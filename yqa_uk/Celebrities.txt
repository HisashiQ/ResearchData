There are a lot of rumors on how she died.  Including murder and drug overdose.  It was concluded that she did from a drug overdose but many people think other wise.  If you google her name there is many site that you can go to that will talk about everything.  There is all the theories and pics.  Its pretty interesting actually
Good Luck

Some fans thought that Marilyn Monroe's suicide was a tragic accident, while others suspected the overdose had been administered by someone else, perhaps by injection. The office of the Los Angeles District Attorney's 1982 review opened a formal Request for Investigation of the possible murder by a person or persons unknown. A report issued was issued that there was no credible evidence supporting the murder theory. It was possible that the actress died accidentally, though suicide is mostly likely theorized.

That's a vast enough subject for a book - and coincidentally many have been written on the subject. The more creditable reasons seem to be favouring accidental overdose while the popular version is that RFK killed her because she was privy to information which could ruin JFK. Of course, there's the less popular mob angle. Check your local library for more info.

<question>



Did anyone else hear Chris Moyles this morning?  Am I the only person that doesn't like him?



My husband insists on setting the alarm clock to Radio 1 so every morning I have to wake up to the grating sound of Chris Moyles voice.  I am an American and moved over here for my husband, and I sometimes am scared to open my mouth afraid that people will judge me because our country is run by the worlds dumbest ape.  For the first time in years I woke up this morning proud to be an American because I voted for Obama.  I often here Chris Moyles make fun of Americans (not that I actually mind a jab here and there from an intelligent comedian) and this morning he actually asked his staff if "McCain is now Vice President?,"  because he didn't understand how this all works.  Then someone said very matter of factly that Joe Lieberman (not Joe Biden) was now the new Vice President.  I wanted to rip my hair out.  I know that there are plenty of smart people in this country, and I also know that there are people that could care less about American politics because they aren't American like me, but how did someone like that end up so successful?  Does he even read a newspaper or watch the news... ever!?  He offends me, I don't think he's funny, and I think he's stupid and mean... which is the worst combination.  My husband seems to think I'm being silly because he thinks he's funny.  I just don't understand how he can make fun of us if he doesn't even understand the simple fundamentals of our country.  It really hurts to know people are listening to him.  I guess what I'm getting at is, despite his popularity, does EVERYONE like this guy or am I not alone in thinking he's kind of a pig?

Hmm...tough one.



I have to travel for about an hour every morning to get to work  - my fiance drives as we work together. We listen to Chris Moyles show most mornings.



I have to say that 90% of the time, I find the show as a whole very entertaining, light hearted stupid conversation that often makes me giggle.



However this morning I almost turned it off - the whole thing of pretending to imitate Obama's speech was so dumb and not even slightly funny. It grated on my nerves SOOO much. He just kept going on..and on!!



He can be offensive and DEFINATELY can push it too far. Sometimes I think I could slap his face if I ever met the guy! but I love the whole "gang" together & I do find them entertaining.



People in England don't care too much about American politics generally - only if they feel it  would effect them...like in the case of the big presidential election.



I hate to say it...but I think a lot of "British" people take the mick out of Americans, for a lot of different reasons - the same way the Americans do with the Brits. Our humour is quite different, and I think you shuld try to take it on a lighter note.

Could someone explain to me what is wrong with chris browns voice?



ok so i've seen chris brown on a couple of things recently - and apart from the fact that i think he comes across like a total and utter pr1ck - what is actually wrong with his voice? i can't understand a word he says - is it cos of his speech impedement or is he just trying to be `gangster' ?? if it's just his speech impediment then my sincerest apologies but i have a feeling it is more like he's trying to be cool - his speech impediment isnt that bad when he's singing.
sorry for all you fans out there but on my sweet sixteen he just came across like a total jerk !!!!

Do singers usually leave right after their concerts?



I went to a Backstreet Boys concert and right away afterwards went out to the tour busses. There were 4 busses there. The band and dancers came out and went into two of the busses. The other two busses stayed vacant the whole time. After about an hour and a half, the two busses with the band and dancers left and the other two were still there. We waited some more, and the security guards were still there and just smirked when we asked if the boys were still in there. After 2 1/2 hours or so, we left cause it was too cold. Do you think they were still in there or long gone by then? Why would the busses and guards still be there? What would have taken them 2 hours??

Sometimes they like to trick the fans into thinking they left, so they can have some privacy. :) The other two tour busses could have been for the entourage that tours with them. Not everyone signs autograhs or comes out for a encore. Every band is different. They were probably just relaxing, or better yet, eating a late dinner. :)

The main band always leave straight away while you are all still shouting and clapping they come off stage and jump in cars and are whisked away before the fans even leave the arena.



The buses and guards are there as a decoy, so you think they are still there while they are getting them further away

Sometimes they do, if they are on tour or such and have to go cross country. But sometimes crew may leave or someone of the sorts. I'm sure that they hang around sometimes to reminisce, or something but other than that, they have no reason to hang around. (:

Satanic Sl*ts?! What are these talentless attention seekers fronted by Georgina Baillie supposed to be?



Having just seen some Satanic Sl*ts performaces I didn't know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock over how dreadful the show.



It was pathetic. How do you get on a stage for doing that? A stripper in Vegas could do better!



My 15 year old sister is a dance student and has been learning for just under 6 months and even she couldn't stop laughing! It's painful to see how unnatural and badly choreographed these lot are!  I am all for girls dancing sexily like the Pussycat Dolls or even Dita Von Teese but this looks like a high school production gone wrong.



Is this all that the Satanic Sl*ts do??



Girls in my local pub dance better and a lot of them a twice the size of Georgina!

They are apparently a dance troupe and in my opinion, a bunch of attention seekers loving the publicity surrounded by the outcry of the messages left for Georgina Baillies grandfather.



Although Andrew Sachs did not deserve that, he also did not deserve to have to read about his granddaughters kiss and tell of Russel Brand.

Too ugly to be models, not talented enough to become professional dancers or singers so they squeeze their flabby bodies into some 666 hot pants and a small bikini top and give us all a fright as they shake their lard on stage. They add a bit of blood too because it apparently looks scary!! Ooh!

Its her job to do that stuff on stage, the same way its single mothers jobs to do lap dancing in seedy London bars and to offer men sexual favours fer booze fer ta baby.  Simple fact is men pay money to watch her troupe dance badly in a provocative satanic style.  Its not her job for her Grandfather to be phoned during a recorded show without his permission and have disgusting messages left on his answer machine.  What happened between him and her was private, if she sold her side of the story to the press well i see no difference between that and him having his picture in the scum press crawling out of some celebrity whores Notting hill flat looking the worse for wear, drugs no doubt and not a lot of sex

it's not just those shows...it's ALL shows (or all fictitious shows at least).  The pilot is the episode they film to get approval from the network whether they're going to be signed or whatever.  Not all pilots even air (sometimes not even the ones of successful shows).  Sometimes they'll re-shoot the first episode, maybe even re-write it because the pilot is the "test".  As to why they call it a pilot, I'm not exactly sure...it's probably a metaphor for a maiden voyage or something.

They make a pilot to see if the show will work, they show it to the executives and based on that one episode called the pilot, the executives decide if they will make a whole season of that one show.

www.enews.com (I think this is what the website is.....just type in e news into a search engine and you should have not a problem at all) sorry, weird phrasing....

Obviously not McCain because he made fun of her in one of his campaign ads, so either Obama or she didnt vote, which I dont think is the case because she is one of the celebs who is always saying vote vote vote, or she wrote someone in which also wouldnt be accurate if she is always saying vote vote vote

Michael Jackson 'Haters'?



Hey there, personally i love him, his dancing, and his music. He has a great personality and just wants to help people. In my opinion, he doesn't hurt or sexually abuse children, he has said he would rather slit his wrists. So all you MJ haters, why do you hate him hmm?
Is it becasue of the 'rumours' that he sexually asaults children, or plastic surgery? Why do you guys hate him, cause i dont think that any answer will because of his music.. :/. I can't understand why people dislike him..
Someone explain..
The best explaination gets 10 points!
Thanks in advance :)

Whacko Jacko is the King of Pop, the best ever... His music has always been my favorite, I don't hate him at all. I just understand that he is totally nuts, and having little boys spend the night with you (willing to admit it or not) is inappropriate. His music was the best, and his personal life was absurd. Kind of comes with the territory when you're a true artist like MJ.

Sad when someone is in so much denial. Do you honestly think he's innocent of being a pedophile? Come on! The evidence point overwhelmingly to his guilt.



That aside... he is a has-been who has rested on his laurels for 20 years.  Better off forgotten.

I don't like his music - I never have.  There is no way he isn't touching little boys - he has paid off families over the years.  Why pay someone off if you did nothing wrong??  If he really would slit his wrists before touching boys - he would be dead long ago

Do you know any famous people with muscular dystrophy?



i need only famous people



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The only one I can think of is Mattie Stepanek.



This is a link about him:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattie_Step...



Oh and also try Wilma Mankiller or William Rinaldi.



The muscular dystrophy syndromes are usually associated with severe and life limiting symptoms so I wouldn't expect many people to be famous with muscular dystrophy. Maybe those with mild forms of it as those with the more severe versions struggle with normal day to day life let alone fame and all that is associated with that as it is a terrible debilitating disease!



All the sufferers that I have met are really brave and strong and cope so well with what must be a painful and debilitating condition.



Hope this helps!

<question>



Is more investigation being done in Jennifer Hudson's families deaths, than in similar non-celeb deaths?



Sure seems like it's getting major air time/news reports.



I'm sorry about her family, but I'm guessing every day similar tragedies are occurring around the country, and other families sure aren't getting the same amount of attention.



Do you think because of her high celebrity status, this case is getting more investigation, and if so, doesn't that bother you?

or... maybe the investigation is getting more coverage, making you THINK that they are working harder, just because you can see it? it's probably not a more thorough investigation, it's just that more of the details are being reported to the public than in a non-celebrity case, because non-celebrity case details don't get ratings.

Yes I do think the cops are putting more emphasis on her investigation than normal murder case investigations.



Yeah it bothers me,  but hey shes famous, it makes sense.

yeah it bothers me,



because she is a celebrity the police know that everyone will hear about it and know about it so they want to make themselves look good by doing a lot of investigation,



whereas if it were a normal person they wouldnt be as fussed about the media attention it got.

I love that guy to pieces. I don't just love him because he's hot, but because he is sweet, funny, talented, beautiful inside and out, cute, and spiritual. I also love how he is also an artist and author. And I love how he is a sexy vegan, and he cares about our environment. He is my inspiration. I look up to him very much. I hope to be as amazing as him one day.



P.S.
Google him if you don't know who he is. He's hella *** cute. Also, go to his website "Brandon Boyd. Play. Pause" He is an absolute amazing painter. You won't regret it.

Okay, who the heck is Bobby Dupea or Robert Pattinson?



I ran across his (?) music and really love his voice. I don't think I've ever saw him before, and he's cute and all, but I prefer his voice more than anything. My daughter got on MySpace and searched and found a ton of info on him, it appears he's an actor or something. She said I needed to write an article about him, so she emailed his MySpace. Although apparently, it probably isn't his MySpace at all. I am just confused about who he is, what's his name so I can attempt to find a CD. I have read the Twilight books, and have heard that the movie is due out this month, and Robert Pattinson is supposed to be in it, is this the same guy singing? Help, I'm confused!

Bobby Dupea is Robert Pattinson stage name.
He got that name from a Jack Nickelson movie.



He does not have a cd out.



He used to have a myspace page, but deleted once all the twilight fans started adding him. It got out of hand.
Robert does sing a song on the new Twilight Soundtrack.



hope this answers your questions.

Does anyone have a photo of Taylor Swifts NATURAL hair?



All the photos i've seen have her with curly hair, but is really obvious that it's been done with curling irons [I know wht natural curls look like cause I have curly hair!].



So does anyone have a photo of her hair as it naturally is? I've searched google and i've found nothing so far :[



Thanks a bunch!

Who do you think most celebrities voted for?



I am 18 democrat liberal so I voted Obama myself. I think most celebrities did as all [both black&white]. I'm not saying most did I'm just guessing because I have a gut feeling they did. What do you think? No celebrities did not have any impact on the way I voted.

Woah Woah Woah! The last time I checked Disney was a multi-billion franchise that could turn the smelly old bum you see on a street corner into a rockstar overnight!



I personally like Miley Cyrus, I think she's a cool person, but even to those who hate her, it's no suprise she's famous.



For regular stars, it's 50% talent and 50% publicity. For Disney stars, no matter how talented you are (see Demi Lovato) it's only 1% talent and 99% publicity (Disney) to make it in this world.

Does anyone else think this is creepier than Miley's scandalous Vanity Fair spread?



where she was not only half naked but sprawled across her dad.



Her dad picks out a much older boyfriend for her who is a legal adult while she is not. Add to that, he's an underwear model. But yet he's somehow also a Christian. First off, how many Christian underwear models are there? Quite a few Christians tend to classify that along with outright pornography. Not to mention, most states don't allow romantic relationships between an adult and a minor even if there is no sex involved. Why does Billy Ray think this is a good idea? Obviously he is very effed up in the parenting dept.

this is exactly why is dont blame miley for what she has done! its the parents that are to blame. they are just using her for fame and money. now shes famous, theyre giving her anything and anyone who tickles her fancy, so she doesnt move out soon or stop supplying them with money and career opportunities. i mean, in their home, there is a seperate part of the house made for miley! they are turning her into a spoiled brat! and she gets hated on for this, not them. some people think: "poor parents having to deal with he for a daughter". i say: "poor miley!"

Single star has to be Elvis, his charisma, his unusual good looks and the fact that he could sing any style of song [ie rock, gospel, country etc.,]
Group has to be the Beatles, they played their own instruments, wrote their own songs and music, had a distinctive style.
Both of the above are still played on thousands of radio stations of every minute of every day around the world.
And that is a proven fact so they must be the best!

Michael Jackson is a kiddy fiddler, you can't pick him. I don't really like pop music but Madonna has to be way up there.

Elvis - Not really pop.

Beatles - don't count, they're a group.

If we're having Elvis and the Beatles then I want Led Zeppelin and Johnny Cash. Doesn't really work, does it?

Personally I don't care who Mr. Gibson hates, everyone has a right to their opinion.  Whether I agree with him or not.  This is America and he has rights.  Hopefully what he has been up to these days is every race and religion and person has their good and bad points.

The Beatles, they wrote their own songs, and had great albums, later years of course, they all had great solo years, and created the Traveling Wilbury's.



Everything about the Beatles ( except Yoko ) is awesome. I think the Beatles inspired more talent then Elvis did. Don't forget about Eric Clapton and Billy Preston.

But you know what they probably have OVER the majority of handsome men out there?



PERSONALITY, DEDICATION AND RESPECT FOR THE WOMAN THEY MARRIED.

These women saw it; props to them.

Probably to ensure that their husband never leaves them for someone else. These not so hot guys are so unbelievably lucky to be married to such beautiful women that they would not risk cheating on them and losing such an attractive wife

I notice this in non celebrities, too.  They always pick ugly guys.  I don't have the problem.  Not married.  If I were, it would be to a HOT guy.  Maybe they like guys who are brainiacs, who knows?

They find them attractive and that's all that matters. They obviously went for personality and not just looks. If I had to choose a hot looking guy with a bad personality or an unattractive guy with a heart of gold, I'll take the heart of gold. The hot guy's looks will eventually fade and all he'll have left is a bad personality.

Because they find them attractive, even if a lot of people don't. Beauty isn't a fact. There could be one man who the world thinks is hideous, but to one woman he's the most gorgeous thing ever. And if she thinks he's gorgeous, isn't that all what counts? After all, she is the one who's with him. 
Beauty is something in our eyes, a personal idea. And it's different (sometimes very different) for everyone.

Because scientifically,.. good looking Ladies are more attracted to uglier Guy's because of there pheromones that they give off.

I've seen a show about this a while ago,and it's quite astounding to watch!

They may also like this person for there personality and not just the way they look,..have you thought of that?

1. deffinitely
2. of course

there are numbers (which, unfortunately, I can't remember) that say a large percentage of people (mostly teens) who have had sex say they regret it and the first time was awful because they didn't actually love the person. and another large percentage deny ever doing it. another percentage says they wish they wish they had waited until they were married.

Amy Winehouse.

Simply because I had a very bad impression of her because she is very well known for getting involved in drugs and her partner is in jail.

The other day I heard her album and she has the most amazing voice. She's so good at singing and I just wasn't expecting that.

Brilliant.
I just hope that she gets better soon.

Paul says he is going to get one of those. I said I'd want one too. He said that I always copy his ideas and that if I copied this one he'd tell me what the word 'felching' means. Part of me wants to know, but part of me knows that it wouldn't be a nice thing and I wouldn't want to hear it. Paul knows best, see. I don't know what I'd do without Paul.

Everyone thought Courtney Love was doomed, but she made it out alive.
Courtney got too many chances. It got to the point where it was either rehab or jail. She chose rehab, and she's been clean since.

That needs to happen to Amy.
Stop giving her chances, give her an ultimatum, jail or rehab.
And it's not rehab for so many days. It's until you are clean and are in a good state of mind.

She sure has enough money to get the best treatment and therapy, whether she'll use it or not is another matter.
I sure hope she'll be around and making new music for a long time, as I think she has a very rare talent.
Noel Gallagher is always putting other musicians down, maybe due to an insecurity born out of the fact that he keeps writing the same song over and over again (and John Lennon actually wrote it first).

Yes. She doesn't seem to want to change. It was like the sprial of Britney Spears. The paps were just crazy for her and didn't even help....so sad.  But thankfully, her family came and saved her before it got even worse! Hopefully, Amy will have a good friend in someone.

plus she hasnt got any real talent, she just looks good. i mean i dont blame her for that, i blame the shallow music industry.  But it still irritates me that she got selected for GA.

Mind you, apart from Nadine Coyle, i think they are all pretty talentless in GA anyway, so she fits right in!

I honeslty thnk she is the prettiest girl I have ever, ever seen.

However, her job is to be an actress/singer/dancer, not a girl who shows every body part to the world. I believe if an actress has a passion for acting, she should act, not show her naked body to the world. She should have chosen the playmate profession if she wanted to do that. Many celebrities do this these days, and I think it's wrong, but their choice.

heres my answer to a prev. question of why:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

okay im a fan but its hard to try to explain why you are a fan. so let me try:
her music is meaningful and heartfelt
she has to take on a lot of responsibility
since her pics she has grown and matured up even more
very religious and dedicated to her religion
extremely funny and is always being herself
i know im a girl but she is pretty. 
she can hit high and low notes and 
has a lot of variety towards her music and songs are unexpectedly good
and i think shes going to be around for a while (at least i hope so :D)

People who like Miley Cyrus usually don't have functional rationalizing abilities. Due to this they believe she isn't rude, slutty, or arrogant. Many of them also believe she doesn't lip sync.

They are childish. Why should we keep our opinions to ourselves, when they spam and nobody else can get a question in edgewise? We have just as much right to express our hate as much as they do their love. If it wasn't for this site I would've forgot JB exsisted, and when I log off I don't give them a second thought.

dude I totally agree! I really think that most ( i didnt say all) of the Jonas Brothers fans need to just calm down a bit and not bash on people just because we don't like what they like. They can go about there Jonas Brothers lovely dovey business, and they can say I am jealous all they want, but the truth is, I can't stand the Jonas Brothers not because I envy them, but because they get on my nerves and they are just another average band.

Well, if you don't like them then that's fine with me. Not all fans are that immature to call someone jealous just because they have a different opinion and different taste in music. But if you don't like them, that's fine. The only thing I don't like is when people make questions like 'WHO HATES THE JONAS BROTHERS?! STAR IF YOU DO!' because that's just not right. If you hate them, fine, that's your opinion but at least keep it to yourself because there are people (like me) who actually do like them.

Thats a great question.

And you should ask the person(s) who said you were jealous what exactly you are jealous of.

Ok I love the Jonas Brothers. Yeah it annoys me too when some fans go to extensive lengths to tell of haters. Even though I'm an obsessive fan I realize people can not like them because everyone has their opinions. I just get mad when haters don't even give them a chance. It's really annoying. However not everyone is like that and I do agree that fans need to realize that.

You have to consider the age group of the typical Jonas fan.  Not yet mature enough to have confidence in their own opinions.  Therefore any opinions that disagree with them are attacked rather than accepted gracefully.

And if you don't agree with my opinion, you must be jealous (LOL).

Madonna is the best selling female artist world wide and recordings spanning several decades, but ABBA also have spanned the decades, enjoyed a come-back in the 90's, and now are big again with the new Movie hit!

I think over-all Madonna maybe has the most record sales, but ABBA is probably ahead on the play time, performance rights, etc?

Interesting one though!

Yarp, she knows its exactly what the contestants are going through
and i thought on the first show she wasn't gonna be very talkative and a bit shy and nervous
but she was really good !

EDIT: I hated Sharon, she seemed really fake and was obviously gutted when Danii came on the show cos she wasn't the centre of attention anymore.

No. Simon manages her so it's probably the only reason she's doing it. I don't want to see another orange wag on our TV screens.

I don't see how being pretty makes you a good talent judge, but she just looks like a chav to me anyway.

No it is not.
Usually if a couple is dating there is a rumour which goes on to identify it, but this doesn't even exist.

Recently she was dating Nick Jonas, which was confirmed by her, and now there are rumours that she is dating Step Up 2 actor Adam Sevani.

Well, it went a bit like this...  Rachel fell down over a childs toy just outside mad Micks Smoothie factory..  She was hurt by this, 3 bruises in fact..  It was at this point that Tony sneaked up behind her and dry humped her til a little baby badger raised the alarm.  Thanks to that Badger young Rach escaped the mence of Tony's fishfinger!

There was a Bbq later that evening, all gathered celebrating Tony's shrimp on the coals

Lol BEEN related?  Don't you like always stay a relative lol:)  Sorry.  Hem hem.

I'm not sure I should tell all...I mean, I've answered a question similar to this one a few days ago...Some believed me, some didn't, but I firmly repeat that it's true that I'm good friends with Elijah Wood.  I mean, if you don't believe me, YOU asked, but I'm just saying.



No one believes me when I tell them, but him, me, and former actress Anna Chlumsky (My Girl, My Girl 2, Gold Digger), are all good buds.  (Check out Anna on www.imdb.com).



And please, no haters.  (On ME, I mean).  This woman asked this question, and I answered honestly.  DON'T think it's all a bunch of lies or anything and don't send me cruel emails with loads of swearing or anything.  That happened to me once:(

Sorry, you asked what it's like...Well, when you really know them, like, as a person and a friend...it's not SPECIAL.  It's just special in a friendly way.  Not 'cause they're a celebrity.  They are people, they just happen to appear in front of loads of OTHER people, without people seeing them in real life.  I mean, celebrities eat, talk, laugh, cry, poo and pee, walk, have gone to school, etc...So there, yah.  But it IS pretty cool to talk to them about their films lol, but it dies down after a while.

P.S. We're NOT going out!  Just good friends.

Uh, me?  Yeah, sounds fishy, but I know I'm telling the truth, that's what matters.  You people are free to believe or disbelieve.  Thank you!

My vote is for John Cusack. Great actor. Nice man, and all round good guy.

Yes, Serendipity was a great movie, and High Fidelity. Also Identity. And the more recent 1408.

When I was younger I enjoyed all of John's movies, however, I've sort of steered away from him in recent years (but I must admit he was really engaging in Serendepity).  On a whole for me, I would have to lean more towards Keanu at this time.

I assume you mean 'cherry' in the same way its meant in the song 'She's my cherry pie.'

To answer your question, no. She's being suggestive, not explicit.

What do you think of Aussie comedian Dave Hughes voice?



I'm asking because people say I sound like him and I personally don't like his voice. But I like hearing my own  voice when I speak because it sounds reasonably deep. But when I hear it on a tape recorder it sounds kind of high pitched and "poofy" and I think that is how I really sound to other people.

Favorite actor:  Kurt Russell - he's adorable and down-to-earth and not affected by his fame.  He also has demonstrated the range of acting he is capable of from comedy (movie "Overboard") to action (movie "Escape from LA") to drama (movie "Silkwood") to science fiction (movie, remake of "The Thing" and also "Stargate").

I guess my favorite actress now is Julia Roberts - like Kurt, she has a wide range of acting ability from "Pretty Woman" to "Sleeping with the Enemy" to "Erin Brockovich".  Before her untimely death, Natalie Wood was my favorite actress -- so naturally beautiful and just as talented.

She is very unique, and has taken her years hard. But give her this; she hasn't resorted to plastic surgery or extreme measures. I think that all she's done is color her hair. She dresses, or is dressed, like a dream, no?



I feel kind of sorry for her -- she's a great actress, mother. wonderful philanthropist, and has a great personality. And her baby-faced husband was caught cheating with a 25 year-old.

I don't think she is attractive either, but then again I am amazed so many people think Angelina Jolie is so gorgeous.  She has pretty hair and that is about all I can give that one.  I just see bony elbows/ legs and bags under her eyes and too big lips.  I have all of those things so maybe that's why I don't think she's all that great.  Parker has the better body for certain.  So, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

I've met Nigel Harman a couple of times, he's a really nice guy if a bit shy. There are a few Nigel Harman forums around where they do outings to go to his plays and stuff, I don't think he's upto much at the mo but he is due out in a couple of series in autumn. I'd really like to meet Justin Timberlake though..... *thud*

I love and adore Angelina Jolie lot's. And I would certainly route for her all the way. I don't believe she would win though, unless she starts eating properly, puuting on some wait and possibly getting into the kind of shape she was in when she did the Lara Croft movies. She's too skinny and frail at the moment. I love her though !!!

i think Jessica Alba would....angelina would probably hold up the peace sign and say "there is already too much fighting in the world" and before she even finished that Alba would have already knocked her down.  Jessica is kickaass and angelina is too busy saving orphans and stealing husbands to care to fight.

Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe Painting Prints on Canvas at Blockbuster?



My friend has this stunning painting/print of Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly, and she said it was from Blockbuster and there was a Marilyn Monroe one she wanted there as well. This was about 2-4 months ago, has anyone seen them there? I don't want to make a trip to find out they are gone! Thanks so much! By the way, these canvas prints are quite large! About 30$ each.

♫Wise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes



The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so
strange this feeling
[ Find more Lyrics at www.mp3lyrics.org/Qc7 ]
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes



Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure `cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes



And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our Empty Sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile♪

She's a teenage pop star.
It's one way of spending her enormous fortune.
She also doesn't have the time to get a real one.
She's busy with other more important things.



The Oompa Loompa comment is very mean.
I'm not a fan nor a critique, but I know my boundaries.
The girl just wants to get a tan.



People can't mind their own businesses because they live boring lives, so they take the boredom out in celebrities. People do everything just to reveal their personal lives, so they have something to gossip about, and so that they have someone to look at and humiliate more, so they feel less pathetic.

I've been told Winnie Cooper from the Wonder Years (when I was a kid), that girl from Free Willy 2 (early teens), Katie Holmes (early Dawson's Creek years/highschool), the chick from the Matrix movies (when I got really pale), and Maggie Gyllenhaal (ew, only told that by one person).  None of those girls look alike, besides having dark hair and big eyes, so I don't know.

i rather suggest you start stalking your own celebrity shadow! because if you continue to stalk other people, you might get caught and that is not a nice thing to do. Remember the " GOLDEN RULE " dude!

Do you believe that David Archuleta is in the closet?



I absolutely love this guy. He is sooo sweet. He really is into tons of music and knows more artists then most people out there. He seems very cool....but sometimes I feel that he is really gay. What do you think. He has used the terms "fantastic" and "wonderful" sooo many times.

How do I contact a bollywood celebrity for a good social cause?



Our group is organizing a charity event for kids at our orphanage. I wanted to contact a bollywood celebrity for the event since I saw the kids are particularly interested in their fav actors/actresses. I've contacted a few people who I thought might help. But I would still like to know what's the best way I can contact a bollywood celebrity.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Hi. Firstly you should look up if they have a web page. If you fine this then check if there is a contact section with details about submitting a request to this celeb. You can also check to see who their management company would be. Try searching in yahoo for bolywood management companies. Often the celeb will have an agent and PA, this information can be found out by searching. Sorry I can't be more specific. If you had their name I could have given you more information about how to contact them. Usually for charity events the celeb would waive their fee for b personal appearance. Hope this helps. Good luck.

Sometimes people make a fake account and say "Oh, this is Selena Gomez's msn! Message her if you want!" when its actually THEIRS.



Then they SPAM you.



Selena's msn wouldnt have her whole name in there AND her birthdate. And if that WAS one of hers, she wouldve made a brand new more private one.



Most celebrities msn's have a whole bunch of numbers in them, and by that I do not mean their birthyear.

<question>



Jena Malone's eye color?



I remember when Bastard out of Carolina aired, Jena Malone's eyes were very brown. When the movie Contact came out where she plays Ellie Arroway, I remember a tv special that said that her Brown eyes were changed by computer to match Jodie Foster's , who obviously has blue eyes. I even found reference to that in the Wikipedia entry for the movie. Every movie she has been in since and even some pictures of her on red carpets and such, her eyes are blue. Out of sheer curiosity, I wonder is she always wearing contacts?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



If her eye colour changes a lot then it's probably contacts.
Her natural eye colour is brown, according to the site below...

MCR is the only band I know that brings message in their songs especially lives and I think that they are nice people. Would it be great if many bands were like them ? I think people should listen to songs that contains moral values like MCR songs than love songs. What do you think?

Thats crazy! She is not too thin, gaahh. This bothers me that people would say such things. She is petite not anorexic or even close to it!



Don't let others tell you what's too thin or not, [unless its a disorder or something -- but thats different.] If you have the same or nearly the same figuire then be proud of it because alot of girls would love to have the same. [Even if they dont admit it.]

To look at I don't think so. But it dosen't mean she could not be suffering from an eating disorder. As long as she is naturally thin, and so are you, neither of you have anything to be worried about.



You must have a really good figure. People are probably just jealous.

I just had a look on the net and there is no mention at all of whether he ir gay or straight. Which leads me to the sad conclusion he is gay and has not been able to come out because of smallville.

I think it was fantastic. Although what made me that little bit more interested and captivated was because the sad fact was that he was no longer alive. It made his character immortalized.

This looks photoshopped too.

I think this is an original.



I hate them together.Plus Nick has true love for Miley and you can see that by the song he wrote for her.Goodbye.Even though he is with this selena for now.Deep in his heart Miley will always be with him.Miley is also trying to make him jealous by going out with a 20 yeras old guy.



I hope one day they will finally realize that they were meant for each other.

Wow thats amazing. We all know pics are airbrushed but its interesting to see the before and after pics. I was particularly suprised at nicollette sheridan (unsure of the spelling lol). She looked really bad. Also Britney Murphy. Your right about kelly clarkson altering her weight is a bit off, particularly as most of her fans are young girls. Have a star :)

Yes, I think it's ridiculous. People are beautiful as they are, I don't understand why people would try to omit natural things about a human body. It shows they're human. I saw a picture of Shiloh on a hot day once, and she was all sweaty but looked happy, like a normal, happy, healthy baby with rosy cheeks, then i saw the same picture on the cover of OK airbrushed, and looking like a porcelain doll. I couldn't stand it.

It is going to far, they're setting impossible standard for regular people; and this time these standards aren't completely real. Celeberties are becoming more and more obsessed with vanity even though they look okay without airbrushing.

Don't you think you could find most of this by just asking Google?



I type in all types of things and google finds a web site for me to look at. Not sometimes, I am looking for other opinions or things not suitable for google but this sort of thing, if you type in the name of each Beatle then I bet something good will pop up and you can find your answers. Go ahead, Type in Google.com
and then type in each Beagle's  name.

Death dates?  Only two are gone, you know.



John Lennon -- October 9, 1940--December 8, 1980
Ringo Starr -- July 7, 1940
Paul McCartney -- June 18, 1942
George Harrison -- February, 1943 -- ?



All were vocalists, Lennon and McCartney were usually the leads.
Lennon played the rhythm guitar.  McCartney played bass and keyboards.  Ringo was the drummer, and George Harrison was lead guitarist.

Eric Schweig
The Characters Talent Agency
8 Elm Street
Toronto, ON M5G-1G7
Canada



"How to send your fan mail and autograph requests to Eric Schweig?:



If you want to request an autograph, follow the guidelines bellow. If you just want to mail a letter with the address above, and do not want anything back, then you can stop reading! If you live in Canada send a properly stamped and self addressed envelope (minimum size 8.5" x 4") with your request letter and a photo. You can include a piece of cardboard to keep the photo from bending in shipping and also add "Do Not Bend" on the envelopes. Send your letter and wait. On average, there is going to be a 3+ month wait for a response. If you do not live in Canada, add several* International Reply Coupons. The International Reply Coupons (IRC) will be used by the receiver to purchase canadian stamps. You can only get them at your post office. Place the IRCs into the envelope, not on it. For more information on reply coupons click here. *For information on postage prices to receive a letter from Canada click here"

Russell Brand & Jonathan Ross-Would You Support My E-Petition To The Prime Minister To Get Them Sacked?



I have just submitted an e-Petition to No.10 Downing Street to ask that a petition be created for the immediate sacking of both these two men by the BBC,and for the Police to prosecute them for their on-air offensive remarks aimed at an elderly member of society and his relatives.Why should these two talentless individuals work for the BBC,be paid vast sums of money,and be allowed to get away with outright rudeness,vulgarity with their despicable,disgusting treatment of the victims for whom these two morons prey on for Radio 2 'fun'? As neither moron has any talent whatsoever,why do the BBC drag out the inevitable and sack these two obnoxious and disgraceful people from its payroll today?



What do you think? Do we have to put up with it? Why should we put up with?



Thank you.



</question>



<additional details>



If someless left a rude,vulgar, unsolicited message on your Mum or Dads,or Grandma or Grandpas answerphone,and you knew who it was that left it,would you still find it funny? I doubt it!



Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross are NOT funny!They love the sound of their own voices,can only get a cheap laugh by being vulgar every other word,have not real talent other than that,and people find them funny?It just goes to show me how dumbed-down society has become if you think they're funny! They don't know the meaning of the word 'funny' thats for sure.There again,talentless twats never do do they?



The BBC is incompetent enough without employing morons like Brand & Russell on vast salaries! The BBC is weak-willed,cannot deal with a crisis of its own making,blusters and buries its head in the sand because its clueless when it comes to sacking hapless, hopeless and incompetent employees!I support my decision to have an e-peition to the PM to get him to do what the BBC wont - sack these two morons!



Jonathan Ross is FUNNY! How does anyone arrive at that decision? I've listened to his Radio 2 programme and its ghastly much like his BBC TV shows!Please define 'funny'? Its so laudible to read here people think this oik is funny!



Re My E-Petition. I don't know when it will be listed as it has to be considered by the people over-seeing it.I am hopeful to have it published online soon,and will certainly make sure a link to it is published here in Yahoo! Answers.I hope it'll do well and that these two will be sacked by decree!

They are paid to be comedians. Russell Brand is rude by nature which makes him entertaining. He has resigned, so you have no power on him anymore, and Ross is suspended. They have both apologised, Sachs has accepted their apology and is not complaining to the police. Georgina is after 15 mins of fame and this is a perfect loophole for her. I think it's the people who decided it was fit for broadcast should be sacked, not the two who are paid to make jokes generally at other peoples expense.



edit: half of the people who say they should be sacked didn't even hear the thing anyway which is stupid. the BBC will think of ratings at the end of the day, and Jonathan Ross rakes them in.

Russell Brand has already done the honourable thing, unlike Jonathan Ross.  No, I don't want to sign a petition.  I shall not ever be watching Jonathan Ross ever again and if everyone did likewise, then it would not need a petition.  I have always found him childish and offensive.  He is too big for his boots and should be sacked.

i agree, but as the answer above said, Brand has resigned and Ross has been suspended. i think they should sack Ross, but they wont cause he is high profile and as they say any publicity is good publicity so i guess the ratings for any future shows he does will go up to see if he does anything else slightly risque.
what i would like to see is the pair of them to talk to families of children and adults who have commited suicide because they were bullied and people who survived the bullies...as essentially that was what they were doing and maybe then they will see what the outcry was all about!

No leave Jonathan Ross he is talent and great wit. Ever seen him with Will smith the pair are so entertaining! Brand however, is chavvy humor not witty just dirty so let him go. what pisses me off is ppl going oh sack jonathan ross and bring back Parky!.....
...Parky is not the same type of show as Ross, Its serious and stars babble about their life stories. Jonathan's is not serious its light hearted mostly humor esp when he interviews funny people. Way more entertaining. Thats why BBC dont wanna get rid of him.

Although "Sachsgate" was in poor taste, the BBC should not be beaten into submission by a gutter press feeding  frenzy. News of Brand and Baillie's 'relationship' was already in the public domain before this episode and her position as a Satanic **** hardly makes her the best person to describe Brand and Ross as beyond contempt. Its so unfortunate that people who enjoyed Brand's show won't be able to in future. The BBC is for everyone, not just middle England Daily Mail readers.

Everyone has a choice to either listen or not listen, you can turn your radio to another channel. If you don't like them, don't listen!!!!  A lot of people do listen and find them extremely funny, we're not all the same.  Seems to me that some people are only happy when they're complaining about something & assume that everyone should have the same opinion as them!! You're wrong & what you're doing makes you as bad as them in my opinion. They've apologised & have been severely told off - no doubt they have learnt their lessons - now leave them alone and put your time & energy into something more constructive.

It was clearly a joke, has anyone seen fonejacker. This must be overreaction of the century, There's no way Ross will be sacked, he is one of the BBC's prize assets. People really need to lighten up a bit. 30000 complaints = 30000 people with nothing better to do with their time.

This is great. I was reading the questions and expecting the Jo Bro fans on "attack" and bashing you - but surprisingly, none.



They're here because we will forever go through Bubble Pop phases, but luckily they are just phases. Like someone else mentioned different generation had different groups and bands. But I remember when music was good, when it had a meaning and now it's just what sells. What's the "hit of the minute".



The plus side of the Jo Bros is they will pass.



Bubble pop is like a kidney stone. It hurts at times. It causing pain and discomfort but eventually it passes and your forget about it.

I don't get it either dude, but since the Y2K bull, everything seems to have become all about money. And that's all the Jonas Brothers are - A marketing scam created by Disney to snatch the money right out of parents' pockets! The Jonas Brothers "good looks" (I really don't see what's so attractive about them, and I'm a 15-year-old girl) seem to attract millions of brainwashed tweenies. It's all an image, it isn't about the music.



It's just a scam (like I said above) created by some people to make money. I don't get it. It's not even about the music anymore, it's just about the image.

Hm. My one explanation is this -



First, let me start off with my generation (as you mentioned) we had NSYNC/Britney/BSB/Spice Girls, The 80's had Duran Duran, Madonna, etc. Generations before that, we had The Beatles, Beach Boys, Elvis. Before, that Frank Sinatra took the hearts of little teenie boppers.



The Jonas Brothers are just simply this generation's thing. Honestly, as long as we have little girls and music - we're ALWAYS gonna have this. It will never change.

It's the same reason high school musical is popular..



the songs are quite (scarily) catchy,
the singers are very good looking
and so it gives pre-teens



and teenagers something to obsess about
if they were really ugly, they would NOT be this popular.
i guarantee you that.
that's society for you.



it will probably last until they do something really disgraceful

massive marketing and peer pressure.



Young kids feed off the energy of the performers and also how flashy and energetic the show is.



Do you think kids would be interested in the Jonas Bros if every time they performed there was no audience to cheer? Not likely. They're just the flavor of the moment. Something new and different.



Also, would any Disney product be as successful if they were all ugly as sin? No way. It's all about image, not talent. The target audience is only interested in images and don't have a clue about what talent is.



And believe Disney is all about the money. Hand it over you mindless drones.



BTW, what happened to Hillary Duff? The same thing that will happen to the Jonas Bros. and Hannah Montana. They grow up, eventually, and lose their appeal.



Thanks Disney for corrupting children and their parents by making them into consumer whores. I also believe Disney is one of the major causes of Attention Deficit Disorder in children.



Here's a challenge for the Disney Channel: Show a program that doesn't contain breaks for music videos completely unrelated to the program. Also, how about going to a commercial instead of incessantly flashing them at the bottom of the screen DURING the show??



Disney is evil.

I can honestly say that anything Kerry Katona has done would make me highly distrustful of it.  She is hardly a good ambassador for anything, except pumpkins, which she endorses by having one as a head.

I have to confess, the last time I saw her was on This Morning when she was slurring her words - I thought she looked a little rough to say the least?  I have had three children and hope I do not resemble Kerry - no disrespect, but that was the last time I saw her and I can confirm - if that is the result of surgery - STAY AWAY!

I think that after 4 kids, if my body needed some work & I was unhappy with it, I would consider surgery if I could afford it.
If Kerry Katona feels the need for surgery then, why not! Her self-esteem could do with a boost.



Does anyone else find it strange that every answer here has received at least 6 thumbs down? I was asked for my opinion, which I gave, so there were no need for any.

Why do Jonas Brothers fans get over the fact that people just don't like them?



Alright now.
on here people that dislike them say Jonas Brothers suck or something and the fans get really angry and just directly dis the haters really badly (i'm not saying they all do, but some of them do).



i hate the Jonas Brothers with a passion, i prefer Take That really, but JB fans get pissed off.



i'm a big fan of Take That, but i don't care what people say about good or bad.
some JB fans don't except that we all have opinion on different stuff.



So why don't the JB fans face the fact there are Haters of Jonas Brothers.



just why??

it's not just Jonas Brothers fans that get like that
most artists have fans that are just stupidly irrational about their support for them
i think it's just because JB fans tend to make their support more public, giving other people a chance to deny their worth
still, it is kinda insulting if someone says the things you like are worth hating

Lol I agree that his acting is sub-par.  Many people don't think so due to the current hype over Harry Potter, and often when something is hyped like that, everybody involved is idolized.  That definitely happened with Daniel Radcliffe.

<question>



Jonathan Ross and justice?



I wonder if a lesser star than Ross would have got away with mere suspension. I greatly doubt it, which suggests to me that the punishment doesn't fit the crime but merely the Beeb's sense that Ross can still pull in the viewers. What do you think ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You are probably right...but then there is little justice in today's society.  Just look at the 200 + murders committed by those on parole. Just look at the financial injustice championed by New Labour. But the Beeb is wrong. Everyone is easily replaced and I can only hope that the BBC will wake up and realise that people like Ross are held in contempt by the majority.....the exception being the chlamydia generation of hedonistic celeb worshipers

<question>



Georgina Baillie turns out to be a cheap wannabe porn star after all. Do you feel sorry for her grandfather?



He's not a big British actor but Andrew Sachs was respected but now that more dirty laundry is coming out about his grandaughter does anyone else feel sorry for him? To see his daughter in amateur porn videos wearing strap ons and knowing she dances for the satanic sluts must be so disappointing.



I'm now not suprised that Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand saw her as so cheap that they made jokes about her its just a shame her poor Grandad has suffered in all this.



How do you think he must be feeling?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I do feel very sorry for him. I love Russell Brand, and I think the media frenzy surrounding this incident is disgusting when there are far worse things in the world, but he was out of order with this, whatever he had or hadn't done with his granddaughter. OK, so Andrew Sachs was a boundry-pusher in his time, but he's an old man now, and whatever else she is, she's still his granddaughter. I actually feel more sorry for him now he's been so defensive of her and she's just made an absolute laughing stock out of him, I think what she's done to him is much worse than what Russell did because now he knows Russell was actually telling the truth, apparently x

Ross was the leader in this - it was he that set the tone.  They rang up a 78 years old man late at night left an abusive message on his answering machine.



Ross has been suspended for 3 months - he should be sacked completely. I have never saw the point of this man.

Jennifer Hudson's Family Murder: Does This Seem Odd?



I hate to ask this, but I prefer NOT to keep it on my mind, I was watching the Nancy Grace Show and a caller called the show and asked Nancy Grace some interesting questions about the case.  The sister claimed to be at work (drives school buses) but there wasn't any school on Friday in Chicago. Also, does it seem odd that she was just changing and updating her myspace profile from the time of the murders to the discovery of her son's body? Honestly, I can tell Jennifer Hudson is mourning, but I'm not sure about her sister. If my mother and brother was murdered, and then my son....I know I would be so weak and tore down emotionally, I wouldn't have the strength to log on some F***in myspace and update my profile. Also, tell me is this odd. William Balfour is the sister husband (or ex). If this man is being investigated in the murder of your mother, brother and ONLY son, why is he still on your top friends list on myspace???? If she had the time to update her profile, why didnt she take the murder suspect of her family down as well?



Even while she updated her profile she added this quote.."NOW BECAUSE I CHOSE TO DO WHAT WAS NATURAL TO ME AND LOVE SOMEONE , IT COST ME MY BEAUTIFUL FAMILY". If that's really the case, why is he on her top friends?



I pray for the loss of the Hudson family, but she doesn't seem to be mourning to me.

That is interesting and you have an excellent point. why in the h e l l are you bloging when you 7yr old was just found shot in the back of an SUV. Maybe she's a crack head, you know they said she sold it for a while or still does it. There is more to the murder than what meets the eye and investigators need to look into it. I think she is twisted to be on a dumb a** cpu typing up some BS, my eyes would be so teary i wouldn't be able to see in order to type anything if i just lost my WHOLE family.

basically this question is asked right throughout the world ...sorry i no this isn't a yes or no answer i am just telling you how it is.... so some people are theist meaning believing ,others are atheist meaning not to believe ....Others are Agnostic this means the don't no as there isn't enough evidence to prove either side or the argument

In every person, there is an 'Almighty'- 'There are no Atheists in foxholes and in Powerball lines!'  We all prayed in school..'God, I hope we dont have a test today''God, please dont let those guys pick on me ' 'God, please tell her to go to the dance with me!'.."God" goes by many  names in all of the religions and for centuries, there has been wars and slaughtering over which name is 'right' for the same body. Your parents call you "Daughter", your Aunts & Uncles call you "Niece", your friends call you "Friend", your husband will call you "Wife", your children "Mom", your Nieces & Nephews-"Aunt", your grandchildren-"Grandma"and your mean boss-peon (doesnt believe youre really a person) and each person has a different history with you. It would be stupid for your children to call you Daughter and your parents to call you Wife-but this is what religious wars and religious hypocrites ( convert to our peace-loving god or we will torture and kill you and take all your property for ourselves) are all about-a name! Do I believe? I believe in a 'higher-power' that controls fate and destinies but I dont know their true name! I hope this helps.

Its a tough question that one. I think that what Society now deems as acceptable is a very blurry line. As far as i am concerned the programme fonerjacker does exactly the same thing as what Ross and Brand did. Its just that foneJacker uses non famous people. I think it comes down to morality really. They should not have done it and i was an invasion of someones privacy and national humiliation. If it had been set up and the celeb was in on it then fine, no one was hurt but the fact is he was unaware and therefore not fare game. I think the BBC went to far and i don't think Ross and Brand are to blame, but the people who set the incident up.

Normally, very, very funny men...if you have a sense of humour. But as much as I love them, even I can't agree with what they did. It doesn't matter what that girl is or isn't, none of that has anything to do with her granddad and he should have been left alone.



As for the BBC, they allowed the content to be shown, and now it's come back on them, they are blaming everyone but themselves for upsetting everyone. Only 2 complaints were made at the time of the broadcast, the rest only followed when the papers got hold of the story. Once again, just like Jade Goody, other people have been made scapegoats to save the company's necks.
Given the state of the world today, there are many, many other stories that should be front page or headline news. What Russell and Jonathon did was wrong, but there are much worse people around. The BBC need to concentrate on the real news.

Apart from offensive, what they did was illegal. There needs to be a debate about why the police can only prosecute if the victim complains, and not a member of the public.



The director general has refused to answer questions about the affair on newsnight. He doesn't have a right to refuse.



The director general and head of standards for the bbc should have resigned, why haven't they?



It is right that this is front page news because a public body should not participate in illegal behavior.



If what they have done isn't publicized and no action is taken it sends out a message that illegal behavior is ok and more people will act illegally.



The bbc has been around for a long long time, it has never done anything illegal before.

Apprently america bullied her, once pulling her trousers down for no reason, and lindsay had no pants on. She started crying because she was so ashamed.

Yeah that whole thing with the pants really happened on the show ... between Betty and Kimmie (not American and Lindsay). The bully too. And it was Lindsay's character more then America's that did the bulling. So my opinion is that who ever wrote the article you read was making something out of nothing.

How many siblings did Marilyn Monroe have?



Someone answered this question incorrectly saying she had 22 brothers and sisters.  The real answer is that Marilyn had a half-sister named Bernice Inez Gladys Baker. Her birth-date is July 30 1919.  Marilyn said; "I have never seen my half-sister. We have nothing in common.  She is married to an airplane engineer.  I am not sure where he lives.  It's in Florida, Clearwater or St. Petersburg."  Bernice was raised by her father, Jack Baker in Kentucky.  In 1961 Marilyn reunited with her half-sister Bernice in New York. Bernice or sometimes spelled Berneice's married last name is Miracle. Berncie was named primary beneficiary in Marilyn's will and in 1967 Bernice became legal guardian of her mother, Gladys Baker.

Marilyn had two half-siblings - they shared the same mother, Gladys - Berniece and Hermitt Baker. Her half-brother, Hermitt Jack, died quite young and therefore Marilyn never got to meet him, but she got to know Berniece in her teens and they kept in touch mostly through letters (some of which Berniece reproduces in her book, My Sister Marilyn.) throughout Marilyn's life

Yes. There was a half-brother named Hermitt Jack Baker born to Marilyn's mother, Gladys when she was married to Jack Baker.  Gladys bore two children with Jack Baker; Hermitt Jack and Bernice Baker (now Miracle).  Hermitt was born 1918 and died of TB in the early 1920s.  Marilyn was born in 1926.

Pink -- or "P!nk" -- is the stage name of Alecia Moore, the feisty Philadelphia singer whose 2000 debut album Can't Take Me Home scored her first top-10 hit, "There You Go." She followed that with the album Missundaztood (2001), which featured the hit singles "Don't Let Me Get Me" and especially "Get This Party Started," a rowdy tribute to Saturday night that played up Pink's urban braggadocio. Her sassy snarl and outrageous fashion sense helped make Pink's music videos as popular as her records. For the soundtrack to the film Moulin Rouge (2001, starring Nicole Kidman), Pink teamed with singers Mya, Lil Kim and Christina Aguilera for a remake of the disco classic "Lady Marmalade." The tune won a Grammy Award for best collaboration with vocals, and helped Pink shift her image from rowdy punk kitten to more grown-up R&B singer. Her other albums include Try This (2003) and I'm Not Dead (2006). She has also acted, with brief bits in Rollerball (2002) and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and a leading role in the 2007 horror flick Catacombs.



Extra credit: Pink married motocross racer Corey Hart on 7 January 2006. According to a report in Us Weekly magazine, Pink "'wrote 'Will you marry me' on the pit board, which Carey saw on his third lap around" during a race in Mammoth Lakes, California... Pink is a vegetarian who has been an outspoken supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)... Pink says she got her nickname for blushing bright pink after a childhood embarrassment.

Anyone hear anythong about Nick Hogan's jail release (Hulk Hogan's son)? ?



I know that he was being released early for good behavior.  All the news has been about the election and the media news is all about Jennifer Hudson's family ordeal.  I just was wondering if they had an interview with him or anything.  BTW, is his sister's show still going to be on VH1 or was it cancelled?  I kinda liked it.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I know he was released, but that is it.  I saw that his sister was the one there to meet him at the jail.

Russell Brand/Jonathan Ross?



Why does everybody keep blaming Brand for the phone calls. I know it was wrong, but everyone keeps saying that Brand has led Ross astray. Ross can take care of himself and should know better, and, it was Ross who made the first comment on Sach's answer machine, i know they are both to blame but surely they are both equally too blame and it's not fair just to blame Brand?

The BBC suspended him. In other words,in 13 weeks,this low-life, 8th rate, entry-level employee of low IQ fame will be back on radio and TV.How boring to know that this 'slap on the wrist' is all he'll get as 'punishment'. The BBC has dumbed-down in recent years and J.Ross is part of that dumbed-down culture that pervades our lives.God help us all when that hapless,hopeless,useless employee returns!

Many people wanted him to be sacked bu the BBC have decided to suspend him for 12 weeks without pay, menaing that he cannot appear on any BBC tv or radio show until after 3 months. But he can still work for other channels so he's hardly going to be out of pocket.... all this extra publicity is hardly going to damage his career!

Yeah he got away with it.3 months pay lost,he will hardly notice it.Proves the point, the employees are bigger than the management,otherwise he should have been sacked.My boss would have sacked me.Pity he didn't work for Amstrad,their boss would have done the correct thing,no messing.

unfortunately the BBC lost its bottle and suspended him for 3 months with out pay +/- a million with a smirk on his face.Lets hope the enquiry will come to the correct conclusion, and his suspension becomes permanent.Popa

On  the BBC News website it says that his BBC shows are suspended for 3 months and he is without pay for that time. Presumably that is correct as it is the BBC website.

No, I think she started out good but let Hollywood go to her head.  Well, really it's her parents fault for not reigning her in.  My 13 year old wont watch her anymore and says shes turned into a skanky ****.



She now watches things with Demi and Selena.  So far they seem to be on a better path than Miley.  It's good to know that there are still people out there who care who their role models are. If you're  a kid, good for you.

I like Miley, I think she seems nice! She's made a few mistakes in her life, but who hasn't? They only reason hers are worse is because she is famous. If she wasn't famous and she was your friend, would you all still treat her this way, or would you have a laugh over it, and gossip about it?



1. They weren't really that slutty, all it showed was her back. People made too much of a big deal out of it.



2. So what? My mum and dad are like 6 years apart and they're living a happy life. It doesn't mean she is sleeping with him, or anything like that. Some people are just meant to be together and age shouldn't stop you.



3. Seriously? What does that matter?



4. I agree with you there! That was wrong. I like Demi and Selena.



5. When you think about it, she hasn't done that many bad things. And most of the "terrible" things she's done, are not even that bad!



5. Nick and her apparently broke up because she kissed him on the cheek in public. Or something like that, but there's no way to know for sure.



I have to disagree with most of what you are saying. I know i won't win best answer or w/e but still. People need to give her space! She's only 15! I know a lot of girls her age who are doing much worse things.



And btw if she was sending them to Nick, people need to think about what he's like. Don't get me wrong i like the Jonas Brothers but he could have asked her not to send them, and chances are that he sent pictures back!



That's just my opinion anyway :)

About a Filipino show starring Anne Curtis?



There is this show in ABS-CBN starring Anne Curtis wherein she's the school's IT girl and she fell in love with a nerdy dude.



I can't remember the name of the show. It's kinda like a weekly show wherein they tell different love stories every week. This show is kinda old and well, if anybody can help me! Please!



Wah! i'm being vague..I know..but I just want to know the name of the REAL NAME of the NERDY GUY.



The story of the show is that Anne Curtis, the IT girl, is kinda secretly dating a nerdy (but rich) guy and well...they broke up but Anne Curtis is still in love with the nerdy guy and she one day mistakens him to be dating when in fact he is just talking a a girl. And then they kiss and make-up and happily ever after..



PLEASE! IF SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING! PLEASE!!!!

<question>



Has the Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross "stunt" been blown completely out of proportion?



I think so....



Do you know that the actual broadcast of the "prank" phonecall only received two complaints. That's TWO complaints. Not two hundred, not two thousand, but two.



It is in fact thanks to the (biased) Daily Mail's article that the escapade has received such massive media attention and been blown completely out of proportion, in my opinion.



No Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross should not have made that phonecall as some people could be highly offended by such actions, however they are not wholely to blame for the incident:



1) the producer should NOT have allowed the "prank" to be broadcast (it was pre-recorded as most of you will know). It was a ridiculous decision and he should be fired (however the fact he should be fired is debatable and down to personal opinion).
2) the daily mail shouldn't have published an article criticising the "prank". AFTER the Daily Mail published this article criticisng the controversial phonecall, the BBC started to receive hundreds of complaints over the matter.



It is not unknown that the Daily Mail has it in for Russell Brand, Jonathan Ross and the BBC. In my opinion, whoever listens or agrees with the Daily Mail's bullsh*t, (excuse my French), needs some help. The Daily mail is vulgar, and does not write based on fact, normally they completely fabricate their stories or overexagerate for a desired effect (in this case, they aimed to achieve resentment towards Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand, and also to provoke the BBC for a reaction).



It is also unreasonable to critcise the BBC for their delay in apologising. I'm not sure whether it is publicly known that two very senior people were absent from their positions at the time of this "scandal" and that the people who remained present may not have been fully aware of what they should have done under these circumstances.
Many people at the BBC regret the decision that was made by more senior bosses but were unable to do anything about it. A majority of workers at the BBC think that the BBC should have made a public apology quicker.



Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross' "stunt" has been completely blown out of proportion. It was meant as a joke as Russell Brand quite rightly said. It is well known that Russell Brand's humour is very controversial and does not appeal to all audiences so if if you dislike Russell Brand's humour then why sit down and watch him on television?



This is just my opinion however. What do you think?

All gone way over board.  It was a bit of humour and I think people are just jumping on the bandwagon in complaining.  I bet if Ross or Brand said the same thing at a stand up gig then no one would have battered an eyelid and everyone would have been laughing!  Yes, it might have been a little insensitive to say it on radio but its a bit of humour.  They have both apologised so why cant people just say "Yep, they f**ked up, apologised about it so lets move on"

Totally.

its been completely blown out of proportion, you can obviously understand how him and his family were offended, but the producer should not have allowed it to have been broadcast, why are they not being criticised as much or even more than russel and jonathan are? the fact that the government got involved in it just shows where there priorities are. the amount of people complaining is obviously not the amount of people who actually listened to it. what was funny though was that he actually did f**k his granddaughter (just my opinion)

I think it's been blown out of proportion. They certainly went too far in what they said but that wasn't a case of malice it was just a lack of thought for which they have apologised and I believe they are genuinely sorry. They just didn't think at the time.



Any offence caused to the public could have been avoided when it was broadcast as it's pre-recorded. It seems daft that nobody is calling for the head of the person who made the decision to include that section of the recording when it went on air.



And as far as I'm aware, in most of the news reports about it the complaints have been about Brand's comments about sleeping with Sachs' granddaughter, which turned out to be true, and Ross' remark about the suicide. The suicide remark wasn't meant to be taken seriously and nobody seems to consider that the remarks about Georgina Baille were probably no more hurtful or offensive than her chosen career as a member of a burlesque dancing troop called the Satanic Sluts.

Right i know that the prank was wrong and not funny, but the show wasn't live, it was recorded.
so the BBC could had done was not to Air it in the first place.



But..the Daily Mail shouldn't make a big deal out of it and come up with sh!t that Gordon Brown got involved, and blow it out of Proportion.



and Finaly, Ross and Brand shouldn't had done it in the first place, but it was abit of a mistake for the both of them to do it in the first place.

Well what they did was wrong and not funny, but i found out that the show is recorded then aired, so it wasn't live, but the BBC could had not aired at all. but they did.



So it was the BBC fault for airing for other people to know, but its also Ross and Brands fault to for doing it in the first place too. and also the media for making a huge deal of it and blowing it out of proportion.



so it wasn't just Brand and Ross's fault, it was the BBC's too as well as the Media.

Shallow? No - it's high time we demanded a return of high standards in our national broadcasting service - the one we pay for! It's also high time we stopped paying obscene sums of money to certain 'celebs' just because they are famous  (or infamous - e.g. John Prescott & Jeffrey Archer ). I'd love to see some hard working, genuinely talented young unknown fill Ross's shoes - and make a better job of it too!

I agree, what utter hysteria!



What on earth is wrong with people that they turn this into such a circus, have they really not got anything better to do?



The actual show got only 2 complaints. It was only when the daily mail picked up on it that people started acting like idiots and getting all uppity about it. Really, how has this even reached parliament, it is an utter non-story and shows how the low-down media can whip up the gullible public into a frenzy about something that doesn't even warrant a second look.



Pathetic. I don't know what's wrong with people.



To those here that are saying they disapprove, did you actually listen to the show at the time? Did it offend you at that point? If you didn't listen, why are you now jumping on the bandwagon about something that you would not even have been aware of had you not been influenced by the media?

Her comment fresh of the plane says it all "I don’t want to say anything more until I’ve had a chance to speak to my agent." She is milking the incident (quite well) to raise her profile. Her lovely grandfather is obviously already aware of here status as self professed s1ut, swinger, waster and groupie. She claims to love it and good luck to her but her protestations are pure hypocrisy.



On the other hand making offensive unsolicited calls is a real crime with good reason. It is illegal and carries a fine of up to £5000 and 6 months in prison.



To promote this kind of behaviour as socially acceptable and funny is also hypocrisy. However funny anyone might think it is to torment some innocent individual over the phone the fact is they have no right to do so and the innocent deserve protection from such behaviour.



Promoting it as OK for a laugh is unacceptable behaviour by the BBC.

Are you so shallow to think half a nation is shallow



HELLO



It is our right to complain if we disagree with something.
Depending on ones values.
Everyone has an opinion some are just plain self opinionated and only hear what they want to hear without debate.
Mostly by not caring about what upset a statement,action,or whatever may cause they go with the flow with no valid opinion except that more people seem to be saying this than that.



No doubt later in life one of these things will hit you full on as it will many,
I would like to see how you deal with it.

Yes they are! It's terrible - there weren't so many complaints until the media got hold of the story and blew it all out of proportion. They don't deserve what is happening, it's ridiculous. The majority of the people who have rung in and complained now did so after hearing the clip on youtube or on various news sites and not after having heard it when it was actually aired - there should be a time cap on complaints - say 6 hours after airing. People are just jumping on the bandwagon now.

Why is it shallow to have an opinion?  I found what they did totally unacceptable and am impressed that Russell Brand has resigned; so should Jonathan Ross  People didn't complain en masse, they complained individually.  I didn't actually make a complaint but wish I had done so.

Hilary Duff was really ignorant to me?



My mom and I were visiting family in Los Angeles. We got bored and were just randomly driving around the whole day. Well, that morning we were in Toluca Lake, we got hungry so we stopped in this really cool diner called Paty's for breakfast. It was probably around 10:30. As soon as we walked through the door, I looked to my left and saw the one and the only Hilary Duff sitting there eating with a friend (i don't know who it was). I immediately pointed her out to my mom. I got so excited, I I knew I was finally going to meet her after being her #1 fan for the past 6 years! So we sat down and ordered. I figured I wouldn't confront her until she was leaving. So after about 15 minutes, her and her friend finally got up and headed towards the door. I grabbed my camera, pen, and a piece of paper and started towards her, my mom followed behind me. I said "Hilary." she didn't hear me. I said it again a little louder. That time she turned around and looked right at me with her friend right beside her. I then said "Can I have an autograph?". She said "I'm sorry, but no." She gave me a little half smile and turned back to the door and walked out quickly. I just stood there watching her until she was out of sight. I have to say, I was heart-broken. The girl I look up to the most just treated me like I was a nobody. My mom was in total disbelief. Hilary seems like such a nice person when you see her on TV.

Niley (i mean, it's quicker to type than: Nick and Miley. right?) broke up near the end of last year ('07) and Nick started dating Selena near the beginning of this year and they're still together, the reason Selena ft.ed in their vid. of burnin' up and was with Nick. =D

Apparently they made a rude telephone call to someone's answerphone.  An old actor [75] name of Andrew Sachs who once played a character called Manuel in a 9 part TV series called Faulty Towers starring John Cleese.



Since the above series back in the early 1980s [I seem to recall] Sachs has been out of sight on TV anyway.



During the rude telephone call, Ross/Brand apparently slagged off Sach's grand daughter who works as some kind of stripper or sex dancer.  Brand claimed to have had a shag with her or some such.



I did not hear any of this myself, so as far as I'm concerned it's just third party gossip.



In any event, British comedy is supposed to be out there on the edge breaking now ground.  That's what Brand and Woss are good at.



Now we will not have the pleasure of their company all thanks to a spiteful press campaign against them lead by the usual narrow minded gang of witch-hunters.

The media is overreacting, you can listen to the show on youtube :)
Sachs has forgiven them but his granddaughter is enjoying the media spotlight
and it is probably true :)



EDIT: Brand and ross are getting all the blame. It was the producers decision to air the show which was recorded on wednesday, on saturday



EDIT 2: only 2 complaints were recieved in the show... and that was about the language
the other load were from people who read about it in the telegraph and have nothing better to do with their lives except complain :)

on 18th october, brand and ross called up Andrew Sachs joking about how he slept with his grand daughter. (even tho he did) and then the daily mail made it a huge thing two days later and it all got out of hand and exaggerated. russel quit his show with ross suspended, with the bbc having making a decision on whether he will stay at the bbc or not.



to be honest its a shame really because Brands show was quite funny and he enjoyed it as well. well i guess, when did everyone start listening to the daily mail.....????

In due reference to those who posted faster than I, I wanted to research a bit first:



As said in the article (and some by others). It wasn't just anyone they called but an honoured BBC veteran actor of aged 78. More than 25,000 listeners and other members of the public had complained by the time the article was put on the internet...
A bit from the article:
The pair were widely condemned for pulling the prank on veteran Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs.
They left obscene messages on the 78-year-old actor's answerphone suggesting Brand had slept with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie



Then it was put on air. It was a bit round the twist in sick madness apparently--I didn't hear the airing .

The interviewer just seemed shocked that he would give it up just like that and Joaquin got a little mad. Almost like we were supposed to see this coming?



I'm very happy that he wants to pursue music, and I can't WAIT to hear what he has to release, plus he does make a pretty hot, sexy musician ;)



But nonetheless, I am extremely sad to see him go from the big screen. Perhaps he'll change his mind later.

I don't think she's going to be okay for a while after what has happened with her nephew, not to mention her mother and brother. It will take a long time for her to be herself again, but lets keep her in our thoughts and prayers.

I have loved him since he was on that Big Brother's Big Mouth show.  He's brilliant.  I love Matt Morgan too- listening to their radio 2 pod cast on the way to work always cheered me up.  Not anymore. :(  Stupid people who complained probably didn't even listen to the show.  Moral outrage over nothing.  And that girl Georgina is in a band called Satanic Sluts, sorry not exactly the picture of innocence, her Grandpa can't have been that shocked.

Is anyone else sad about Russell Brand?



I am going to miss that radio show so much, every wednesday i looked forward to getting the podcast and listening to it before I fell asleep, and it kept me entertained on long plane, bus, car journeys. I was so disapointed when Russell resigned. The whole situation was blown out of proportion, the woman is in a dancing troup called the satanic sluts for god's sake! The BBC handled it really badly. I'm praying that Ponderland isn't pulled, I don't see why it would be since it's channel 4. Anyway I thought that the stuff Jonathon Ross said was worse. All in all it wasn't nice but everyone makes mistakes and I hope Russell's career isn't damaged too badly.

http://i35.tinypic.com/whlcee.jpg



And I'm Wesley Snipes!



my question is do you think Mariah Carey intentionally  makes her skin darker to appeal more to hispanics and blacks? sure  given her background I would call her hispanic but her natural skin colour is very white.



</question>



<additional details>



I have CRAMPAGE, yes of course she does her natural skin color is very white which comes from her Irish side, but she hides in with her horrible fake tans and make up to try and look as hispanic as possible.



The reason I'm mad because someone was telling me she's black and I think it's insulting to a black woman and reflects on how messed up american society has become where a woman who is whiter than casper the ghost can be called black.

Well, she sings pop but more on an R&B level which appeals more to the ethnic crowd... I dunno if she does that intentionally though. If she does then what I said above would explain that

No, unfortunately.



Criss Angel is the biggest phony in the world. He claims he doesn't use camera tricks, but that's how a lot of his so called illusions are created...along with audience plants.



If you want some eye-openers, go to YouTube and search for "Criss Angel Exposed" - there are a lot of videos analyzing his tricks and exposing how they are done.



I was a fan until I saw some of them.

People have their reasons for hating celebrities, but with Hudgens, I do think jealousy plays a part, if not a big part in that.
She's an OK singer, good enough for a pop singer because, in general, it's not so much how you sing as your image/looks.
Over the decades, fans have long had a love-hate relationship with their favorite singers, actors and athletes. And, in addition, many entities in the media love to bring up and tear down people, and in many ways, fans aren't too different.
I don't hold the nude pic against her. Teens these days are growing up amid a world of instant exposure. So, when I was a kid, I didn't have to worry about my mistakes, stupid acts, etc., end up on something like the Internet, and be open to a worldwide audience.

People hate what they can't have or can never become.
She's got a fairly good voice. Her singing is not bad.
Maybe people don't like the type of songs she sings.
And she probably doesn't have a choice, because she's still signed to Disney.
I think she's sweet.
A lot of people are just mean for no reason.

I think mainly for her nude pic scandal. But in general, she's just a bad actress, and her whiny singing voice doesn't help her either. I mean her second album did worse than her first. What does that tell you? :)

Because she pretended to be "little miss innocent" and then those nude pics surfaced & showed what a big fake she is.  She can't act & she can't sing.

I see lots of talent in them, they have amazing voices. But their songs are not very good, I just am not able to get on board with teenqueen music.



When they grow up and start producing more mature songs maybe, but so far it seems they're just after mass amounts of money and they're working over teenage girls for it.

... WELL in a word i guess i couldnt describe it. but.... THEY HAVE NO TALENT!!!  really ok look if u look at any other band over the time of the past they have so much better music and really think about it HOW OLD R U?? most of that music is meant for 9 or 10 year olds. Dont get me wrong or anything they are SOOOOOooo hot. BUT they have no talent really!



but most people dont like them because they wanna be "individual" and that's stupid u have no reason to not like them.



WELL think of it this way i have been playing music for 6 years and i could play any one of their songs on guitar they all sound they same. and im not even really good at guitar.

Well I like them!! Their music is great and they write their own songs and play instruments. Also they seem sweet and well mannered and are always polite! And they believe in waiting for marriage!



Plus they do a lot for charity and donate a percentage of their earnings to children's charities.



Sure people dislike their music (I don't) but I don't see why people "hate" them personally!



I think that they are like marmite! You either love them or hate them!! There doesn't seem to be a middle ground!

I agree with Ronko. People like me have mental breakdowns but we're left on our own to take care of it. No one is putting us on the news and paying for our medical care.
But when Britney shaves her head and has a mental breakdown, it's all over the news and she has more than enough money to get help yet doesn't use it.
It is sad when Whitney Mel Michael and Britney have problems and it ruins a perfectly good career

BBC have banned Jonathan Ross for 3 months - is this punnishment ?



if i had millions in the bank and i was given three months off work - i think that it would be a bonus ? what do you think ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



it is their way of showing the public that they are punishing him. They dontcare about Jonathan Ross.



If he's banned does that mean the Jonathan Ross show will still air though? Its unfair to make 4 poofs and a piano suffer because of Jonathan's mistake.

Poles are the real heroes here the UK's and US take's all the credit thought becuse they're are  more powerfull than Poland



Americans are just like they want to potray the Polish People  wisecracks that say they're all heroes acting as Macho's etc but when something is up they're the first ones to run and hide in paranoical fear



This is not weird just a little bit sad that these kinda of People are the rullers of the world

Movies are made from a script. Scripts are made up. Make believe. I don't think it is weird. It is people using their imagination. In hind sight maybe it's because they are free to be.

Maybe it the Brits got off their whinging asses and made some movies of their own other than Billy Elliot they could have some heroes too. Besides, we all know that Mexicans are the true heroes. Tacos are delicious.

HA! I am Canadian and over here, people who put 16 Ys' in front of a word are considered pretty weird also ;-) But to answer your question, when Europeans produce movies they can have anyone they want to be the heroes, but guess where Hollywood is? Might have something to do with that.

Dont Judge Americans on movies they are just movies remember this...The USA is a big place imagine:-If you live in southhampton in the uk would you drive to liverpool for a household item? probably not, in the US its quite normal..think this through..they are different in many ways just becuase they speak english does not mean they have similar values..Best not condemn an entire nation based on showbiz..

Absolutely ridiculous! Trial by Media! There is far more offensive 'comedy' allowed out there. over 98% complaints made were made by people who haven't even listened to the show! They just jumped on the hyped up media band wagon. Sad representations of the British public. Know the facts before complaining!



Baillie slept with Brand and dances for a group called the Satanic Sl*ts(!) perhaps she should look at herself before complaining about others.



Also apparently the show was pre-recorded so if anyone is to 'blame' it's the producers/BBC bosses!

it went OTT with the media and complaints, i personnally didn't think it was that bad, i've seen jonathon ross do worse on his show and same with russell brand, they have apologised so i think it should be dropped



sparki is sooo right i think only 12 complaints were made when it was actually on the radio the rest was done after the media brought it to attention,

Hello,



(ANS) Both Ross & Brand are 100% totally over rated & totally over paid idiots who should be sacked.



**They both have their mouths & brains disconnected and as a result twaddle & rubbish pours forth. The BBC should get rid of both of them, & find broadcasters worth listening to & worth the license fee payers money.



**How can the BBC really justify Ross's 18 million salary sick !! IMO.

I first heard this song in, like, february, when I heard that vanessa hudgens was gonna be doing a cover of this song in her second album (Identified, released in July this year) but she never did the cover, but I hooked to the song and I so love it, but I have no idea where to get it! =(
Please don't give me any irrelevant answers; like, about nessa, because she's amazing leave her alone. But that's just my opinion, becasue I know her. Other people think other things, and, frankly, I don't care; so please stick to what I'm asking, because I've seen alot of crap on other peoples q's, so I don't want that. Thanks. Please help! =D

I hope their tour bus crashes and they burn to death, nah kidding.  I hope one of them becomes a big sellout and loses it all, I hope one of them turns out to be gay and I hope the third one turns to drugs and becomes a hapless crackhead.

You'd be suprised!
I met them earlier this year and Kevin was by far the most caring and chatty, Nick and Joe were less interested, probs cause they thought i was wierd cause i kept drooling over them :) but in real life Nick is the only good looking one personally.

Hello,



(ANS) 100% totally blown up out of all proportion, but the press & TV & media justify there own existence by doing precisely this, i.e. blowing things up out of all proportion. Frankly, I'm sick & tired of hearing about this story now.



**The BBC should have sacked both broadcasters ASAP and quietly got back to work doing what the organization does best. Providing high quality content not twaddle & rubbish. Ross & Brand only dumb things down IMO.

It is a farce they apologised, it shouldn't have been broadcast but it did so nothing will change that now, the worse part is Manuel's granddaughter is int he paper bragging she did get done by Russel brand probably getting paid for the story, all they did was tell the truth maybe another way would have been better but they were not be dishonest.

Absolutely ridiculous! Trial by Media! There is far more offensive 'comedy' allowed out there. over 98% complaints made were made by people who haven't even listened to the show! They just jumped on the hyped up media band wagon. Sad representations of the British public. Know the facts before complaining!



Baillie slept with Brand and dances for a group called the Satanic Sl*ts(!) perhaps she should look at herself before complaining about others.



Also apparently the show was pre-recorded so if anyone is to 'blame' it's the producers/BBC bosses!



As for Gordon Brown and the Tories trying to get involved - they should have FAR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO BE WORRYING ABOUT!!!

Where can I find a picture of Framing Hanley's Nixon smiling?



In the beginning of the 'Lollipop' video he's seen talking and smiling at this girl and I would like to know where I can find that pic of him.
Thanks

It's a media storm. They're loving every minute of it. All Brand and Ross have done is played into the hands of the gutter press. They were complete fools who have insulted a much loved elderly actor and they shouldn't have done it. Their egos got the better of them and their good sense switched off. But that's all! As far as I'm concerned Andrew Sachs has accepted their apology so why should it be anyone else's concern to cry for their heads? The press love stiring it up. They will get as much mileage out of it as they can especially if they can mention Ross' wages in every story. It's crap. How respectful is it of them to play on Andrew Sachs' being old and respected when they're calling it 'Manuelgate' in the papers?



The pair of fools and their bosses have been dealt with, this needs to shuffle off now..........but it won't because the gutter press haven't made enough money out of us yet.

It is a  crime.
You cannot encourage people to go and hang themselves. And you must respect people's privacy.
When I saw Chris Evans in tears because the bad boys have caused resignations by loved producers, then I feel the furore is justified, but not the solutions that the BEEB have so far come up with. Chris is quite 'cutting edge' but knows where to draw the line.
Ross was the perpetrator and should go.  But he has no decency. I get the feeling that Brand realises that he went too far. Ross does not understand that.  It seems that everybody in the BEEB is scared, or in awe, of Ross.
