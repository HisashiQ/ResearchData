Are you feeding your bird on Pellets this will cause it to drink more.

Try giving it some greens in small quantities,such Broccoli ,Kale,Spinach,Carrot,but not Lettuce.

Apple and Pear are all good.

Parrots are not great drinkers so I would not worry.

Owls have fourteen vertebrae bones in their necks.This gives their neck greater flexibility so they can turn it around to 270 degrees. They have to do this because, unlike us, they cannot see to the sides very well so this helps the birds.

They have a different spinal system to us, there vertebrae is almost double jointed and they can turn their heads over 280 degrees, from the front, in either direction, on a horizontal plane. they can even turn their heads upside down. This is partially to do with the fact that they can't move their eyes around like we can because their eyes are mushroom shaped (we can see the bottom of the mushroom stalk when we look at them). also an owl uses stealth to find it's prey so you don't want to make a load of noise turning around in a tree to find out what is behind you.

Are hybrid chickens more resistant to disease?



I had 4 hens, and all but one died of what I think was Marek's disease. This was a while ago now, but I was wondering if crossbreeds would be more resistant to disease? Because mine were pure bred pekin bantams.

I was wondering this because I have heard that say, in dogs, pedigrees are more prone to inheritant problems, deformations, etc, and i wondered if the same goes for chickens

Cross breeding different species will give much better genetic diversity and will make the chickens healthier. And in most cases pure breeds have been inbred at some point in their bloodline.

Any species which has been severely inbred to produce breeds eg dogs, horses, cats suffer a higher risk of genetic disease. Outcrossing to other breeds of the same species results in a healthier animal. I don't know what breeding practises are used in chickens but if they're similar to pedigree dogs having been heavily inbred then a hybrid/crossbred chicken will be more resistant to disease.

Sorry to hear you lost 3 of your hens, it must have been very distressing. If you're looking at getting some more hens hybrids aren't your only option.

Don't buy your hens from the same source as your others as the fact that they weren't given the required vaccines, indicates a poor breeder.

A reputable breeder will vaccinate their hens against Mareks, Newcastle, Avian flu, and coccsidiosis and should be able to provide proof in the form of a certificate etc.

Warrens are very hardy birds but I also keep Marans, Blackrocks, Bluebelles and Light Sussex hens and all are hardy girls. If they're given the vaccine and live a healthy life with good quality feed, fresh water, good shelter and the freedom to run roam and flap in a decent size run you should have no serious problems.

Good luck!

With mereks, it all depends on the chicken. most chickens that go to a show, have been exposed to mereks, it just depends on how healthy the chicken is if it shows up right away. If there was extreme weather (really hot or cold) or some other reason why the chicken might have been stressed (change of environment, shipment, different food) cause it to affect the chicken even years after it has been exposed. it is some what like fibromialgia where you have an underlying cause to for it but it doesn't show up until your body is stressed.

Kakariki's  in my opinion do not make good house pets as they like to "FLY" 
All birds will peck you until the become accustomed to you.

They are quite affectionate once they become used to you but will still give you the occasional nip,if they are not happy when you handle them.

Like Cockatiels they enjoy a nice warm water mist spray.

Other than that a good diet is essential and it is worth buying a book on them and their welfare.

It's easy. Use your own nail clippers to cut them.

If you look carefully at the nails you will see the red veins running so far down them. cut them just short of the veins and all will be well. Don't cut across the veins.

PS. Have someone else hold him while you do it.

Good luck

Well I use a dremel tool.  It causes no pain for the bird and you can't cut the nail to short.  It sands it off.  If you already have one then you just have to get the sanding attachment.  There is also a product that you can buy the is called  PEDIPAWS and it is only $20

Nail clipper or pet nail clipper.
In the nail you should be able to see a little pink line. Do NOT cut that, or else it'll bleed really bad. It'd be easiest to just cut the tips and do that until they're shorter. Long nails tend to have a longer pink line, and cutting just a little at a time will make it receed so it'd be easier to cut without hitting the pink line.
Also, they make perches that are like nail files, that help keep them short.
Or you could get a nail file and CAREFULLY file it to a softer point, remembering to avoid the pink line. :)

Unless you feel confident to cut your birds claws "Don't" all birds claws are sharp!!

Cockatiels don't as a rule have long claws I have a one that is nearly 29,yrs. and have never had to cut it's claws.

Do you know of a breeder in your area as they will always help and may even do it for you "If" necessary,or even a pet shop.

You can if you feel confident but make sure that you only cut the tip of the claw off,depending on the length of the claws this should only be the very end of the claw which is the point or the sharp bit.you can use a pair of ordinary nail clippers to do this.

But like I say only if you are confident others have given you an idea of what is required,but I would visit a vet and they will tell you if they need cutting they may charge you and even show you how to do it.

But without confidence you could cripple your bird for life.

But it could be worth it in the long run,to visit a vet.

They are typically a little boring because they don't talk or do tricks.  But if you work with him a lot he'll develop some character.  Of course if you do decide to buy one, only buy one that's been hand fed and is used to humans.

Cockatiels are only a little more expensive but have way more character.  I've had mine for about 10 years and he's got more character than my dog.

As a starting point to the avian world, yes. They are noisy, easy to care for, quick learners, and readily available. It might depend on how long you want one for (if you are going on to other birds), and your budget. They are inexpensive; it's more about their upkeep that takes time.

It depends on what kind of pet you are looking for. Birds are good pets for those that might not have the time or energy an animal such as a dog requires.

They are easier to care for since they don't need as much of your attention.

They are cheaper than dogs/cats since they don't need shots, and consume less food.

Then again if you're looking for some playful and loving you may want to look elsewhere as budgies are usually more for looking at.

No i don't think so. When i had one it looked so bored being cooped up in an increasingly dirty cage every day. That's another disadvantage, cleaning out the cage. They can also be a bit noisy.

I didn't think so, then we got one.

Pluses:

1. They're relatively cheap as pets go. You can get a nice big cage and some toys for well under $100.

2. They don't stink up the room. All you'll really smell is bird seed.

3. You don't need to take them for walks.

4. They burble, sing, cheep, and can learn to talk.

5. They're amusing to watch, they climb around and explore and play with toys.



6. They're cute and fluffy, and once tame will let you pet their soft feathers as long as you're gentle.

7. They're relatively easy to tame, and while they can give painful bites until tamed, they aren't going to do major damage.

8. They're easy to keep clean, if you get a good design of cage. You just need to change the water at least once a day (or more often if it gets dirty), and change the paper you use to line the cage.

On the minus side, they need regular out-of-cage time and social interaction. I work from home, so ours gets to see me and talk to me as often as he likes. If you're not going to be around all day, get two so they can keep each other company. Also, place the cage where the action is--ours is in the living room, right outside my home office. He can watch me work, and can watch TV with us. (They like that.)  We also have a play gym so if he wants, he can come be with me while I work.

They can be noisy; sometimes they'll decide to squawk, and you'll be able to hear it from the other side of the house.

Ducks are a valuable source for keeping bugs down and away Much better than chickens.Ducks will get into a pond and scoop up thousand's of mosquito eggs at one time, chickens wont.Ducks will be fine with the chickens only thing is ducks require different needs than chickens.Most ducks will stay together and leave the chickens alone unless the duck thinks its a chicken.Ducks can cause sickness with your chickens  ducks carry a bacteria that they are immune to but not the chickens but if clean up behind the birds your chickens should do great.Have to make sure your chickens don't drown in duck's pond or pools since a chicken doesn't know what to do if fell in. Ducks eat more feed than chickens are louder than chickens at times,and leave a mess bigger than a chicken and do make great watch dogs.Chickens are good for egg production faster than a duck which will also lay eggs.Chickens are happy and healthy when they are free roam feed water a good roost area are safe at night,and set free in the morning's not left in a tiny cage all day and night.Some people have a chicken duck goose swan for the family pet also turkeys and peacocks as well this all depends on the person and the type pet they wish to care for in a long term setting. Ducks like chickens should be trained to enter a coop/pen at night for there safety and well being.( no matter where you live)both chickens and ducks are vulnarable to predators! Like cats,dogs fox ratcoons skunks amoung others as well. Best to place both chickens and ducks in a coop/pen with a latchable door Since chickens are blind at night ( cant see well or not at all) Once a predator finds your flock it will return to kill all birds it can reach.I have a ratcoon that comes to vist my coop every night (mine are locked in and this rat can't get in.Ducks need water 24/7 in or out of coop/penThe swimming for your ducks is Very imporant for the cleanning  they do and to use webbed feet.Ducks are social birds so best to have more than 1. With ducks you need time and commitment  for the ducks to get to know you and you to understand them. The floor of the coop/pen should be dirt or something soft for the feet if it's a hard surface this will give them sore feet. Ducks like hay to rest in and build a nest with and lay eggs in unless the female makes on outside the coop/pen. There pen/coop should be cleaned once a week since they do get messy. With a dirt floor rake when you notice it getting packed down this will make floor soft again for the ducks feet. Chickens may also loosen dirt as well if allowed in ducks pen/coop.

My suggestion would be to call or email a good cockatiel breeder and describe what happened to your bird to them.  They could probably diagnose the problem and tell you.  Also, I would talk to a quaker parrot breeder and ask them everything I could on how to take care of my new bird.  Different breeds of birds have different requirements, and it would be wise to find out everything you can.

Hi,



1. Teflon coated cooking pans produce toxic fumes (Polytetraflouethylene) which can kill a pet bird in minutes. They only have tiny lungs.



2. Check the plants that you have around the house, Amaryllis for example is extremely poisonous.

3. Had the bird been nibbling any paintwork? Avoid using lead based paints on woodwork.

Hope these give you some pointers.

The best thing to do would be to locate a good avian vet and take your little quaker for her first check-up ASAP. Pet birds should see the vet for a check-up at least twice a year. That way you can speak to the vet about what may have happened to your cockatiel and discuss how you are going to care for your quaker to ensure that you will have a happy, healthy bird who can live up to 30 years, so it's best to get on top of this situation right away.
It sounds like your cockatiel may have had a respiratory problem of some type. All birds have extremely sensitive respiratory systems so you must avoid scented candles, incense, perfumes, etc. And do not use teflon-coated cookware, or cook very spicy or heavily scented foods around your bird.
Quakers are hardy, tough little birds, so with a bit of guidance from your veterinarian and a whole lot of research you should do just fine.
There is too much info about quakers to list here, but there are many good websites that can help you out.

Fear not.........what happened to your cockatiel is very rare.  It might have been a heart problem.  A lot would depend on how old the bird was and if it had displayed any other symptoms.  Most parrot-type birds require similar care (though not identical) and have similar characteristics.  Usually if the bird starts that apparent choking, there is little to be done unless there is an obstruction or you are VERY near a veterinarian well versed in avian medicine, but it would be extremely unlikely to happen a second time.  There are some parasites that can cause a behavior such as you described, but that would not come on suddenly.  I am including a few links to get you some information.  You sound like someone who really cares about your pets, and I am sure you will make good use of these sites and other sources you will find on your own.  Enjoy your birds, let them enjoy you and your love, and do learn all you can about them.  You will be glad you did.

While cockatiels find it difficult to say the actual words to songs, they CAN whistle the tune quite well. Just pick a song with a good, repetitive tune and play it over and over for a few hours each day. Your bird should soon start to whistle along, but don't get dissapointed if it takes a few months or if he never whistles- some birds just dont like to sing.

With enough practice and consistency it is definitely possible. I know a lot of people use music players with simple tunes and play it to their cockatiels every day. You can buy bird training CDs with words and/or songs on them at PetSmart or online. =) Good luck!

Mine whistles and sings, his own songs. But he likes to sit on my lap, and watch the birds on Youtube. When I whistle to him, I will see his throat begin to move, then he starts singing along.  His favorite trick is holding his wings out, running around the living room in a wide circle, singing "whoopee, whoopee"!

I breed Cockatiels and a few of my birds just won't shut up!

Male birds are more likely to talk than females and it is easier if you have just the one bird.

Concentrate on one word or phrase at a time and continue saying it, over and over again.... every day.  Your bird will hopefully start copying the sounds. However, some birds just won't talk and are happy to just whistle. Good luck.

African grey parrot feeding?



Hi. My CAG Kiwi is 6 months old. I used to feed her Nutribird A21 hand feeding formula once every night. She will have 40cc comfortably. For the morning i keep for her cooked corn, peas and some sunflower seeds mixed with Prestige premium african grey seed mixture. By the time i go back at night, she would have nibbled upon them. Now, in this part of the country because of 'bird flu', there has been a ban on imported bird foods. So i have switched her night food to 'gerbers organic baby food' mixed with corn flour and powdered pellets. Again 40cc she has it comfortably, provided given warm. I dont know whether i am feeding her the right nutritious food? When can i start giving her boiled eggs? Is there anything else that i can give her more nutritious? She still has all the stuff through syringe. She doesnt take it if i give her through a spoon. Am i doing the right thing by feeding her through syringe? Will she get so used to it that she wouldnt explore eating on her own? Please clarify my doubts. Thankyou.

Your pet birds diet is one of the most important considerations in its overall care. A first time pet bird owner may be overwhelmed by the vast assortment of seeds, seed treats and other items that are sold on the market as "Bird Food". The fact is birds need more than seed-type "Bird Food" to stay healthy. Although the specific nutritional requirements for all pet species have not been determined, it is known that birds require basically the same nutrients in their diet as other animals do. A wide variety of foods, including vegetables, animal or mature bean protein, whole grain products and a source of calcium should be offered. Following is a breakdown of the Four Basic Food Groups that are of particular value to pet birds:

Grains - Breads and Cereal Group (for B Vitamins) 
Approximately 60% of the daily food consumption may be selections from this food group that includes seeds. Because many B vitamins are contained in the seed hulls (which the bird does not eat), other foods from this Group are also valuable to provide. They are : Whole wheat bread, Cooked brown rice, Commercial Monkey biscuit, Wheat Germ, and other whole grain products.



Fresh Vegetables and Fruits Group (for vitamin A, C, minerals) 
Vegetables alone may account for approximately 10% of the dietary intake. They are: Broccoli, Endive, Carrots, Parsley, Pumpkin, Winter Squash, Collard Greens, Sweet potato, Corn, Peas, Beans, Kale, Lima Beans, Black Eye Peas. Fruits are offered in only very limited amounts and should make up approximately 5% of the daily intake. They are: Apples, Bananas, Grapes, Strawberries, Cherries, Oranges, Figs, Kiwi, Mango, Papaya, Peaches, Pears. DO NOT FEED AVOCADO. It is poisonous to parrots.

Meat Group (for protein and fat) 
Protein should consist of 25% of your birds diet. Hard cooked or scrambled eggs, Peanuts or other mature legumes (navy beans, kidney beans), Beef, Chicken, Tuna or other fish.

Dairy Group (for calcium and protein) 
Excessive consumption of milk products by birds is not advised, but the calcium needs must be provided (although birds do enjoy small amounts of yogurt, cottage cheese, and hard cheeses). The greater the consumption of seeds in the diet, the higher the need for supplementary calcium. This is most easily met by mineral supplements in the form of Cuttlebone and Mineral Block. If a bird refuses to eat the above items, calcium supplementation (crushed tablets, liquid or powder), may be mixed with other foods. It is also important to ALWAYS GIVE FRESH WATER DAILY. Pet birds may also benefit and enjoy a sip of fresh fruit or vegetable juice occasionally. DO NOT FEED YOUR BIRD "GRIT" (small pieces of rock or shell). It does more harm than good.

cockerels are sexually mature at the age of 6-7 months... however you should not breed them until they are about 1 year old...  breeding cockerels any younger than 1 year of age may result in egg binding or other seriously life threatening problems... any further questions email me at:

Yes you can buy one love bird by itself. They are easier to hand tame that way. As long as you are handling the bird everyday and have a mirror in there for it it will do just fine. If your going to just watch the bird then you need to make sure it has a buddy. As long as the bird has Human or Bird friend to bond to it will be one happy bird.

This isn't at all strange: robins often have "pet" humans. They originally evolved commensally with wild boars, as the boars would turn up nice juicy worms and other invertebrates while they were rootling around for acorns and things.  As boars became more scarce (and, in the British Isles, eventually died out) robins started to befriend (human) gardeners who would turn up worms while digging up their beds.  They are very good at recognising individual humans, so if you have a garden or provide food in some other way, the robin will probably consider you a useful ally.

It is not unusual for a robin to be friendly with humans, whilst digging my garden I often have, a robin watching from not to far away, when he sees something he is in there like a shot right under my feet or the fork whichever is the closer.
 Some years ago I had a robin eating out of my hand, each morning I would open the patio doors and call him for his breakfast ( Meal worms) he would sometimes come from as far as two or three hundred yards away, hop along the fence, look both ways then fly down onto my outstreached hand for his meal worms.

I have a special robin too as does my sister. Like you we both have gardens. My sister and I have come to the conclusion that robins associate us with food. When we frequantly water our lawns and gardens, worms come to the surface of the soil or lawn, therefore becoming readily accessable to our little friend THE ROBIN. In a sense, we are putting their dinner on the table for them. Thus we are not an enemy but rather a friend.

How about taking this question down and rewording it in relation to hens and rooster. That is the way most people I know talk about poultry.



Then you can get onto compatible breeds of poultry to breed from. That way you will get the right outcomes from your poultry breeding.

That is, if that is what this question was about in the first place. I suspect that you are after a chick to pull her feathers and you are not into breeding the feathered variety at all.

Cheers!!!

My cockatiels' eggs hatched, three born, I woke up this morning and found one dead..?



I found one of the three chicks dead this morning. It was upsetting for me, since this is my first clutch...
The baby is "really" dead... it has red around it's beak... it scarred me.
I took the baby from the clutch to prevent sickness... but now I have a question: Why did it die?
They're young, 1st time parents and are feeding their baby... this one is abnormally small and has a full crop, so maybe three is too much to handle and they pushed this one away?



</question>



<additional details>



I know my birds don't have "Polynoma" or whatever. They get regular check-ups, thank you.
The crop was half full, according to a friend. She thinks the baby was stepped on, and this is the birds' first clutch. The beak was red, so she said maybe he was stepped on, or something to that effect.

I doubt they pushed the baby away.
It may have been born dead.
It may have suffered from abnormalities.
Anything is possible but those are the most likely of them.
Don't worry about it,
I've have eleven love birds before and a lot of the babies died because of those two reasons.
Have fun with the babies. :]

In some cases it also could have died because of the cold or just and unlucky one that just wasn't strong enough to survive like the other 2.

If the crop was full they did not push the baby out so as not to care for it.  If this chick was born the same day as the other 2 (there can be a space of several days between some chicks depending on when during the laying process the hen began to sit)



and was siginficanly smaller than them then there was likely something wrong with it that caused its death.  It is also possible with inexperiance parents that they fed the chick the wrong types of food which causes and impacted crop that resulted in its death

It's called the food chain and the life cycle of the strongest survive. Nature provides for several eggs to ensure sucess of at least one otherwise extinction could result. Nature accepts that not all survive. What ever the reason merly remove the baby say a prayer and move on.

You say that this crop was full??  I hate to tell you that sounds like Polyoma Virus and if that is it then most likely all the chicks will die.  The parent birds could have Polyoma and they would pass it to the babies.  The thing is that the babies can not survive with it.  You need to take the breeders to a vet and have a test done.  If a baby does survive then it will become a carrier and then they will pass it on to other birds and the cycle is started over.  Once they get the virus there is no cure but the birds can live a semi-normal life.  You can't breed them anymore though and you can NOT ever bring another bird into the house and if any of your friends have birds they will need to strip and disinfect before ever going back home.

PLEASE have the birds tested.  I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing that there could be something wrong with my birds and then giving or selling there babies and making other people's birds sick.

How do I stop my single female cockatiel from laying eggs?



Hi,
I have a single female cockatiel who continues to lay eggs, is there a way to stop it?.  I know that a cockatiel can lay anywhere from 2-8 in a single batch, but I think she's gone beyond that now (I believe she's layed ten).  The other problem is that they are not real eggs just a soft shell each time (which I know means low calcium) we've been giving her foods with more calcium in it, which hasn't worked so a new cattle (calcium) bone is next hopefully that will help.  I know that it's quite dangerous for cockatiel to lay too many eggs because it lowers their blood calcium level (and too many eggs can lead to egg binding), so the other thing I was wondering is, should I get her a nest and let her sit on the shells anyway?.  Will that stop her from laying more eggs?.



Are there some things I can do to stop the process?.

Any ideas would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I do not agree with some of the other posters here.  You CAN get your bird to stop laying eggs. You are right in thinking this constant egg laying is bad for her. It does tax her on calicum and giving her foods with more calcium and a cuttle bone is DEFINITELY good. Do keep doing that.



First of all, do not take the eggs out. If you take the eggs out she thinks shes lost the eggs and it encourages her to lay more to replace the ones that went missing.  Let her sit on the eggs so she doesn't lay more. Let her sit on them till she abandons them, then remove them AND the nesting box and anything that she could use as nesting material. To keep her from laying eggs again make her "environment" an "unsuitable place for rearing young."  This means shift her toys around regularly and change them out with new ones. (Change= bad egg laying time)  Also cover the cage for a good 12 hours at night and let her sleep. This changes her body's rhythm and makes it think its not the breeding season.  Also, a vet visit to make sure shes ok and that shes getting the vitamins she needs is highly encouraged since shes laid so much. And keep an eye on her in case she gets eggbound, if she stops pooping or looks slightly ill or swollen this is a sign of eggbinding, take her to an avian vet immediately because lack of immediate care results in death.  Best of luck for you and your birdie.

Your bird needs a vet visit. She can get a calcium shot and liquid calcium for you to administer,. The soft shells mean she is already calcium depleted. Feed her broccoli, sliced almonds and scrape cuttlebone over food (use a spoon to scrape into a powder)Also lupron shots can be given which may help to break the egg laying cycle. She needs 12 hours of undisturbed sleep in a dark quiet place. She needs substitute eggs. If you take the eggs away she will lay more to replace them. Maybe marbles would do if you have nothing else as the soft shells will break . They can break inside her too which is very serious.

The egg laying cycle is governed by hormones & it is not really possible to make changes at will, you can certainly attempt to deter the process by moving away the nest box .It is quite usual for single birds to lay eggs occasionally,these need to be moved so that incubation does not start,this would be a totally futile exercise since these eggs are infertile.

PLEASE take your baby to the vet.

You might be taking the eggs from her too soon. Let her sit as long as she wants on the eggs then GRADUALLY take them away from her. (Like 1 every other day)

Force feed that baby some calcium. Shave a calcium block or cuttle bone into her food.

She may get egg bound. This WILL kill your bird.

PLEASE take her to the vet.

It is NOT unnatural for a single bird to lay eggs. It is not unnatural for them to lay many eggs at once. It IS unnatural for them to lay and lay and lay and lay!

You need to get them something to wear their teeth down on.  You can't stop mice or other rodents from chewing, nor do you want to.  Just get them the gnaw sticks to use instead.  If they don't chew and gnaw constantly, their teeth will overgrow and they will die from starvation.  They sell those sticks anywhere that they carry hamster supplies.

Mice are rodents, which means their teeth continue to grow throughout their lives, and they have to gnaw on things to keep them sharp and from getting too long.

If you really don't want them gnawing on the cage, give them plenty of other things to gnaw on in the cage, like wood, plants, grains, etc.

Well mice and rodents in general need to be constantly chewing on things to wear down their teeth because they keep growing and if they get to long it can be harmful to the mice.
when i had my rats they always chewed on the bars, ALWAYS! Got really annoying sometimes but i got used to it. 
I also got them some chewing toys, like little blocks of wood. That really helped, they loved chewing up popsicle sticks too.

No, for budgies you either use sand sheets or loose sand. You can buy sand sheets from nearly all pet shops, and sand from probably reptile shops? But they are the best things to use. It's what we use for our birds, and what is used for the birds at college.

EDIT: It's grit that helps them digest, not sand sheets.

I suggest that there be a grate at the bottom of the cage and you use newspaper in the bottom under the grate.  In the wild birds do eat sand a gravel to help digest there food.  Macaws spend several hours a day eating clay because it absorbs the poisons from the nuts that is their main diet.

In captivity birds do NOT need the gravel or sand because their diet doesn't consist of the same things as it does in the wild.  It is actually very dangerous for you to offer grit to birds because it can cause impaction of the intestines and it causes very painful deaths.  The same goes for cuddle bone.  The hard covering on the back of the cuddle bone can cause impaction and rips if swallowed.  So if you give cuddle bone I suggest that you scrape it off and put it on the food.

So newspaper or paper towels are the ways to go.

wood shavings are good, or you can put this metal thing at the bottom of it, and this plastic thing should slide out from the front of the cage, and you would put paper under that so it can catch the droppings.  They also need a cuttle bone!! And maybe a toy at the bottom too.  Remember to rotate the toys as they get tired of old ones quickly.

Well, do you have a pond/pool for them?
Most ducks wont mate unless in some Pond/Pool.
So if you dont have one of those, then they are most likely Infertile ( Not fertilized ).
If you do have a Pond/Pool then you probably would of seen the male duck getting ontop of the female (Mating).
And if you have seen them mating then they are probably Fertile.
If your duck ( female Call ) is broody at the moment ( has made a nest with her eggs inside, next to each other ) then you can just let her do it.
But, if she is laying eggs willy milly anywhere in the yard then you can buy an Incubator On Ebay or Mcmurray Hatchery.com ( I suggest the Little Giant Still Air Incubator with auto egg turner, or the Hovabator with Auto Egg Turner ).
If you decide to Incubate them with one of those Incubators, then I suggest getting "A guide to a Better Hatch" which you can get at Mcmurray Hatchery.com. Its a yellow book with a Picture of a Chick standing next to a broken eggshell.
It is really helpful.

It doesn't matter if you touch them.
Although, you really shouldn't because the bacteria on your hands can kill the embryoes inside the eggs.

Well, good luck.
I do hope this helped.

You know if the egg is fertilised if the duck has met and gone through the ritual with the drake.  I would let your duck sit on these ones and see what happens.  If after a couple of weeks nothing happens then remove them - far away from the house!  The duck needs to have been with the male in the previous seven days to be fertilised.

Try to candle the egg after a few days in the incubator. Then you should be able to see if it is fertilized or not.

The avian vocal organ is called the syrinx; it is a bony structure at the bottom of the trachea (unlike the larynx at the top of the mammalian trachea). The syrinx and sometimes a surrounding air sac resonate to vibrations that are made by membranes past which the bird forces air. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, which is how some species can produce two notes at once.

Do lovebirds mate in captivity?



My sister has 2 lovebirds, one male one female and they've recently started humping. It appears she thought they might be neutered when she got them - do they neuter birds? I told her they didn't. Will they breed or are they just enjoying some recreational rumpy-pumpy?

Yes, they do. Some people say they are the easiest birds to breed.

You can "spay" and "neuter" birds, but it's a very dangerous procedure because 1) the anesthesia could easily kill a bird, especially one so tiny, and 2) the surgery is so invasive and again, these are tiny birds with equally tiny organs. Many people don't do it due to the incredibly high risk. It is a VERY. LAST. RESORT for people saving their birds' lives if they have had troubles with, say, passing an egg before, something of even higher mortality.

Are they DNA sexed? You really can't tell with lovebirds without having a DNA sex test. If they're "humping" like that, they think it's mating season. This could be a dangerous time for the female because small birds can easily get an egg lodged in the cloaca (where the egg comes out), become egg bound, need surgery or some sort of avian veterinary intervention, or worst yet, they could die with few notable signs beforehand. There are some times where stimulation is affection, but again, this leads into mating season. Stimulating areas are on the back and the belly, both places the birds are touching to each other, and this is like a favour they do to each other.

I do not agree with putting a nest box in to see if they have babies. One reason is the risk to the female lovebird, as I already mentioned. The other reason is that babies need tons of attention from both the human caregiver and the parent birds. Parents need more energy, more calcium, many supplements if they're eating a poor food mix (pellet based diets are best with fresh food supplements and about 5% seed composition - they're the most well-rounded parrot diets so far). The babies and parents could be malnourished, you may lose some of the babies, the parents would be devastated, and it would be heartbreaking for you and your sister. Especially if your sister was under the impression that her birds were neutered, this is not the right time to go off blindly into experimenting with breeding. It's not safe at all, and calls for very emotionally, financially stable people, a LOT of time and devotion along with emergency contacts on call (certified avian vets, constant transportation, constant open-eye watching for the slightest changes in the babies or the parents) and extensive research. Also, if the parents reject (a) baby/ies, since you/your sister decided to breed them, they are your responsibility. There is a huge guilt issue if you happen to lose a baby or if a parent rejects one, or more, and you have to be the one getting up every 2 hours day and night to feed it when it makes the slightest whimper for at least 8 weeks.

Hmm, Did you realise you posted this in bird? I'm guessing your talking about a labrador dog.

Dog's are they carnivore's Are they really like wolves,hyena's and jackals?

Or are they more like us? Is it foolish to feed them only meat? Should they be fed what their human family eat?

The truth encompassess a little of each

In the wild, other hunting animals that seem similar to dog's, such as wolves and hyenas, eat fruit, leaves, grasses, dig for roots and even obtain vegetable matter from the stomach of their prey.The bone's of their prey provide calicum and help keep teeth clean.Their diet's are highly varied and also change seasonally.

A domestic dog fed on human diet struggles with dairy products and can actually be poisioned by some of the common ingredients in human pantries.

Dog's are actually omnivorous.They need alot less meat protein then cats, ferres, snakes and feeding a high animal protein diet to a dog will take a toll on its health.A dog is designed  to digest a wide range of plant and animal products.Dog's must eat more then just muscle meat.they need plenty of carbohydrate's and fibre from vegetable and plant matter and only a very small amount of fat.their protein can come from both plant and animal product's.the other thing's to consider are sources of mineral such as calcium and phosphorous and of cause vitamins.

CATS
Cat's are strict carnivores.this mean that some of their nutritents can be obtained only from animal sources.However being a carnivore doesn't mean that all of the nutrients need to be from animal products or that a carnivorous animal could survive eating muscle meat only.
A wild carnivore such as a lion will kill and eat an atelope.it will lickthe hair off and chew on the skin.the organ are consumed, including partly digested grass, leaves, and other grazed plant material.Last of all, the bones are eaten too.

Cat's and Dog's are also very different in their needs

For both animals too much protein can lead to kidney failure, but cat do need a little more protein than dogs.

Labradors are best to have dried dog food, with a tiny drop of cod liver oil in to keep the coat nice and shiny. Iams or pedigree complete are what most people use or you could purchase the food from your vet, they do special diet dry food which is most suitable because labradors are prone to putting on weight from constantly eating anything! Speak to your vet if you are unsure im sure he or she will advise you well! But most definately use dry food!

Long is better than tall.  I don't suggest you getting more than one because if you end up with a male and female you are going to end up with unwanted breeding.  The size you give sounds good!!

Yeah that's a good sized cage. As the answer said long is better than tall. The recommended size for one parakeet is 18x18. If you have two it might need to be a little bigger. Just try to get the biggest cage you can.

Ya, that should be good. And about the company thing...if you want the bird to be bonded to you and be more of a pet only get one. If you get two they will bond to eachother and will not want to be held. Here is a site to help you get started if you need it. Good Luck! http://parrotcentral.net/

A recommended bird cage size for budgies is 24 by 24 by 24 and 1/2 inch bar space size. You need to keep the width between the cage bars in mind also. It's especially important with smaller birds. A budgie's small head could poke through and get stuck or worse. BirdChannel.com has some articles on bird cages and accessories for the cages that you might find helpful if you are not familiar. Good Luck finding the best budgie bird cage.

Your chickens are individual animals.  Only clones or identical twins would have the same preferences.

Do you mean 'in their ways'?

Be sure they get lots of greens and crushed oyster shells.  Make sure you feed them the nutrition they need and they will be fine.

I feed my chicken layers pellets and mixed corn which they enjoy I also feed them in the evening with some scraps from the table and a little more mixed corn.  If your chicken has only recently been off its food then keep an eye on her incase she has something wrong with her, if she has always been like this then its just the way she is. If you have had her a while then she must be having all the food she wants.

chickens all have there own personality. have layer pellets always there so that they can eat that when they want.  any chicken usualy likes wheat, try soaking the pellets till they are soft but only do enough for one day so they dont go mouldy, they normaly love that. give grass, scaps,bread, cat food, fruit, vegie....you will be sure to find something she likes.
