Why don't people (women) tell men that women give sex when attention is withheld from them?



Instead of all this 'be yourself' 'respect them as people' nonsense. Why aren't social dynamics most often taught as they truly are- women give sex (most often) when they feel they have nothing else of requisite value.



</question>



<additional details>



Of of course, women only have sex for their own pleasure and prerogative. Never do they- as they saying goes 'give sex to get love'.

As a woman, I can tell you from personal experience, that I enjoy sex, but I also have values. If my standards are not met, then forget it.
Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoy my sexual times with my partner, and it has absolutely nothing to do with a perception of little value. That's got to be the dumbest thing I ever heard.



Maybe social dynamics should include a segment on the many misconceptions men have of woman. I think you ought to sign up, because I have no earthly idea as to where the hell you got your information.

I for one don't want to teach either my son or my daughter that dynamic.



I want my son to respect women and not expect sex from his lady after only a couple of dates. That's a problem, you know - I've heard quite a few men say that if a woman won't sleep with them after a couple of dates they will dump her. Nice. That's not the kind of male I wish my son to be. I want him to value sex enough to see that it is worth waiting for and saving for marriage. I want him to respect himself enough to wait.



I want my daughter to respect her body instead of treating it like a bargaining chip to get attention or things. I want her to remember that she is worth more than that. I want her, like my son, to value sex enough to want to save it for her husband and herself alone. I want her to respect her young man when she has one, too.



I want this for their sakes. Hubby does too. We both agree that this is the best thing for them, after seeing how wonderfully it worked out for us. It makes a huge difference in life.



IMO this whole sexual dynamic society has today is based on a lack of respect. People don't respect themselves or each other. If they did they wouldn't be jumping into bed with near strangers all the time.

Because I don't want to be prohibited from certain activities or certain jobs simply because my body has breasts and a vagina.



For example, I have lots of trees in my yard, and when Ike ripped through, there were lots of downed branches.  I got out my chain saw and cleaned up the mess.  This is usually considered man's work because it requires moderate upper body strength.  But I have a saw that is scaled to for my size and strength and enjoy the exercise.



This is a purely personal example, but when most of society is entrenched in gender roles, both women and men have limited employment opportunities.



Firefighters are a good example, because most people use the argument of dragging a person out of a burning building.  But what about the other essential functions of a fire fighting team?  Aren't there roles where women can serve just as effectively as men?



By separating sex and gender, we get to choose roles rather than having them assigned by default.

Modern feminism is essentially a movement for people who don't fit gender roles. I don't mind that - it's good to see people as individuals and try to accept them for their personal qualities, and I don't think anyone should be denied opportunities because of their gender.



But I wish they'd understand that many studies have shown a biological origin to gender identity, and that they are the exception to the rules. Most feminist theorists believe that differences create social division, which isn't true at all; a gender neutral society isn't needed to have equality. Sex and gender are different, but in the majority of people they go alongside each other; that's not stereotyping, it's biological fact.

Sen. B. Obama is a Marxist and a Racist but I haven't seen him as of late.  He is hell bent on turning the US into what the USSR was in the mid twentieth century.  I don't think he's a zombie or a cannibal, he's just a man who will represents the demise of the USA.  Although he has a cold heart, metaphorically speaking, it wouldn't account for having blue or purple lips.



In terms of cyanosis of the vermilion lip, this would typically be in the context of being really hypoxic (e.g. SaO2 &lt; 87%), so if he were genuinely this sick, he'd need to be on a venturi mask so I doubt this was frank cyanosis.



It may have just been makeup of dryness of the vermilion border which gave this appearance on TV.  It's really doubtful that he was frankly cyanotic.

Men, what are your views on traditional feminism?



We all know how the men on GWS hate modern feminism, because it's demonized men.  But how do you guys feel about the original feminism, that states that men and women are equal and women should be treated with the same respect as men, should get equal pay for equal work, should be educated, shouldn't have to do 100% of the housework and childrearing, etc?



</question>



<additional details>



Sid Snot, if you're being serious, then you're the reason why modern feminism exists, because women are sick and tired of putting up with crap like that.  THAT is why so many women have decided that they hate men.  So don't start complaining about a modern feminist hating you if you come face to face with one.



So Raj, you believe that men should be allowed to be total whores, but women shouldn't?  Please explain.



Kurishi, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Elaborate more on the housework and childrearing thing, or else you're getting a thumbs down.



But why shouldn't men ALSO be chaste?



And also Raj, what about masturbation?  Should women be allowed to masturbate, or would that also violate the "laws of chastity"?

My views on the examples you have given are of course in total agreement with the exception of housework and child rearing (WAIT BEFORE YOU THUMB ME DOWN) because it should be the woman's choice whether she wants to do those things or not (as in a woman shouldn't feel like they can't do those things) but even some early feminism was horribly fundamentalist and lead to such horrendous things as feminists aborting their child if it was a boy.



edit - I'm not sure what you don't understand about it. The point is that people shouldn't say that women shouldn't do 100% of the housework. Freedom of choice is what's important. some women will want to do 100% of the housework and should be free to choose to do that if they so wish, you see?

I have no problem with any of those, because those are simply matters of self-direction EXCEPT for the concepts of "equality", equal respect and equal pay for the following reasons:



Equality: Men and women are equal in terms of their human worth. But they are not "equal" in that they are the same (because contrary to feminist madness, equality does equal sameness). This concepts also leads to other follies like the pursuit of material equality (i.e. communism) and vice.



Equal pay: This is a myth and can only be achieved through labor-market price fixing (which is basically communism or socialism). It is not only unjust (since external bodies arbitrarily determine your pay, rather than you), but it's economically disastrous.



Equal Respect: This is a nebulous and silly thing that results in all sorts of social calamity. It justifies abortion (such that women can be free of the burden of childbirth, just like men), promiscuity (such that women, who are the guardians of chastity, join men in pursuing sex), and, in general, a treatment of women that is contradictory to their nature.



Edit: Last I checked, sex required both men and women to occur (at least normal sex does). So how can a man be a "whore" without a corresponding woman "whore"? Men are more sexually aggressive and pursue sex more by their nature than women. If women do the same, then a lot more sex (and abortions and out-of-wedlock births and divorces) simply occurs. If women lived up to their responsibilities as guardians of their chastity (and since feminists say that it's "their body", it is therefore "their responsibility"), we would all be much better off.



Edit 2: Men SHOULD be chaste. But, just by human nature, men pursue and women are pursued (even in this feminist world we live in). If you tell women that they should be just as pursuant as men (which is contradictory to human nature), then women are more willing to abandon their role as guardians of their chastity. Now we have neither group that lives up to this role, which has resulted in a lot more sex and the various social calamities that arise from it.



Edit 3: I think it's good to avoid masterbation (this goes back to arguments over lust and it's overriding effects on the mind and the will), but it's irrelevant as far as social ills go so I don't really care one way or the other. You can't get pregnant, transmit an STD or cause emotional damage to somebody else through self-gratification.

I support traditional feminism. It was not "men as a class" that set up the old configuration. It was our leaders, it worked, it served its purpose, we have all this technology to show for it and we are all taxpayers now because modern conveniences allow us to work a full week and sustain ourselves without a back up person in a supportive role at home.



The old system eventually freed women and now men and women work within the same system, taxation.

respect: they already do- *when deserved* - more respect than men in fact. respect in our culture comes from (1) being an expert (most leading scientists and nobel laureates are men) and (2) having very high moralities (women when caring and charitable make inroads here) and (3) being courageous/bold (a quality usually found more in men)



equal pay: already do (in the US at least). if education fields (engingeering, management, sciences always pays much more), time off, maternity and other concessions are taken into account fully. There's a lot of controversy on this and you'll find statistics both ways. There was an interesting class at Harvard U on the economics of gender last semester (Im not a student there- but saw the syllabus and read part of the book)



educated: in the US, women already outnumber men on college campuses. There is absolutely NO barrier to a woman getting educated.For engineering, math and science, there is unusual support and desire for women students and researchers, shown by special fellowships and scholarships available to them only.



houseword/childrearing: this has since the beginning of civilization been the domain of the mother- to nurture and protect her child. women will always be more involved with raising and nurturing their children. men are rarely as attached to their child. that said, most people do agree that when both parents are working, men should help more. in reality this rarely happens. success depends on the individual household rather than the society at large. expect changes in the following decades but not complete 50/50.

well, lets see. Reverse psychology can be done for many reasons.
a lot of the times it is to get you to do something or admit to something that you would not normally admit to. that is what i did when i first started out as a shrink. However, you are right and it does make patients feel bad. I started using different methods for gathering the most information out of my clients in a shorter amount of time. Hope this works, for you. If not then i will take another shot at it.

Well perhaps one would attempt to use reverse psychology in order to influence you to do something or admit to something that you normally would not have any desire to do so.  If one is always true to ones self, then it matters not what someone does to try and convince you otherwise.  =P

Because the media portrays women as weak (which I'm suprised the feminists aren't fighting more...), and men as strong, so naturally any time there is a fight on cops, or a battle in court over kids, the woman is viewed as the perfect mother and completely faultless, while the man is demonized.

I don't understand why so many men on this site like to stand with the violent ones in solidarity. Wouldn't they be implicating themselves as having a propensity towards violence by doing so?



Or do they simply think that a quarter of women are liars and all men are sugary sweet?

Contrary to what Tracey says, I do not blame my erectile dysfunction on feminism.



My erectile dysfuntion is the result of my penis almost doubling in girth over the past 3 years.  During that same period, I gained an extra 1.5" in length.  Quite frankly, my body cannot pump enough blood in to service the unit.



I would blame feminism for the arrogant, condescending and disdainful attitude that almost all women, feminist or not, seem to have these days.  Women, being illogical creatures, think that having 'rights' means you can insult and judge others with impunity.  While this isn't something that feminism specifically fosters, they certainly do nothing to curtail this side-effect of their movement.

Although values and beliefs are intrinsically very personal, they are also "formed" by societal conditioning, peer pressure etc.



Which core beliefs and values do you think are DIFFERENT between the genders. Do you agree that we probably share more in terms of values and beliefs than we differ?

I think men and women of the same culture probably have more values and beliefs in common than two people of the same sex of different cultures.  Very few values seem to be intrinsic, most are taught by religious, political, societal system.  From what I've studied, taboos against murder and incest seem to be the most common across cultures.  That stated, there will be some common threads ... look at worldwide campaigns to stop injustice, etc.



For instance, a worldwide campaign to help women in poverty isn't necessarily a "woman" thing.  It's that women have tended to be oppressed historically in many cultures, stemming from the fact that they are the physically weaker sex and physical strength has been the defining characteristic of power in older times.  Women often mutually understand the feeling of being oppressed, so they may reach out to help each other.



But its not exclusive to women -- other demographics that feel oppressed may also pitch in.  Consider the Civil Rights Movement, and how it was aided by other minority groups such as women, homosexuals, etc.  Eventually, many movements took place -- which leads me to believe that we have a general human drive for dignity and equality.

I honestly don't think women have many values- as harsh as it may or may not sound. I feel they sway with the wind. What exactly do they value? Integrity?- no. Self-esteem?- Of course not. Woman, as a social group, value whatever society wants them to value and rarely stray from that ideal.

Sex-based abortion is a really bad idea based on the fact that nature maintains a 50/50 balance of male and female for a reason. Ask the millions of young men in India and China who can't find a wife (because so many of their female peers were aborted) whether it's a good idea.

Well, I'm a feminist and I can tell you that I believe in choice for women, that is a woman and not the government having the say when it comes to her reproductive choices.  I am against infanticide, which is murdering an actual child because it is male or female.  Abortion is not infanticide unless the fetus in question is viable or able to live outside of its mother.



Most women do not choose abortion lightly.  Rape, incest, health, lack of economic resources are some reasons women choose to abort.  In a perfect world every child would be wanted, women would not be raped, and every woman would be healthy enough to carry a pregnancy to term.  But we do not live in a perfect world.



Better access to reproductive services, birth control, and sex education has been proven to reduce the amount of abortions. Hopefully you are on board with this.  Criminalizing abortion may have reduced abortion but with the terrible consequence of women performing abortions on themselves or going to "back alley" abortionists putting their health and lives at risk.



When I was young I read a book that talked about the days before it was legal.  I remember a black and white picture of a girl, slumped over and dead on a floor from a botched abortion.  That image is seared in my mind forever and that's why I'm pro choice today.  I don't EVER want to go back to those days.  Do you?

I myself, am not a supporter of abortion, except for instances of rape and incest. Although I myself believe this way, I don't force it on those around me. I believe it is the woman's right to choose.



I didn't use to think that way, until I learned of all the cases of abortions gone wrong, in which a coat hanger or unsterilized equipment was used in an unclean setting. When you see this, you get a feel for the urgency that was felt..the need for the procedure, or life would be ruined. It is truly heartbreaking.



Now, sex based abortion is simply wrong.



It is deciding that one life, because of its gender, is more important than the other. I despise people who support that way of thinking. A male is no more important than a female, and vise versa. How would you like it, if you couldn't find a husband or wife for your child, because of selective abortion?



Also, would you really want to raise your children to believe that one gender is better than the other ? I mean, if there is gender based abortion, your children would eventually ask why, wouldn't they? And you would have to explain to them that in fact, even in the great country of America- we are not  created equal after all. What would that do to our society?



Think of China- how do you think those girls feel, knowing  every single day of their existence, that  they are worthless, and because boys are the prized creatures, the girls must be the servants, because girls have no value? How do you think they feel, when they know that they are viewed as 'nothings' and 'burdens to society'. And those are the girls who were allowed to live. Would you want that same view of life spread throughout our country? I know I wouldn't. I'd want my children to respect life equally and to learn right from wrong as we have always done.



This sex based abortion has the potential to create a monster.



How would you like it if we had a situation on our hands like China? They killed their baby girls for years, because they saw no value in them. Now they don't have an even ratio of males to females, hence, not enough wives for their sons. And you know what? It serves them right! No matter which gender is deemed 'more important' it is wrong, and it could spin out of control.

I think feminists are against what sex-selective abortion represents rather than the abortions themselves. Sex based abortion usually happens in countries which views females as inferior, and so is seen as another example of inherent male privilege. It isn't really anything to do with abortion itself, or with the rights of the child; it's the concept of females being less worthy of life that they object to.



I'm personally against sex-selective abortion for the same reasons I'm against all abortion.

You've got it. They are only pro-choice if you choose how they want you to choose.  They are hypocrites.



As for the other answers... women still die from abortions. They are even dying from RU 486 try looking up the facts instead of believing the hype.



These aren't simple matters and they are being treated as easy fixes.  The women that I know who had abortions, had them as a matter of convenience like, I'm not ready for a child, I'm don't want another child, I don't want another child so soon, I don't want the father to know, I don't want my parents to know.  Sounds like a lot of "I"s. Abortions are done after viability all the time, just look in the phone book and then check how early some babies are delivered and live.



Why aren't the "feminists" more concerned with the fact that abortions are being done on minor girls means that a statutory rape has occurred with abuse or pedophilia involved?

Gentlemen and Normal Ladies who have or plan to have a child at some point...?



If a lady proudly proclaimed that she's a modern Feminist either when you're interviewing a nanny, babysitter or perhaps she says this when you meet your child's school teacher, for example, would you allow this person to be around your child?



If I found out that my child will be in the presence of a modern Feminist, I would immediately send my child to another school to avoid the possible abuse (physical and/or emotional) that my son or daughter may sustain in this individual's presence.



Regrettably, unless they tell you directly or self-incriminate during the interview, there's no way to know without a formal registry.



How would you deal with this situation?  I'm terrified of having my child in the presence of a modern Feminist.

No, I would allow my child to be cared for by them and if something came up I disagreed with I would explain to my child that many people believe in different things.  As long as it is not harming others, it is okay.  I have no reason to believe modern feminists or most other groups of people are any more or less likely to abuse my child.  If it was going on with anyone...I'd raise Hell.  I also have no reason to brain wash my child.  I intend to allow them to develop their own views and beliefs...again, as long as it does not harm others.

Not that the daughter would probably listen, but I'd definitely make it known that it's a little creepy...even if it is in a joking manner with her.  I mean, consider he's old enough to be her father and that an 18 year old woman does not have the maturity yet (in most cases) to give a 40 year old what he wants and needs and trust me...eventually she WILL move on...to have more fun and to someone younger trust me.



Actually, when I was 19,  I was dating a 35 year old.  He was gorgeous and I thought he was THE world.  He thought I was an immature female who was just fun to get drunk and spend the night at her house because she was pretty.  He cheated on me with an older woman, I caught them, it was over quickly.  Really funny story actually.  Even though my parents knew about it, my dad didn't tell me until after we split that he thought the guy was weird for wanting to date me when he was closer in age to him.  He said he wished he would have said something to me and he could have saved me from the heartache.  So yeah, I'd tell her.

Yes 18's legal../but I would seriously wonder what a 40 year old would be doing with an 18 year old considering as you go through life you do change. Of course it depends on the person, you can get 40 year olds that look and seem so much younger but I think that is too wide.



When you get older the age gap doesn't matter, but at that tender age compared with someone that's 40 and gone through about 25 years of relaionships and experiences, the gap is vast.

It is the legal age but why would even want to date someone that old?  I can see if he was like in his 20's at least but someone that old wouldn't seem to me like a 20 year old dating a 70 year old guy. Can't you just look for someone closer to your age?

I'd be fine with it. A man's age wouldn't matter at all, I'd be more interested in the way he treats her and how comfortable she feels with him. I've always dated older men, and I've found that they're more loyal and caring than younger men who are more focused on sex and their own needs. People mature at different ages, and you can't help who you fall in love with.



Anyway, at 18 she's legally an adult, so even if I wasn't happy with who she chooses to date there isn't much I could do about it, apart from talk to her.

When I was 18 I didn't want to date a guy who was 40.  Yuck.  My parents wouldn't like that either.  As long as I lived under their roof, I wouldn't be allowed to date him.  As long as I had a brain, I wouldn't have moved out of a place where I got everything for free just so I could be with a guy they didn't like.  He'd have to be one heck of a guy to make me choose him over my family.  And to me, a guy who is 40 and can't find anyone his own age... is one heck of a pathetic guy.

What would a 40 yr old man have in common with a 18 yr old KID? My problem would be that the man has issues just because he can't get anyone his own age, so he has to prey upon younger girls, how sick!  Yeah, Yeah men go through this mid life crisis  and they want to feel younger or do more "younger" things but in all reality it never works.  Men look so stupid with young girls, it's just not the right thing to do, even if 18 is the legal age.  Plus, if you're 40, then your old enough to have children her age, so in all... wouldn't it feel like you a sleeping or dating your own child? That's just gross!

It is easier to answer when you don't have a daughter. So, don't hold much sense to what I have to say, but here it is anyway. I would think it would be more about the character of the man regardless of his age. Society expects a man at that age to be mature, respectful, and have retirement saved, as well as, have some self respect for himself enough to treat the daughter right. If those were all there then sure, but if not, then I would question it and maybe try to run a background check and have him followed by a PI or something. You know, the usual parent stuff for any guy at any age.

Wow.  That's a big age difference.  But you know, at 18 I really wouldn't have any say over my daughter's sex life.  Legally she's an adult and she's going to do what she's going to do.  Would I be concerned?  Sure.  I certainly would get to know the 40-year-old man in question and monitor the situation.  Getting all high and mighty and forbidding her to see the guy and such drama would be a mistake.  This is a delicate situation, and I certainly wouldn't want to alienate my daughter.

Ask your daughter where she sees this going.  More than twice her age is quite a gap. Ask her what they have in common. Maybe she'll get tired of him "teaching" her all the time whether she needs his input or not.  I dated an older guy for a while and got sick of it when I noticed how many negative opinions he had on simple things like the color of an accessory I was wearing. Then I noticed how he would sit back and watch me having a good time, rather than joining in.  Maybe he was too tired?



Have you mentioned he may have children older than her and ask her why middle aged men are so obsessed with being with women as young as possible. Is it that they think it makes them look younger or more virile to have a woman half their age with them? I think it makes them look older in comparison and pathetic that they can't handle a woman with life experiences even close to where they are.  I think it is some sort of psychological problem.  I mean really aren't you closer to his age?

We can trust feminists to define what an ideal man is to them. Feminists have every right to dream being married to a fit carreer man, that besides having his high stake powered super money career to buy her luxuries with, still has enough spare time to do the housework and child rearing to enable her doing whatever you do with a womens studies degree. Just like the male plumber can dream to be married to that millionaire supermodel.

Gentlemen, if you were in a hiring position and the candidate's resume...?



Revealed that one of the organizations with which the candidate is affiliated is a modern Feminist organization would you consider interviewing this candidate?



If a CV or resume serves as the basis for determining whether a candidate is suitable, there's a lot of subjectivity in deciding if you'd like to interview them.



If the candidate indicates that the candidate is a member of an unsavory organization like the KKK or a modern Feminist organization which I find makes the candidate unsuitable for the job, I believe that I'm entitled to take this into consideration and throw the resume in the trash bin or "keep it on file" as they say, (this doesn't represent gender discrimination).



Would you also be reluctant to interview a candidate that is a member of an unsavory organization like the KKK, Aryan Nation or a Feminist organization?

The candidate's resume likely wouldn't reveal anything like that. It's standard to keep political affiliations private. If I found out that they were part of an organization that was registered as a hate group, I would not hire them. If it was an organization I disagreed with but didn't consider dangerous, it would be the least of my concerns.

Since "feminism" is so etymologically similar to "dwarfism" or "gigantism"...?



why doesn't feminism actually mean "the condition of being feminine"? Why does it actually mean the opposite (i.e. the feminine adopting masculine attributes)? An "ism" is a doctrine governing the word before it, and the word before "ism" is "feminine". Is this just more proof that "feminists" (or should they be called "masculinists") have no idea what they're talking about?

Inquirin:



"Anti-choice folks such as yourself seem to think there is some type of abortion party going on, that little sluts are out there spreading their legs getting pregnant and then aborting."



There is a contradiction here: if an embryo or fetus were similar to sperma, then they could be killed only to have some enjoyment.



Nobody would want to punish as a murderer a boy who uses to masturbate himself, because sperm is not human beings.



You are revealing your moral doubts when you use justifications such as "rape, incest, quality of life of the baby", etc., etc.



Inquirin:



A woman has not a total right on her body. If you decide to use your hands to press the throat of another woman to kill her and steal her money, you will go to jail because of the wrong use of your body. Why if you use your womb as an electric chair or as a scaffold to kill a baby, should not you be punished at all, but only receive counseling?



Inquiry:



Science has demonstrated that life does not begin when a baby is delivered. An evolved law should be based on sience, not on religion. Current law is based on religious facts:



. It exists a soul that penetrates with the first air breathing



. A woman is not a female primate with parental duties towards her offspring, but a "godness" who creates life



. A womb is not only a viscus, but a sacred temple where the "godness" decides if her "creation" lives or dies

"When the fetal baby is killed, it is being favored, because it is difficult to live in this world"



A) That is a bunch of bull crap. Yes, it is hard, but not being loved enough that your own mother would kill you is harder.



"A mother who has killed her embryonic or fetal baby should not be punished because she needs counseling"
A) You bet! Anyone who wants to kill the living person growing inside them needs counseling. The same goes for the people who kill babies for a living. I take that back, they need to be put in prison.

I think that abortion is the murder of a person. Almost fifty million in the U.S. since Roe vs. Wade. People say a 'fetus' is not a person, but if you look at pictures and stuff, they even have little fingernails at like, six weeks. It's sanctioned murder.

I have to disagree with you fundamentally because I do not think of fetuses as babies in that babies are persons and fetuses are not yet persons.  Murder applies to actual persons.



Babies who are brought into the world unwanted are harmed. They are shuffled around to foster homes, they suffer psychologically, they are exceedingly lucky if they are adopted.  Sometimes they are physcially abused and murdered.  They are impoverished.



Anti-choice folks such as yourself seem to think there is some type of abortion party going on, that little sluts are out there spreading their legs getting pregnant and then aborting.  But you forget about the complicated circumstances surrounding abortions such as health, rape and incest.



Many of you also seem to disfavor the very things that allow women to avoid abortion such as comprehensive sex education and birth control such as the morning after pill.  Most of all, you forget that women a persons who have the fundamental human right to make decisions about her own body - whether she's gestating a fetus or not.



You also forget that many reasonable people, even some religious people, do not believe life begins at conception - and people have disagreed about this through the ages.  Abortion should remain legal and accessible and fanatics like you should stop trying to push your religious and/or philosophical beliefs down other people's throats.



Lastly, if you care so much about babies do something to help the many children here and around the world who live in poverty and are being abused.  Because you're right.  Children are being harmed, but not by abortion.

No doubt.  Abortionists and modern Feminists enjoy the opportunity to kill the unborn child as an extension of irresponsible behaviour.  This was never the intention of protecting one's rights, i.e. it wasn't about advancing systematic use of abortion because people behave stupidly.  No matter the circumstance, abortion is killing of the unborn (the rest is semantic crap).  It should only boil down to where those with a degree of integrity believe that killing is justifiable, nothing more.  In cases of rape/incest it's killing but a necessary evil, imho.  In terms of abortion as an extension of irresponsible birth control when a lady gets 5 TOPs over 2 years, that's ridiculous and I don't wanna hear how the pill is "ineffective," that's rubbish, we know this from primate trials.



To criminalize abortions won't reduce mortality so botched Abs will be performed by butchers and not a whole lot of good will come from it, so from that perspective we have a duty as a society to keep this a matter between a lady and her MD.



The ultimate authority isn't necessarily secular law when it comes to doling out punishment.  That's between a higher authority, the physician and the lady, and I'm not privy to these proceedings.

Now wait just one minute. As terrible as this sounds, what makes you think I want to pay for the mistakes of a foolish **** for opening her legs irresponsibly in the first place? The welfare system is overloaded with just this kind of a problem. She makes a mistake and I have to pay? Suddenly we are promoting that this woman does not have to be responsible for her actions? You don't think that forcing a woman to have an unwanted baby is actually going to MAKE her responsible do you? People in this situation don't always just have one baby and stop. If they knew how to have sex responsibly, they never would have been in this situation in the first place, right? (I am not taking about sexual victims in this circumstance. I am talking about those who use abortion just because they don't want to have their lust child).



I am going out on a limb and sounding a bit like a devil here. This sounds terrible I know, but I want to know what the asker is suggesting I do to take care of all these unwanted children. Currently people are going hungry, not receiving adequate health care, and losing their homes. I just don't see how the answer on the big picture is by forcing life that I am somehow now responsible for despite having nothing to do with creating it.

</question from>



<question>



Why do parents who are into moral values, only worry more about their daughters? ?



and freed their son for almost 100%?



ok for example, when it comes to:



1. dating.
people tend to worry more about their daughter with the reason --- "girls get pregnant". (e.g.) my Iranian lecturer told that in her country, girls are not allowed to have boyfriend, but guys can have girlfriend.



------why do they only concern about the consequences that their daughter might get pregnant outside of marriage, but never concern if their son might impregnate some other people's daughter?



i believe that this isn't just in Iran, but could be everywhere. and this has ended up the girls to be constrained without the boys being treated the same way. parents should have constrained both (if they do really look forward on a well life and society), or else it's unfair.



2. going out at late night
most parents only worry about their daughter doing so since their girls might get involved with wild-nightout people and dangerous men.



----but why musn't them worry at all about their sons, not even about what their sons can do outside at late night, while it's actually easier for boys to get influence with gangsterism and drugs (compared to girls) ? plus, it will keep the boys loitering while they should have sleep or at least studying. this would affect their performance, and this is actually the thing that can make the boys to be more useless than girls. in the end, more boys will dig the girls' golds.



3. incapable of cooking and doing housechores
it's like a disgrace when girls can't cook well. they say "don't be a woman if you can't cook" (wt...?). also the stereotype that "girls place are in kitchen". it's ok if they say that when the boys are in wars, but why is it still the same even when the boys are on couch?



there are multiple questions here, actually. but the point is, why can't parents treat both sons and daughter at least a little more equally, since daughters are too constrained while the boys are too freed? i know that it has something to do with boys can take care of themselves thing. however, although their sons might be male, they are kids too, so they're young yet immatured that they can always do stupid and disgraceful things. but why do these parents don't seem to have any thoughts about that?



</question>



<additional details>



i respect strict parents too. in fact, it's them that makes better of the world. but why must all the rules carried by the girls and left nothing for the boys? at least a little for them would do.



yeah, boys can always be a threat to girls that we tend to keep them inside at late night. but aren't (bad) boys also make a big threat to other boys? especially in spreading bad influences (like; drugs, prostitutes, screw other girls etc.)?

1)  If you're a feminist you probably believe that men are absolved of all parental responsibility since they're all "lazy, uninvolved parents" and you don't acknowledge that men have to pay child support.



2)  If you're a feminist you probably believe that men are threats so it's more dangerous for girls to be out late at night around boys or men.



3)  If you're a feminist you place boys and men laying "on the couch" but not out earning a living.

To answer the main question, it's all about getting pregnant.



The other stuff is about an abdication of your duties as a parent to teach, guide and protect all of your children. Everyone should know how to cook and clean. Those stereotypes go out the window these days.  Some people can do certain tasks better than others and it has nothing to do with gender.

I wondered the same thing when I was dating my husband. My dad was so strict. I wasn't allowed to ride alone with my boyfriend(at first....this changed after a while), I had to be home 11:30 sharp(even when we were engaged), I couldn't wear revealing clothes, I couldn't be alone with him in a house, etc. I thought he was so mean until I got married to my husband and I asked him something about when we were dating. This was my husband's reply: "Oh, yeah! That was hot....I was looking down your shirt the entire time!" I then realized my dad was right and even good Christian boys have horrible thoughts. I have so much more respect for strict fathers now.

The wage gap is due to women choices not discrimative. Why dont the lawmaker "Obama" understand this?



Yes you might have the same years of experience, and degree. But that doesn't mean your going to get or deserve the same amount of money as everybody else.Simmer down people.... Keep reading :P



Most people and 99% of lawmaker politician don't consider reliability, who works more hours, and negotiating your pay ( Which men do more). When women have children they work less hours, and aren't as reliable because there are more commitment to the baby/family than work. Unlike career guys who work work work and eat and work to provide for future or present family. Truth. Cause a company thats into saving cash and making money rarely just comes by your office and hands you a nice pay raise. You have to ask for it, thats business...dont be a passive hardworking pushover!!!!



Not all men get paid the same doing the same job with the same degree. Do women really think that ?  If you disagree and seriously think the wage gap is solely based on gender discrimination your a complete asshole!!!! What do yall think ?



PS: Could someone other than me tell Democrats to shut up about the wage gap/ equal pay for equal work. I mean so working hard ends after college...why work hard on ya job if your getting paid the same as the hardest working co-worker on the first day of work. Hmmm there something wrong with that dont you think ?

Tracie there as obviously more women dropping out of the workplace(temp or permanent), more men working FT plus OT than women( yes women do work OT to and all that but not nearly as much as men thus there is a wage gap).

I think you need to meet some better women. It sounds like those you choose to connect with are needy, unmotivated, non workers expecting a handout. I really think your question is a reflection of just those woman you have surrounded yourself with. There are over 2 billion women on the planet, surely you do not presume to know what all of them choose to do with their time or how hard they choose to work? (not to mention those that are not allowed to choose work or education at all, how do explain their "wage earning" gap?)



I guess, according to your infinite wisdom, I am just another asshole. Thank you so much for helping me to open my eyes and see the world as you would have it be. I wonder where I would be with out your deep intellectual scope.

<question>



Why do women seem to feel "equality" is a right?



Throughout time, countless millions and millions of people have pledged and lost their lives fighting for their freedoms and equality with others. Why do women seem to think "equality" is something that they are privileged to, or they are owed? Blood is shed to get equality. Since when do people simply 'ask' for equality and have it granted? When has that ever - in the history of the civilized(and uncivilized) world- happened?



Why do women seem to feel equality is such an easy ideal to obtain? -that they can wake up one day and start voicing their opinions and men would acquiesce?



... Or are they simply hoping men to be more altruistic and amicable in dealing with women than they have been in dealing with men over the issue of freedom/equality? That men would in a sense 'take it easy' on women and not force them to shed blood for it?



</question>



<additional details>



___
The reality is that women benefit tremendously from being born in a democratic, morally sensitive society- where men are actually open to simple discussion about the topic.



Men have never had the luxury of simply "asking" for equality. How ridiculous an idea is that? - not too ridiculous for a woman I expect.

Because human rights are guaranteed in free countries and...(sit down this might shock you)...women are humans.

Yeah, I don't know why they don't force us women to earn those rights like they forced the Blacks many years ago, and like they forced the Indians. There is nothing equal in giving us women a free ride because we can produce kids. What is wrong with this world?

You don't seem to realize that women have been fighting for equality for centuries. From Seneca Falls to the Suffragettes to the movements in the sixties and eigthies, women have been fighting. They fought for the right to vote and won it, fought for the right to equal treatment are still do, and they fought for crimes against women to be taken seriously. You don't think the women who have suffered through domestic abuse and rape in silence over the years have suffered, have been spared blood shed? Women have been fighting for years, and still carry that fight on today.



Not to mention that these wars you speak of, these fights for freedom and equality…women fought them too. As nurses in the battlefield, as workers in weapons factories at home, and more recently as soldiers in these battles. Women have no delusions that they have to fight for their rights, they've been fighting all these years. Women are still fighting for their rights.



How have you missed it?

Women and Men of GWS can I hide here?



It all started innocently enough, I got bored over at R&S so I went to Parenting and asked if anyone like me hated Dr. Seuss and thought his books were stupid and made the kids stupid...



I took off out of the section when I realized that a bunch of outraged Yuppie parents with spoiled Toddlers were forming a lynch mob and they were looking for me... I asked  for someone to hide me out in R&S but one of them found me there so I came here.  Can I hide out with you all?



Boy I thought the Fundy Christians were bad but they don't hold a candle to outraged Dr. Seuss lovers....

SURE! You can hide under my table with me. I am hiding from the Radical Feminists trying to dress me up like a dike and put me behind a desk. I feel for you. I went over there as a dare and asked why I couldn't drink while pregnant. I was torn apart by hormonal pregomonsters. Needless to say, I came back like a whipped puppy to hide under my table once again.

this is the single most abusive category you could go to
its a war zone, with all the reporting that goes on, and account suspending,  and the petty thumbing down ..



frankly, if you go anywhere near feminism, politics, or religion, on Y/A, youre volunteering for a stressful experience



I recommend you click on "entertainment and music"...and then sub category "polls and surveys"...there you'll find people who just tell jokes

and um...stay away from expressing opinions AGAINST anything..because thats when youll get a troll up your butt and your account gone



it's just not worth arguing here...but if you CAN resist the urge to have a say every time you feel repulsed(!),  the reading is worthwhile..you can pick up a lot about what feminism is currently, and what all the different types of take on it are (and there are a few)



oh and the perverts and ALF show lovers are just here for entertainment purposes only..including the guy who just wants to be kicked in the groinal region

I am relieved to hear that I am not the only person who finds Dr Seuss unutterably tedious.  I think his books are lame and the pictures are hideous.  But I don't give a damn if people get annoyed by anything I say.  In fact, I enjoy stirring people up.  I think I will pop over to parenting and have a go at them.

I was a troll long ago over in R&S during a Christian moronic delirium tremen of some kind they were having about the "rapture" about to happen and Muslims from the Middle East were a force and mullahs or teachers were using this site for their classes and the Christian freaks were so SHOCKED that "foreigners" DARED to presumed equal status on this AMERICAN MISSIONARY POSITION site and they were screeching that atheists had to LEAVE this country and oh gosh it was fun pulling their chicken feathers.  Every time, though, that the lynch mobs come after me, there seems to something more fascinating to participate in elsewhere. . . like IMMIGRATION during the "border" wars and the MINUTEMEN and . . . . elections are cool, too.  Lynch mobs are fun.  You stay here and I'll thumbs down anyone who bothers you, OK?  Parents over in the parenting sites are PHYCHOS, though.  You're on your own with them.  The dog people are freaks, too, over in some pet category. OH! The VEGANS!!!!  THEY are a trip.  I LOVE to troll over there talking about yummy fried little bird arms and posting recipes for blood soup.  : )

Mangled up in tangled up knots.

Well I tick people off (usually unmarried welfare moms) over in pregnancy and parenting when I tell them "their gifts from God" aren't free, and to get a job so I don't have to support them.



If you really want to cause an uproar go over to cats and ask them the name of a good vet in your area to de-claw your cats!



I got lots of hate email telling me that I am a horrible person and should not be allowed to own cats.



To get along here:



1. If you post any type of reasoned intelligent response to doodles you will be blocked.



Do not ask for credible sources!



2. Do not answer any question that asks about your views on abortion, if you are pro-choice.



You will be called a baby killer and told your own children should be killed.
3.  If you declare you are a feminist - you immediately lose your looks, become a lesbian, and must wear flannel the remainder of your life.  You also hate men- even if you have sons and a loving spouse/SO.



4.  Pretend VAWA is a new vegetable.

Do be yourself (though be respectful and restrained until you find out what works) and don't try to be someone else (think for yourself).  Do try to make the other person happy and don't just think about what you want out of it.  Humour is always a good way to break the ice.

If she's a lady, be chivalrous, relax and treat her like one.



If she's a feminist, NO chivalry.  No opening doors, offering to pay for her, helping with coats, buying flowers, or anything you wouldn't do for a man.  Do not touch her, ever.



DO talk about the wage gap, the patriarchy, abortion (you better be pro-abortion), and violence against women.

Do feminists want to negate my right to negotiate a higher pay for equal work ?



Say a woman applies for a position as programmer. She negotiates a salary of 2800. I apply next, with the same degree the same experience and the same skills, because he needs 2 of us. I tell him 6000 or bust, because I don't see why I should work my butt off for projects that earn him hundreds of thousands and settle for chump change.
He wails, but in the end agrees, because it aint like he can go and pick a programmer out of a soup line.



What should happen according to the feminists ?



- nothing everybody works for what she/he signed up for



- Her salary should be upped to match mine



- both our salaries should be averaged so both earn the same



- something else ??

I agree that men are regarded with suspicion, I disagree that it's fair. A while ago I remember walking down the street with a hoody on, a group of girls were coming in my direction. As soon as they saw me they crossed the road. Most guys avoid children altogether, I take holiday programmes at the moment, one of the activities involves tying medals around the necks of 7 year olds. I have to be extremely careful not to accidently touch them while doing this - which is pretty difficult I assure you - or risk being held under suspicion by the women around me. Is it much wonder that men avoid teaching in primary schools?



Just look at how easy it is to falsely accuse men of child abuse, voilence and rape. Things like VAWA and Harman's bill which is going to be introduced soon; these both are products of mistrust towards men.

Hell yes.  I'm a man, and we are a very suspicious lot.  We are protectors or villians, and you can't always tell who is who.  Men are capable of some very nasty things, so don't worry about profiling them (that IS what you are doing).  It is a very reasonable prejudice to have.

It is unfair, and it's exactly the same as racial profiling and is the product of modern Feminism in its attempt to convey (in as subtle a way as possible) that all men are inherently rapists, and do not have brains and somehow use testosterone (a molecule which has zero function without a receptor for cognition)  or they suggest that men somehow can only use their penis to think rather than their brain (again this stands in contradistinction to about a century worth of neuroscience which has never associated the glans with any capacity to think) and not much more.  Modern Feminists like to joke about these things as if they are just metaphors and speak about castration or mutilation of male organs rather flippantly, but men don't do this.  And the irony is that these same brilliant modern Feminists complain that men's humour is somehow "juvenile."  If men's humour is regarded as toilet humour, then modern Feminist humour is more like cannibal humour.



Modern Feminists claim not to hate men but in the same breath make juvenile jokes and metaphors which marginalize men and boys and distort physiology in their attempt to suggest that men are incapable of thought.  Modern Feminists do, indeed, hate men, this is hardly a matter that merits discussion.

Yes its similar to racial profiling, but more prevalent and less recognised as wrong. I can see how it would be difficult for some women not to feel that way. I think it is because for the persistent demonising of men and the publishing of false and doctored statistics relating to rape and domestic violence.



If you grow up hearing that all men are inherent bullies or potential rapists and child molesters, its bound to have an effect on the way you feel about men.



Its important to try to remember that all this stuff is propaganda, men are blamed and demonised in the same way Jews were blamed for everything that is wrong in the world in Nazi Germany. Same tactics.



It wouldn't be such a worry if legislation didn't reflect these lies, but it does, VAWA etc.



This is why we should be monitoring feminist groups and keeping feminists out of positions in the social services, education, law and government.

What would you think of her?



A young woman you work with has really bad asthma and was taken to the hospital for it earlier this year. But she's pretty shy and soft-spoken so she doesn't talk about it unless someone wants to check up on her. Occasionally while she's quietly working, you will hear her cough a lot, sometimes with a loud wheeze. When she came in the other day, she mentioned how she had a rough night. She said an attack hit after midnight, she didn't go to sleep until 1AM and then was up every few hours in the middle of the night. When she was at work, she seemed tired, but throughout the day functioned pretty normally and seemed her quiet, hard-working, smiley self.

I think that she's not either not complying with her asthma medications or is not being treated properly.  I would implore that she immediately see a proper physician (if she's not being treated properly) and be placed on something like Advair or some combination of corticosteroid plus a beta agonist, e.g. salmeterol or and always have a rescue inhaler of albuterol present.



The public may not see this but when asthma goes untreated and a young patient arrives at the hospital already cyanotic, all the neubulizer treaments & epi in the world won't help, these patients die.  I've had to watch children die because they weren't being adequately treated for asthma.  My concern would be for her health first and foremost.

Why do women raise their arms in the air and expose their crusty armpits(when sleeveless) in the face of a hot?



Why do women raise their arms in the air so much and expose their crusty armpits(when sleeveless) in the face of a hot guy. I am a somewhat hot guy and one thing that I noticed is that when a lot of women are digging on you they'll constantly be raising both of their arms in the air and putting their hands behind their head, and exposing their stank pits. Does it have anything to do with the pheromones that humans release from their underarms that signel sexual desire. And this is not preening cuz I've seen preening(playing with yer hair) too. Another thing that I have noticed is that some girls like to ball their left hand into a fist and put it by their waist while simultaneously raising their right hand in the air(kinda like they do at male strip joints) around a hot guy. I had a cashier at a grocery store do that to me one time right in the open and it looked kind of bizarre. Anyways, any help would be appreciated.

Maybe they do that 'cos they're sweating, 'cos they're nervous.
Maybe they should use a better deodorant and take care of themselves if their armpits are actually 'crusty'.



And, i'm not gonna be mean to you, 'cos if a guy or girl was 'revealing' 'crusty' armpits at me while twisting into a tarded shape, i would be quite revolted.

What would be the preferred method?



I have seen many polls here suggesting castration/penectomy for pedophiles/rapists.



Without reopening the whole issue of whether this would be a successful way of preventing such crimes, let's assume that this punishment is now in use.



So, what would be the most suitable method of castration/penectomy with which to punish pedophiles and rapists?

I don't think castration would work because it's still in the mind, the desire is still there. And if they ar frustrated they will do other things. Also a lot about rape isn't just sex, it's the power etc.



I think they should just be killed.

Not true feminism.  Feminism in its purest form believes that women deserve the same opportunities to succeed that men have - no special handouts, no degradation, just equal *opportunity*.



Some women try to take advantage of it, insisting that they be given special privileges, but this isn't feminism.

I think that he crossed the boundary. A boy should not hurt or threaten a girl. It is a boy's duty to protect his girlfriend no matter what. I think that what you have experienced is enough to know what is his true nature. If a person loves you, he will never hurt you in anyway. Either by words or by action. But it's just my opinion. It all depends on you. But for me, find someone who will never hurt and will take care and protect you always. Just stay safe.

No way - you get out while you can - preferably when he's not looking & where he can't find you. Go to a friend's house - one he doesn't know. Pack a bag, take a mobile & charger & a radio, etc. A laptop if you've got one. Call the cops or get legal help http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/ - so you know where you stand if he comes after you.

There are many times in a relationship where one partner gets angry with the other, but there is never an excuse for violence and never an excuse to threaten to rape someone! You need to dump him immediately and tell him that if he ever contacts you again you'll call the police. And then follow through on the threat.

No. There should NEVER be domestic violence in a relationship, and if any occurs (as it has with you), the best idea is to bring the relationship to a stop. No, it won't be easy. No, it won't feel good. But it's better than the alternative...as thousands of people across the world are proving every day.

Has there ever been statistics released on male victims of rape by a female perpetrator ?

<additional details>



if so could you please provide links?



Hi Blackburner -



"Non statutory female on male rape is widely, but incorrectly, considered impossible because male erectile response is seen as voluntary, when, in fact, it is involuntary. Fear, anger, anxiety, and non-arousal have been cited as factors in being unable to obtain an erection. Therefore, male victims of rape by females often face social, political, and legal double standards. Female rapists are usually seen as less culpable than male rapists by the courts due to these misunderstandings. Those who do not understand the law in many jurisdictions fail to realize that the penetration of a male by a foreign object or a digit also constitutes the same crime. Since rape by females is much less well known than male-female rape, male victims of female rapists often find little support from rape crisis centers."

Sexual arousal does not equal consent.  If a woman has sex with a man who is very drunk, that is rape, just like if the roles were reversed.

Jackson Katz says that 99.8% of people convicted of rape in prison are male:



http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3exzMPT4nG...



That would put femle perpetrated rape at 0.2%, but of course if there is really such a taboo about male victims of rape perpetrated by women, then the stats of successful conviction rates won't reveal it.



My guess is that female on male rape is so rare, that it would be a waste of resources to fund special rape crisis centres for them- it would require paying for staff who would have very little to do, especially when (in the uk at least ) funding is already being taken away from rape crisis centres for women. In London there is only one rape crisis centre - well- its in Croydon - which is very far south of London - no where near the centre.



I've had male friends confess to me that they've been raped by men, female friends confess that they've been raped by men (only 1 has reported it to the police), but never been told of a male friend raped by a woman. I have assessed that a female friend of mine sexually assaulted another woman, which she denies, but the way she explained events, it definately seemed that way, so I also wonder if in that 0.2% rape stat of Jackson Katz whether that includes female upon female assault.



To state it plainly, a man is far more likely to be a victim of rape by another man than by a women. However, I do not think we should trivialise it, because rape is about power, violence, violation, humiliation,etc. If we look to the Gulf War pics with Lindy England mockng the prisoners who they had obviously forced to arouse themselves, its clear that this physiological response can occur in terrifying, humiliating circumstances.

Unless you have more than 2 babies, how is being a SAHM hard work ?



Why cook everyday when you can cook 2 nights a week and have food for the whole week ? Why not discipline your kids so that they clean their own room and do chores around the house ? Why not have your husband help out around the house a little when he comes home ? Does your whole house get dirty everyday...really ? I think that MOST sahm's are making it to hard on themselves. And try to do everything. Which is why they think being a SAHM is harder than most regular salary job. Oh please shutup, try working in the rat race and raising a kid. SAHM hardwork my ***(Only if you make it to be). You get to stay home, be with your kid 24/7, free food, free transportation, free home/stay, your office is the sofa , escape from the rat race, and many more positives. And you wanna tell others this is a harder work. What do y'all think ?

Hahaha, just because a SAHM does not have more than two babies, does not mean she dont have one giant kid to pick up after..
It may not be hard, but ive grown up around plenty of females.



From what  I see, most stay at home moms do all the arrond running.. grocery shopping, buying stamps and mailing out the bills, picking up modge podge to cover up the nail holes.. all while dragging along her 2 year old who she has to constantly worry about feeding and changing and satisfying, plus worrying about her 6 year old who has to be enrolled in soccer in four days.



Really, as a young guy, I give some stay at home moms mad props.. while other, like ones I know, that just sit up stairs and smoke pot while their kids sit in front of the brainwaswhing screen.. no props...

Well, I have never been a mother at all, but I hold a great deal of respect for those who are. It looks like extremely hard work.



And how can you discipline a baby to clean its own room and do chores? Your question states that you are talking about babies, but you fail to realise that a baby is a lot of hard work. Cleaning the baby, feeding, playing with, socialising, changing...



Not everyone has a husband who can help them around the house either - maybe he works long late hours and is exhausted. If you are going to be a stay-at-home-mother, you are accepting the responsibility for the majority of housework as well as childcare. If both parents work, of course they should share the chores, but if only the man works, why should he have to do chores as well? That's unfair.



"You get to stay home, be with your kid 24/7, free food, free transportation, free home/stay, your office is the sofa , escape from the rat race, and many more positives" - you really are looking down on these women as if they were lazy or something. There's nothing lazy about cleaning and cooking and of all the mothers I know, not one spends all day on the sofa. Nor is anything "free". If you are married or co-habiting, you have accepted that you are together, you are working together as a team. That means sharing and accepting that what is one partner's also belongs to the other person. She isn't scrounging off her partner, her partner is sharing with her and what's his is her's and vice versa - you don't understand the nature of relationships.



I think from the tone of your question that you resent having to work and you resent that other women are free to spend more time with their children.

I don't find being a housewife particularly hard, but I think some women work harder at it than I do.



However, I don't see how you can cook 2 nights a week only.  do you mean you should freeze a lot of stuff?  We haven't got a big enough freezer for that, and in any case I don't think my husband would care to eat frozen food every night.



As far as getting children to help with chores goes, I have never managed to get my sons to do that, but I suppose there are some women who can manage it.



I don't clean the whole house every day, as I find housework quite boring, I just do a bit of the house every day.



It is a lot easier when the children are at school, as you have several hours a day to do everything in peace.



However, if you have two children under school age (as I did for a while) then it is VERY tiring.  Looking after very small children is exhuasting, and two at once can wear you out very quickly.  It doesn't have to be more than two to exhaust you.



However, I certainly don't think it is harder work than being in a regular job, and that as far as I am concerned is one of the advantages. If I fel that I worked harder than a person who is out at work all day then it would have a lot less appeal to me.



I think the reason modern housewives tend to go on and on and on about how hard they work is that nowadays we are all supposed to WANT to work really hard all the time.  endless toil is supposed to be the goal of all of us.  The days when those who had least work to do were considered the most fortunate are long gone.  Nowadays, you are supposed to want to work all the time, without ceasing, and if you don;'t you are considered somewhat peculiar. I think this is why housewives have a tendency to insist on the hardness of their lives.  They've got to prove that they are toiling all day just like everyone is supposed to nowadays.

Yeah, the reason  you think it's easy is because you don't see many SAHM's complaining in this section.  It's the career women who think doing dishes or folding laundry is such a difficult task. Snit, they need to discuss it at great length as if it's the dishes are the biggest obstacle in their lives.  Hopefully these gals will see your tips  since they seem to struggle with it so much.

Cooking 2 nights a week? We don't like eating the same meal for 3 or 4 days in a row. If you do, fine. Go for it. I don't. I like something different. Cooking's not hard. I don't mind doing it daily.



Free food? LOL um, someone pays good money for all the food we eat! What, you think we steal our food from the grocery store every week? LOL Ditto with transportation and "home/stay". It's called insurance, rent, and bills. We pay those too. Get a clue. And my office isn't the sofa. I actually *work* all day. I clean. I cook. I homeschool my 2 kids. I sell Avon on the side. I'm involved with my church. Not work.....whatever.



Being a SAHM is work. I get so darn tired of people slamming what I do and saying it isn't much work, I'm lazy, blah blah blah, you work harder because you have a job so therefore you're better than me, blah blah blah. Whatever, sweetie. This kind of crap doesn't do a thing to help anybody - all it does is generate more bad feelings on both sides.



This is why I say that women are our own worst enemies. I have never, ever had a man talk about SAHMs the way you just did. Men are supportive. Men realize how hard their at-home wives work. Men value and appreciate us. Too bad if you can't or won't see the importance of our job. We know better.

Why does a guy have to play "prince charming" to get a one night stand?



Why do guys have to play "prince charming" to get girls to bed?
My friend Kim (20) told me what she had experienced at a gig two months ago. She had met this guy there and he asked her out after the gig. She told me that they exchanged interests and got to know each other. She thought they had good chemistry. Two hours later (that night) they kissed. Kim told me he was romantic and everything. He held her hand, stroked her, bought her a drink etc. They weren't drunk and they only drank 1 or 2 beer each. She told me he confused her very much. He played on the "prince charming" image and he still said she reminded him of a porn star. And they still held an intelligent conversation. Kim told me that he suggested that they should go into a toilet! (and presumably have sex). She said that she was unsure about what he wanted. She isn't a "gatekeeper" and she doesn't see anything wrong with one night stands, sex on the first date etc. She doesn't like the socially accepted fact that girls have to play it hard and be "gatekeerpers". She isn't guilty about anything but she is very sad because she felt this guy was an interesting person who had much in common with her. She told me they could just be friends and nothing more. She was disappointed. This guy played on many things to get her attention: friendship, "prince charming tendency", romance, dirty talk, intelligent conversations and debates, getting to know her etc.
They didn't have sex but they made out and she told me she was looking forwards to seeing this guy again. She sent him SMS (2 times) and he didn't answer her. She gave up. Why did this guy bother getting to know her if he wasn't interested in nothing more than sex? Why did he act romantic? Why did he come with the intelligent debates? Why couldn't he rather have played dirty and lusty instead of tricking her into believing he wanted a relationship? Why couldn't he be honest. I think I would prefer a guy who said "I just want to have a one night stand" to a guy who showed interest in my personality and then wouldn't talk to me again. I think most people value honesty. Why couldn't he have been honest with her? This is in 2008 and a guy does not have to play "prince charming" to get a one night stand. He was indeed playing "prince confusing".
Fellow girls/women, can you always tell if a guy wants just sex or something more?



</question>



<additional details>



I find the "toilet" thing weird too. But she did make it clear that this guy was very confusing. He was first playing on getting to knowing her, then romance and then naughtiness+romance++++++++++



Kris W, she is not blaming anyone. It is not about blaming men. If a woman was using a man I would have reacted the same way. If a woman was playing interested in him only to get him into bed.

Well, I don't think there is anything wrong in one night stands either.  However, I do think if a man wants to have sex with a woman he should at least make himself agreeable to her.  And wanting to sleep with her doesn't preclude intelligent conversation, does it?  You can have both, can't you?



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Of course you can have both but this girl didn't hear a word from him later. They did not even become friends. Why waste time getting to know a person who is gonna forget you anyway? And he was confusing her. She didn't know what he wanted: sex, love, friendship?

This happened to a friend of mine as well - I think she went on about it for three weeks. Honestly I don't care. It's not a big deal to me, sometimes people use lines and tricks to get other people to do what they want them to. It happens all the time - and it just makes finally finding the real thing even more special.

because yes we do have to play prince charming just to get a one nighter. saying i just want a one nighter is a red flag for waste of time to girls. or maybe even this guy is dirty. who knows what ou think. i try my best to get to know everyone equally. weather im just looking for a one night stand or if im looking for a wife. i use the same approach and i use honesty to ensure that i never seem like a liar or a trickster. this guy might have been more drunk than this girl knows if hes willing to shack it up in a toilet. and why would a girl want a relationship with that kind of person anyway?

you can't always tell what a guy wants unless he is a rare person willing to be honest with himself and with you. You have to first decide what YOU want and then you can set boundaries for what you will put up with.

Generally speaking, very few women (and, to speak more broadly, very few people in general) are open to casual, semi-anonymous sex with recently-met partners, for good reason; there's a strong correlation between people who don't take to one-night-stands and people who don't have some version of the herpes virus.



But, for that reason, people who DO seek that sort of sex tend to recognize the need to put on costumes to 'broaden their market,' so to speak, or else meet with very rare success.  As a result, most people (male and female) seeking one-night-stands have a tendency to pretend not to be, and often a tendency to refuse to even admit to themselves what they're doing (most one-night-standers I know tend to describe their experiences as "being swept up in things" and "before-I-knew-it"s rather than calculated efforts to get their partners into bed).

That sucks. Not much else to say, your friend was looking for a one night stand thought she found more and ended up getting burned.



I personally disagree with the concept of a "one night stand" and those that attempt it and get burned I have little sympathy for them when they start crying or blaming men for this and that.



Maybe if people understood the concept of person responsibility things like this wouldn't happen.

He was probably just giving her what he thought she wanted.  Sometimes you get a certain vibe from a woman.  No sense playing the nice guy if she's looking for the bad boy and vice-versa.  Its not like he "tricked" her into bed.  He didn't get her wasted, she was of sound mind when she took her clothes off.  She did exactly what she wanted to do and it sounds like she enjoyed herself the whole time.  So why can't she leave it at that?



She obviously liked the guy, which if she didn't like him, then NO amount of "Prince Charming" would have charmed her pants off.

I have no idea why a guy would do that, personally, I agree that if he just wants sex, well then he should make it clear that's all that he's interested in.



And what's wrong with being a "gatekeeper" as you call it?  I'm sorry, but in my younger years, I had a couple one night stands and you know what--I hated every one of them and myself when it was over.  and only one of them was actually satisfying.  My own self, personally, I prefer sleeping with someone that I actually give a damn about.  Hate to say it, but if a girl were to sleep with a guy on a first date, or on the night they met...well, those are generally the girls (granted not always) that don't get called the next day or even later in the week.

Yes it's easy to tell if guys only want sex, but sometimes you just get so hopeful and entraced that you forget your instincts. I think guys have to put on the "prince charming" fasad just to peak girls' interests because most girls ARE the gateskeepers.

In some circumstances men are at a serious disadvantage.



For example, I work in an off-license. One of the guys who works there was sexually assaulted by a female customer (she grabbed his crotch and twisted) - and nothing was done about this. She wasn't even banned from the shop. Yet when a man made a crude suggestion to one of the girls I work with, he was escorted from the shop, told not to return and threatened with legal action. This is not fair. That's the main way I see a disadvantage for men in society today; because women are seen as victims and men as perpetrators for these crimes, and when it's the other way around, it's taken far less seriously. That's just one example.

Yes and no. On the one hand, pretty much everyone in the highest positions of power are men, so they still run things to a large extent. On the other hand, boys are disadvantaged all through school, less men are enrolling in college, and men are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to marriage and children (they get put through the ringer in divorce court, and women automatically get custody even if the father is the better parent). Domestic violence and rape are pretty much swept under the rug when a man is the victim. I could go on but you see the point, I'm sure.

There are no terms for that - you can be sexually active and not a **** or a player - I can't think of one single term that specifically means "sexually active" without meaning anything else as well eg. your examples both mean "sexually active with a wide variety of partners" which is definitely not the same thign as "sexually active".

Yes, the masculine is demonised in the feminist controlled education, social services and family related legal systems, but I don't believe it began at the birth of feminism. I agree with Mary McElroy......



"Genuine discussion of feminist issues ended in the 1970s when one school came to dominate and moved to silence competing views both within the movement and outside.



Politically correct feminists maintain that women as a class are politically oppressed by men as a class, which means that every woman is oppressed by every man. Class oppression is the ideological lens through which PC feminism views all issues."



Mary is taking about when feminism shifted from being a human rights movement to being a propaganda spreading hate group.

Depends on your definition of feminism.



I think true feminism is the belief that women are of equal status and value as men.  I'm impatient with women who think they can't do certain things because they are female, like car repair, or taking care of household issues, etc.



I think feminism has been subverted by some of the 'feminist' groups with a political or power agenda.



Any group that seeks to empower itself by tearing another group down or to have an advantage over another group by virtue of its identity is sick and twisted.



So, equal rights is cool.  Equal opportunity is great.  Affirmative action, quotas, or advantages based upon your demographics is evil and the opposite of equal opportunity.



The political feminists groups that get a lot of press and attention do seem to seek out the emasculation and ridicule of men.



My first wife (poor thing) was such a 'feminist.'  She really got into degrading humor that was just basically insults pointed at men.  She obviously felt that men were inferior to women and had no respect for them.



Without respect, you can not have a real marriage and eventually I left.



I admire women of strength, the true feminists who don't need to tear down others to feel good about themselves.

Why do girls wear makeup?



what is the point of wearing makeup. in my opinion i hate girls that wear makeup. whenever i see pics of celebrities with it on to me they look like clowns. or women in magazines too or basically any girl that wears it. i don't think they look attractive or beautiful at all when they wear it. they look fake even the smallest thing like eyeliner why do they have to wear it. why can't all women just not put anything on there face and be happy with how they naturally look. if girls claim that there beautiful and pretty then why do they have to put a bunch of **** on there face to be it. in my opinion girls just look ugly with it on or they look like clowns but i will NEVER say that a girl is beautiful or attractive when they have top put makeup on. so what is the point of wearing it. and if it's so guys would notice them then if they can't notice them with how they naturally look then there not worth going out with.

The reason why many women wear makeup is because a woman's look matters much more in society than a man's look. It's sick. For the ones ruling our society (media) women are nothing without their beauty while men are nothing without their brains (or wallets).



And it is socially expected that a woman should wear makeup, shave etc but it is considered stupid if a man does the same thing. I think many women use makeup like a drug. They think they become better looking, more attractive and less depressed.

Why not ask a easier question like "Why do women wear high heels even though they are terribly uncomforable?"  I think it is a society thing related to our self worth, self esteem.  We see all these adds with beautiful women and under the adds it says "this makeup, this eyeshadow, etc." and we think if I wear those things I will be beautiful too.  I won't have this red tint, pimples, oil, dry skin, etc. We have to be able to look at ourselves in the mirror and like what we see without the additives.

There's a difference between makeup and too much makeup. The former can be very pretty and it doesn't take a lot to make special features stand out.

yeah it sucks to feel like one has to wear makeup before leaving the house. It has alot to do with insecurities. and truthfully if one gets to the point of knowing someone well enough, you will definetly be seen without makeup eventually. younger woman definetly wear too much makeup at times when they really do not need it. i was guilty of that when i was younger. now when i wear makeup , i do it mainly to hide blemishes and make myself look a little more awake if i am tired, or if i am going out to be seen at a social thing , like a party/bar. I do not wear makeup in the house or around the neighborhood or if i am getting up really early and there is nothing i could do to look more alert. i like putting on eyeliner because i kind of stylize it into the cat eye look. the act of putting on makeup is fun, i am a painterly creative person so i like experimenting with appearance and how to change it.  if anything i agree with you that i am not fond of societal pressure place on young woman to alter their appearance to be more acceptable. another thing that bothers me about makeup is the possibility of it messing up ones skin or taking in harmful chemicals. i have recently cut down on the amount of makeup i wear and have bought allegedly makeup with organic ingredients. it is cool you asked this question, being a guy and all, however hate is pretty strong words.

I wear very little make up myself because I hate feeling like I'm hiding my face. Even if my face isn't "perfect", it isn't bad - I have very pale, flawless skin and I like the way I look without hiding anything. I wear mascara, occasionally eyeliner or concealer, but not every day. I couldn't stand wearing anything more than that. My mother and grandmother are always buying me make up and trying to convince me to wear it but I don't like how it feels. If a woman is wearing a lot of make up I think she is showing how insecure she must be about her appearance.

I can't be bothered with make-up, unless I'm on stage - as a kind of preparation ritual where I psych myself up- but I haven't even bothered with that the last couple of times. I like to know how I actually look. It would make me really insecure if I started to perceive myself in my minds eye the way I look with make-up - I would get paranoid of people seeing me without it.



Occasionally I decide to put it on, but it makes me feel self-conscious. I prefer to see the world as there for my taking, than feeling that I have to put on a brave face for it.



I don't want to dis the sisters who do wear it though. If they get something out of it then good for them.

Makeup should be worn to enhance natural beauty not cover it.



I use eyeliner on occasion but almost always wear mascara,  lipstick (at least lip gloss) and a little bit of blush.  I will use a  concealer to hide flaws (mostly dark circles, I'm terribly sleep deprived lol).  If worn properly it gives an allover healthy appearance.



I wear it as much for myself as I do for others.  It boosts my mood when I look in the mirror and I don't look as tired as I feel. lol  It has the same effect on confidence as dressing nice.  People usually wear clothes that enhance their figure or physique because it presents a good image and just makes them feel better.

Is bidirectional-rape possible?



Feminists say that, if a woman is drunk, then her consent is invalid (and she could therefore cry rape, even if she was willing when drunk). They also claim to want equality between the sexes, so I would think that the same would apply if the cases were reversed (i.e. if the man were drunk, then he could cry rape). What happens if both are drunk and they do the deed and both decide to cry rape? Can they each press charges against the other and show up to court as simultaneously the victims and perpetrators of rape?

Of course, but do men really want to be considered that weak by the legal system. It would be an insult, as it is to women.



Expanding the definition of rape to include sex with beer goggles on is just another way of embellishing statistics and fooling women into thinking that there is a rapist on every corner just waiting for his chance.

I think your question is flawed. When a woman is raped when drunk, she is not 'willing' while drunk - just close to being comatose and moving in and out of consciousness, so unable to give consent. I don't think mutual rape could really happen here, because one person would have to be conscious enough to perpetrate. In otherwords if they were both that drunk, they would have fallen asleep in a heap and no act would have occurred.

Does modern feminist theory actually give men a free pass to rape women?



Before deleting this question, explain to me how modern feminist theory would approach the following scenario:



Suppose that a particularly lewd and licentious man spots a woman to whom is attracted. Having no morals, he decides to rape her. But before he does so, he downs a bottle of "liquid courage". After he commits his appalling crime, he is arrested. But it turns out that he was drunk at the time, and feminists claim that drunkenness (at least as far as women go) dissolves the consent. So apparently the rapist did not, according to feminists, consent to sex and could therefore claim that the woman raped him instead. Without violating the supposed feminist principles of equality, can somebody explain why this rapist, according the modern feminist theory, is actually a rapist?



</question>



<additional details>



Jenny: I don't understand. What does that mean exactly? That his consent was dissolved, but that he consented to aggression? Doesn't that mean he consented (contradicting feminist theory)?



And for the record, I think that such an act should result in many years behind bars. I just don't see how this is even a crime according to feminists.



Mr. Morbid: That's true, but from a practical perspective, there's no evidence and no reason for a jury to believe that he had planned his attack beforehand. Also, are you saying that if a woman desires a man (but doesn't sleep with him), then is later raped by him (in a feminist drunk way), then is that therefore consent?



To reiterate my record, I think it was a crime for which he should be punished, but I haven't seen any explanations that conform to feminists' opinion on the matter (pertaining to drunkennes and consent). Obviously most (including me) disagree that it was non-consensual, but I just can't see how, from a feminist perspective (and without abandoning their so-called egalitarian nature), that this could be a crime.



nickipettis: That's all fine and dandy, but a jury also needs evidence to support their decision, and there is no evidence of intent, so from a practical perspective, no intent can be shown. Also, feminists think that even if a woman intended to have sex with a man, she can claim rape if she has sex with him while drunk (because drunkenness invalidates the consent).



thingamabob: So this man is simply guilty of a less serious crime (neglect) than rape?

He didn't need to give consent to the woman he was the instigator. He had already premeditated what he was going to do and took action to help him commit rape. So his judgment wasn't clouded.



Now if the woman had asked him to rape her if he was already intoxicated then the principle would apply.

I don't claim that being drunk dissolves consent. And people are responsible for their actions when they commit crimes while drunk so yes the guy should be prosecuted.



I think you should stop generalizing people and just worry about yourself.



So you hate women and feminists, so what.  Why not just stop dealing with them.  I don't like  people who are too into religion but I don't have to start arguments in Yahoo answers because of pent up aggression over it.



As a true feminist, an egalitarian, I think the rape laws are biased towards women. I've known more than one guy to be wrongfully prosecuted because the woman changed her mind to consent and called it rape after the fact.  A woman just had to utter "rape" and they guy could be screwed for life.



Equality isn't about bringing the opposite gender down, it's about taking responsibility for your actions and not expecting special treatment because of your gender.

He still perpetrated the crime, he carried out the aggression, that is undeniable. Regardless of the difficulty of establishing mens rea, (yahoo insists that I have spelled it wrong) since the woman wasn't drunk her accounts may be more believable than the rapist's, who was.



After criminal investigation we could soon establish that the woman was not guilty and therefore trace the alcohol back to the man.



How is it a crime? It is neglect. If you get insanely drunk, you are more likely to commit a crime, thus if you are about to drink an intoxicating drink you should do it indoors, where you will (hopefully) hurt no one. Not knowing is not an excuse - this is a man we're talking about.

inherent genetic superiority and sustained parental inculcation of certain esoteric values not shared by the remainder - that is, the remainder of the population - a significant majority as it is, I ought to add - does not simultaneously nor mutually cherish to such esteem that is - insistence on maintaining an alimentary orientation that consistently consolidates subcutaneous adipose matter within the respective appendages. Notably, the subjects of misogyny willing or unwilling's questionable insistences and possibly misguided altercations on ever-perpetuating the custom of self-attenuation does leave Africans coming across as relatively shapely to a significantly higher degree

What message does gender switching names send?



More girls are being named with what used to be considered more traditional boy names (like Ryan for example). As these names shift from boys names to unisex names, they become less used on boys and more used on girls to the point where they often end up more as girls names (like Ashley).



But now I've started to notice that in some cases people are asking/opening up to using/actually using what were considered more traditional girls names on boys.



I saw a question on another name site the other day asking about naming a girl Caleb or Michael, and naming a boy Ashley or Morgan.



What message do you think it sends to the children if you give your daughter a more traditionally masculine name than your son? Do you see this is a "bad" thing or not?

How drunk does a person have to be before sex  is considered rape?



How do they determine just how drunk a person was at the time of the alleged rape?



If a person is incapable of rational thought and consent and it's considered rape then shouldn't a drunk driver have lighter sentences since they were drunk and not capable of rational thought and consent before they got in their car?  Or if a person gets in a drunken brawl are they considered less of a criminal because of being intoxicated?

Note that Tracey includes "incapable of functioning" in her definition. What exactly does that mean? Not being able to say the alphabet clearly or walk straight? The intentionally flexible nature of the feminist definition of rape allows virtually all men to be accused of it. Strangely, men are apparently exempted from this.

Yes, but we have institutionalised chivalry. Women get special consideration. Also these loose definitions make rape seem a lot more common that it actually is, that is then used to demonise all men, and stir up fear and resentment among women.

Your examples appear to view the victim of the rape as a criminal....nice work.
Remember - in rape cases, the perpetrator is usually the sober one. The perpetrator is the criminal, not the victim.

The original domestic violence movement was hijacked by pc feminists who cloud our thinking on violence... "covers men" not good enough Tracey, everyone deserves equal protection by the law and social services. We should not have groups that do not care for all groups equally involved in protective legislation.



"In 1971, Pizzey opened the first battered wives shelter in England, which she ran until 1982. Arguably, the Chiswick Family Rescue was the second domestic violence shelter in the world. Pizzey's book "Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear" (1974, out of print) was one of the first to explore and expose wife battering.



Today, the shelter Pizzey founded denies her entry; her name does not appear in its official history.



Pizzey's 'mistake' was to diverge from the theory of domestic violence that feminists at the time insisted dominate all discussion. She believed that men could also be the victims of domestic violence, and that women could be as violent toward their partners as men.



Pizzey's views put her on a collision course with PC feminists who, according to Pizzey's own published account of events, initiated a campaign of harassment and violence against her.



Pizzey described this harassment in an article she published in the Scotsman in 1999.



"Because of my opposition to the hijacking of the refuge movement, I was a target for abuse. Anywhere I spoke there was a contingent of screaming, heckling feminists waiting for me," Pizzey wrote. "Abusive telephone calls to my home, death threats and bomb scares, became a way of living for me and for my family. Finally, the bomb squad, asked me to have all my mail delivered to their head quarters."



One night, the family dog was killed.



Eventually, "exhausted and disillusioned," Pizzey said she went into "exile with her children and grandchildren," leaving England in 1982 to live in Santa Fe, New Mexico.



Pizzey returned to England that same year for the book tour of her next book, "Prone to Violence," which once again ignited a violent reaction among feminists. Pizzey wrote that when she arrived in England for her book tour, she was "met with a solid wall of feminist demonstrators" carrying signs that read "ALL MEN ARE RAPISTS, ALL MEN ARE BATTERERS."



"The police insisted that I have an escort all round England for my book tour," Pizzey wrote in the Scotsman.



There is some reason to believe that "Prone to Violence" has been the target of a campaign of suppression by PC feminists. According to the web site Wikepedia, in 1996 an internet search of the world libraries that can be accessed through the Library of Congress uncovered only 13 listings for the book: an astonishingly low number for a pioneering work that caused a sensation.



Why would PC feminists nearly riot over a book and, then, ignore it?



Because Pizzey advanced a competing theory of domestic violence.



When viewed through the PC lens of class oppression, domestic violence is not an act of violence committed by one individual against another. It is an act committed by men that must be correctly understood within the larger context of women's class oppression.



"Prone to Violence" spelled out some of Pizzey's disagreements with that view.



Disagreement #1: Of the first 100 women who entered Chiswick, Pizzey found that over 60 percent were as violent or more violent than the men they were fleeing. In short, a significant percentage of the women were also batterers or otherwise active participants in the violence.



Disagreement #2: Pizzey developed the theory that many battered women were psychologically drawn to abusive relationships and they sought them out. To PC feminists, such analysis was tantamount to 'blaming the victim.'



Disagreement #3: She explained why the existing model of domestic violence shelters was ineffective. PC feminists were attempting then (and now) to secure ever greater financing for these operations. Sandra Horley, director of Chiswick in 1992, reportedly complained, "if we put across this idea that the abuse of men is as great as the abuse of women, then it could seriously affect our funding."



Pizzey may or may not have been correct; I believe she was and is.



Neverthless, her book drew upon over 10 years at the Chiswick shelter during which time Pizzey dealt with some 5,000 women and children.



"Prone to Violence" is an extremely early and honest overview of domestic violence from a woman with extensive experience of its daily realities. The book cried out to be taken seriously. At minimum, it deserved a thorough rebuttal from its PC feminist critics--not death threats directed at its author nor the ultimate silence it received.



Pizzey is not alone. In America, Suzanne Steinmetz -- author of the book "The Battered Husband" and a co-author of the much-cited "First National Family Violence Survey" -- experienced a similar drama. She and her children received death threats; an ACLU meeting at which she spoke received a bomb threat.



The reason: her research indicated that the rate at which men were victimized by domestic violence was similar to the rate for women.



In large and small ways -- from shrill protests to the tearing down of announcements, from blocking university promotions to threats and defamation -- PC feminism has attempted to stop voices it could not control.



Feminism is dying not from a backlash but from an orthodoxy that cannot tolerate real discussion...and never could."

Because modern feminists (the ones who lead the movement anyway) are hypocrites who want special rights not equality.



And no, despite what Tracey says a majority of men are not killed because of drugs (how this even relates to domestic violence shows how little you know tracey).



Women are statistically equally likely to cause domestic violence , more likely to abuse children (due to being around children more) and more than 5 times more likely to use a weapon in a DV situation.

Because TV stations exist to sell advertising, women do 80% of the spending so the advertising is aimed at mainly women, just switch on your TV. Advertisers want shows that appeal to women. Producers want shows that appeal to advertisers needs.



Shows like Raymond, portray the woman as infallible and the male as an idiot.



This reinforces the females decisions to buy such and such while negating the husbands ability to object. It is a subtle sales technique. When you think about it, its insulting to everyone. I've not owned a television for over a year myself.



and I've no idea what MRAs would be doing objecting to this, I think they are more concerned with family law.

Something I don't understand about drunkenness and consent...?



if a woman has sex whilst drunk, she can cry rape. i.e. she isn't held responsible for her actions.



if a man punches someone in the face whilst drunk, he isn't able to escape an assault charge because he was drunk, because he made the choice to get drunk and is still responsible for his behaviour.

Institutionalised chivalry, women are special. Loose definitions of rape also help those interested in exaggerating the prevalence or the crime.



Part of the general 'all men are rapists' attitude. The Independent Women's Forum maintains that this statistic is a myth: "based on a fallacious feminist study commissioned by Ms. magazine. The researcher, Mary Koss, hand-picked by hard-line feminist Gloria Steinem, acknowledges that 73 percent of the young women she counted as rape victims were not aware they had been raped. Forty-three percent of them were dating their 'attacker' again" http://www.massnews.com/2003_Editions/5_...



The general tactic has been to expand the definition of rape so as to make it seem more prevalent: "…even verbal coercion or manipulation constitutes rape” (Roiphe, 1993, pp. 66–67) and “with such a sweeping definition of rape, I wonder how many people there are, male or female, who haven’t been date-raped at one point or another” (Roiphe, 1993, p. 79).  Dr. Christina Hoff Sommers observes: "Dr. Andrea Parrot, chair of the Cornell University Coalition Advocating Rape Education and author of Sexual Assault on Campus, begins her date rape prevention manual with the words, "Any sexual intercourse without mutual desire is a form of rape"http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/...



Incredibly, when one feminist spokeswoman was challenged on the '1 in 4' statistic, she responded: "The statistics don't really matter... We're just trying to focus on the real issue here... not bicker about numbers" http://www.deltabravo.net/files/ifmenhav...



Question: The above distortions of truth all have in common that they put men in a bad light. There are laws against incitement of prejudice against women and ethnic groups; should there be laws against incitement to promote prejudice against men? Or laws to prevent feminists covering up research that would help male victims of domestic violence?



Question: Do the media (e.g. BBC news) have an obligation to present information in a fair and balanced way, or is it ok for them to present only the story that the feminist movement wants us to hear?

What's the difference between being pro-choice on abortion and pro-choice on rape?



some people believe that the woman is more important than the fetus, that a fetus isn't a human being etc. and so it's ok for a woman to have an abortion. that's fair enough, i kind of agree.



what if someone believes that women are less important than men, and so it's ok to put a man's sexual needs first, and therefore believes that rape is ok?



i know one is legal and the other isn't, but this is a purely moral question.



where do we draw the line on pro-choice?



and based on that analogy, is it easier to understand why people are pro-life, and how they view people who are pro-choice?

Because pro-choice is pro-choice about murder and not rape. Just like women can abort their babies, men should be able to kill others who inconvenience them.



Edit: Note Tracey's circular logic: "A zygote doesn't have the same rights as a woman". But the zygotes rights are defined by law. So the zygote doesn't have rights because a zygote doesn't have rights. Therefore they can be killed. That's feminist logic...

Maybe we don't want to. I don't wear makeup because of societal pressure. I'm a stay at home mom - society somewhat expects me to be plain and frumpy. lol I wear makeup because I like to do so. I like collecting all different shades and experimenting with different looks. It's fun. And I like the way I look with a bit of well-placed colour on my face. I wear it because I want to, not because I feel like I must. I think alot of women are the same. We like girly stuff like makeup!

Why do you see it as weakness that women wear makeup? It's nothing to do with strength or weakness and it's human instinct to want to make ourselves look as good as possible.



There' sno difference between accentuating our looks with makeup than you having your hair combed or putting on a smart suit to work. We project a positive image of ourselves.



I love wearing makeup, I look a lot better with it and it's fun.

The problem isn't mainstream or independent feminists, it is the influential radical feminists, we resent you giving them your support. You turn a blind eye to and often support legislation that discriminates against men. Misandry has become so commonplace and normal that many of you don't even realise that you are taking part in it.



Anyone that blames all men as a class for oppression and wrong doing does at least resent men.

I love men! Come on now... our lives would be booooring without them, to say the least. Today, I'm going to remind my fiance that I love him even more than I did the last time I reminded him... (because he truly is one of the "good guys"!) But... my brother, on the other hand, whom I often contemplate dishonorable acts upon... ahh, I think I'll just ignore him! That seems to work pretty good most of the time.... though, tar & feathering seems like much more fun! LOL



P.S. If you haven't guessed... I'm not a feminist (however, I do believe in equal rights, equal respect, equal pay, and all that good stuff). I just don't think we have to degrade men in order to prove our point, or meet our goals. I love the men in my life... well, most of them... ok, maybe not... but, I have loved a few! (My dad, my son, my fiance... and, oh yeh, my dog... LOL).

Would you honestly rather have a woman or man police officer protecting you?



Suppose you are a young college female walking home, through a very dangerous neighborhood, and call for a university police/security escort.



Would you rather a woman walk home with your or a male officer? This is the simple situation I use to explain why woman shouldn't be police offiers, security personal, soliders, guards or anything like that. If you aren't willing to put your own life directly in their hands, than we shouldn't put other people's. It's not sexism it's practical sense.

And besides, even real police can't just pull out a gun and shoot without the perp showing deadly force first.

Considering the cops in my country carry guns, I don't care if the cop is a chimpanzee. What is a male going to do to a perp that a female couldn't do? Does it matter whether it's a man or a woman pointing a gun at the criminal? Bullets don't care about gender.



The city I live in has a number of female police officers that WWE wrestlers would think twice about picking on.



To answer your question, I HONESTLY would not care about the gender of the cop protecting me.



Edit: So it's a taser instead of a gun. Do tasers somehow "work" better in male hands than female?

I absolutely could not care less.  A cop is a cop, and, more importantly, a person with a gun is a person with a freakin' gun.  And, if you're going to argue semantics as if it matters whether they have a taser or a gun, a person can get up and run with a bullet in them; a taser will drop your *** in a heartbeat.



Also, A Pregnant Christian is obviously sexist and is ashamed of her own gender.



And, yeah, everybody go ahead and give me a thumbs-down because I'm right.  For what it's worth, I'm a guy.  And I wasn't aware that so many of you are stuck in the 1950's mentality of women being weak and inferior.  Shame on you, seriously.



You may be intimidated by a female cop, you may not.  It depends on the cop.  You may not be intimidated by a male cop.  But if you tell me you're not intimidated by a person with a gun, you're lying through your teeth.

I have no issue with women police officers, firefighters, soldiers etc. However, I do take issue with how they get their jobs. The physical requirements for a female to become an officer/soldier are less then for men.



If I am in a burning building I want a firefighter who can lift my 210lbs, not a firefighter who only had to lift 180lbs to get her job.
My point: if a woman can pass the same requirements set out for everyone (male and female) I'd feel perfectly safe with a female guarding me.

I love the real Tracey and all the clones of her confuse me.  I don't know if this is pertinent in her case but maybe she, more than others, kindly responds to e-mail from trolls and they like latch-on to her attention.  Every time I've spent too much time responding to such e-mails, the trolls latch-on.  I don't mean the guys who just want to discuss something further.  I mean the trolls who have emotional neediness issues related to latching-on to a "mommy" figure to combat with like they do or had to do with their own mothers in order to get maternal attention.  It's not wise, though, to pay them too much attention.  It's just like feeding the coons on the deck a powdered sugared dough-nut one night and then they show up at the door looking for more dough-nuts the next night and they bring all their siblings and such.

Do feminists want to negate my right to negotiate a higher pay for equal work?



Say a woman applies for a position as programmer. She negotiates a salary of 2800. I apply next, with the same degree the same experience and the same skills, because he needs 2 of us. I tell him 6000 or bust, because I don't see why I should work my butt off for projects that earn him hundreds of thousands and settle for chump change.
He wails, but in the end agrees, because it aint like he can go and pick a programmer out of a soup line.



What should happen according to the feminists ?



- nothing everybody works for what she/he signed up for



- Her salary should be upped to match mine



- both our salaries should be averaged so both earn the same



- something else ??

So...you wouldn't wail if, say...the woman negotiated a later start time and an earlier quitting time because she wants to spend more time with her child?



You'd be just fine with that?



So...why all the screaming from men when they perceive that women are getting away with more at work because they have children? If their employers have allowed them to negotiate this work schedule, then what business is it of yours?



Raj: You are incorrect. Both men and women in the U.S. are entitled to 12 weeks off unpaid due to the FMLA. There is no paid maternity leave for women in the U.S. But you knew this, didn't you? And I wasn't talking about maternity leave. I was talking about working hours.

The guy that was hiring you will usually set the price he is willing to pay.  I don't think he would hire you for $6,000.00 when he could easily find someone for less.  There are unemployed programmers all over the place.  It has nothing to do with the feminist.

I like how Tracey pretends that maternity leave is "negotiable". It was negotiable once, until it was mandated by law (thanks to feminists). Now women don't "negotiate" maternity leave. They are "entitled" to it (thus undermining the free-market negotiation process).



Edit: No I didn't know that. Which raises the point, what's your point? That a woman should be able to negotiate greater benefits than a man, but if a man negotiates a better salary, then it's evidence of the "wage gap"?

Is this verbal abuse if it what my BF says is true?



I am in my early 40s, and I've been with my boyfriend two years. We just moved in together. This is the longest continuous relationship I've ever been in, although I've dated lots of men.



I have a friend who thinks I'm being verbally abused. She had witnessed my boyfriend getting angry with me in public, over little things, and yelling at me at home.



The thing is, I am too embarrassed to go into therapy because everything he uses against me as "ammunition" is true -- so how can it be verbal abuse? He says things like, "No other man would want you / put up with you." And it's true -- look at my history of relationships. He will also say, "No wonder your own mother didn't love you -- just look at yourself." And, to this day, my mother has never been very loving / warm. The list goes on.



Is it really verbal abuse? He is just telling me the truth.

It is still verbal abuse even if it's "the truth". He is a jerk. You deserve better than that. Move back out and end this relationship - do you really want to spend your life being talked down to like this? I bet you hate it! And you should. Please dump him before he escalates to physical violence.



And once you do that, it might be a good idea to sit down and examine yourself. It sounds like you have trouble picking good men or men who are suitable for you. Figuring out why and fixing that problem would be really good for you. Maybe consider talking to a counselor about this - talking it over can help you get to the bottom of things. Perhaps a phone call to Dr Laura would help - she's really good at steering people in the right direction. Either way, he is only part of the problem. It sounds like you've got some self-esteem issues that need sorting out.



Good luck! I hope you can straighten this thing out. You deserve better than this jerk - don't forget that. PS, when he says "no other man would want you"? He's full of crap. That is NOT true.

Sure it is abuse.  The fact that you don't even realize it is pretty sad in itself.  Anyway, if this is a high point for you in terms of relationships, maybe you should find a way to change yourself.
Go find a hobby or join a sports team or volunteer somewhere.  You need to make yourself different if all you are attracted to is abusive men.  Maybe then you can see the light and find a guy who treats you better.

You don't have to put up with that ****! Who does he think he is to tell you what your mother thinks of you or has done in the past. If you believe what he sys you will end up pushing your family away from you and you may lose your relationship with your Mum.



As for no man wanting you. Plenty of women myself included go through different men and have lots of relationships. That is just life experience. You shouldnt look back at those relationships and think of them as failures you should look back and remember the good times. The man you are with just now sounds worthless and undeserving of you. He is just focusing on things he knows you are sensitive about.



You sound like a positive woman who knows he is wrong but you sound a little scared to do something about it.



Its all very good us sitting here at our computers telling you this stuff there could be other stuff that has happened that makes it more difficult i.e kids involved which makes it harder to walk away.



Honestly though if you feel it is abuse of any kind verbal or whatever get out before it gets worse.

you CAN do better, but he doesn't want you to know that because you'll leave him. he's keeping you down, so you won't stand up.  verbal abuse is serious. i strongly recommend domestic violence (which includes sexual, verbal, and physical abuse).



800-799-SAFE (7233) for a DV agency near you. i think you need education about verbal abuse and it's seriousness. it can cause depression and is worse situations suicide.



he is WRONG. DEAD WRONG.



you may have chosen men that are not suitable for relationship; perhaps they are emoitoanlly unstable. or abusive.



your mother has her own issues, which is the reason she can not express love for you or has love for you. but it is NOT you!



with education about domestic violence, specifically verbally abuse, you may be able to learn the signs of an abuser and get out of realtionship quicker than you did in the past.



with your history of emotional distance from yoru mother, it's no surprise that you're USE to his behaviors. it may seem normal to you.

Something I don't understand about drunkenness and consent...?



if a woman has sex whilst drunk, she can cry rape. i.e. she isn't held responsible for her actions.



if a man punches someone in the face whilst drunk, he isn't able to escape an assault charge because he was drunk, because he made the choice to get drunk and is still responsible for his behaviour.



why is it ok to play the 'i was drunk' card if you're a woman, and not if you're a man?

Institutionalised chivalry, women are special. Loose definitions of rape also help those interested in exaggerating the prevalence or the crime.



Part of the general 'all men are rapists' attitude. The Independent Women's Forum maintains that this statistic is a myth: "based on a fallacious feminist study commissioned by Ms. magazine. The researcher, Mary Koss, hand-picked by hard-line feminist Gloria Steinem, acknowledges that 73 percent of the young women she counted as rape victims were not aware they had been raped. Forty-three percent of them were dating their 'attacker' again" http://www.massnews.com/2003_Editions/5_...



The general tactic has been to expand the definition of rape so as to make it seem more prevalent: "…even verbal coercion or manipulation constitutes rape” (Roiphe, 1993, pp. 66–67) and “with such a sweeping definition of rape, I wonder how many people there are, male or female, who haven’t been date-raped at one point or another” (Roiphe, 1993, p. 79).  Dr. Christina Hoff Sommers observes: "Dr. Andrea Parrot, chair of the Cornell University Coalition Advocating Rape Education and author of Sexual Assault on Campus, begins her date rape prevention manual with the words, "Any sexual intercourse without mutual desire is a form of rape"http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/...



Incredibly, when one feminist spokeswoman was challenged on the '1 in 4' statistic, she responded: "The statistics don't really matter... We're just trying to focus on the real issue here... not bicker about numbers" http://www.deltabravo.net/files/ifmenhav...



Question: The above distortions of truth all have in common that they put men in a bad light. There are laws against incitement of prejudice against women and ethnic groups; should there be laws against incitement to promote prejudice against men? Or laws to prevent feminists covering up research that would help male victims of domestic violence?



Question: Do the media (e.g. BBC news) have an obligation to present information in a fair and balanced way, or is it ok for them to present only the story that the feminist movement wants us to hear?

As far as laws on rape go a man can be at risk of being convicted of rape if the woman is drunk and the man isn't, at risk of being convicted if the woman is drunk and the man is drunk, but it's not an issue if the man is drunk but the woman isn't.

More importantly, according to the law, if a man and a woman are EQUALLY drunk, she lacks the mental capacity to consent, but HE is still responsible for determining her mental capacity, even if, at the time, he lacks the mental capacity himself.



Women will NEVER be held 100% accountable - whatever percentage less than 100 will be taken up by men.  Which is why we have men being held 140% accountable.



It's bizarre math, I know, but when discussing women, even the logic of math falls apart like stale cake.

I don't see why not. In the case of feminism a woman can be against it just as much as a man can be. All it takes is some common sense and an absence of hang-ups re men.

Not necessarily.  I think there is some value in divergent thinking - sometimes disagreements lead to new ways of looking at things.  And I think men and women can bring different perspectives to a problem.  However, the polarization that is found so extensively on this forum certainly leads no where.  When two groups continuously point their fingers at each other in attempt to lay blame, nothing productive happens.  So maybe standing side by side is too much to hope for, but we could at least be looking in the same direction.

I think that each sex has an insight into life that the other might not have.  When we come to accept that we are complements and not competitors we will have all of our bases will covered and nothing but good can come from that.  Its the notions that we are, or should be, exactly the same or that we are  polar opposites that causes such a divide.  We should all value our strengths, accept our weaknesses, appreciate what the opposite sex has to offer and only then can we move on.

yes, but the reality is that somewhere something or things are working to prevent that. control is the motive. divide and conquer is the weapon of choice and it is working very well. consider adam and eve and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil or the tower of babel. adam and eve stood together when faced with gods wrath at their disobedience and for their togetherness they were both kicked out of paradise to toil and struggle the rest of their days. at one time the world was united as one in race and language at babel. it stood together in an effort to reach heaven and be with and like god and for their efforts had their language and physical appearance confounded in order to break their unity. the feminist movement was just another twist on the divide and conquer road to keeping us dazed and confused as to what we could and should be. we have to realize and understand who we are in order to fend off the attacks from without that would keep us separate from one another as human beings. there is no "essential" difference between men and women. we are but two parts to a whole, the natural affinity of which is each other. the underlying reason and cause for our separatist mindset  may be more than we wish to discover. perhaps the best we can and should do is break free from it without ever knowing where it came from.

Men & women standing side by side is similar to playing the piano with two hands in harmony.

To play the piano we're taught to match each hand to specific keys (notes).  We can try to make the right hand invert to play what the left hand has natural talent in with much practice.  However, the music becomes more beautiful, more harmonious, and more exciting when used as a pair instead of iscolating each hand.

Much like learning to play the piano, we (men & women) must study what goes where ... and listen to the music that's being created ... without fear of failure.  We mustn't stay in the same genre' of music if we're ever to grow and acheive greatness.  Imagine mastering "Twinkle - Twinkle Little Star" and never expanding on the possibilities?  How sad would that be? ;o(

I believe it could be. I believe there is one snag to this theory.
People.

I believe that people show where and how they would help.
It is oft their secret passion, vanity and pride that make so little sense in terms of gains where this may be found. Of course not in all things, not for all people.
I believe that regardless of any person or thier nature they fit into society, in fact they already do.
I consider that no matter to what extent that places any one person or group at odds with anything else it will always be in that delicate dance of the most hypnotic of grace, you may have to step back a long way to see it.
I think it is already there tho, I just dont think its seen. There is a lot of drama the supercedes it in the senses.
I think attitudes and beliefs could be better used to make a better of it.

Disagreements dont have to be destructive competitions, They can come to together.
Misunderstanding is nothing more than a unique opprtunity to improve understanding - the best example I can think of right now is found in language students and how most native speakers treat them. With patience and respect for the effort, Even awe at times. Talk about encouraging.
Competition doesnt have to be negativem, the negative is found in the needs of those that play - and not so often the aims of what is sought.
All out hostility isnt the end, if you consider that from destruction comes creation. Even at times this may be required perhaps. But I doubt it given the vast number of other possible outcomes.

Sometimes the Dance is all there seems to be for so many.

Definitely. So many talents are wasted by those who aren't willing to admit that everyone- male or female- are great at something, and that  everyone has something to contribute.
Shouldn't that be obvious when it takes both sexes to make a child?

Is this something that PLAYAS have learned?



"If a relationship is based upon the desire to get sex, then you will find yourself addicted to it, but not him."

Is this why a lot of "players" are overly confident, because they don't desire the true person, rather the activity they can get from someone?

When someone is realllllllllllllly nervous around a person IMMEDIATELY and always afterwards, does that mean they most likely feel true love for that individual since true love, like lust, can be felt right away?

OK, I consider myself a "player" (if that's what you still call it) so I'll bite.  The term "player" originated to describe men who consider picking up women to be a game.  For some who play this game, the endgame is sex.  For others of us, the endgame is a date or a phone number.  Whatever the endgame is for the "player," when they have acheived it, they will move on.  The problem with your statement is that it used the word "relationship."  With a player, there never was a relationship.  The object of the game (you) was simply an obstacle in the quest for endgame.  What could be a more challenging game than the human mind?  The art of persuasion is one of the oldest and most demanding artforms in history.  The ability to persuade a person to volunteer whatever you want whenever you want would be the pinnacle of the form.  The quest for that can be quite addictive indeed.

Women do differ from men. So what? Should we treat them differently? I don't think so. 
Reply:
Things, eh? Funny that you say that, but I don't think that people are things. My opinion of that is such that we are all different. Can you find two identical people (not identical twins who are still different in character)? No. They can be similar and still they are different. So, should I treat everyone in this world differently? I will simply run out of options. Thus, I have just several models of my behaviour concerning different people with certain variations depending on the situation. But it never means that I have to apply them taking into consideration only sex or race or whatever one reason there can be. Everything in society is too complex for simple divisions based on one criterion.

Certainly there are biological differences and certainly in the brain as well as musculator and bone shape and density. This is due to genetics when chromisomes collide and prior to ANY cell growth. Mutations are carried this way.



That said feminists say that all this is irrelevant in this day and age. Yet they complain that men get more money for hanging off the side of a skyscraper than a woman gets sitting in an airconditioed office. Why aren't there any female riggers? Why aren't there equal numbers of women in sewerge collection and treatment? Why aren't there more women in garbage collection and treatment? These are all highly paid jobs yet no women apply. It seems women have no interest in breaking the glass ceilings in these highly paid boys clubs.

This is why no feminist will ever have a public debate on her claims about men. They must maintain the victim status of men whilst claiming women are much better and smarter. Naturally, of course, feminists fail to explain that every time boys and girls are pitted together in an intelligence test and even though boys are disadvantaged at school boys always win.

What you must remember is that feminist notions are ALWAYS the opposite to reality so they have to tell outright lies, grossly misuse statistics and use urban myths to prove their point. I have not found one negative comment made by any feminist anywhere at any time to be true.

Well, undeniably, this is the regrettable state of affairs that modern feminism has resulted in where men are simply treated as defective rubbish.  A human being can only withstand so much before the human being cracks, and this is called "blowback," wherein there's been so much humiliation and emasculation and derision of men by feminists that the only escape from this madness is to regain any degree of self-worth we have before our gender is systematically eradicated by this wicked philosophy.  This may be our last chance before the small window of opportunity is gone.

Oh my I can see where this question is going but I think you ought to read the social history over the ages as to how women have been mis treated by men.

No women would want anyman to bend or bow to them. No both sexes would like respect and understanding and have to work at it.

'If' by Rudyard Kipling

IF.....



--------------------------------------...



IF you can keep your head when all about you 
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:



If you can make one heap of all your winnings 
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

How will this action be different?  When did you put women first?  So you feel the pendulum in the last few years have swung to far toward pro-women and now you want to push it back to pro-men.  Maybe we should all focus on making things better for everyone and stop the never ending circle of me-me-me!

Our we could all focus on respecting and standing up for  each other.
The power struggle we have now is just a pendulum that swings from one extreme to the other.  In the meantime women who are not feminists are caught in the cross fire between the men and the feminists.  Feminism has an "every man for himself" mentality that has left men and non-feminist women out in the cold.
Is this really the same approach you want to take?

Up here in Canada, the feminist agenda has crept into every facet of society.  They are like whining babies and unfortunately will never, ever go away.  To discount them is like ignoring the floods.

I actually agree with this.  Feminism is an organized and deliberate movement designed with the intention of forwarding the cause of women.  If men don't like the results, it only makes sense to start a similar but opposite movement.  Let me give you one piece of advise though.  Always state in public discourse that you are "only interested in the equality of the genders."  It is important to appear centrist or the fledgling organization will be destroyed in a torrent of bad media and the feminist agenda will be furthered instead of stunted.

Ahh, thumbs down when I wasn't trolling?  To all of the people saying "work together", I point to history.  Change rarely ever is a product of two amorphous and massive sides coming to a compromise.  It is most often the result of a radical element of one side grabbing the sword and pushing forward.  If this element is strong enough, both sides will be forced to evolve the way they think to consider this event.  If the element is not strong enough, the sword is dropped and a new element will rise up and push forward.  Such is the pendulum of history, such is the cause of humanity.

EDIT:  To those who are saying "haven't men always done this?"  The answer is no.  As scary as that might be to you, there is no organized movement to further the cause of men.

Then get rid of the feminist bigots from the universities that teach women (and men) to hate men and put women on a pedestal e.g. Women's Studies students "learn about a 'female way of knowing', 'female logic', 'female voice'... Experts in women's studies often use it [the term 'difference'] in connection with the innate superiority of women" (Nathanson & Young 2006, p.277)

Then get rid of the man-haters in goverment who promote anti-male laws under the guise of equality http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/pol...

How would that behavior be new?  Men have historically ignored the accomplishments of women, the concerns of women and the thoughts of women.  They have only listened when Women stood up for themselves and made their voices heard.



If you want to ignore women, you will have to get some large earplugs, but don't be surprised if women kick your sorry carcass out of the road because you stand in the way of progress.

I have been told on some of my questions by some feminists that women shouldn't be focusing on men's issues, we should do it ourselves.  By that point of view, I guess we should.



However, rational people realize that we should be helping out people in general.  You might focus on one gender or the other, one age groups, etc., but you shouldn't ignore the plight of others.

I'm sure you're not alone, but I don't feel that way.  I know there are lots of women trendier, prettier, and better looking than me (like, in all likelihood, you), but I don't care.  I like my comfortable clothes and my comfortable shoes and I mostly hate the mall and my hair refuses to do anything besides be long and straight.  Any other hairdo will disintegrate in under 10 minutes.

Edit: Though come to think of it, I felt that way pretty much every morning when I looked in my closet from about age 12 to age 18.

Yes, we do.  No, you're not alone.  We're judgmental creatures and we tend to be hardest on ourselves.  "We are living in a material world," my dear.  It's hard NOT to notice others.

The only cure I've found is to get over your outward appearance and concentrate on your attitude.  If you carry yourself tall, eyes straight-forward and embrace who you are as a person, all of the material stuff becomes less of a bother.  It won't matter what you're wearing because you will exude confidence.  It's pretty exhilarating because people will start noticing you more.

It takes plenty of practice and concentration, and you really have to feel confident about yourself.  You'll get there.  :)

I do go through phases when I feel utterly like c.r.a.p. about myself, but it has nothing to do with how I look or what other people think of how I look.  It has more to do with whether or not I'm living up to what I believe, living up to my potential as a human, and whether I'm currently coping with the stuff life's throwing at me.  I've got more important and serious junk to stress about than fretting about whether or not I'm trendy enough compared to other women.

Of course.  Its important to remember that there is something absolutely EVERYONE doesn't like about themselves.



But generally, when I feel like that, I take a mental health day and cancel all my plans for the day, then i make myself a face mask, give my feet a good foot soak, maybe go get a massage if I can afford it on that particular day, go for a jog, do some yoga, drink some green tea and just try to make peace with myself and have some alone time... I call it therapy for the soul haha.  I know that this isn't always a realistic option, but it works wonders!  I always wake up the next day feeling so much more alive, so much more beautiful, confident and refreshed, that its worth all of the catching up I have to do from cancellations.

I think its cause I need a change... maybe a new hair cut or something. If you do something nice for yourself it might help you to feel better. I think I need to take time out to go to the gym and have alone time. What would make you feel better?

Why do woman get special treatment in the media?



Example: In a recent stampede in India it was reported 150 died, mostly woman & children. 45 children and 47 woman died. The article thus ignored 58 men that died.

In the "old days" woman got special treatment, but in the new age of emancipation and woman in the front line of battle, is this not a type of prejudice?

they mentioned women& children because it is the majority number. in writing articles/ essays, the majority number is always highlighted first followed by minority, and since this involved only two subjects (men + women&children) so they don't have to mention what's minority one (men). -readers can do their own math.



furthermore, children are usually mentioned with women. so women and children is one. 45 and 47 is only to show the figures difference.

i find it kinda prejudice though. i dunno how it is to the men, but to women it does happen. while many of us are striving to be at the front line, many of us tripped; either by the men, or ourselves. it's kinda a payback pain to many of the female, except minority of female who are totally fortunate at the front line.

No that was just a way for them to get people's attention, they have no political agenda except for making money and getting ratings. And it worked! That was wicked lame, the original headline seemed like it was only women and children and then the count was 150.

That's because most reporters are men so they are more likely to notice the female casualities. If there had been more women, it's likely they would have paid more attention to the men.

Aaron: there are different types of feminist.



Modern feminism is more about getting what is best for women (rather than what is fair), and getting equal outcome (rather than equal opprtunity)

Western feminists realise that they already have the bracketed parts and that that makes traditional feminism obsolete. So modern feminism is all about discriminating against men and turning everything to women's advantage.

Yes, the modern feminist hates men.

What?
Anyway, I do have one thing to say about feminists.  It's a load of crap.  I don't care what some woman wants to say to this.  I hate when I hold the door for a woman, or do (or offer to do) something courteous and they say "Oh you think just cause I'm a woman I need you to do that? You think I'm too weak to open a door?"  I don't say anything but sometimes I swear I just wanna say "No, I'm just being nice. Now get in the door before I shove you in."  Women can do everything a man can (well...most things) Yes, it's true.  But there's a line between disrespect, and common courtesy.

The reason why feminists are so nosey are as follows.

Little girls who are emotionally damaged in some way grow up to be feminists.  Some of them were neglected as children, some unloved, some sexually abused etc.  Their main driving force is a need to control to make up for the lack of control when they were abused.  They often (especially when stressed) feel the need to adopt controlling behaviour by seeking power within social relationships.

Knowledge is power hence their nosey-ness.

"Feminism" and "man-hating" are not the same thing. Why does everybody think they're the same thing? I'm a man with lots of feminist women friends. They don't hate me. They don't hate men. I hold the door for them all the time. They don't have a problem with it. Feminists may be assertive, but that doesn't mean they hate you. (And if you think it *does* mean they hate you, then--hate to break it to ya, but *you're* the one with the problem. Fraidy.)

Women do differ from men. So what? Should we treat them differently? I don't think so. 
Reply:
Things, eh? Funny that you say that, but I don't think that people are things. My opinion of that is such that we are all different. Can you find two identical people (not identical twins who are still different in character)? No. They can be similar and still they are different. So, should I treat everyone in this world differently? I will simply run out of options. Thus, I have just several models of my behaviour concerning different people with certain variations depending on the situation. But it never means that I have to apply them taking into consideration only sex or race or whatever one reason there can be. Everything in society is too complex for simple divisions based on one criterion.

Certainly there are biological differences and certainly in the brain as well as musculator and bone shape and density. This is due to genetics when chromisomes collide and prior to ANY cell growth. Mutations are carried this way.



That said feminists say that all this is irrelevant in this day and age. Yet they complain that men get more money for hanging off the side of a skyscraper than a woman gets sitting in an airconditioed office. Why aren't there any female riggers? Why aren't there equal numbers of women in sewerge collection and treatment? Why aren't there more women in garbage collection and treatment? These are all highly paid jobs yet no women apply. It seems women have no interest in breaking the glass ceilings in these highly paid boys clubs.

This is why no feminist will ever have a public debate on her claims about men. They must maintain the victim status of men whilst claiming women are much better and smarter. Naturally, of course, feminists fail to explain that every time boys and girls are pitted together in an intelligence test and even though boys are disadvantaged at school boys always win.

What you must remember is that feminist notions are ALWAYS the opposite to reality so they have to tell outright lies, grossly misuse statistics and use urban myths to prove their point. I have not found one negative comment made by any feminist anywhere at any time to be true.

Is selfishness a bad thing?



Richard Dawkins might disagree.

Is it even possible to be completeley unselfish, and not look out for your own interests?  And what would that society look like?  What are your thoughts on selfish people?  :-)

It's hard to define.

For example, is protecting my child "selfish"? After all, the reason why I would protect her is because I wouldn't want to experience the emotional distress that I would experience if she were hurt or scared.

Were my parents or my spouse to become incapacitated and on breathing/feeding tubes, and it was up to me to make the choice to stop treatment, keeping them alive would probably be the selfish option (since none of them would want to live that way), but the reason I would find it hard to let go was due to love.

I think the question on selfishness in personal human relationships in general should be replaced with a question on fairness, justice (you should give and take in equal amounts) and that selfishness should stop being viewed as one of the major vices at all times, since it is certainly a matter of degree, as many people here have already pointed out.

If our society as we know it turned to one full of altruistic people, it would certainly cease to function. Selfishness is fundamental.

It would depend on how far it goes. If you have absolutely no regard for the feelings or well-being of others, then it's bad. If you look out for your own interests when you have to, then it's not. Even the most seemingly altruistic people are probably at least somewhat in it for the thrill of making people happy and the accolades that follow.

It's not possible, and even if it were, it would not be healthy. Everyone has to be selfish to some degree, because if you can't take care of yourself, how can you take care of others? People (usually women) who look out only for others become run-down and bitter. The key is to find and maintain that line between selfish and narcissistic.

There's such a thing as looking out for yourself - not letting yourself be taken advantage of - that's not selfish in any way. Then there's total devotion to self - which is selfish.

Complete selflessness can be as bad as complete selfishness. If you are completely selfless then you are open to being taken advantage of by selfish people.

Balance is everything - too selfish is bad. Too unselfish is also bad. People are not totally selfish (Dawkins was not totally right, and many scientists have shown this) - and a totally selfish society would be a bad place in which to live. But a totally unselfish society - nothing would ever get done. Martyrism does not work well in the real world.

A lot of people have this the wrong way up. Dawkins only states that genes 'selfishly' protect their own survival. 
In some cases this leads to acts we might label altruistic, and in other cases as selfish. His main thrust has always been to recognise this as biological fact so that we can overcome its worst excesses in civillised society.

People need to read Dawkins much more closely.

Well don't know about everyone but this situation do arise at times. Also the reason for fell out depends on certain cases. Usually in cases where u say "never spoke to again", the reason may be EGO either from any side or may be some IMP reasons which does not lead any of them to talk to each other again. This reasons may include family, society, traditions etc. So I think one should understand the importance of friend or the other things(family, society, traditions) and accordingly leave the friends forever.... :(

You gotta get confident bro.  If you don't get confident (not arrogant, not narcissistic), just confident in your own skin, you won't get the girls you want.  If you don't have this confidence in yourself, they'll smell it and you'll never get the quality girls you want.

No hot girl wants a guy who doesn't have confidence.  The only way to gain confidence is to get fit, stay fit and take pride in who you are.  There ain't no magic to this.

Practice makes perfect. If you want to meet women, you'll simply have to come out of your comfort zone a bit and try to strike conversation, or at least say "hi". The more you do this the more you'll see it isn't as big of a deal as you're making it.

As Gaspari said, you need to get confident.  The only way that you will be confident in your ability to talk with women is for you to do it...ALOT.  When I first started out in the game, I just came up with three very simple routines.  I would then rotate my material between conversations.  Any good routine has an Opener; "Hi my name is ____, that's a nice_____ that you're wearing."  You need a transition with a time restraint.  The time restraint is important because it allieviates her need to find a way to squirm out of the conversation.  She knows that you will be leaving in a few minutes so why bother; she might as well listen to what you have to say.  "So, what class is that book for?  English?  That's where I'm headed right now, I don't imagine we have the same professor do we?  Last week in class we were reading the most boring book...(go on to converse about your shared experience reading something you hate or what book you loved)  Finally, "I'm going to be late for class, do you drink coffee?"  "I think you should buy me a cup of coffee after class."  "No?"  "Alright, I'll buy you a cup."  "Well, do you want me to use smoke signals to let you know when I get out of class or are you going to give me your phone number?"  This is just a very simple example of a routine.  If you already know basically what you are going to say, it will help you deliver it with confidence.  Use your small set of routines over and over until you are really good at them.  After you master these routines, create more.  Create ones which are specialized for certain types of women.  I have been gaming for about 6 years and I have over 100 routines. Some are very specialized and some are borrowed from people more talented than myself.  Just get out there and do it or sit around and regret not doing it.

I was very slow (out of the gates) I made up a questionnaire and asked girls fifteen questions including where they came from do they party. if invited to a frat party would they come and if they came would they bring extra girls if admission was waved&gt; what their favorite sport was is they surfed, or liked to dance. how old they were and their phone number and you know what I thought was not much to offer I asked five girls a day for a week and then went back to find them and talk again to them (on the questionnaire I wrote notes like what she looked like and hair style and where on campus and what day and time I met and did the questionnaire with her) that way on the same day around the same time I had a better chance of seeing her again and it worked I became confident and started dating a few really nice girls I met that way.

This is exactly what happens to me.
But for a different thing. Going out
It seems to cause so much hassle when a girl in my family leaves the house but the boy may never return and it is deemed ok. When I say why is he allowed out, answer is BECAUSE HE IS A BOY. It annoys the day lights out of me

umm I've been to Dubai a few times, you dont need to wear one there.  At least none of the Americans do.



....I'm not sure what to say to this Q all the way around tbh.

Dubai is located in the UAE which is one of the most liberal of middle east countries...so "the romans arnt wearing one neither should you"
In fact your more likely to insult people by wearing one in that country, as it's reserved for the very religious.

I think safety.  You are in a different country which has a different culture.  Remember you are a guest in this country and you are expected to follow their rules.  I am NOT saying the rules are ok or alright, but you MUST follow them.  It will be over shortly and when you are home you can wear the t-shirt.  I don't have any good way to defend your mom calling you a ****--that's just abhorrent and as a mother, I will apologize to you on her behalf.  Good luck sweetie

I don't know that your mom is sexist as much as overprotective. However, in an Arab country, being modest as a woman can be considered a display of cultural sensitivity. Why don't you ask your mom to explain why her reaction was so strong? What was she wearing?

.... there is this saying "when in rome, do as the romans"

When female friends of mine were on active duty in Iraq, they were required to wear a head scarf if they were leaving the base.  Is it sexist? Yes. The men did not have to.  Was it protecting them from extremists with guns. YES!!

You're mother isn't being sexist, she's trying to keep you safe.  Whatever the actual circumstances are in Dubai, she felt that covering you up was the best way to protect you.  Until you move out on your own, get used to it.  It's her perogative.  It's far better than how you'd feel about her if you wore the tee-shirt and got hurt.  If it bothers you THAT much, don't go on vacation? (lol, my mother would have simply left me home with relatives on the next trip - her money, her trip, her rules)

And get over the fact that the whole world isn't gender nuetral.  I'm a feminist and fairly liberal, but I'm not about to risk being raped or killed for it.  If someone told me in a foreign country, this is the best way to protect yourself, I would definatly do it.

I have a problem overall with parents having any say whatsoever with what their children choose to wear after the child is old enough to dress himself.  As for traveling, if the stupid country wants my tourist dollars they are just going to have to get their knickers unknotted over whatever I choose to wear.  People are fashion nazi's, that for sure.  That acculturated tyranny has to stop and we stop it by ignoring those perverted anal "rules" and dressing the way we want to.

I probably would have just covered up for the sake of argument. However, your mother was a little out of line calling you a ****. That's BS.

I would ask your mother why she felt the need to call you that, when you were simply asking why you should cover up. I think she did have your best interests at heart, but completely defeated the purpose by losing her cool like that. 
Unfortunately, my mother did the same thing. I couldn't wear sleeveless because she thought I looked cheap. I wish mothers would understand being that difficult with their daughters only makes them want to rebel more.
But I bet you both set out to hurt each others feelings, so I think an apology is in order for both of you.

If it were a simple matter of her trying to protect you in a foreign country, I doubt she would have called you a ****. She would have simply told you that you were in a foreign country and needed to be safe. It sounds like she is most definitely sexist since she lets your brother stay out late but not you.



Sadly, there's not much you can do. My Dad was something of a misogynist, and all I could do from age 14 until 18 was count down the days until I could legally move out and in the meantime clutch my b*tch magazine and use it as a reminder that not all people held the same beliefs my Dad did. Nothing I told him was enough to convince him that his attitudes towards women were screwed up (he used to tell me about this fantasy he had where he married a young woman, had two babies with her, then divorced her and married a new wife. It was disgusting.) They're your family and you have to take the good with the bad when it comes to family members.

I've noticed that most of the other people who answered here dodged the part about your having to be in early but your brother gets to stay out as late as he wants. It is a double standard, especially if he is younger than you are. She is perpetuating the notion that girls are totally incapable of caring for themselves and need to be "protected" by being kept under house arrest while boys can run loose and do anything they want to do. This is precisely the sort of thing that causes bad behavior in boys. They are not being taught responsibility nor are being taught any sort of self-control. They learn that their actions will have no consequences for them.

i think she was just doing it to protect you from people who would find what we take for granted as offensive or as a sexual invitation. however i think it is unfair for your mother to assume that your brother can look after himself. no one can truely be safe at 4 am on there own.



my mum had 3 brother and the goings on in her family sound similar even today. i'm pleased i only have a sister and they all only had all boys or girls so the uneven gender division stopped with my grandparents. it is shocking and because he is a boy is'nt a good enough excuse.

I think the fact that your mother called you a s*** is more important.  That was incredibly disrespectful and an appalling example for her to set!  Most parents are more liberal with boys simply because, in general, it's usually girls who are on the receiving end of the sex crime statistics.  Aside from negotiating some changes, there's little you can do.  But maybe you CAN have a chat with your mum about how she spoke to you, and point out how hurtful that was for you.  Another point is why your mum reacted as she did.  Maybe there are hidden issues for her regarding safety.  Perhaps she has had a bad experience in the past.  Tread carefully in any conversations you do have with her on the subject, just in case.  And start any conversation off by telling her that you respect her opinion and understand that she's trying to protect you, but... Hopefully, that will make her less defensive.  But if you can't talk to her or your dad, there's not much you can do - except act maturely, don't throw paddies over this and hope that eventually your mature responses will make a difference.

I felt just like you when I was a teenager, but when I grew up a bit I realized that most of my family’s “don’t” were for my own protection. You see women are equal to men, but equal doesn’t mean identical. In other words your brother cannot be attacked and raped just as easily as you can be attacked and raped. The number of kidnapped women is over multiple than that of men. Being 6’5” and male doesn’t make your brother better, it just makes him safer!
(Of course she should have never called you a ****, you're right to be angry there!)

Its disgraceful what shes asking you to do...the t-shirt thing i can just about understand, but the double standards over going out? which one of you is older? thats totaly unfair....why does she assume that rapists are the only trouble out there? what about muggers? muggers normally attack men more than women....stats show that to be the case. Men under 25 are the overwhelming majority of victims of all muggings reported to the police. rape is only one kind or trouble,what about drugs and sex? those two other things could apply to men or women.

Your mother was not being sexist, she was doing what most mothers of sons do and uphold their right to be treated in a 'privileged' way!  What did you think would happen in Dubai? You would be able to walk around in a bikini and sarong?

Next time don't weaken your argument by accusing your mother of something she is incapable of being...tell her the truth, she is colluding with a system that allows men and boys to have so much more freedom of movement than women and girls, that makes her a collaborator and traitor to her gender!  Not a sexist...tell her to free herself by challenging her self loathing as a woman, put the burkka on your brother, cut your hair and stick on a fake moustache and walk the streets of Dubai passing as a young muslim boy!

It all depends on where they live and what the weather is!  I live in Texas where the temperature rises above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (above 20 degrees Celsius) in the summer.  If you wore woollen anything in that kind of weather, you'd just keel over and die!  We tend to wear as little as possible, let me tell me you!  Short shorts, sleeveless blouses, nothing on the head (although I do wear a hat to keep the sun off the face -- avoiding future skin cancer, you see, but most palefaces want a tan).  And if they live in small towns, they nod the head and say "Howdy" here.  In California, if you say "howdy," people think there's something wrong with you!  In big cities, people do something that sociologists call "Civil Inattention."  That means, when you get close enough to speak, you let your eyes glaze over, you glance away from the person's face or you look at the ground or the sky -- anything so you don't meet their gaze, which is rather like a threat (kind of like with gorillas, you see).  And you mustn't speak or you will thought a panhandler, begging for spare change.  Rather sad, isn't it?
Since I live in a medium-size city, I never know which to do!  So I keep glancing from the sky to the person to the ground to the person ... until we're past.  I keep hoping the person will speak first, so I can go ahead and speak.  But I don't dare make the first move.  What a coward!

What are womens views on guys who crossdress?



I am just wondering what are womens view on guys who crossdress. So if  a guy wants to wear skirts,dresses, panties,heels, makeup would you support him if he asked for your support.



Lets say  your workplace had a rule prohibiting men  from wearing womens clothing. Wo/ the fear of getting terminated, would you support a petition that allowed him to wear a dress or a skirt?Why or why not?

In the workplace, clothing should be modest of course. But, if a man wants to wear a woman's suit, then by all means go right ahead. I would support him.

I think a person should be able to wear whatever they want.  We as people  always want to live up to this stupid society code and worry about what other people think or what they seem to think is appropriate.  Live and let live no one can tell anyone what to wear.  I mean you would hope that you hired a person that values their job and will up hold the up most integrity and wear the appropriate attire.  If they are reckless in what they wear without using sound judgment then maybe they shouldn't be working for that particular company anyways.  We have no right to set a criteria for who should wear a skirt or should wear pants or who can wear a tie or whatever.  I would just say dress appropiate for the occasion.

I know people have issues, but this is a problem... Ok? A guy shouldn't feel that putting on panties or stockings is a good thing. Why? Because a man wouldn't. It's ok to want a facial or a massage. That's for the body and it feels good. But, to want to dawn female specific stuff is a warning that professional help should be sought. For all the guy knows he could have been abused as a youth, yet repressing it....

If women are allowed to wear pants, and furthermore, men's clothes, be a tomboy, and act masculine, and I won't discriminate against her for that -- then I won't discriminate against a guy that wears makeup and gets pedicures & manicures. Good for him and his androgyny.

try listening for a more in depth meaning! 
She is telling you about her day and so in so what they wore! 
these are all signs on who she is!  what she likes what she don't what bugs her!  if you at all care about some of the women who talk they are giving you little logical hints or pieces of a puzzle for you to piece together.. are you man enough to do the puzzle???

It's only your opinion that we "say so little" - you may just not be listening to everything.  But, you're entitled to your opinion, so I won't argue the point.  However, you asked why, so here's some insight.
I personally talk a lot because I just enjoy talking, simple as that.  I also enjoy listening - I just enjoy conversation in general.
The problem may be that you're just spending time around the wrong women.  I won't deny that there are some yappy chicks out there who just drone on about nothing.  Avoid those and find women who are intelligent, educated, and have something meaningful to say.  But bear in mind that those women may still like to talk a lot.
For the most part, it's ingrained in us.  For centuries, women have been in villages together - raising children, preparing food, and taking care of the home.  Everyone had to communicate and work together to get things done, so that meant a lot of talking... to the children... to the other women... The men would be out hunting, which means they needed to be quiet, even when hunting in a group.  Talking had to be very limited - in other words, whatever they had to say, it better da*n well be important.
Ultimately, you're probably just not interested in what they're talking about.  Men can go on and on and on about nothing too.  But to them, it's not nothing.  If a group of women are together and a group of men are together (like in a bar or restaurant), neither group will usually talk more or less than the other group.  They're all finally among people who like to talk about the same things, so they do.  It's all relative.

Edit: Big surprise - a thumbs down.  Oops... looks like I talked too much.  God forbid I use more than one sentence to answer.  For all the guys who don't want to listen to women, that's fine - just don't spend time with them.  I don't like NASCAR, therefore I don't watch it.  It's an EXTRAORDINARILY SIMPLE concept.

The lower classes would do rough domestic/farm work, taking their babies with them.  Or, as the Industrial Revolution swept the country, they slaved in factories.

Single working class women (from the age of 11 upward) would be put into service in the houses of the wealthy.

Educated women (able to read, write, sew, knit) might teach in schools or work as governesses.

Apart from "the world's oldest profession?"  (which was very widespread in that era despite all their so-called high morals.)

Women in the Victorian era were primarily

homemakers but they also helped to run the farms

domestic service such as maids, governesses, nursemaids, laundresses

in urban areas, some worked in factories or were seamstresses

However, as women began to go further West, the job opportunities opened up considerably more. Some of those women were...

teachers (especially in the old West where they were called "schoomarms")

nurses (and in a few cases Doctors!)

cooks
entrepreneurs/shopkeepers 
artists (like Mary Cassatt) and writers (including reporters like Nelly Bly)
actresses and singers 
hoteliers/barkeeps
homesteaders
prospectors in gold mines
stagecoach riders (such as Stagecoach Mary Fields of Montana)

Some Victorian women were even spies, professional gamblers, and outlaws!

The term Victorian covers a broad spectrum, as it covered a broad time frame-approximately 60-70 years.

Most of the upper class and middle class probably wouldn't have had jobs outside of the home, and if they did it probably was only to help tend a family business, etc.
If a woman did have to earn a living there were several options.  She could become employed as a seamstress, which payed little (unless she was lucky enough to be a dressmaker for some of the upper class).  She could do handwork to sell (embroidery, etc.)  Many women were governesses, maids, etc.  Factory work was also a possibility.  If a woman was educated, she could find employment as a teacher (or governess as stated before).  Even if she could not find work outside of the home, she could take in ironing, sewing, or washing for a busy middle class lady (upperclass women would have had a live-in maid).
Nursing and clerking (secretary) were even possibilities.
Of course, some were reduced to prostitution and begging, but those were not by any means the only options.

throughout the Victorian era, domestic service was probably the largest area of employment for working-class women.  Large numbers also worked in factories, or in sweatshops (i.e sewing clothes).  Laundry work was another way a lot of women earned a living. For middle class women, teaching was the main acceptable way to earn a living in the early part of the Victorian era, though quite a lot of women earned a living through writing.  There were many succesful women authors in the Victorian period.



From the 1850s onwards, nursing became a respectable occupation for women, due to the reforms made by Florence Nightingale to the nursing profession.  Schools of nursing were opened in England, and nursing also became a highly esteemed occupation in the USA.  A great many women worked as nurses during the civil war, about four thousand professional nurses and many more as volunteers.

Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to graduate from a USA medical school in 1850, and other women entered the medical profession in the course of the century.

Quite a lot of women began to be employed in government jobs during the Civil War, and continued to work in government posts during the later part of the Victorian era.  By 1900, a third of all government jobs in the USA were done by women.  A great many women were employed in offices, the invention of the typewriter in 1868 greatly increased employment opportunities for women in office work, by 1900 three quarters of all the USA's typists and stenographers were women.  Women were also hired as telephone switchboard operators.

A lot of women worked as sales clerks in the new department stores, by 1900 142,000 had been hired.  The work was hard but not necessarily grim.  An in-house newspaper written by the workers at the Seigel-Cooper department store was crammed with stories about who was dating and whom and comments on other workers' hairstyles, and clothing, dancing ability, and general popularity.



Library work was another area where many women were employed , they were praised at the 1876 American Library Association meeting for being "the best of listeners".

Some women went into journalism, the reporter Nellie Bly became famous in the 1880s for her 'stunt' journalism, she got herself committed to an insane asylum, posed as a homeless woman, and inserted herself into the New York deomimonde as a way of exposing conditions in the city's jails and hospitals.



In 1888, she became an international celebrity when she announced that she intended to become the first person to go around the world in eighty days.  She managed to make the trip in seventy-eight days.

Women who went out west found that they could make a lot of money in catering.  There was a shortage of good cooks, and a woman called Luzena Wilson who started cooking for miners in a mining town near Sacramento, she made $20,000 dollars in six months, which she invested in a hotel and store.  A woman wrote from California that she had made $11,000 in less than a year baking bread and cakes "in one little iron skillet".  With only a few dollars, a woman could open a makeshift boardinghouse and earn a comfortable income.



The labor shortage in the early West wiped out the normal rules about what jobs were appropriate for women.  They worked as barbers and advertised their services as doctors, lawyers, and real estate agents.  Nellie Pooler Chapman took over her husband's dental practice in Nevada City, California.  "A smart woman can do very well in this country" wrote young woman to a friend back east.  "It is the only country I was ever in where woman received anything like a just compensation for work."

Re: the comment above that says that women have been in the workforce since "the industrial revolution".  women have actually been in the workforce as long as there has been work.  There has never been a time in history when women have not worked.

Patriarchy...Illuminati....9.1… conspiracy....Imperialism.... Racism..... financial market manipulation.... ?



JFK assassination... and so on

All these examples of conspiracy to oppress (with that exception of the feminists and their patriarchy) are backed up by various bits of "hard evidence", even Illuminati and UFOs  conspiracy theorists can name names or provide footage for us.



Feminists, can you provide evidence of the patriarchy?

If there really is an enemy, wouldn't one of the following be it? 
racism, cultural superiority, social Darwinism, historical determinism, “dominion of the Elect,” “God's chosen people,” , “might makes right” The New World Order.”



Where is the patriarchy, hiding in a cave?

http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article625...



Rio... you cannot answer the question though can you? Provide me with proof, anything...



Eleanor, I did not say that I believed in the Illuminati, all I said was that that  the people that do provide a hell of a lot more evidence of their bogey man than the feminists do of theirs, how gullable are you?

Lets unite against a common enemy instead of a fictious  one?



Eleanor, LBDSMBSLBBADOLDB.. you can point out the fact that pre birth control men were the only ones available to consistently work, you can prove that there were laws that confined women to the role of nourishing a tax payer so that he may be productive, you can show me oppressive religion but you cannot show me this "patriarchy".

Patriarchy = Red herring. Hegelian Dialectic.



LBDSMBSLBBADOLDB should have read LBDSM, not sure why that happened there!



Eleanor, what you are saying is that you are concerned about your own pension,  and that is evidence of a patriarchy.
Bare in mind if it were not for the system, there would be no pension support at all and your life expectancy would be 25 to 30 years.



So anything that isn't just so for women is patriarchy. What do we call it when things aren't just so for men or boys.

Haven't you noticed that the antis here use the word "patriarchy" about ten times more than any feminist has? Why are you asking us to explain something that we no longer believe in?

Either way, when patriarchy did exist, it wasn't a conspiracy to oppress. It was just a bunch of people inadvertently thinking the same way at the same time.

Patriarchy is a theory comparable to that of institutional racism - ie, it is not that individuals are attempting to be racist, but that the system / society acts against people of a certain race, inadvertently.  For example, let's say there was a law that circumcised men could not become doctors, this would affect some races more than others.

Likewise, patriarchy is the theory that institutional systems act, often inadvertently, against women.  So before we had pregnancy and maternity leave, a woman would have to take time off sick to have a child, and too much time off sick would lead to her being sacked.



I do not concern myself too much with patriarchy, as I believe in personal, rather than social explanations / solutions to problems.  However, that is not to say that it does not exist - and as for evidence for the Illuminati, just how gullible are you?!  :-)

Edit - interestingly, many men actually make reference to a similar oppression faced by men.  For example, that the legal, health and education systems favour women.  Are they also falling foul of 'conspiracy' theories, or do they have a point?  You're free to decide either way, but you need to realise that these theories of systematic oppression are not just confined to feminism.  And as for the Illuminati, it's okay, lots of blokes believe in it.  And Star Trek.  Women understand this, and we love you anyway  :-)

Edit - I don't think you understand what patriarchy is.  No-one is suggesting a particular group of men got together and decided to oppress women, therefore I cannot show you such a group.  I cannot show you the men who decided to keep women oppressed, but I can show you many women who live in poverty due to having an insufficient pension in old age.  It is not that the system decides to be sexist, but that the system works against particular groups for various reasons.  So any stats which show current systems have a worse effect on women ARE evidence of the patriarchy, and if you are waiting for names and evidence of secret meetings, you will be waiting a long time  :-)

Firstly, as the first author indicated, questioning Feminism is unacceptable and is by it's very nature regarded as misogyny.

Secondly, evidence is not something that Feminists need to support their theses, therefore this is also an oppressive measure (quite typical of the patriarchy).

Thirdly, attempting to draw any comparisons between Feminism and anything else must indicate that one is a member of the patriarchy and misogynist.

Only a member of the secret order of the patriarchy, i.e. a misogynist would dare to ask for evidence.  Evidence-based practice is frowned upon by Feminism.

Only members of the patriarchy can be this oppressive to so much as ask for evidence.

Why don't you study Roman law, of the cultural traditions of the Middle East currently, and you will find out the the man is/was the head of the house to such an extent that they can murder members of their families legally.  That is called a PATRIARCHAL system.  Perhaps you should first look up the definition of the word patriarchy, since, if a reasonable person knew the meaning, they would recognize it when they saw it.
In the US, the 14th Amendment was first written to give women AND black men citizenship, but the Bill didn't have the support to pass, so women sacrificed their won cause so that black men could become citizens.  Leaving women out of the Constitution on purpose, despite Abigail Addams pleas to her husband John to include the words women AND men IS patriarchy.
But you already knew this..............

I am highly opposed to modern Feminism and I can't speak for them.  In general, Feminists have a rather poor understanding of embryology and/or physiology, so they are highly selective about taking very complex biologic principles and facts and using them to advance some silly agenda of supremacy, almost as if the undifferentiated embryo is the better form, and that which is acted upon by the amniotic milieu is somehow defective.

This sort of selective use/abuse of fundamental biologic principles is the sort of thing that drove the Third Reich's advancement of Eugenics, Social Darwinism and literature, the likes of that of V. Solanas' SCUM Manifesto.

It's terribly dangerous and history has proven this.  Biology and any other Natural Science should never be distorted to suit some peculiar political goal.

Women, the match is on, the big game, the Olympics or the big finals. This is the moment you want to talk, why?



Why phone then, or try to engage your man in conversation and idle chat?

How long will it take before you start to be JUST a little bit more sensitive?

We always want to talk.  Its up to you to communicate to us when would be a good time to talk and also what is and is not important to you.  We may not understand the sport you are watching and therefore dont realize that we are interrupting an important moment.  On the other hand some women might be using this as a measurement to see whats more important to you...her or the game.

Maybe if you were more sensitive to us, then we would be more sensitive to you. You interrupt us in the middle of our favorite shows so we feel we can do the same.

This is why a DVR service like Tivo will save your relationship and your sanity.

Just hit the "record" button. As long as you keep the conversation under 30 minutes, you're good to go!

You give her your full attention without missing the game, and she thinks that you gave up portions of the game just to give her your full attention. Everybody wins.

You are a very handsome gentleman but we ladies don't like to be questioned about this sort of thing.  We are strong and independent and don't need to be questioned about our ideas.  You must understand that we can beat Michael Phelps if we wanted to but we're not interested in this.

Usually because my husband isn't interested in the game either, so we're both bored and have a conversation.  He dislikes sports as much as I do and usually starts the conversation.

Fortunately we're rarely trapped in a situation where we can't change the channel and watch something interesting.

Is it my fault why I have a hard time maintaining my friendships?



've had a few friends that has just suddenly stop speaking to me for no reason at all.I have one friend I've known since junior high, so almost 12 years, I went to go visit her, at her grandmother house before she went to iraq and after that I tried calling her and emailing her, and she just ignores me, then I have another friend I've known since high school and I hadn't spoke to her in months, and she sounded very bland, questioned me about "my new boyfriend" and we talked for a few minutes and she got another call, told me she would call em back and never did,then I went to another friend of mine's birthday party, she was reallllly distant, I mean the entire time she was talking to someone else, and when I tried to talk to her, she gave one word answers, and that was a year ago and after that I never heard from her again.And so I guess my question is why would my so called friends whom I;ve knows for so long just stop suddenly talking to me? These women do not know each other at all so what gives?

Sadly, this is a very common scenario!

My own mother is so jealous of me that she's borderline psychotic. And I don't even really understand it! It stems way back when I was younger.. anytime my father even spoke to me, she found a way to get him to herself -- therefore ruining all of our relationships. My father has not once hurt me intentionally, in any way, but the woman I have as a mother has on too many occasions to even count.

Its a really sad situation.. and I can feel for you if you're going through this too. She distorted my idea of relationships for the longest time because of her intense jealousy over me -- hopefully it will be easier for you to deal with..

Good luck! &lt;3

Just read your post - what are you talking about?!

All people, male or female, of any age, of any religion has legislative protection from forced marriage.  It is, in fact, illegal to force any individual into marriage within the United Kingdom - I refer you to the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007.

That is not to say forced marriage never occurs, but it most certainly is illegal.  If criticism lies anywhere, it is at the door of ignorant people who claim and perpetuate the lie of no legislative protection.

There are also many other laws that can come into play when dealing with forced marriage - those involving kidnap, domestic abuse, assault and so forth.  I also refer you to the Family Law Act 1996.

Of course, for any legislation to be effective, it needs enforcement.  This, in part, requires the cooperation of the individual involved - understandably, this is frequently difficult. They may need to leave their families, even prosecute their families - an incredible emotional and traumatic experience for all involved.  Support agencies and the Forced Marriage Unit also need to be openly available for assistance - an area which is, no doubt, under resourced.

More recently, proposals have been made, and subsequently declined, to make amendments to the current legislation.  It was deemed, in consultation with community, asian, women and family protection groups, that current legislation was adequate - that harsher laws would lead to criminalising families and become reliant on sole individuals prosecuting their parents.  It was agreed that harsher laws would only serve to isolate victims further.

The best thing to emerge from these recent consultations is the need for greater awareness within 'at risk' communities and better training for professionals who work in arenas where forced marriage may be an issue.

I hope this has provided some enlightenment of forced marriage issues.

There is a Forced Marriage Unit operating out of the Home Office, and there are laws to cover everything from rape to abduction and illegal use of passports and applications for rights to remain.  This government has done so much more than most to highlight the problem, it is actually underpinned by domestic abuse legislation and the inroads they are making into attempting to address cultural, socio/political inequality between men and women regardless of faith!  Only Muslim women are forced to marry eh?

I suspect those men understand feminism all too well.  If you wish to discuss important issues, it would help if you started your sentences with a capital letter.

Feminists like it when women display self-esteem, so you might want to say "I" instead of "i".

I think a lot of people (not just men, but some women , unfortunately as well) are defining "feminism" in their own personal books. Despite the fact that feminism covers issues ranging from equal pay, to medical research, to abortion, to rape, to cultural oppression, some people choose to take only the things they dislike about the feminist movement and hold those things up like giant banners. Despite the fact that most feminists are just regular women who try to practice their beliefs of equality at home and in the workplace....many people want to promote a caricature of lesbians in combat boots killing babies and bashing men....it's bizarre. It's almost like if we took one tiny piece of the human rights movement (which feminism essentially is, with a female spin) and spewed all over the place how much we hate the human rights movement because (insert overblown slur about human rights here). "Feminists are whining for money to the government" is a strange argument I often see here. I've never solicted the goverment for funding. I'm a feminist. I don't know what to say - it's sad really. Feminism is so vast, how could any one person possibly agree (or disagree) with EVERYTHING ever said or done in the name of furthering female human rights? How do these people feel about the fact that female genital mutilation is occurring in north america on little girls in filthy, unsterilized environments? This is ONE battle feminists are fighting. Do those feminists have your approval? There are HUNDREDS if not thousands of worthy feminist causes. Feminism seems to be the popular doorstep of misogynism (for some people).

You'd just love the 'equality' in my place of work, which is largely an office situation employing 17 females and 10 males.
There are five Team Sections, all headed by females each earning a minimum $58,000 per annum. The only employee earning more than those five is the Manager who's a male.
By far, who are the ones taking the most days off work on Sick Leave and Domestic Leave? That's correct, - the females. By far, who are the ones doing the confrontational work? That's right, - the males.
I am the lowest paid out of the entire staff, but hey, I've only been employed here for 8 years and NEVER had one day off on Sick or Domestic Leave during that time, and my job is every bit as important as most who work here. You've guessed it, I'm a male. 
So dear poster, as a so-called 'Feminist', what would your gripe be with regard to my place of work and the 'inequality' therein?

I am in a management postion in a male dominated field my whole life.  I find that  many  men truly understand and appreciate strong women, those that do not  are intimidated by women who are intelligent, secure with themselves and have ambition and drive.  Reality is that is their deal not mine,  its about choices and I choose to move forward and keep focused on the what I am about and how I relate to people.

Some are trolls.  Others are men who have a genuine beef with the hypocricy of feminism.  If it's about female empowerment, just say so.  Don't go around spouting off this equality garbage.  Equality does not equal special treatment.  Equality of opportunity has already been obtained by the feminist movement.  Now they want to force equality of outcome.  That's not equality; it's socialism.



If you've never heard a woman complain about feminism, you haven't been on this forum very long.  There are quite a few regulars on here who are both female and anti-feminist.

Finally, the founders of your movement would be ashamed of you.  If your values are truly a fundamental truth, then no amount of ridicule should dissuade you from them.

in my opinion, women are equal.

You have absolute freedom right now- IN MY OPINION, you asking for "special help and quotas" is the same as minorities doing it.

It makes you LOOK inferior- and in need of special help.

This is THE reason- coming from a business OWNER- why women are paid less!  They get the job when someone else had higher qualifications, so the owner gets annoyed he "has" to hire her, and pays her less and doesn't give her raises.

So if you're equal- which I fully agree that you are- then STOP SAYING SO AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!! BETTER YOUR POSITION IN SOCIETY!!! IF YOU ARE EQUAL TO MEN, THEN HOW IS IT THAT MEN CAN POSSIBLY KEEP YOU DOWN???

I'm an equalist. I have issues with feminism, because despite what you preach, modern feminism is NOT about equality. You feminists never recognize the pressures and gender oppression that men/boys face. Women already have far more privileges than men, and this can easily be proven. You think sexism is a one-way street and that men don't experience it on a daily basis.

Feminism was necessary at one time, but not any more. Feminism is only relevant in the Middle East and various third world countries.

Today, modern feminism in the US and other Western nations is a bastion of misandry and its true focus is not about equality, but rather giving more privilege, prestige, and power to women at the expense of men. A woman today already has more opportunity than the average man.

And you haven't been on this forum that long if you think there aren't any women that are anti-feminists. They're for equal rights too -- they just don't believe in what feminism has become today; about special privileges for women, female supremacist philosophy, and male-bashing sexism.

There are two male viewpoints that raise their head on here time after time.  The first which I have the more respect for is the rank sexist who thinks women should be seen and not heard.  The second, the men who say 'We should be equal, but only if it does not affect their life, rights and male privilege.  Basically, not to be too pushy, perish the thought! lol

I have been here a short time. I love the assumptions that both sexes sometimes make about feminism. And yes, some women don't understand it either. 
For instance, did you know I don't wear a bra or cosmetics? 
I also don't shave my legs? 
I was shocked to find this out myself!

As for the men, we have to give them a break. Alot of them aren't so bad. And maybe, with time here, they may open more to the issue and there can be real dialogue on both sides of the issue. Don't be discouraged!

Well it could possibly be linked all the way back to your childhood. Most girls who were either spanked or roughly punished when they were kids are more likely to experience pleasure from rough housing now, so to speak.

And that is mostly because, it was the parents doing the disciplining and when your kids..you have an attachment to your parents. You love them of course. and thats the kind of affection they gave you when you were a child.

So, it sort of goes along with rough play. You want to feel close to this person so you like being rough housed cause it is in a sense a expression of rough affection.

I could be wrong. but thats how i see it.

Take Care.

If it is true that you are in a committed relationship with someone you care deeply about, then you can just try to remember that he's handling you roughly because he believes genuinely that you enjoy it. He's trying to make you happy. Maybe it's just guilt surrounding all of the connotations that come with words like "sl*t" and "whore", maybe you feel like it's wrong to enjoy something with so many negative implications, but just remember that it's all for mutual pleasure and that he doesn't really think you're a "sl*t" or any of those bad things.

Fantasy v reality?  Many people like murder films, but how many of those would murder or  want to be murdered?  Not many!  Perhaps you want to be a different person and have a more exciting life for a time, but then you realise that is not who you are or what you want out of life.  If you can keep it as a game or part of a "secret you" which you only share with your partner, then don't worry if your partner continues to show you respect.

Men are true pig *** bastards sometimes... This has no relevance to your question at all, I'm just talking about some of those BS answers you got. Anyways...

You and I are a lot alike in this way, actually. I love it when it's rough, especially if I get to have a little fun being forceful, too. But afterwards, just like with any other human being, I still want to be treated and respected as a human being. But when it comes to sex, it's really simple... It's what turns me on. However, I'm not a **** or a tramp, so I don't want to be treated or thought of like one. I only get this way every once in a long while, but when I do it's like a release of all the pent up passion in me, and so being rough is almost like the best way to get it out. Once it's out my boyfriend knows that that's it, it's over, you got your fun, you know? Lol. And we go back to our sweet, innocent, decent relationship no problem.

In your case I think the reason you like it rough is basically for the same reasons I do. But you feel used and abused afterwards because it's also a lot like what happened to you when you were a teenager. And so deep down it's like bringing back bad memories and feelings for you that you just want to forget and let go of. So you feel the same way you did when it happened after having rough sex because it's a lot like what happened. It's pretty normal, really. I'm sure a lot of females go through this if they were raped. You just gotta tell yourself, "He got the best of me physically, I am not going to let him get the better of me emotionally too."

Much luck to you.

I think many women are attracted to strong, authoritative men simply because as women, we were created by God to follow a loving husband and we are happiest when we are functioning in this role.  You might feel degraded afterwards because it sounds like even though you are "feeling" his strength and being reminded of his authority, you are not feeling loved through it.



As a woman in a Christian Domestic Discipline (loving wife spanking) marriage, people often analyze me and try to determine why I need a strong, authoritative husband.  They ask if I was spanked as a child (mildly) or if I was ever sexually abused (never), but I have spoken to dozens of women who are either in CDD marriages or want to be in one, and there is no common denominator that I can find.  Through many studies, I have come to the conclusion that it is simply in me and many other women to need to feel their husband's authority in a tangible way.  But we also have a great need to feel like he loves us through it all.  I believe one of a woman's greatest needs is to be cherished.  It sounds like you are getting that feeling of authority, but you are not feeling cherished after it is all over.

Does he cuddle you after wards and tell you he loves you?



If not ask him to start holding you after wards and talk calmly and sweetly to you, that should fix those nasty after feelings.

There's absolutely nothing wrong as long as it's consensual and it's not causing undue pain in your life.  If it's causing you severe periods of sadness/anxiety or other alterations in your normal functioning, that's when it becomes an issue, otherwise, there is zero problem.

Perhaps on some level, are you confusing fantasy with reality?  I'm one who likes to be abused in the bedroom.  My partner calls me **** and many other dirty names.  He pulls my hair, spanks and bites me, sometimes leaving bruises.  But this is all with my consent.  Actually, he wouldn't do any of that except for the fact that I enjoy it.  But this is fantasy.  If I was honestly being called a **** or abused in real life, I wouldn't stand for it.

I think you should analyze your desires to figure out why you wish for the things you do.  And you need to remind yourself, that what happens in the bedroom is fantasy only.  Even if your partner is calling you dirty names and being rough with you, it is only because you wish it.  If you didn't ask for it, he probably wouldn't want to do those things.  Talk to him.  See what he has to say about what you ask him to do to you.  If he enjoys it, ask him why.  I think having a conversation will give you deeper insight into the dynamics of your relationship, and likely give you comfort.

A lot of women who were raped have rape fantasies, people remember their sexual experiences and this arouses them later on in life whether they are good or bad.

It's a sad but at the same time arousing reminder of how bad you were treated. This happens a lot with women who were sexually abused as a child.

Just because being slapped around and called a **** arouses you sexually doesn't mean it's good for you or emotionally healthy. Your depression afterward is an indicator of this. Keep in mind that this guy is supposed to love you and having him behave towards you in a rather deviant way has an effect on you as well.

Is he getting aroused by hurting you physically and emotionally? If so, you're probably angry at him in some way for it. You are essentially putting him in the place of a rapist and you are witnessing the pleasure he's taking out of it at your expense.

Why does the media constantly portray men as idiots or buffoons?



Though I'm young, I recall shows or movies like Father Knows Best, Leave it To Beaver, To Kill A Mockingbird, etc where the men were portrayed as mature and smart. They knew how to handle business very well. Now in just about every TV commerical , movie or TV show, they are idiots who can't even make decisions without a woman's or even a kid's help. I find this insulting to my dad, my brothers and my boyfriend!

Why are women always portrayed as supporting roles.  I would love to see some good movies that feature women in starring roles.  The reason is that patriarchy is alive and well and obviously big business sees males in poor role models as money making ventures.  Too bad that women only having leading roles in porn movies which continues to objectify and dehumanize women and turn them into targets for abuse and degradation.  While we are at it why doesn't your male dominated culture do something about human trafficking,  it would seem that a country so top heavy with male representatives could show some compassion to all those who are being enslaved.  Wait at least feminism lobbies for human rights rather than whine about men not having any rights.  Feminism actually stands up for the rights of others.

You know who the majority of TV writers are? Men.

Look at all the dumbo Hollywood comedies floating around - all written, directed and (mostly) acted by men. Don't blame it on "the media" as an abstract construct, there are real, individual people behind movies.

I have to admit I am quite at a loss when it comes to that. It seems the majority of watchers (yes, watched and laughed at by men as well) want to see that. Still, think about it: the situation in society has changed. Men making decisions all on their own has shifted to families making decisions together - to a certain extent, and that's fine.

"The media" is a market that is balanced by the consumer. You will get what you want. If you ask for something, and if enough people ask for the same thing, it will be on your screens sooner or later.

Don't blame the producers, blame the viewers. Bottom line. Stop watching such rubbish.

PS: This is not so much about the way men are portrayed but goes for all that trash TV out there. ;)

Were you aware that most tv executives are male, and always were?

You need to get an education, hon.  Obviously you are too young to remember Blondie and Dagwood cartoons:

'Dagwood and Blondie marks 75 years on the comics pages'

"Hard to believe its been almost 75 years since ditzy flapper Blondie Boopadoop fell for bumbling Dagwood Bumstead in a love match made in the funny papers.

In those days, Dagwood was a rich playboy whose snooty parents greatly disapproved of the union. When he and Blondie married in 1933, the J. Boling Bumsteads disinherited their son, relegating him to a modest suburban life of raising kids, carpooling, battling blowhard boss Mr. Dithers and making really big sandwiches.

Now one of the most famous married couples in the world in one of the most widely read strips in comics history...".

There are plenty of other examples, but you should learn to do your own homework.

Well "pampered princess" doesn't really show that they prehaps are a hurdle for feminism, for all we know, she might be just as wanting of equality as us, but choose to be very materialistic.

I would say though, women who view themselves as below men (doesn't happen often, but sadly does happen) are the biggest hurdle. I mean, sexist men we can deal with by use of physical, mental and/or esteem abuse (so basically let them be loners for the rest of their lives). But women who think men are the great, we can't really drag her in and tell her why she's wrong.



In fact, it's people like that who make the rest of the females look bad, for someone of a certain group to put down their own group is basically say, "I know what women should be because I have the experience of being a women." And it's hard to argue with that, even if other women disagree.



And at least I could tell you weren't being sexist. I can tell curiosity from ... whatever else there is.



It's a shame there are (brainless) dolts in this world who can't find out all the facts before making a rude remark. Oh dear, I didn't mean to type (brainless) dolt, I meant to type (brain-dead) assumers.

Great video but deeply disturbing to me. It was that disintegrating part at the end that has me reeling right now.  I did that a few years ago.  I just realized I never got all back together since that moment.  I will, though.  Thanks for letting me see this video.  What she should do is whatever, essentially, I should do to pull myself back together in that regard.  And, it would dishonorable for me to say what she should do because I am, for some reason, not there quite myself.  As for practical steps, she needs to seek assistance from WOMEN, get away from the baboons for awhile and the bombardments.  In the state that she is in, she is experiencing heightened awareness of what is wrong all around her, in her face.  That will calm down and the injustices and hopelessness will wane in hurtfulness.  But, she's a major wreck about to happen.  She will only slide into an empty worsening increasingly weakening private hell and despair from which escape becomes even more difficult each day she remains in it.  So, she needs to actually physically LEAVE with her children and enter the system and a battered women's shelter immediately.  She needs to get smart in like a hurry and listen really closely to what professionals, especially women, are going to be saying to her, and do exactly what they advise, no hemming and hawing or calling Prince Pr*ck Charming to see if he magically grew a brain overnight and is going to "do better by her".  She needs to study the welfare system and social services and federal educational funding opportunities, special programs of any kind.  She needs to choose paths, including enlisting in the military, that she never considered before.  She needs to like NOT get in another relationship with a man until she is WELL, for at least three years.  She needs to get educated.  And, she needs to take every step she can to stay sober, stay clean, stay healthy, get really fit, take care of herself and get all the counseling humanly possible that she can.



This video is what feminism is all about.  The rise of women hasn't been about anything wrong with women wanting to be wives and mothers and building families.  It's been all about  empowering women with the legal protections and the means and the rationality to answer your question, "What would YOU do, girl-child, if you run into trouble? COULD you figure it out?  Did you pay close enough attention in school, at least as much as you did with putting make-up on every day, to have the smarts to figure your way out of a mess like this?  COULD you negotiate the social services systems and use those resources to your best advantage?  Have you been striving all along to rise and prepare yourself to withstand troubles?  Do you save as much money for bad times as you spend on television service?  Did you believe in and invest yourself or in the Prince Charming meal-ticket theory? Have you ever volunteered at a Battered Women's shelter to support other women?  Have you been reading a book or two every month, self-studying all along about basic adult requirements for rational self-determination, like psychology or economics or computer science or even know how the Equal Rights Amendment reads?"  That's feminism, the movement to empower women with the legal protections, rationality and self-determination to take care of oneself properly when the chips are down.  One cannot be free without rationality and self-determination.  Lack of freedom and miserable vulnerabilty is a CHOICE.  Only ourself today can surrender our Will and fate to others though our choices to be vulnerable and not do the hard work to always be rising.

What a great answer Patois! :-)

Yes, the images at the end, when she is breaking, are extremely disturbing , when I was a little girl, I practically saw my mother like this! :-(

My father was extremely abusive, physically and psychologically. He would do cruel things, like disappearing for three days and coming back very late at night, going to my mother's room and wake her up so she could see the lipstick on his face, and tell her something like "Do you see this?....Do you?...See?..I do what I want"....my mother told me this when I was older, up to that time, she didn't understand why he had to do this to her.



Me at the age of the child in the video, saw my father breaking an umbrella on my mother's hair, fights because my father was drunk, my father punching my mother on the face...why?...why?..Because he thought she was not submissive enough...oh...no she wasn't. She was a painter, a stay at home mom and a feminist....my father tried to break her.



When my father left, it took my mother many, many years, to trust a man again, the whole poisonous relationship broke her. She used to have kind of epileptic attacks out of high stress...they could happen anywhere...and me the little girl was so afraid of them.



All this to say, that growing seeing all this, I know that, and abusive relationship between a man and woman with a child, affects that child enormously, as well as it breaks the mother when she is th abused one. The abuser moves on, or has something else on the side. Hey my father had a second family at the same time he was with us... yea, juggling two women with his children at the same time...of course this was known many years later...devastating to my mother too, when she found out! :-(

So all this personal story, to say, that in that situation, I would leave IMMEDIATELY. I know it would be difficult as you love the man, but abuse just gets worse with time, not better. And life is too short to be with someone that treats you with so lack of respect. 
Also for the child, is terrible, he will learn that "love"  is not to be trusted...sad, ...sad.

This video should be demonstrated in schools teaching children of both genders how not to be and how to recognize the signs of abuse without confusing it with love. I would stop and take a hard look at my life and a life of my child. After that I would call police and ask for help, any and all kinds of help they can provide. I also would grab at whatever help is offered for the sake of my baby. For myself I would be trying to use this sad experience as a life lesson to be able recognize abuser and a bully as soon as he shows up in my life. So I can send him on his way, before he had a chance to do any damage to my family and myself.

"I might look through your stuff, for what I don’t wanna find
Or I might just set you up, to see if you’re all mine".

Both of these are a red card offences as far as I am concerned. The first is just way to para and the second is just a really bad game to play. If I was this lady I would seek professional help e.g. a counsellor specialising in relationships.

Edit
Just made it about halfway through the video in order to understand the above comments by Patois and Flyinghorse. What would I do in this situation? Its easier said than done but I would get out. If I had brothers I would get them to kick her stupid bf's a** and get her out of there with the child. He is a punk and doesn't deserve a woman.

Note to Patois and Flyinghorse: you are proving what I have been saying about people's motivation for becoming feminists. I really don't think having bad experiences with men is a valid reason for supporting a movement that treats all men as if they are abusers (e.g. with VAWA etc).  This would be like condoning a man who treats women like dirt just because he has been mistreated by women in the past. Part of being a mature adult is to get over you past hurt, not turn it against the world. After all you would expect no less from a man who had been hurt by a woman or women.

Edit
Btw my first answer was based on the lyrics, not the video. I didn't like the sound of the video after a few seconds so googled the lyrics instead.

Most of the time it is not the religion per se, but the people and clerics. E.g. Christianity in its central doctrine says that there is no more distinction between male and female in Christ (i.e. those who are Christians), the church has been unable to implement this in practice. Even in Buddhism, among the bhikkhus (clerics) there is discrimination. We lamas do not permit any women to claim to be reincarnation of any rinpoche. To be reborn as a woman is considered second best so how can a living buddha be second best?



Just to answer a query about disciples of Jesus in the Christian religion: it would have been difficult, or even unwise, to have a mixed band of close disciples to travel with Jesus. Imagine the sleeping arrangements and how tongues would wag. But there is evidence that the 12 men were NOT the ONLY disciples of Jesus. The band of disciples went beyond the 12, although the 12 were supposed to 'witnesses', and among the Jews, the witness of men was given greater weight. By the way, the category of male and female does not apply to God.

Christianity is not sexist towards women. People say that it is but usually what they offer as "proof" shows that they have no more than a passing acquaintance with the Bible. When you actually take the time to study out the Bible (from a source that isn't biased against Christianity in the first place), you will find that it isn't sexist. In fact, at the time of the Bible's writing, following its teachings elevated Christian wives and daughters above their nonchristian counterparts. They were treated *way better and given far more consideration and rights.

it would make no sense to follow a reliligion just because it is not sexiest. It would be self-deception because we would not follow it if it were sexiest.. probably we need to re-examine the nature of men and women, and try not to confuse patriarchy with religion. Most, if not all, of the religions have been modified along the years of human experience that is why we need to be able to distingusih the orginal from the artificial in them.

My religion is so simply; God is not a ceature and has no gender. Messengers were naturally men because no women could bear with such a responsibilty especially at those savage times.

Most religions teach that wives should be submissive to their husbands.  This was a universal social norm at the time that most religions were created, so it is not really surprising,

However, Christianity accords a higher status to women than most other religions do.  Paul said that in Christ there was neither man nor woman, Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, which was quite a radical concept for his day.



In the early centuries of Christianity, women were among the most eager converts, and were frequently instrumental in persuading their husbands to convert, as happened with Queen Bertha of Kent for example, and Queen Clotilede of the Franks, who persuaded her husband Clovis to convert.

well, in catolicsm, women were hugely important. mary magdalene most notably, the problem was the catholic church. they altered many texts etc, to undermine the role of women, (mary was never reffered to as a prostitute in original translations and texts)hence allowing the male aspect to be the main root to power.modern religion is sexist. original texts are not. its the institution of religion that has sexist intent. even in islam, women are revered in much of the koran. sara, one of mohammeds wifes, was of huge importance, they also have a huge amount of rights under sharia law, especially when it comes to divorce, which shocks alot of ppl. unfortunatly society has a huge impact on religion, usually in a bad way.

If the company or job isn't something like modeling or similar type or job, then that person would be stupid for hiring her to just have eye candy at the job, because that's only going to hurt the business as the lack of production or less production will hit the company when a person that is more qualified and skilled would be producing, therefore, benefiting the company much more.

<question>



Are first-wave feminist Suffragists rolling over in their graves at what modern feminism has become?



Most anti-feminist equalists like myself agree with the original tenets of feminism brought on by the first wave -- equal rights & opportunity for both men & women.

Today, modern feminism has been corrupted by radicalist misandry. Modern feminists have perversed feminism in the same way that Muslim extremists have perversed Islam.

Would the original feminists side with the tenets of modern feminists; male-bashing, anti-male discrimination, preferential treatment & privilege for women, female chauvinism, sexism, and female supremacy?

The original Feminists (women's rights advocates) simply wanted fairness.  They never wished for supremacy or revenge.  If they could see what modern Feminism has corrupted their righteous cause into they'd roll over quite a bit in their graves.

This modern Feminism is all about supremacy by any means.

The fact that most leaders are still male show that patriarchy is still the SYSTEM that most countries subscribe too.  That and the number of women murdered by intimate partner shows that the war on women is still ongoing and I think the original feminist would be proud their granddaughters still carry the torch and hope for equality, so their daughter won't be terrorized by rape and abuse.

The greatest lie from feminists today is that the early leaders of first-wave feminism would support modern feminism.  It tries to create legitimacy by connecting with the past. In reality, a lot of the early feminists had strong conservative values.  For example, a lot of the first-wave feminist were anti-abortionists. I have no doubt that many would be horrified to what see what their simple civil rights movement had produced in 2008.

I'm white..I shower twice a day, I use a loofah.

I also own about 20+ different bottles of lotion from bath and body works on top of all the other bath stuff I buy thru Victoria's Secret. I spend $150 on my hair every 6 weeks. I have real hair..I don't get a weave, I pay for color and cut.



As far as using hands to shower..it's not a problem..if that's their preference. Using a sponge just helps to get rid of dead skin.



I shave everything..except the hair on my head. Legs, arm pits, bikini line and basically all the hair down there.



White or black or whatever color..we're all human and as such we all have different habits. Like with the weave..a lot of african american women get that done and its expensive.

I'm white, and I use exfoliating gloves or a loofah to wash myself with. I try to use good, caring products on my hair because I use straighteners.

The reason why black women spend a lot of money on hair is because if they want a good weave they have to pay a lot of money for it, same with hair extensions. My friend told me this.

I don't know much about East Asian, but you do see their hair a lot more, but that's just because it comes out black most of the time, and with white women it comes out blonde everywhere apart from armpit and you-know-where, unless you're naturally blonde.

Why should your employer pay for your babies?



Time off unpaid, I can accept. (even if your colleagues might be annoyed at all the extra work they have to do).

But for your employer to be forced to pay you to take time off to have your babies, when it has absolutely no benefit to them whatsoever... why? At a time when the world is ridiculously overpopulated?

Feminism isn't about just having their cake and eating it (what's the point of a cake if you don't eat it?) It's about having other people's cakes and eating them too.



Kat V: it's not a choice employers make in most cases. It is something forced on them by law. If it benefitted employers, like feminists like to pretend, there would be no need for laws forcing it.



king_khan: answer the point instead of insulting me. Employers don't have it their way all the time; look how many small businesses go bust every week. My father is self employed and couldn't afford to pay someone to take time off whenever they felt like it.

I am not suggesting women stop having children; I am suggesting that they save up for them (you know, like they happily do for their holidays, shoes etc.) and pay for them themselves.

In the mind of the true Feminist, rearing of the child is something she should be compensated for by someone, anyone, whether it's the company for whom she works or some man down the street.

Asking why a Feminist expects to be paid for having/raising a child is like asking me why I'd like to have a tree that grows money in my backyard -- it's just too damn easy.

Much of Feminism is about having their cake and eating it too.

Well, I agree with J- it's so they don't have to train new staff.  In some countries, men can also apply for paternal leave- although it is not as long as the maternal leave.



As for the employers, they employ women, and women get pregnant.  It's a fact of life.

Edit: Last I heard, employers are allowed to choose candidates.  They can discriminate based on gender, as long as they are very careful about it.  My friend was fired because she fell pregnant.  She can't  go after them for it - they never said WHY  she was being let go.  It happens.

Are you an idiot?  If women stopped having children because they couldn't afford to take time off from work...we'd have a serious problem.  Only rich women with no ambitions but to stay home can afford to live on one salary alone.  Women also want to work as well.  What should they do for the time that they are out?  If a worker takes unpaid leave, that is disrespectful to the worker who has worked hard for the company.

Stop siding with the employer.  He / she has everything going for them.  The bosses and employers can raise their own salaries, make their own hours...please.  They live in heaven compared to the middle class laborer.



Women are part of the workforce and they are bearing our kids.  I think you need to be much more respectful to them.  How would you like this to happen to your mother, aunt, sister or grandmother?  Shame on you.  Modern women might be demanding, but bearing a child is a good excuse for missing work and getting paid for it.  If it was something that they could brush off, they'd be at the club instead of at the hospital.  Come on, stop being jealous of them and focus on your own work, goals and aspirations.

Not all employers have to pay maternity pay. If they don't you can get STP which the government pay through the employer. And now men can also do this.  Not for as long but they can get time off called Paternity pay. Were would the world be if women could not afford to leave work for a few months to have children that are our future. I think that as a man you just feel like you should be given a few months off paid holiday once every few years. But trust me being a mother is a 24 hour job. No holiday and no sick pay. Men have got a good deal.

It is a feminist example of "equality".



If an equal counter balance was added to the system(a benefit designed primarily for males) they would scream till the earth shook about not getting it.



You are right. Feminism is based upon school yard bullying in a sense.



They want everything and have no consideration for anyone else.



---------------
Yawn. The reason why the USA has a high infant mortality is because in other countrys if the baby dies before it leaves the hospital it is recorded the same as death at birth.

The USA is the only country that makes a large effort to save the infant. Once the infant is born, no matter how sickly it is the infant is recorded as being alive.

And as for the world being designed to suit men, the history books often paint a different reality. Before the American revolution government existed for the sake of itself.



Sure the majority of the ruling class was male, but there was also female rulers that where just as evil as there male counterparts.



And the feminist notion of reordering the world to suit there needs is a clear example of feminist hatred. Society should serve the needs of those that belong to society.



It is just as evil to have a female oirented society as it is to have a male oriented society.



But often the ignorant are blinded by there own bias.
----
Men as a voting block have been ignored for the last 20 years. The government routinely pass's anti male law's, bar's men from abuse shelters even though our tax dollars help to fund them. Ignores rampant sexism against males in the local and college level educational system.



While time and time again we are told to "take one for the team". Enough is enough. How much more can we be expected to take?



I say we should demand equality and an end to special privileges.

Many ego-fragile men so badly want to feel superior that it's a shock and frightening for them to see women as equals.  It's intellectually challenging for such so-called men to see women and children as much a part of society as they are.  Men have thought for a long time that society is supposed to serve men only and they designed it to serve men specifically.  Men have budgeted for and designed public toilet facilities, for example, to serve the male body's needs and have expected women to just "make do" with the number of toilets that are suitable for men and not for the reality of female body needs.



Women got legal protections for their rights and have begun to redesign society to better suit the needs of women and children and not just for the needs of men, especially in the tsunami of cultural changes that the Industrial Revolution caused.  We as a society, for example, when we transitioned from horse and buggies to automobiles, decided as a society of taxpayers to support working men and end the practice of toll roads.  We built elaborate highway systems and bridges to gease the skids of commerce that led to prosperity as we grew and evolved within a more complex technological society.  And we choose nobly and wisely to spread the cost of that over the ALL of us.



The Industrial Revolution changed our entire culture and economy and women had to enter the workforce en masse to help support their families long before "hairy-legged feminists".  We as a society need to face that reality honestly, do right by our children and figure out how best to take care of the children of working parents and spread the cost of that over the ALL of us.  Developed nations with large numbers of women entering the workforce began doing that over 30-40 years ago and now enjoy a far higher standard of living than the U.S. today, lower crime rates and social welfare costs, and their children enjoy the highest academic scores in the world.



I mean, have you seen the shocking infant mortality rate for the U.S.? Our shockingly low math and science scores?  How can we truly remain economic leaders in the world as business owners if our kids are so poorly educated that they can't compete in the global job market or if we can't maintain an adequate pool of engineers and scientists?  How can men be proud of that in these modern times if we are supposed to be such a rich and great nation?  What's so great about a stupid nation that can't properly take care of it's children without resorting to male and conservative irrational feeble-minded backward hysterics about how it's all working women's "fault"? Women and liberals apparently must lead in this issue because many men and most conservatives and religious freaks are too wrapped up in their petty self-serving greedy male entitlement backward troglodyte Master/Slave paradigms to do what is reasonable and right in this matter as a voting block for our children's sakes and futures in our modern reality.



Men as a voting block in the U.S. should be ashamed of themselves for how they refuse to set aside their self-serving egotistical social designs and outrageously let children suffer in the transition.  I keep saying that if morons actually believe that children should suffer until women return to their kitchens and assume their "traditional" roles, we should give them exactly that.  Working women should strike, go home, draw a welfare check and let martial law take over as society falls apart until we have what we NEED, quality childcare, universal health care for children, better schools for our children, a better family-friendly economy and work conditions including paternity/maternity leave and respect for workers who have children.  Where do people get off thinking that working parents and children don't have rights in a society?

Edit: You asked so many questions does it make any difference which one I answered?  I thought about answering your "sorta" question about overpopulation at first because I didn't want you to embarrass yourself anymore and felt sorry for you  a little for not knowing that overpopulation is far from any kind of concern these days in light of the more informed nugget of reality related to the alarming near species-ending decline in fertility rates worldwide that has rational people gravely worried.  I hope that information empowers you. Many nations are now offering women lots of cash to breed and people should prepare themselves for much more of that in this century and for a shift in sentiment away from tolerating any discriminations against reproductive working women.  But, I decided to answer one of your questions related to why and WHO should be paying for workers' children.  I do not think it is right for the employer to do so.  I stated an argument in favor of spreading that cost over tax-payers.  Are you still confused?

Women working and having children aren't just doing it for their own fun, both those things are necessary for society and the economy, hence the government is interested in insuring that the women can do both. Working and having children isn't as much "getting everything" as "giving everything".



The employer IS interested in women having children, because he/she is also a part of society, and will grow old some day, and will need that next generation to work and keep society able to take care of its old. Babies are not like holidays and shoes.

If you think the world is overpopulated, tough crap. The success of your countrie's economy depends on growth of the population. After you change that, then you will be able to complain about selfish women having babies just for their own kicks and still expecting to get something back from society.

I have to say I agree. Being pregnant myself, I know paid parental leave would be very nice, and it is something that employers should at least consider, especially if they have a really good employee who's worked for them really hard for a long time, but I think whether or not to offer it should definitely be the decision of the employer, not the law. The fact is, my employer did not make me pregnant. That's something I chose to do, and whether or not I could afford the financial burdens that go along with that, including taking time off work, is something I should've been, and was, thinking about before I made my baby in the first place. I'm not trying to be judgmental of anyone. I realize things happen in life that people don't expect or plan for, but that's not just the case with having kids, that goes for most anything. If you bought a new motorcycle on credit and had an accident, receiving a broken leg that kept you from working for awhile, well that situation sucks for you: you're not going to be able to have some income for awhile and you're gonna have new expenses, but what does that have to do with your employer? Should he be expected to pay you for a time in which you won't be useful to him? You have every right to take time off to recover and have your job secure when you're better, and you have a right to dip into whatever benefits you have available as far as sick hours, vacation hours, etc,. but is it unreasonable to expect you to do that? After all, that's what you have those benefits for, and if you don't have those benefits, that's unfortunate too, but once again, how much can you really expect your job to take care of you in your personal life? I don't see pregnancy and maternity leave as any different than any other circumstance that would take you away from work for awhile. People need to realize there is no benefit without some kind of sacrifice. If employers had to offer paid parental leave, it would cost companies outrageous amounts of money, requiring them to compensate for these costs in various ways, because not only would they have to pay the workers taking off, but also their replacements, which would quickly mount up, especially for big companies with many employees, amounting to thousands of dollars a year. That would have to be made up some way, possibly requiring cuts in employee pay and benefits, not to mention, the cost of goods and services would go way up. So in the end, do even the ones that expect to benefit from paid leave really do just that? The money has to come from somewhere, and if not from the employer or other employees, then where? The government? Should it be tax payers' responsibility to provide for other people's families? I believe that's called welfare. My husband and I have worked hard to have the life we now have and we see it as our responsibility to take care of the child we've made together. It's no one else's responsibility to take care of us and it's not our responsibility to take care of anyone else. I realize people make mistakes and shouldn't have to pay for them for life but other people shouldn't have to pay for it either, be it families, friends, employers, coworkers, or taxpayers. I'm not trying to sound preachy or holier than thou, but I am not nor have I ever been close to wealthy and I've never relied on anybody to help fix a mess I've made. I deliberately did everything I could to delay having kids until I had researched the financial and emotional burdens of it and made certain I had the ability to shoulder such burdens and I feel strongly that others should feel obligated to do the same thing.

We also have to raise the child because the daddies go to work or are just plain useless is upbringing! On top of it we have to do all the house work, which includes washing daddies underpants and socks, irioning his shirt and cooking dinner for him (goooshh women are sooo underpaid!!!) and we cant persue in our careers because then the house work get neglected and the child!

It takes two people to make a baby. If men want women to look after their children instead of contributing equally, they should be willing to pay for that privelage. Women aren't taking time off work 'whenever they feel like it', but to go through an extremely intense time. They're taking time off work to provide for the children that both men and women create.

Woman often don't want to choose between giving up work to look after their children but find themselves biologically tied to them meaning the choice is made for them. What's wrong with that? You can't make me feel guilty for caring for my child properly in its first months of its life. But that's not women's primary use in life. What are we supposed to do after the few months we spend caring for the children men help create? Sit around looking pretty so that we can be accused the next minute of not contributing? Why should we be punished for our biology when we are actually providing something that men are not willing to. Remember, fathers are also entitled to paternal leave but may not be so keen to take it because it 'de-masculinates' them which is a pathetic excuse not to take care of their children.

Also, it's not like women are getting free money The amount a women gets paid during maternity leave depends on wages earned during previous calendar year.

I actually agree with you. I don't think that it's fair on the employer to have to pay maternity leave plus a salary for a temp until, and IF, the employee returns to work.  I have known a few women who KNEW they wouldn't be returning to work, however they did not inform their employers of this because they didn't want to 'lose' their maternity pay.



For example: Let's take an admin assistant who is salaried at 15k. She know she isn't going back to work but decides to take 5.5K off the company anyway ..... is that fair? Is that equality? No to both.



I think maternity/paternity leave should be unpaid so the employer only has to pay one salary instead of two but the position should be keep open for when/if the woman decides to return.



It's not the same as time off for sickess ...... no one CHOOSE to be sick.

because if the woman is pregnant and the man has left here, like the do so often, he is also "pregnant" (u know like when couples say "WE'RE PREGNANT!") but unlike the poor woman he has left exhauseted and sometimes ill with being pregnant, he can continue to work and earn money, whereas she NEEDS money for the new baby, but cant because pregnancy kind of counts as an illness as it causes many problems towards the end that means you cannot work!!!



so when they're off having babies, when there is no man there to support them, and they need time to recover from ripping their bodies appart, how are they going to pay for nappies, food, a crib etc?????



edit; a man would get paid if he was off for a few months with severe back problems which may have been causes by playing football, which was his own decision, and self inflicted, like you say pregnancy is. so why shouldnt a woman get time off towards the end of the pregnancy when she is most deffinately uncomfertable and is experiencing pain?

This is a toughie.  I am a female and have had children but I agree that it can be extremely difficult for smaller business to cope with the financial stresses of maternity leave.  They usually have to pay someone to fill the vacated position as well as fork out for maternity pay.  Plus, employment law is getting a bit silly in this field and, ultimately, it's young women of childbearing age who'll lose out.  If I were an employer, I would avoid them like the plague (discreetly, of course).  Whilst it may seem right now that women can have it all, if things continue as they are then it's only a matter of time before it all blows up in our faces and we're back to square one.  Moderation is the answer here, I think.  We have to consider the rights of the employer as well as those of the employee.

"Why do modern women want everything, but seem unwilling to make any personal sacrifices at all?"

Shows your ignorance/immaturity. As a "modern woman" aged 50+ let me suggest to you some personal sacrifices.

Women, generally, even these days earn less.
Women, generally, have to work 150% harder to prove themselves worthy of promotion.

Given current legislation your question is not well founded. Because these days there are paternity leave rights as well as maternity.

I accept your comments about the effect of that on small business but I do not accept your comments about this being the fault of selfish women.
Women, generally, are expected still to bear the brunt of childcare so if a child is ill it is mother who is expected to take time off to care - not father.

Simple fact of the matter is that it is actually men who still, and always have, wanted everything but never been prepared to make sacrifices.

Apart for a scant few years out when my sons where under 5 years old I have worked. But I made a decision that it was more important for me to be at home with them than to be a working mother. Yes, my choice, but do not think for a minute that it was at no cost to me in terms of the family income, my contribution to the Inland Revenue and, for me somewhat important, the failure to achieve in the workplace what I could have because.......silly me, I chose to care for my sons at the  expence of personal progress and ambition.
So, the up shot is......if I had not taken that time out for my sons I may well have achieved more in my work life. So what? My sons mean more to me than what may have been had I been, as many men are, career driven.

After reading your question, it appears you are only asking it based on two huge, inaccurate assumptions on your part.  The first, is that employers pay Maternity (not for babies as you suggested, but in fact, for 'leave' due to pregnancy).  The second inaccurate assumption is that it has no benefit to an organisation.

So, to deal with your first inaccuracy - Maternity Leave.  Although a woman may indeed receive her maternity pay, on her usual payslip, with the usual deductions from her employer, this money is recovered by that company from the government.  Larger companies, do indeed, pay some maternity - but 92% is recovered from government via NI/PAYE.  Small companies are in no worse position (despite the old argument that it is unfair or difficult for small companies to employ women of child bearing age).  Small companies, those whose National Insurance contributions are under £45,000, are reimbursed 100% of the Statutory Maternity Pay PLUS an extra 4.5% 'compensation'!



So it is, in fact, the Government and Society, who pick up the 'perceived burden' of Maternity Pay.  This is because intelligent, sensible society recognise the need to have children and create the next generation, and of course, the biological constraints that only women can bear those children.  (Yes, overpopulation is a global issue, within the UK in fact, not enough children are being born and the problems that this will cause for future generations is an entirely separate discussion - but suffice to say, when you're old and infirm, someone will need to wipe your backside and empty the commode for you!).

As to benefits for the company of paying Maternity, as aforementioned, there are fewer financial difficulties incurred than most people believe and ignorantly bandy about without any real understanding (sound familiar!).  Any costs that do arise are certainly far less than those arising from a crashed computer system or annual management jolly to a luxury hotel dressed-up as 'Training and Development'!

If a women has applied and been successful in attaining a job position, then she must possess the right attributes for that post.  During her employment she will have developed experience, maybe a rapport with clientele or multidisciplinary department relations etc.  In essence, an integral part of the working team.  No company wants to see this go, or find a replacement and start from scratch with another employee.  Have you ever heard discussions about problems with Staff Retention or Staff Turnover?  High levels cause organisations a huge headache, where and when possible, all companies try to 'retain' there staff.  This is why it's important for companies to pay maternity, to 'retain' their employees - and attract others too.  So much so, that the vast majority of larger organisations and public services not only provide the Statutory Maternity Rights and Pay as laid out by legislation, they go the extra mile and include what is termed as 'Enhanced Maternity Benefits'.  They pay their employees above the Statutory Maternity Pay, provide bonuses for returning to work, financial assistance with childcare and 'phased return to work' flexibility.  If employing women, and/or employing women of childbearing age, was unprofitable and cost ineffective, then companies would certainly not do this would they?

Whether, man or woman, it is in the best interest of any organisation to value their employees - maternity is just one of the ways in doing so - just like providing 'paternity' leave for fathers.

I hope this has been enlightening and helped adjust your somewhat ignorant ideas.  Although sometimes I find ignorance is often an excuse for run-of-the-mill stupidity - and I guess, there is no helping with that.

Actually, it is not just something that could help women. Men have every right to take leave and get paid for it when they adopt or when their mate has a child. 
I have known some men that have taken the unpaid leave to be the primary care giver, simply because the woman made a significantly greater amount of money.

You're clearly not educated in management are you? There are a lot of benefits employers give both male and female employees that may not seem on the surface to directly contribute to the business but it does.



Human resources has become a competitive field and may jobs come with perks to attract talent and loyal employees. Parental leave is just many of those. Some include extended health benefits, personal leave and flex hours.

Coworkers do not usually have to deal with extra work when a person takes a parental leave. Usually a temp is hired. There is some disruption in work when this happens, but as all work places deal with parent and other types of leaves, no one is really at a greater disadvantage than another because of this.

Modern women make quite a lot of sacrifices. As it takes two people to make a baby and usually men also want families, some one has to take time off work to raise a young child. Usually it is the women who does this, losing work experience, promotion opportunity and social connections. More and more men these days are taking up that responsibility, but asking for a maternity leave is hardly shirkingresponsibilitiess. Until you have done it yourself, I don't think you are qualified to make judgement on those who have.

In fact some of us love it because it gets them out of our hair . so of us like wines that are not white zinfandel .In fact some of us like beer. Stout even!!!!!!!!! . when we are angry it is probably because we or someone we care about was wronged somehow, and not because it's that time of the month. We don't all get moody around that time of the month. and if some of us do it might just be because it's a big messy pain and it hurts . a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

It's a bit like me jumping into the ocean and a dolphin decides to punch me in the stomach with its snout.

Do I hate all dolphins and mistrust them?

No.

That particular dolphin was annoyed and something happened to him prior to meeting me that made him want to batter me in the stomach.

I don't think that would ever happen, most guys don't listen and if you only knew how women felt when you don't listen maybe you would start but i I don't think men will ever listen because it is all about looks and all that, you want no problems well relationships come with problems.  I mean some men are respectful and listen but those only come around oh so often.

First, said person would need to prove that there is a "Right to own slaves", and in trying they would run into so many contradictions that there would be no consistency in the persons moral philosophy.

People today like to make up "rights" and say that they are entitled to them. Right to health care, right to education, right to a job. What they don't realize is that by creating new rights without any account for consistent moral philosophy they create irreconcilable contradictions. They advocate an unpractical moral ideal. How can you support property rights if you support the right to health care and education? You MUST violate property rights to uphold the newly created rights. SO if you believe in any of those sorts of things, say "bye bye" to your property rights. Ill be taking your computer, thank you!

The two are not mutually exclusive but are difficult ot reconcile.  I think here of The society of Friends (Quakers) who were large in the sugar trade which depended on slave labour.  Given the slavery laws in UK (I can only speak of UK and England in particular)  the right to own slaves died out with the last slave. Therefore in UK the answer is redundant.



We then come to criminals forced to work. these people can be said to live in near slavery but are paying a penalty and  do receive some  payment for their labour and are not usually in prison and forced to work for a great length of time and there is also a  voluntary element in that work. They are not owned by the State but are restrained by it .

Many people are.  It is slavery for a woman to be forced to have an unwanted child,  Yet, I suspect that you are in favor of forcing women to have babies against their will, yet you would not support having a person or a fetus own another person.  You would not be for enforced child labor, but you are for enforced mother slavery.

Women walk around with a sense of entitlement, as if the world owes them something.



These kind of women don't like me, because I believe these women don't deserve any more than any man. It should be equal.

EDIT: I think these women, like the one below me, have missed the entire premise of your question. You're asking, why should everything given to women simply because they ask for it, despite it having negative effects on society or other groups?

Example: If crackheads get together and want crack to be legalized to help out their cause, should we just give it to them? What effect would it have on the rest of society? We can't just give groups things without analyzing the possible/plausible ramifications it will have. Yeah, I know that was an extreme example but it was just an example to make a point as clear as possible.

Since when is education being "feminized"? Example?

And who do you know that has been promoted due to their sex because of preferental treatment and not on the merits of their work?

Abortion should be an option, period. Unequal divorce and custody - you can fight for these things to make it right. Maternity pay - most jobs also pay for Paternity Time off as well.

Whether I have a kid or not doesn't affect you, and neither does a promotion. I better freakin' get promoted due to merit - otherwise it's illegal! 
If you feel the others are unequal, which they can be, I suggest you fight for your rights instead of blaming others for the outcome. It's not a matter of what I want when it comes to your personal matters - it's up to you to make it right.

It didn't seem to matter to men for tens of thousands of years how they discriminated against women and got "society" served up on an easy platter for them, regardless completely what an effect it had on women and children, just as long as men got what THEY wanted.  That's HISTORY, not an opinion.



Are you suggesting that women be held to any higher standard than that?  Surely you aren't suggesting that equal rights and a society that accomodates women and children and not just men frightens you or something like that, like that really matters anymore. A few men are like that, still clinging to their ego-fragile male entitlement paradigms.  Oh, well.  Too bad for them.  But, I PROMISE you from the bottom of my great big heart I will vote and struggle and strive to protect the rights of men exactly as much as they have for women.  Fair enough?  WAIT!  Men voted AGAINST ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.  And, WAIT, they got all annoyed when women got a federal law to criminalize marital rape.  And, WAIT!  Wasn't it not until 1993 that women were even allowed to attend schools of their choice because men locked them out of it?  Like I said, I will return just as much consideration for men's rights as they have shown women.  Fair enough, uh?  You BET women get what they want these days.  And we've just begun.

in the late 80's early 90's there was a 4-5% dddifference with males being on top in academic achievement and in college enrollment.

Feminist's made a big deal about it and the government began "positive discrimination" against male students because feminist's felt boy's had a "natural advantage".



Fast forward almost two decades later and the so called "positive discrimination" has become a full fledged war on boys.



It is not uncommon for a 15%-30% difference in the number of women on campus vs men.

Males are being marginalized. At first title IX was used to ensure equal access. Now it is used to further the war on boys. If a college is 67% female then feminist's demand that 67% of all athletes be female.



And with the wide spread drop out rate because of the hostile environment our education system has become male suicide is at an all time high.



Those that benefit do not care about anyone but themselves. They have no care for equality or equity.



------------
The level of hatred exhibited by some here is truly shocking. Ignore the female chauvinist.

I'm sure most women would like to feel as safe as men do walking to their cars in a dark parking lot, but we don't.
First of all, unequal divorce and custody rulings? What are your statistics on this? Is this something you assume or is this something that that ever-so-mysterious (yet all knowing) "everyone" seems to know? I know of more divorce proceedings which end in single moms raising kids on their own because the father has bailed than divorce proceedings with the father screwed over. So, cite some statistics.
Abortion has taken place for hundreds of years. Legalizing it did not have a negative effect on society, it had a positive effect on women's health. Women no longer have to go to a back alley butcher to abort an unwanted pregnancy.
Maternity pay? What is wrong with maternity pay? Honestly, I really can't see why you feel maternity pay is wrong. Our society offers disability pay, paternity pay, even pay to care for ill family members.
As for the feminizing of education, I have to wonder about that. So you quote a newspaper editorial... whoopty freaking do, it's hardly scientific. I'm a university student and I have classes where I'm the only woman. I will point out that men are free to enter the trades without fear of being ostracized by co-workers. The reason there are more women in universities, gaining grants, it's because it's the best option we have.
And you ask if men can get everything they want... what do they want that they don't have... besides breasts?

No they should not get it just because they want it, If they want it really bad, then damn well work for it like the rest of society.

They think they should be free from all consequences, and then when the consequences do happen, who do the point to? Men, they had to have caused it....

I don't agree with feminism whatsoever, and it breaks my heart that my partner and son suffer because the world has gone mad. My partner used to frequent his local gym but since he's moved in with me he has to travel for half an hour to get to one as our local gym is women only.
My son is so active he bounces off the walls but hisschool don't do enough for him. I take him to football lessons, karate, swimming, I play tennis with him and we do loads of exciting science experiments. He just doesn't get the excitement and the interactive lessons in his school that keep him interested. He misbehaves, I tell them, well if you made the damn effort to spark his interest rather than sitting him there with a book to read for the whole day, maybe he wouldn't misbehave! He's bored, obviously! I thought you were qualified for this job? They don't even have any male teachers! Men are too scared to teach in primary schools nowadays, they must obviously be paedophiles after all, it winds me up, I think a variation is needed at such a crucial age. You can't bring them up thinking only women have authority.
I'd also like to add that I've been applying for jobs recently, the application forms state they are an equal opportunities employer so we must ask for your gender, race, religion blah blah blah. If you're equal opportunities, surely you shouldn't need to ask? You should employ on merit. Needless to say I don't answer these questions.
I'm sorry I don't really seem to have answered your question, but I still feel better to have got that off my chest!

Democrats are more left politically speaking which means they're more socially conscious, everyone is equal, at best they're into public education and that kinda stuff for all and at worst they're out at the socialist (communist).  You're garden variety of feminist (the majority) are more your central left, public education for all black / white, male / female.  The feminazi rabid feminists tend to be out further and sometimes off the scale.

Lately I have seen quite a few bumper-stickers proclaiming Jesus as the proper presidential candidate. But is this really who we want?
Let's look at the facts. He is a drunkard, remember the 'water to wine' incident? Rumors have been circulating the internet about the sex tape with Mary Magdalene.



Just imagine him trying to defend himself: "I occasionally partake in the drinking of wine." Or,  "I did not have carnal relationships with thine women."



On November 4th, make an informed decision, vote for Satan, the clear choice for integrity and consistency.

The ones that provide all the American JOBS...payroll is one of the the biggest expenses for a business. The extra taxes don't take away profit, without profit companies go out of business...but it will take away from the expense side. It's a no brainer.



Don't kid yourself, it isn't just BIG business. A SMALL business, which makes up over 50% of the employment in our country, is any business with less than 500 employees. Do the math, 500 time a decent salary is WAY over the 250,000. So it is the small business not the large one that will be going away...with all of the jobs....going away because they can't AFFORD to move to China.  BUT if they expand the Government, maybe everyone can get a job at unemployment or the tax office...what do you think?

The US Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a “small business” according to its average annual receipts or the number of its employees. Here are examples from the SBA’s Table of Small Business Size Standards setting forth the maximum average annual receipts by industry that a business can have and still be classified as a small business:



Crop production of all types — $750,000
Animal production except for cattle & chicken/eggs — $750,000
Cattle feedlots — $2.5M
Chicken/egg production — $12.5M
Forestry & logging — $7M
Fishing — $4M
Irrigation, sewage, water supplies — $7M
Housing construction — $33.5M
Heavy and civil engineering construction — $33.5M
Dredging and cleanup — $20M
Concrete, framing, and other housing contractors — $14M
Car dealers — $23-29M
RV, motorcycle, & boat dealers — $7M
Furniture, hardware, clothing & sporting good stores — $7M
Electronic stores — $9M
Supermarkets, gas stations & department stores — $27M
Pharmacies — $7M



There are many more examples at the link. In addition, most of the industries in the Table — such as manufacturers of food, beverages, apparel, print, oil/gas, plastics, plumbing, machinery, computers, electronics, electrical, transportation, and furniture — are considered small businesses based on their total number of employees instead of average annual receipts. In those industries, the cut-off between small and large businesses ranges from 500-1,000 employees per business/industry.



It’s difficult to imagine a business that has 50 or more employees (let alone 500-1,000) that has receipts of less than $250,000 per year. And, given the SBA definitions of “small business,” it seems likely that many small businesses in a wide range of industries have receipts of more than $250,000 per year.



If so, it is appalling that Obama would imply that, if he is President, a small percentage of businesses exceed the $250,000 per year cut-off for increased taxation under his tax plan. In fact, the number of businesses subject to additional tax is large and is over the 50% number John McCain mentioned.



98% of all businesses in the US are classifed as small business.  Hence, many will simply close their doors (we are already seeing that), and others leave.  (former executive SBA/Washington)

Big business or Small business will be taxed harder if they ship jobs oversees, or if they make over $250,000 dollars. Only 2-5% of all small business in the United States makes over $250,000 so the other 95-98% will not be taxed higher, they will get tax breaks. HOPEFULLY, this will generate new employment in the U.S. but we will not know until it happens. Obviously, what has been happening the last eight years is not gonna work any longer because we are in an awful spot and we look like idiots to the rest of the world.

because they are focusing only on work and neglecting their parental duties of nurturing the kids and feeding them nutritional food. they should be taught they are not meant to provide - thats a mans job. plus they should focus on these matters.

For the individual woman since they can make their own choice my opinion is irrelevant. I may approve in some cases but not others.



But in general there is a problem. Take shaving for instance (very minor surgery but still body alteration) there was a time when women had a choice in the matter. Nowadays this form of surgery is considered the norm and women are 'expected' to do it. This is the reasons why i have a problem with it. The issue is more one against the media and society. The prevalence of cosmetic surgery causes the bar to be raised for all women this leads to more pressure on women to get it done. Thus creating conformity rather than individuality.



So as i said for a woman I don't have an opinion but regarding women in general I am against cosmetic surgery.

Ladies, Good Day.  Why the hell does the check out bill come to $323.14 every damn time...?



We go to Sam's Club?  Like when I go to Home Depot or Sam's Club I know what I need, I buy it and then go pay for it.  It's usually like $44 max.



Whenever you go with ladies, the entire store must be scoured for everything and two shopping carts must be used (one must be the bright orange industrial strength kind).



Why is it that when all we needed were eggs, paper towels, milk and paper plates does the bill have to exceed $320?



*If possible, please use scientific principles to account for this behaviour in 80% of ladies.



*Modern Feminists, I implore that you not engage in the use of profanity as this makes me terribly uncomfortable.

This isn't a "scientific" answer or a "feminist" answer but here you go:



I think its better to buy in bulk, which is what Sam's Club is for. It means less trips to the store which leaves you more time during the month (or however many times you go) to do whatever you need to do without worrying about needing to buy something. Also, buying in bulk is USUALLY the better deal (not always, but usually) money wise. You get more for your money. A lot of men don't really grasp the concept of shopping in general, so I don't think I would expect them to understand buying in bulk to save money and time they can spend watching football or hanging out with their friends.



Hope I helped

A guy (were talking about stereotypically) sees what he needs, goes in and gets it and gets out. One track mind that thinks in the present and wants to get the work done in the least amount of time wasted. (Im terrible sorry if I offended anyone who reads this).



A girl (again stereotypically) thinks about the future and thinks about many different things at once, so she goes in and notices a sale and thinks about the future and says hm-mm, if I buy that now I can save money, since I know I will need it later. So they see another item on sale and buy that too. This process continues until she is sure she has everything she needs.



Some instances they start thinking about things they meant to get later that week and would save time and energy later.  For example a girl will go to a place like Walmart to get shampoo and conditioner. Then they start thinking that they needed a gift for a friend whose birthday is next week. So they buy a photo album for the gift. Then they remember that they needed new sheets since the old ones now have a huge hole in it. So they buy a new set of sheets (and of course its not just the ripped sheet they need to replace but the whole bed set; because everything has to match after all (still being stereotypical). This process continues until she can no longer think of anything she needs or the whole store has been scavenged through.



On a note Im am again very sorry if I offended anyone. Just remeber this is sterotypical and not everyone is like this. Some research does show that girls think about many things at once and that their mind is constantly in motion. They think about things that need to get done, things that have gotten done, and things that are currently being done (grocrey shopping: comparing prices and thinking about what food at home that is running low). Whereas a guys mind is usually more focused and directed, thinking about what he is doing in the moment or what he will be doing that night. There are known instances where these ideas prove false, not all girls think a particular way and neither do guys.

Because women usually try to plan ahead. That's why we come out of the store with more than we went in for. And if money isn't an issue that just makes the spending more uncontrollable.



When I go shopping I do 2 or 3 thing depending on what kind of shopping im doing 1- Always take cash and only enough to cover my purchases 2- Write a list and stick to it so that I can avoid buying things that aren't in my budget or that I don;t have any use for9 I like to by things just because its on sale) - eat before going grocery shopping so that you don't overfill the cart with the things your craving because your in a store full of food and your stomach is empty.

Ladies, can you handle this challenge...?



You must live with the New Jersey Ball Kicker Fellow for two years.  He'll be a perfect gentleman, won't harm you in anyway.  The sex life will consist entirely of the ball kicking ritual and the Pussycat dancing business once or twice daily, but that's all (but you simply can't refuse).  Otherwise he'll be a very peaceful man and help with all household activities.  You'll be supplied with $88,000 US for living expenses.



If you complete this task you will be rewarded with a tax-exempt check for $400,000 US, 18 holes of golf with Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens and a year's worth supply of mango flavored Haagen Das ice cream.



Are you willing to accept this challenge and if not, what (reasonable) stipulations would make it more appealing?

What can you say about this rtcle about unfair treatment for men?



In Australian immigration policy a distinction is regularly made between women and children (often treated erroneously as equivalent to "family groups") and single men. The details are subject to current debate and recently failed legislation (August 2006) in the Australian Parliament. But for example in one recent case, the Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, determined as follows concerning Papuan asylum seekers: "The single men on the boat would be sent to an immigration detention centre, but families would not be split up and would be housed in facilities in the community".[12] The discriminatory treatment of single women (routinely assumed to be members of some family) and single men evident in such a practice is rarely examined in the Australian media

I feel that women, in general should not be "locked up" as such, because they suffer more emotionally than men. Also females are far less likely to disrupt a community and are more likely to be beneficial. Of course, it would be better if no one had to be locked up.

I agree. Breasts are not sexual organs, anymore than the buttocks are. They have been fetishized to the point of being seen as "dirty," and completely sexualized, so much so that breasts are only "ok" if they are in a sexual context. The reaction that many have to a woman breast feeding only demonstrates how twisted the view of breasts have become.



Think about it...if breasts are sexual organs, how are we to reconcile that with the fact that they are used to feed infants? Is breast feeding sexual abuse? That's a ridiculous notion, but I HAVE seen some (admittedly crazy) religious groups suggest just that. Ick.

Stimulating the breasts can arouse some women. I would have to agree with you though. I really don't see this blind fascination with boobs. I can understand how some see them as sexy, but it just gets ridiculous after a while. My significant other sat next to be one day and just poked my boob with a food menu for five minutes straight. From what I saw, the fabric and skin would depress just like every other fleshy part of my body if poked. Big deal.

Why do people think that teens don't have self-control?



There are a lot of people who say that teens will have sex no matter what because of their raging hormones and if they aren't taught about "protection"(if you can even call it that) then they will not know how to prevent pregnancy. Not true. I was only taught abstinence, but I wasn't retarded. I knew what birth control was and how to get it and I knew about condoms without my parents or teachers telling me.



Is there honestly no trust in todays teens to make mature decisions anymore?

I don't know.  People also think all teens will go off and drag race at 100 mph, or smoke anything that can be inhaled, or get drunk every Saturday night.  Or maybe that was just my parents.  I never did any of those things.  I didn't always do the smart thing, but I never did anything like this.  My problems were more about what I DIDN'T do, but that's another story for another topic.  Besides, I know lots and lots of adults who make these kinds of mistakes, and often they're the same ones talking about teenagers doing these things.



On a side note, with all these people talking about how hard it is to control their hormones, I wonder why anyone questions why anyone really is surprised there are people who say rapists just can't control their urges.  A lot of these people are playing right into that argument by saying they themselves just "couldn't wait."



Marissa is right.  Sex ed is taught just about everywhere now.  It's parents who are falling down on their jobs.

Anyone who says teenagers aren't aware of the different methods of birth control is full of BS. Sex ED is taught in nearly every, if not all, states in the US. With that said, we can't use that as a reason as to why the teen pregnancy rates are so high.



I don't think raging hormones are to blame either. I don't think that teenagers have any more of a sex drive than someone in their mid to late 20s.



The difference being that teens tend to feel as though bad things happen to other people, not them. As The Mrs. said, it has been proven that teenagers have poor decision making skills because that part of their brain is not fully developed yet.



So to answer your question, yes, it is difficult to trust teenagers to make mature decisions. This is why parents need to be involved so that they can help their teenagers make mature decisions.

I think it's simply a matter of younger people having a certain sense of "invincibility" or perhaps insufficient judgment.  Obviously it doesn't apply to all and is probably way over-generalized, but nonetheless, as a society we tend to feel that the teens are still formative years where many still don't recognise the potential consequence of their actions.  This forms the  basis for much of our legislation and so forth.  To some extent I think it's true with respect to decision-making, but is not absolute.



I'm certainly of the opinion that if someone can hold and shoot a firearm, they certainly have the capacity to determine whether they are responsible enough to engage in coitus.

Wait until you have teenagers, then ask that question again.  I'm not saying teens have absolutely no control, but their brains are not finished growing, and they do really stupid things - even the "good" ones.  They don't think things through like we do, and feel invincible.  With our teens,we're covering all the bases.  They know we believe they are too young for sex, and don't approve, but they also know about condoms, etc.  They know that they have no control over what a girl does with their child, should they get her pregnant, and they know they will be getting jobs, and paying for any offspring they create.

Not many of them are all that mature to begin with. And not all teens will have sex, but many will. Of course the one sitting inside all day, playing war craft, who weighs 240 pounds at 5'5'' will not. Nor will the one who walks around with one of those anime headband things.
Another problem is many are told it is a great thing and are looked down upon and ridiculed if they say they have never engaged in intercourse. Their friends attempt to force them into relationships, and they also spread mistruths about sex, which their peers believe.

I think it's really the culture that's screwed up, not the fact that teens are being teens. To be more specific, I think it has something to do with a liberal society. As for the self control thing, I think it depends on the media, school, and parents. Teens in other cultures doesn't believe in having sex so soon.

I don't think it is so much a lack of control but a lack of maturity.  They feel that something bad will never happen to them and they feel invincible.  Teens as well as other people are going to practise risky behaviour and I would rather they be safe and have some workable knowledge then pregnant or dying from an S
TD.  The other reason is teens are trusting and believe that the world is a good place where only bad things happen to bad people.

Because the average age a person loses their virginity is 16.  This has nothing to do with "today", it has been this way for decades, it has just not been talked about.  Perhaps talking about it i why teen pregnancy has gone down.  This is not just in the US but in most modern nations.

The US has the highest teen pregnancy rate (as I mentioned in an earlier post they are going down) and we are known as one of the most prudish (modern) countries especially when it comes to talking about sex : http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_te... coincidence?  Probably not.



EDIT- Oh, lets not forget the last part of the brain to develop is the frontal lobe especially the portion which contributes to decision making, specifically self-control.  This typically does not form until early -mid 20's.  Most recent studies suggest as late as 25 years old.

the problem is boys heads are telling them to "spread the seed" and girls heads are saying "get their approval"
it's all evolution
boys want to get people pregnant to ensure the survival of the race and in cave man years they were in their prime (remember they only lived until like 30 so they would be middle aged)
and women want to get the strongest male in the group so she and her children (which he will so kindly provide her with) will be protected and fed.
not to mention the fact that teenagers begin to strive for autonomy, which is completely natural and healthy for them to do, but autonomy means using their own minds and their minds are saying help the race to survive! so parents think back to their teen years and go... uh oh!

Ah.. excellent question.



I dont' think all "teens" have no self control. Quite the contrary... I did not have sex until I was 21.... I think they "can" make decent decisions.



That said, people of all ages LIKE sex. No matter what we teach to who, there are going to be mistakes, people who see nothing wrong with having sex at 15, drunken one night stands, and pills/condoms that fail... (a friend of mine had a son because both the shot and the condom failed the same night.. lol. it's one of those nasty little probability things..).



There will always be teen pregnancies for the same reason women in their 20's, 30's and 40's get pregnant - sex is fun and people like to do it. :)

I wouldn't say it's because of raging hormones that teens will have sex no matter what-- it's because of raging hormones, and normal human emotions, that teens will date and have relationships no matter what.



Different relationships move at different speeds-- that much is just about individual dynamics, and is true, as far as I've seen, for adult relationships as well. A small number of teens will wait several months before kissing; others will get together through a kiss. Some will stick to kissing for months, then run the rest of the bases* in a matter of weeks; others will have only a small gap between kissing and second, but wait a very long time for the rest of it. And some--  5 percent of all people-- WILL save themselves for marriage.



I think that in many teen relationships lasting more than six months, and most teen relationships lasting over a year, the partners will start to engage in some sexual activities-- be it vaginal intercourse, oral sex, or mutual masturbation. All of these activities require protection, be it from pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.



So I don't think the raging hormones are an issue, but I don't think there's anything that can be done to prevent teens from having sex. Not too long ago, abstinence until marriage was a very reasonable expectation-- because people were getting married in their early and mid-teens.



As for teaching about protection-- yes, some people ARE so dumb that they don't do research on their own before having sex. Or worse-- some think that they already know everything they need to know, or have misinformation about what is and isn't safe. Many people still think "two condoms are better than one," and some even believe you can effectively avoid pregnancy by douching/jumping jacks/having sex standing up/using withdrawal (which in an adult relationship can work to some degree, but isn't plausible when it comes to teenage boys). I don't think they should be having sex without doing research, but I don't think they should be punished with an unwanted pregnancy or STD, either.



It's also one thing to know that condoms exist, but another to know how to use them. Some people don't know about squeezing the tip, or forget to check the expiration date, or are confused about that whole darned foreskin thing, or use their teeth to open it, etc etc.



Source(s):



*I'm not specifying what I mean by the 'bases' because it's different for every couple and every individual. Some couples never have oral sex at all, and in some communities it's basically expected of a couple.



EDIT: I actually agree with Gaspari for once, about the whole invincibility thing. I'm somewhat responsible, but a lot of my friends make decisions that aren't really the best for them in terms of long-term mental (and sometimes physical) health (like being in relationships where they are extremely dependent, or relying on substance abuse [and i do mean abuse, not just recreational usage] to solve their problems), or they do stupid, unimportant things that could have dire consequences (like playing 'chicken' on the highway with friends).

I've got a 19 year old and 17 year old.  I think teens lack self-control in part because they remind me weekly year after year.  Psychologists study them and report that their immature brains lead to impulsive behavior, even when it's not sexual and hormonal.  An ob/gyn I chose because of her reputation as being great with young girls told me to get my daughter an injection instead of the pill at 14 because she'd never had a patient that age who actually was responsible enough to take the pill or use condoms regularly - she delivered their babies.



I'd say that "abstinence education" had a great impact on my daughter - for about a week.  Then hormones or peer pressure or 21st-century culture took over.  Both my kids were sexually active by 12 and I'm just thrilled they haven't had kids.  They and their friends all started drinking and drugging in middle school, by the hundreds, literally.



So, no, there's no trust on my part that teens will make mature decisions.  You have to mature in order to be able to make mature decisions.  A lot is the culture.  I believe every word in "Reviving Ophelia".  But a lot is the nature of being a teenager.

When are you going to grow up? You don't have to post a stupid question immediately after someone else does it. More mature answer for the question you are referring to by someone sensible.
.........................................
Kate is completely wrong. A uterus is a bag of skin with one purpose: it waits to nurture a baby. You can lose your uterus and be fine.



Now, if you lost your ovaries as well, that's entirely different. The ovaries are the boss. Lose them and a woman's life changes because she'd go into early menopause. You cannot lose your ovaries and keep the uterus; you can lose the uterus and keep the ovaries.



I think what you meant to ask (but couldn't because you're young yet and not very knowledgeable) is would a woman have her tubes tied for the love of her man. She couldn't get pregnant, but would still remain healthy (and non-menopausal). Many women do, but it's a major surgical procedure. Vasectomy is a minor procedure and can be reversed.



You do understand selfishness has nothing to do with it, don't you? Couples decide for themselves what works best. Most people don't practice the ridiculous, angry sexism that permeates this place.

I've always wondered thought the same thing.  If it's ok for the mom to terminate the pregnancy, why is it not ok for a dad to terminate his attachment to the baby?  It seems only fair to me.  Unless we're talking rape, I think most women understand that having sex could mean getting pregnant.  If they can kill the baby, why not let the dad kill his relationship with it?  It seems more human to kill a relationship with someone than to actually kill them.

Not always.



Sometimes I really do wonder how anyone could possibly support McCain, but the way I figure they are seeing what they want to see--not sure if that's the same as being uninformed. Perhaps misinformed?



I don't think they're being deliberately contrary, I definitely sometimes question the intelligence of the other person (I know that's cocky, but at least I'm being honest)



I wouldn't say I don't care, but I don't try too hard to change their minds. I'll argue my point of view and provide facts, but if they still disagree, I give up.



I don't understand what you mean by "score points off of them"

when somebody disagrees with me, i don't assume they are uninformed, rather i will engage with a deep conversation  with them and ask  for the reason why they are disagreeing.. In psychology, we have a phenomenon called self-serving bias and we think that we are always better than average. so, we must be careful when talking with others.. we might be downgrading others for the expense of upgrading ourselves... :)

Depends.  If their arguments are based on logical, factual information, then I just figure they reached a different conclusion than I did.  If their arguments are based on rumors, speculation, myth or fallacy, then I figure they're either gullible, naive, ignorant, or in denial.  I will almost always (except in the case of trolls) attempt to back up my arguments with logic and facts, even if it's just to demonstrate that my conclusion is valid, if different from their's.

Great Question!!!!!



I try very hard not to jump to the 'uninformed' conclusion - but it doesn't always work.  This is often the case when I am discussing or arguing with a person who has proven themselves to be massively uninformed.  You tend not to believe in their reasoning skills or their information sources.



Like the previous responder, I find the American election to be a great example of where my patience and ability to listen to others is tested - because I simply can't wrap my brain around anyone's belief that John McCain would make a great leader.  I can accept the Republican philosophy as a very good one - but certainly not in the way the party has evolved and exists at present - with its massive corruption and clinging to religion.



Do I think they aren't as bright as me?  No.  But I do wonder about how much they have investigated - objectively - the two candidates and parties.  As they TRULY exist, rather than how they have propagandized themselves.



Do I try to convince them?  No - I don't think its a matter of convincing, as much as it is the desire for a lively debate.



Scoring points?  Well that would just be nasty, wouldn't it?  Heehee...

It depends on what we;re talking about.



Politics?  They are either misinformed, or they were just raised that way and have blindly followed in their parents footsteps.
Religion?  I don't expect everyone to believe what I do.  But seeing as how I do believe, I must think it's right, so therefor eveyone else is wrong.
Homeschooling?  (How I was educated k-12) I don't assume, I know people are (mostly) public school clones and I don't expect them to be able to think out of the box.
Everything else?  I know my stuff, I research things, and I do admit when I was wrong.  But mostly I'm right, and everyone else is just not using their brain.

If their argument is well-informed, coherent and convincing, I will take it into account.



If it is uninformed, incoherent and not convincing, I dismiss them as an idiot.



On most issues I will respect other people's opinion (as long as they are coherent etc.) but there are a few issues about which I feel so strongly that I cannot help but get very angry with people who disagree.

i never disrespect another's understanding, their state of mind, their personal experience, their hope and faith.  More often than not, i listen more deeply, diving beneath the surface of human words that so inadequately serve.  i am always open to that spark from another which might ignite my own spark into the flame of knowing, learning, understanding beyond where i am at any given moment.



There is an alchemical combustion that takes place in the exchange of ideas and experiences...very much like the "Where two or more are gathered..." concept from the Bible.  It is this "point" of ignition that affects the  transmutation that i look for within myself.  We are all in process, and every unique process adds to another's, since we are one being fulfilling the All That Is.



Being "right" (judgment, self-interest, separation) comes from the ego and is quite out of the purview of our call to awaken from our collective sleep/ignorance.  i am here to awaken, and enfolded into that intention and purpose is the awakening of humanity as a whole, for each one is onself.  Only Source is...and we are Its manifestation.

Sometimes I think their life experiences have been different from mine.  Sometimes I think they are uninformed.



Recently, a friend of mine cut off contact with me after accusing me of "telling lies".  I had never lied to her, but it seems that she could not conceive of so many difficulties happening to one person as had happened to me.



This, to me, is naive and uninformed.  Any amount of tragedy is possible, and I don't even think my life has been that tragic.



It's really sad that such things cause irreparable rifts between people.

I would never base my knowledge on faith.  But I do choose faith, often, when determining my beliefs.



The difference is that I will be confident to share my knowledge freely, but will be more wary in discussing my beliefs.  As I feel that discussion points should be backed up with verifiable facts, it is difficult for me to enter into one based solely upon my beliefs - unless I qualify them first.

i once believed in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy; then i believed in a knight in shining armor coming to sweep me away; then i believed in injustice in the world; then i believed that i was right about everything.  All of these (and more) have changed...radically.  Beliefs are not absolutes.  They, in fact, are based on the point to which one has developed/evolved in experience, but also what one has learned from one's experiences.  And they are constantly "changing," impermanent human constructs that come and go.



Beliefs, more often than not, are second-handed to us by others, whom we "belie(f)ve" because we see them as authorities in our lives...and over our lives, as well.  But beliefs really imply lack of knowing...one's own knowing out of one's own experiencing.



Your use of the word counterintuitive is telling, for it is the whispered intuitive guidance that steers us intelligently toward every goal.  Only this intuition can be trusted to emanate from an intelligence beyond our own limitations.  This is the "gut feeling" to which you refer...this is our inner knowing, our reliable feed from Intelligence beyond our imagining, from Source.

Knowledge is a tricky concept.  People often believe they know things, when in fact, they may not.  I am one of those people who, when asked a question, will preface my answer with "I think" if I am not 100% certain of the accuracy of my answer.



But those things that I hold under the umbrella of knowledge are grounded in the following:



1.  Assessment of the source - its trustworthiness, and if it/they have an agenda.



2.  Cross referencing with other sources - this may require actual researching, or simply testing the theory on others whose knowledge base I trust.



3.  Gut check - this isn't always the most effective, but knowledge has to sit comfortably with me.  Often, there are things that have passed the first two with flying colours, but I either choose to NOT believe it or don't want to believe it.  In either case - whether this is sensible or not - I simply ignore it.  LOL.

Why is rape considered a crime, and abortion isnt?



First of all, with the whole feminist rights movement; feminists have tried to justify their actions in all proportions.



You might tell me that abortion takes place generally with the consent of both a husband and wife (so you cant blame only women), and in case of rape; is needed to protect a "13-year" (or whatever) old child's life from the difficulties of parenting. Have you realized what you are doing to the fetus inside her: you are KILLING it, MURDERING it. It is a crime against humanity. You might tell me women are not solely responsible for abortions, and I can also say that rape isnt committed only by men. So why all this hypocrisy from feminists?



Studies have shown that only 1 of 4 women report rape, and 1 of 10 men report rape because it will hurt their ego and damage their reputation in society. So men get raped a LOT too, they just dont tell it.



I think abortion should only be used in the case of the girl's "near-death" state. If she's about to die, she should have the right to save herself over the child. However, we have seen in the past how women have sacrificed their lives to save the child in them. Abortion is getting misused a LOT these days, over the smallest things; like a girl is not ready to start a family. If you didnt want to have a kid, you shouldnt have had sex (or sex with protection). If you wore protection, but still got pregnant; tough luck, you should have known better; now deal with it, raise a kid. Dont put your mental deficiencies on your child.



You tell me that women should have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, the thing is: from a christian point of view, the body is not exactly yours: the body is only for the time-being; and the soul is for the hereafter. When you take a child's life; more than taking its body, you take its soul. Im sorry feminists, but you have to realize there is a LIVING child growing inside them, and taking its life is a very serious matter. Dont justify it to make women look falsely independent, you arent doing yourselves any favors.

Importance of research on discrimination on women?



i'm doing a paper on the discrimination of women and the negative effects that it has. it's for a psychology class. i'm required to then give reasons as to why research on this issue is important and to whom such research benefits. your thoughts and views on this would be much appreciated. i just seem to have faced a major block for some reason...if you could also provide me with links of previous studies that are related to this i'd be really grateful...thanks in advance(",)...

research on this issue is important in this century because discrimination have became more subtle due to the awareness given by previous studies (maybe their are a lot of internet sources out there talking about this) i.e. people believing in the gender stereotype that women are only found at homes. such research should be addressed to both men and women especially for the poor people, because it seems that even women accept this stereotype so they are not aware that they are already being discriminated. You can use this idea as a start off point in your paper, good luck!!

Discrimination is both a perception and a fact - and I think you should approach it that way.  As perception is one's reality, they may truly believe they are discriminated against when, in fact, they are not.

See if you can find any articles by Susan Wolf (famous feminist writer) She has some really good articles. And well the biggest beneficiaries of research on women discrimination would ultimately be WOMEN. This type of research is important so that society can be widely informed about why it is wrong to do this and can slowly start moving forward to abolishing on a 100% discrimination against women. We are already working towards it but we're not quite there yet. You can see this because the glass ceiling still exists in many aspects of society.



Fort example did you know that throughout the US many hospitals have different standards protocols on how to treat men and women with the same symptoms? If an adult MALE walks into the ER(emergency room) with chest pain and shortness of breathe it is considered to be a heart attack and has to be taken in immediately to get his heart checked, but if an adult FEMALE walks into the ER with the same exact symptoms they will take her into a quiet room and have a nurse talk to her about stress management.

Feminists demand preferential discrimination to women's favour - visit your local women's studies class and they can provide endless reams of studies on how women should be put above men and how women are genetically (or mentally, emotionally, sexually, etc. etc.) superior to men.



Harriet Harman, a British MP and feminist is pushing to convert women's prisons into mens prisons, wants male criminals to be punished with prison while female criminals get 'therapy' and then go home each night to be with their family. As you can see, this is clearly discrimination in women's favour.



She also wants a law that forbids men from claiming discrimination when a company refuses to employ him on sexism reasons. She stated specifically 'white men'. This comes a year after a feminist colleague of hers refused to employ a white man despite his application being a clear winner at all levels. He took her to court and won. It seems Harman wants to protect her Sistahs from legal action when they break the law. As you can see, this is clearly discrimination in women's favour.



There are many more, but this just a ocuple of recent ones.

Research on discrimination on women is very much needed. At least to convince modern feminists that there isn't any discrimination based on their gender that leads to the pay-gap.

Women are rational, but sometimes our rationality and logic gets overshadowed by our emotions. Men sometimes have that problem too but the overshadowing emotion is more often rage LOL. Women are often considered too emotional even today. That's because we are more emotional than men by and large. It isn't a bad thing; we're just different. We handle and express our feelings differently than men do. I think men feel as deeply and are just as capable of getting frustrated or hurt or touched, but they handle it differently and don't always show it as willingly as women do.



Some consider emotions in men to be weak. I think being emotional is only a weakness when a person allows their emotions to have the driver's seat in their life: they make decisions based on how they "feel", they are always focused on how they feel and expressing it, they get hurt or offended very easily and it's a big deal, etc. That is weakness in my opinion. Emotions are wonderful, and they have their place, but they are something we need to control rather than letting them control us.

Well, it depends on who you are talking to. There are those who see women no more then baby making housewives. Then there are those who see them as equals. I personality am on neither side. I don't agree or disagree, there are men who are more rational then certain women and then there are women that are more rational then certain men. It really depends on which women and which men you are trying to compare in this kind of situation. And yes, even to this day there are men that think women get too emotional. This is another toss up. Not all women are "too emotional," it just depends on which person your talking about. Like Lisa would cry if she stubbed her toe while if Katie stubbed her toe she would just shrug it off. And finally for if emotions in men equals weak men, still, like I've said, depends on who's eyes your looking through. Some think a man that cries ever won't amount to anything in life. While others believe that if they show emotion they'll do better if then if they don't show emotion. Me personality, Men should show emotion, but while keeping in mind not to show too much. A man needs to be able to know  what emotions to show where.

Weakness and being emotional are not a sign of gender. No I do not agree. It is an individual set of traits not based on gender.
Within society, yes men who show emotion are often seen or viewed as weak. Do I agree with this, no not in my opinion. Men who are capable of showing emotion in my opinion are well rounded and human. Welcome to the human race.

Men and Women are two different types of species.  We act and think differently to certain things.  Emotions are natural in both sexes and it's what starts from child birth.  The bonding from the child's mother begins when the baby is hungry and cries for that need. Babies also laugh and get angry.  We human beings have that already in ourselves even when in the mother's womb.  I was told to sing or listen to music when I am sad or angry as this calms the baby.  Sad movies and even one that inspires people will make a man cry.  If you understand what love and hurt can do to you it's almost like this painful feeling way inside a person.  Some are good feelings and some are guilty or bad feelings.  Without emotions in both men and women, our world would be a dull one.  No world is a perfect one as no human is either.  It's a good feeling and those emotions come through anxiety or even depression.  Frankly, I believe that when a man cries he is only feeling one thing that many women will admire and that is that he is very strong and a patient man which is very rare in men.  in then turns us We cry for Jesus, and that is what emotions come from not only from the outside but yes within.  A powerful feeling indeed that is.

So did Locke but we're talking a long time ago and an view of women in the western culture.  Women are not "too emotional" although there certainly are some women who are.  But as a whole, it fluctuates.  I also don't see expressing emotion as a weakness.  Being controlled by emotion, or being a slave to emotion, however, is another story but men can be caught up in this too.  Men have been said in the past that they are prone to "rage" or "jealously" or "possessiveness."  This can be seen quite often as Aristotle and other philosophers warn against such a state in men.  Aristotle, for example, tried to teach moderation in all things.  Yet these are also emotions, though why they are often not viewed as such is beyond me.



Men had to be taught to be rational (that was the entire point of philosophers).  Even Aristotle pointed out that if one didn't receive a certain training from a youth he would not likely ever be a wise, moderate man.  The problem was that women were not encouraged to take part in philosophy (although there were a few) and moderation was not targeted towards them.



In this day in age, however, where rational thought is valued in both genders, women have proven that they can be just as rational as their counterpart and men have proven that some of them can be just as emotional as women.  It's really not a gender thing as much as a learned thing.  And one does have to keep in mind that women are encouraged by society to express emotion while men are discouraged.  Not very fair but the whole "John Wayne" image is still expected of many men.

There is a serious lack of recognition of EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE.



Who says emotions aren't logical?
I don't buy that.



I think that a man who can show his feelings without apologizing for them, is 'stronger' as he is facing a society that frowns about using his inherent gift.



Without emotions we would be robotic.
How many 'technical' difficulties would we have without emotion?



Intuition is a great tool, as it calls upon a higher intelligence than simple weighing facts.  Sometimes there is more to a situation than what is presented.



I think both men and woman are emotional and logical, it's just what society expects us to be and our minds have been genetically altered by how we use them.



BTW Aristotle was a fruit loop in many of his 'theories.'  I think his claim that woman are 'too emotional' comes from a bias, bias is not logical, it is emotional reaction.

Were women really depressed back when women weren't supposed to work outside the home?



I know some women like staying home, doing housework and raising kids. Personally, I hate housework  and domesticity and, though I enjoy kids, I like for them to go home to other people's houses at night. Personally, I couldn't live without the adrenalin rush of my work. I'd like to get married too, but in times past marriage and children went together in the absence of reliable birth control.

Some women must have been judging by the feminist and women's rights movements. I suppose women who didn't like it would have either had to silently hate it while doing it or fight and be frowned upon. Maybe if brought up with domesticity as the nor or 'right thing to do' we'd have different values and just would have accepted it.

I don't think it was as bad as the like of Ms Steinam would have us believe. The radical fems in the 60s made it sound like every housewife sustained herself with brandy and pills because they hated their lives so much. I don't think it was that bad! Given how natural it is for a majority of women to want to be home with their kids, I think she was full of crap. Seriously, most of the women I know who have careers want to be home with their kids but can't afford to do it. Or they have terrible feelings of guilt for leaving their young kids in daycare because they have chosen to work. Not all of them feel this way but many do.



Back in the day, I don't know what women like you did. Some of them probably did their best to avoid pregnancy (there have always been herbal methods of aborting....I suspect they got used). Others probably resigned themselves to life with kids and made the most of it, and probably even came to enjoy their children. I'm not sure!

In some parts of the world people would laugh if you asked this question. In many Asian countries and some European countries life itself is so busy that you do not have time for anything else. It's only in modern western societies that almost all women work. Logically speaking women in some countries have to work to meet the cost of living. If everyone works, who would take care of the household, develop a life outside work, and spend time teaching the kids about everything. High levels of interaction is necessary for kids to grow mentally and learn social skills. No wonder you see most kids now a days with their face in a book or PSPs. It also depends on what you want to achieve in life... If you are a person who wants to achieve a certain position in a company or a level of salary then no doubt you would choose not to sit at home, but fortunately there are more in depth and spiritual side to most people's goals as they grow. I am sure you're at the most in your early or mid thirties... as you grow older the way you look at life will definitely change. I am only in my mid twenties but have traveled widely and maintain high interests in culture. I am only making these comments from my observations from around the world.

They had very few options.  I come from a family with a lot of women like that.  My great aunts were both teachers.  They never married, and traveled the world together while on summer break.  However, they had to put up with a lot of discrimination.



My mother was born in 1932.  When she went to college, there were very few options for women.  She got her MA and went into education, but quit when she became pregnant, as that was simply what was done in the 1960s.  She became a housewife, but was obviously unhappy.  Most of the mothers in my neighborhood were unhappy.  They didn't all drink or do drugs or anything like that, but as children we all knew that they just were unhappy and frustrated.  Some took it out on their children or husbands, others just stewed.  My mom went through a dizzying number of arts and crafts in an effort to find something interesting to keep her occupied before finally giving up.



She read and studied a lot.  Looking back I can see that she suffered from mild depression.  She would never admit it, but she loved teaching and being a SAHM was a horrible experience for her.  But she really didn't have much choice in the matter.

Why do feminists ask this question?



"Why do anti-feminsts think that women should be the main care providers of children, I don't understand".  This has been stated many times by many posters.  I've answered it much to their derision and anger.  I'd like feminists to answer up for their feigned ignorance as to why many people think that women should be the main care providers of children.  I've taken highschool biology and I've taken child development.  It's quite common sense to me why when you look at it in those parameters at the very least.  Either their pretending to not understand which is a pretty weak defense for their overall argument that daycare and/or men are just as qualified, or are they actually ignorant to the amount of blood, sweat, and tears it takes for babies and children to be raised in a loving, stimulating environment.



The question is Why are women the preferred choice to be the primary care giver of children-answer in the sense of having 2-3 children within a couple of years of each other.  This is due to the fact that most families were having 2.3 children, with a dog and house with a white picket fence.  What's your argument for or against.  also list if you've had children, because thats the ultimate source.  Feminists, antis, men, women, may answer.  Trolls are allowed and welcomed for entertainment purposes.



To be perfectly clear I'm not saying men are not capable of raising children which has been proven many times.



</question>



<additional details>



edit-women becomes pregnant-9 mon later baby born, baby totally dependant on care-giver-breast feeding is obviously best choice for baby-at least one year on average-we'll say next baby born  when first is 2 years-same scenario-2year old child just as dependant on care-giver-mother still breast feeds and raises babies.  All the while the husband has worked, accumulated experience, seniority, and probably pay raises.-is that good enough?



edit-your source is to be whether you've had children or not-thank you!!



edit-highschool biology would be about the basic level of understanding about the whole idea of what it takes the female of the species to become impregnated and then make a baby over the following nine months.

You have provided no arguments for why women should automatically be the primary care giver. Therefore I ask it in order to see if anti-feminists actually CAN come up with any such arguments.



Edit



Argument re breast feeding - bottles, breast pumps etc.



Argument re seniority etc. - woman may be the primary provider, may have built up experience, pay rises, seniority etc.



Edit



Know It All - like I said, the woman may also have built up experience, pay rises, seniority etc. You certainly don't need to be a biologist to understand that, it's quite a simple concept. The argument that the woman should automatically be the primary care giver because the man has a greater earning potential is therefore invalid.

Re source:



You said as part of your argument that you have taken high school biology. Well, I am therefore quite entitled to state that as part of my argument I have taken biology at degree level.



Haven't personally had children but am very close to my brother and he and sister in law share child raising responsibilties. Both are professionals, she earns more than him and is therefore the primary provider. Friends have similar set-ups.

Feminists have bigger issues than that. They're hat8eful that men don't 'suffer' because they don't have boo8bies, periods and pregnancy. Think about it. The only legit way to express this frustration is by saying "Why do anti-feminists think that women should be the main care providers of children, I don't understand".



"All the while the husband has worked, accumulated experience, seniority, and probably pay raises.-is that good enough" - Very true. You don't have to be a "biologist" to understand that. :-)

What I'm wondering is why women would be afraid to be a nurturer...is it considered a weakness?  A lowly position?



EDIT: I consider myself a feminist--I believe in equality of rights between the sexes.....



But I think that something has happened in this country to the entire concept of "motherhood."  I've experienced my own personal turmoil because of it.  Having worked ever since I was a teenager and then gone to college and obtained a nursing degree, when I decided to stay home and care for my two children, it was an extremely difficult transition!  I've felt like I was worth "less" so to speak...because I was not earning any income.  It was a very hard thing to overcome...I still have inner battles about it sometimes...



Motherhood should be a respected and worthy position for someone to hold....not considered lower on the "totem pole" because they are not earning any income...

<question>



Women are given the option to abort a child when sex resulted in an unwanted pregnancy ?



eventually because they are too young or it does not fit in their life plan to have a child right now, because they are at college or the like.



If women have the option to have sex and opt out of parenthood if they dont feel like it right now, shouldnt men get to choose if they want to financially support a child they helped create.



The point is womens choice extends beyond having sex and not having sex, if they dont want to care for a baby they can abort.



Shouldnt mens choice extend beyond keeping it in his pants and having sex as well ? If she decides she wants to keep the baby shouldnt a man have the possibility to opt out of fatherhood and child support payments, if he feels he is too young not ready yet or it does not fit in his life plan, just like a womans choice extends beyond keeping her legs closed and having sex ?



This is not to say the man should have any say in her decision to keep the baby to abort. Her body her choice, but since it is his wallet, shouldnt it be his choice if he wants to support a child SHE decided to keep and give birth to ?



</question>



<additional details>



The Mrs. you seem to think that contact of the father to the child is mainly for the father.



anta iam saying the women who want to save the child should first check with the baby daddy if he is going to support it or not and take HIS decision into consideration.



A Christian, who do you think it will be who gets an abortion ? Good married christian women ? I think not. If skanky women abort their offspring it can only benefit society.

It's such a difficult choise. I think it is unfair that the man has no control, but I still feel that as it's in he rbody no one has the right whether she should carry it or not.



The idea of paper abortions for men...I don't there'll ever be a solution because whilst there will be genuine accidents and amidcable decisions where she keeps the child but he doesn't want anything to do with it, there are still so many cases where couples are together and may even plan a baby bnut for some reason he decides he doesnt' want to be tied down so just buggers off.



The male pill will be a good idea, more control over their reprocuitive rights.

in my state if you terminate you parental rights as father through the court then you aren't obligated to pay her.....she lives off welfare, food stamps and wic, or in the case of alot of them, their new boyfriend......and you have no right to see the child....but, if you give up your rights then you didn't want to see it anyway did you?



i'm with you 100% on this one.....they can't have it both ways but they have it that way.....and the family courts in most states i found during my divorce and deep research into this subject, side squarely with the woman/mother in over 90% of the cases.....

Yes, it should be a choice he has made too - I don't think women should be able to claim child support from a casual sexual partner or someone like that. But if the two people were in a serious relationship they should discuss this and make a decision between them.

I believe men should be able to choose to opt out as well but only within the first 24 weeks of the woman's pregnancy and he should not be able to change his mind.  The only point at which he should be able to contact his child after opting out is when the child contacts him as an adult (18 years old).

You have discovered the great mystery of female logic, the fact there is none. Abortion or not, females consider only what is best for them and the heck with everyone else. Therefore, it is stupidity that causes the pregnancy (birth control is not rocket science yet they think somehow it is) and concern for themselves and not others in the decision to abort or make the man pay. Feminism is a dead dogma and should be repudiated as the false agenda it is.

I don't think anyone's choice should extend beyond keeping their pants on. I think that's where our freedom to choose ends. Once we've made that choice it should be up to both the man and the woman to be responsible for any kids that they conceive. I can't help but wonder if more people would be less promiscuous if they knew they didn't have the option of abortion. Given that most abortions are done as a form of birth control I think I have a leg to stand on here.



I wish this issue wasn't all about what the woman wants. If she wants to abort she may even if the man really wants the baby - even if they are married. If she wants to keep it and wants the man to pay, he gets sued for child support and has to pay even if he doesn't want to be a father. It's all about the woman. I wish there was a way to change that. It should be all about the child and what is best for the child!

Why are some women so mean to unattractive guys?



I've been told that I'm a pretty hot guy. I've been called a stud, a hunk, sexy, you name it. But I also happen to have a lot of empathy for other guys that I see who aren't so hot. Sometimes, girls can be very brutal to these guys, I've seen girls who flat out refused to talk to an unattractive guy, even when he was just being nice or polite. Guys like me on the other hand, get plenty of attention from girls(mabe to much).
They literally through themselves at certain guys. I've had girls stare me down and bare their teeth at me. I've had girls brush up against me with their breasts on purpose. I've had girls look at me with those charmed eyes that you see in the movie "The Little Mermaid" when Ariel first sees Prince Eric. I've had girls tell me that I could do anything I wanted to their bodies and much more. What I'm trying to say is that theirs a lot of things that girls do around very attractive guys that a lot of average to unattractive guys have absolutely no clue about. Sometimes the attention can be to much, where you get to the point where you get tired of being hit on by the cashier at the local target, you get tired of being hit on at work, you get tired of bein' hit on at the club, do you get ma vibe. You get to the point where you just want to be a normal guy, who gets treated like crap by the average girl, but at least he has his space, at least he gets to breath his own air.

Because they believe they are Gods gift to man kind and that their looks make them special.  Which is just fine with me because if all they are interested in is physical looks I get my revenge when they turn 65 and everything is sagging and falling apart.



I would not really want to have a girl around me that loved me just for my looks and nothing else. Everyone is going to look dumpy at some point when age catches up to them.



As for your situation try to find one that cares about you more then the looks. A nice looking package is great but its what is inside that really makes a relationship work and last.



Case in point I was good looking when I was in my 20s so was my wife, now we are both decades older. I still think she is a knock out but she is past her bikini phase of her life (after having two kids). If it was just based on looks the relationship would have fallen apart (I'm losing my hair).

Most people who are for CIVIL rights would be pro-feminists because they look for fairness and equality.



Feminism is not about saying a female is 'better'.  It's about allowing woman to have the same opportunities based on quality as a man does.  Not discriminating against gender.

Lots of guys who don't know about feminism call themselves feminists. Thats because they think that feminism = equality. Of course most of us on G&WS know exactly what equality means to a feminist - the freedom to discriminate against men.

Mako - HAHAHAHAHA!!! Thats awesome!



starlit624 - I can't think of any. I will say this though, which I'll get thumbs down for saying: You can't really trust the reasonings behind why the celeberties like Brad Pitt and George Clooney would be feminists. Usually people like that are only Femininsts to appear more PC, and get more approval from the fans and modern society, but not because they are truly strong believers.



Also, the male feminists who aren't celebrities, the normal people, usually are this for the same reasons many people are religious....because they were raised in a environment where the belief was preached to them by very convincing parental figures in their lives. Like a single mom raising her son to be hardcore feminist. Usually these guys are very passive, very 'Beta Male', like how some women who are raised to be passive and submissive to men by their traditional believing fathers. But don't think they believe in femininsm in the same deep and meaningful, FULLFILLING way that many women do, out of their own freewill.



Some of these guys are femininsts because it it heightens their possibility to get girlfriends by appearing more PC-non-threatening. If they get girls that way, they will hold onto their feminists beliefs (whether they deeply believe in it or not) in order to be an item for modern girls the same way many people hold onto religion in order to feel "good" and not bummed out about life.



EDIT: Bring on the thumbs downs hateful femininsts, even though this is from life obsversation, and I know you hate anything that is not pseudo science. I have no reason to make this up. These are things I've actually seen and witnessed and I find it a compelling phenomenon. Why is it so hard for people to just be an egaltitarianist. (true absolute equality)

<question>



Can I ask you something?  What is it with women EATING and DRIVING?



Now, perhaps it's none of my business, but when I'm at a red light, I take a look around.  I see all kinds of things.  You'd be surprised how many people, both male and female, pick their noses in their car.



I see people, both male and female, getting into the music they play.  I've seen men playing with themselves.  All of this I expect, believe it or not.



But the one thing that's really getting to me of late is the sight of WOMEN EATING.  I've hardly ever seen a man eating behind the wheel (despite the fact that I know they must be eating sometimes too), but I'd say it's a 50/50 shot that I'll see a woman noshing on something.



If that's not perplexing enough, then I start wondering what exactly the deal is with the way they chew.  They look like camels, the way they chew.  And these aren't necessarily fatties.  Women across the fat spectrum seem to be perpetually stuffing their faces.



What is the deal?  Are their husbands and boyfriends starving them?  Are men actually taking the time to eat at a restaurant, while women are stuffing their pieholes on the go?

I'll tell you why I eat in the car.  I run 3 times a week and on the days that I run, I'm hungry all day.  Sometimes when I'm out driving to pick up kids or run an errand, I will eat something small.  It's cool you like to people watch, but be careful because I'm sure you don't look any cuter that a camel when you chew.

You know, I've noticed the very same thing.  I don't know why, but something is telling me that men (in general) who get fast-food will park and eat before hitting the road, but more women (in general) are impatient and would rather eat while driving.  Women are typically better at multi-tasking than men, so maybe that plays a role.



To be quite honest, though, overeating in general has become a very big problem, but I'm not sure if all these women you're seeing are overeaters.  They would rather just kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.



P.S. That's sick that you've actually seen men playing with themselves while driving.  Talk about an overactive sex drive...



P.P.S. Oh and the whole chewing-like-a-camel thing... I think people in general seem to drop everything they've learned about etiquette when they are alone.

Ladies, are you interested in a simple, yet interesting problem...?



Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?



If, indeed, you opt to switch doors, then please offer a cogent argument (mathematically sound) as to why you've made this decision.



Thank you and may you have a blessed day and have only the finest quality candy in your possession in the forthcoming days.

I would pick number two. This is the way I thought about it. Imagine there were ten doors, and you picked say, number seven. The host opens all doors except your door and say, number nine, and gives you the choice to keep your door, or switch to number nine. Common sense would tell to change because if you do you have a ninety percent chance of winning. So in the original situation, if you stay with your door, you have a one in three chance of winning. Take door number 2, and you'll have a two out of three chance of winning.

ladies, keep the goat! buy the goat a mate and breed the goats. Soon you will have many goats. Milk the female goats and turn the goats milk into roquefort cheese. sell thousands of pounds of roquefort cheese at $16.00 a pound to the chinese. make tens of thousands of dollars profit each month. When the goats die, sell the meat, and tan the hides and sell the hides to boot manufacturers for expensive goat skin boots and shoes. buy more goats with the profits. as you expand, buy as many cars as you want. by this time you will have quit watching tv and game shows because you will be up to your ankles in goat **** and wont have time to watch the entertainment aimed at the proles. you will be too busy working and hiring accountants to keep track of the profits.

<question>



LADIES,  if you don't mind one asking, how many BOYFRIENDS do you have here at YAHOO ANSWERS ?



Come on now.  Be honest.  Now I know that a  lot of you all have a



huge social life,  and you just love to associate yourselves with as many people as possible.  Being popular seems to be the thing nowadays.



Anyway,  women are more sociable than most men.
And they love to be complimented daily.  Even more so from strangers.
Oh please flatter me,  I do not care at all.  Woman are also just as
arrogant,  and egotistical,  as men are.  Right ladies,  sure you are.
And they like to say hey,  just another notch under my belt,  if you
know what I mean.  Misery loves company,  it is true what they say,
very true.  Females don't mind a little bit of male companionship.  So
my question is this.  How many boyfriends do "you"  have here on
Yahoo Answers.



</question>



<additional details>



When I say the word boyfriends.  I am
using it as an informal word.  Meaning
men you associate with daily.  Not
like a serious boyfriend or something
of that nature...........  Wise up.

HUH?



I personally have "zero" boyfriends on y/a.



I would guess that most females here have 0 bf's from Y/A.  That is a strange question...



So, it makes me wonder:



Is your question directed at somebody here personally?  Because you sound like you've been burnt.  (Which is your problem, not the 'issue' of all ladies.)



To answer the latter part of your question:



I'm sure many ladies do like compliments, just as men do.  It is nice to be recognized or appreciated for a quality or physical trait.



I dont' see that as being an egotistical response from a man or woman.



I see that as most people liking positive reinforcement.  Nice is...nice!

Hi



I want to know:



What was your question that was 'logical'  that got deleted?



(are you sure it was logic and not insulting? &lt; that's a question).



You need let us know the question you asked that got deleted, in order to answer THIS question logically.  (add it to details if you'd be so kind)



Because if people are answering your question above, without even knowing the specifics of what was said....than they are also guilty of the same ignorance that you specify here.



Logical debates should be based on informed reasoning, not emotional knee jerk responses.



Best wishes to you!



PS Calling the moderators "ignorant wusses" is in violation of conduct here.



Although, I personally don't think your question here should be deleted, but it could be.



Source(s):



I don't think you understood.  I wasn't making a judgement,and I'm sure you got favorable responses.  I simply am inquiring what was the question that YOU asked.
But you thumbs downed me before you understood my question.  MAYBE that's what the moderators did to you?  Judged too quickly???

This is the only section where I have ever had an answer deleted. I think some of the users are very sensitive.



It helps to try and be respectful of others and their feelings, even if you do not agree with them. Try and word your question appropriately, do not use examples of violence, vulgar language or throw stones at others. Construct a well thought, intelligent argument.



However, if you feel that you are being unfairly picked on, you do have the right to appeal. It is against community guidelines to continually pick on another Yahoo user, if they have not actually broken guidelines.

<question>



Does this theory make sense?



As a woman ages, if she has an active interest in sex and has an active sex life she is more likely to be more visual in how she is attracted to men than women who are in her age group who aren't interested in sex and do not have an active sex life?  Can her level of sexual activity be measured by how visual she is when it comes to what she is attracted to?  As a writer who is interested in men and women's relationships I am wondering about how one can measure an older woman's activity levels with out asking her.  I mean like could I sit back and watch a group of older women who are out for the evening at a bar or club and be able to tell which of them are pretty active in the sex department by how visual they are when dealing with men?  I know that I am explaining this badly but anyone have any ideas?



</question>



<additional details>



visual== how important looks are to her.  Do looks of the man become more important to her as she ages versus when she was younger?



PLus can this interest in his looks give a clue to how active her sex drive is?



Maybe that is a better way to put this.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I disagree completely; if anything looks become less important. Now you defined your criteria as 'older age', what you did not stratify are: income and social status, her own desirability, and relationship history-(also 'self esteem').



If I answered your question plainly- 'Do women become more concerned with prospective partner's looks the older they become?' The answer would be a simple no. Why would this be the case? Older women are generally in less position to discern the qualifications of mates than are 20' somethings.-- this means that older women have less leverage in choosing a mate... however it doesn't necessarily mean that they would not PREFER more attractive looks in a man (they just don't have as much pull to be able to request this anymore).



Now it is possible that your theory holds true for financially successful women, esp. those who have been in long term relationships before (more especially with women who were long-term with marginally attractive 'nice guys' and now want to try a good looking man for size). Maybe women who are economically taken care, and are more mature no longer place as much emphasis on a man's financial stature or social status (in this case-popularity). Once again maybe theyd like to try an attractive man to see how it feels.

No, it doesn't because you are using the term incorrectly.



"Visual" in *this* context means being turned on by watching porn, other people "at it", and so on.  No foreplay necessary, no stimuli of any other kind other than that which is purely visual.



It has nothing to do with what a person of the opposite sex should happen to look like to a woman.



Here is an article abstract on the subject:



"Sex differences in response to visual sexual stimuli: a review.



Full Abstract



This article reviews what is currently known about how men and women respond to the presentation of visual sexual stimuli. While the assumption that men respond more to visual sexual stimuli is generally empirically supported, previous reports of sex differences are confounded by the variable content of the stimuli presented and measurement techniques. We propose that the cognitive processing stage of responding to sexual stimuli is the first stage in which sex differences occur. The divergence between men and women is proposed to occur at this time, reflected in differences in neural activation, and contribute to previously reported sex differences in downstream peripheral physiological responses and subjective reports of sexual arousal. Additionally, this review discusses factors that may contribute to the variability in sex differences observed in response to visual sexual stimuli. Factors include participant variables, such as hormonal state and socialized sexual attitudes, as well as variables specific to the content presented in the stimuli. Based on the literature reviewed, we conclude that content characteristics may differentially produce higher levels of sexual arousal in men and women. Specifically, men appear more influenced by the sex of the actors depicted in the stimuli while women's response may differ with the context presented. Sexual motivation, perceived gender role expectations, and sexual attitudes are possible influences. These differences are of practical importance to future research on sexual arousal that aims to use experimental stimuli comparably appealing to men and women and also for general understanding of cognitive sex differences."

Confidence in their own sexuality.  Honestly, that's it.  They no longer have to worry what their family might think.  They are more independent than they were in their 20's.  And they have no problem telling men exactly what they want...or don't want from them, for that matter.



I am 40.  And I am already over the little miss prim and proper stage.  It is no longer a game at this age.  Now I know what I want.  Why play coy?  I'm not going to live forever.

No.  For one thing, it lacks an adequate definition of "visual".  One may suppose that your intention is to mean "engaging in activities which indicate an attraction toward men", but this is rather circular.

To ward off hunger during the winter months try this recipe.



Ingredients
3-3/4 cups all purpose flour



1 tsp baking powder



1/2 tsp salt



1 cup butter or margarine, softened (not melted!)



1-1/2 cups granulated sugar



2 eggs



2 tsp vanilla extract



Cooking Instructions
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium sized bowl. Set aside.



Beat butter or margarine, sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl with electric mixer until fluffy. Gradually add flour mixture and stir with wooden spoon until thoroughly mixed. Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for two hours.



Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out circles with a cookie cutter or other round object, such as a glass or round plastic container. Place circles 2” apart on ungreased cookie sheet.



Bake for 6-8 minutes, checking after 6 minutes. Cookies will be done when edges are lightly browned. Do not allow cookies to get too brown. Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool on cookie sheets for 5 minutes. Remove from cookies sheets to aluminum foil on a flat surface and allow to cool completely.



What You Do



Bake your favorite sugar cookie recipe (try Amanda’s Sugar Cookies, above), or purchase a package from the store.



Using a butter knife, spread white frosting on top of each cookie.



Let children decorate the cookies with sprinkles, sugar, and candies.



To make holly berry cookies, place two red candies or jelly beans toward the top of the cookie and draw on leaves with green decorator gel.



For sugar stars, trees and other shapes, gently place a miniature cookie cutter on top of the cookie after it’s frosted. Carefully sprinkle a small amount of sugar into the cookie cutter with your fingers, being careful not to let the sugar fall outside. Gently remove cookie cutter.



You can completely cover a cookie with decorative sugar by holding the frosted cookie upside down and dipping the frosted end into the sugar to coat.



Use red decorator gel to write “Ho Ho Ho!” on your cookies.



A snowman can be made from candies and fruit roll ups. Cut a strip of fruit roll up, about ½ thick, and twist it into a rope. Place the fruit roll up around the top of the cookie as ear muffs and add jelly beans for the muffs themselves. Decorate face with colored candies.



Use cherry raisins to form the petals of a poinsettia. Place a colored candy in the center.

Yes, it can be difficult, especially in a weak economy. How difficult it is really depends on the kind of job the returning woman is looking for and her education and skills. College is not so difficult to return to.



And it is probably more difficult for SAHDs to return to the workforce because many employers are still biased against it.

I think it depends on the career/field. I worked full-time most of my adult life, even 2 years after I had a baby. This past year I became a stay at home mom to focus on school (and because daycare is outrageously expensive). When I go back into the workplace I will be a nurse, and I don't anticipate having too much trouble finding a job due to the demand. But if I were going back into the same field I had been in before (mental health), I definitely think it'd be difficult to find a job.

How can we further oppress women to help level the playing field?



The world is unfair to men. For example:



1) Women make 75% of what men make. Women should only make maybe 40% at most. This is because they are weak and can not work as hard.



2) Schools cater to little girls and oppress little boys.



3) There is a greater percentage of women in the university than men.



4) Women get the luxury of deciding whether or not to abort...that is, they can erase their mistake with an abortion if they regret having sex, but men have to go with what she wants.

* Yawn* I hate when trolls aren't even funny. It takes the whole point out of trolling.



To make your house fun an lively for thanksgiving try this craft idea.
What you'll need:
1 vegetable can



Felt: brown, red, orange, tan, goldenrod, white, black



Scissors



Tail pattern



All other patterns



Scissors



White craft glue



Hot glue gun



How to make it:
Inspect the opening of the vegetable can and be sure there aren’t any sharp edges. If there are, use a piece of sandpaper to wear them down. Remove label, wash and dry completely.



Lay can on its side on the short end of the sheet of brown felt. Roll up to determine how much felt you will need, trim the end so that you have about an inch overlap at the top, bottom and around the perimeter as well. Glue the brown felt to the can, folding over the excess and gluing to the bottom and inside the lip of the can. Look for the seam, this will be the back of your turkey.



Using pattern, cut out the tail from a piece of cardstock, you will need this to glue your felt to as the felt is too flimsy to stand on its own. Using the other patterns, cut out a red waddle, white eyes, black pupils, brown head, black eyebrows, goldenrod beak, tan collar, and orange feet. For tail feathers, cut out 2 red, 2 tan, 1 orange, 1 goldenrod and 1 brown.



Glue the collar, straight side lines up with the top of the can, to the front of the turkey (remember, seam is in the back).



Glue the red waddle just above the bottom of the collar.



Glue the head over the top of the waddle, leaving just the bumps of the waddle showing below the head. The head will be above the lip of the can



Glue on the whites of the eyes in the center of the head. Glue on the black pupils to the white.



Glue on the goldenrod beak, overlapping the bottom of the eyes slightly.



Glue on the eyebrows above the eyes, pointing upward.



Glue 2 orange feet to the bottom portion of the can (see photo).



Lay the card stock tail template on to the table. Glue a red felt tail feather on top of the far right point. Repeat on the left side with the other red tail feather. Glue a tan feather to the next point on the right, overlapping the first red one. Do this on the left as well, using a goldenrod tail feather.



Repeat on the right with an orange feather and on the left with a tan feather. Finally, glue the brown feather to the center point, overlapping feathers on both sides. Be sure there is no card stock peeking through, all should be covered with felt feathers.



Hot glue the completed tail to the back of the can. Put some hot glue on the sides of the can and squeeze the tail feathers around the side by gripping the can with your hand.

1) if you think women are weak you and I should meet some time. I'll change your opinion on that one in less than 5 minutes



2) Schools Cater to girls instead of boys because girls behave themselves and actually try and learn



3) I'm not certain this is true but assuming it is it's most likely because women are smarter, and more well behaved, and will actually go to school and learn instead of going out getting drunk and being too hung over to attend classes



4) Women get to decide whether or not to abort because we're the ones that have to squeeze that watermelon sized lump of flesh out of a hole the size of a Quarter. If you want to push a grapefruit out the head of your pecker I'm sure no woman would think she had the right to stop you.

Why do women wear bras?



According to these websites and at least one of the medical websites, bras do not contribute to women's health nor are they, for the most part, comfortable.  In fact, they may cut off circulation.  Bras do not prevent "Cooper's Droop."



Is it because in North America breasts are looked at as genitalia rather than feeding glands for infants?  Or because the fashion industry has performed an amazing sales job?  Or some other reason?



So, why?

Because it helps for support. Some people get back pain from their boobs and they need something to keep their boobs from drooping. It is also socially unacceptable not to wear a bra. When women nurse they need bras for support and so they can prevent their shirts from soaking with milk!

Women wear bras for many reasons. A few off the top of my head; for support to their breasts to prevent drooping or sagging breasts, to not show their nipples (which you realize really make breasts what they are after having seen some breast cancer patients with their nipples removed). Other reasons may be to make their breasts look bigger, since some bras do have padding. Some women hate bras, others find it for psychological comfort, like a purse. Relating to support, men desire perky breasts (a sign of youthfulness) and bras can give that perky effect. However you spin it, most women look better in bras.

It is probably how we were raised. When you learn to wear a bra from a young age and that not wearing one is wrong you just do it. Plus it is more comfortable to cover them and hold them up because it feels more secure.

drooping is not comfortable.  if exercise is involved, a bra is a MUST!  over time, if we didnt wear a bra, breasts would sag considerably.  it is comfortable, you just need to find the right fit and the right size.

It can be uncomfortable to go without a bra, as breasts jiggle around when you walk fast or run, and that aches, also boobs look bigger and more perky in a bra, so there's a fashion aspect...



I have small breasts, and never bother with a bra at home, but wouldn't out in public without one as I'd look completely flat-chested, which would affect my self-confidence...  It is mostly based on societal norms I guess...

1) Because it can hurt if a woman is doing any vigorous physical activity and doesn't have support for her breasts.



2) Because it looks odd sometimes if a woman is not wearing a bra, and for professional and social situations, it is important for people to conform, at a basic level anyways. (For example, if a male had an erection, he would do his best to hide it, so as to not be thought of oddly, correct?)
3) It's important for women to get a bra that fits properly, even if this means getting it fitted or spending more for one.

For the vast majority it's purely for comfort, nothing else.  There's been no research that bras affect the Cooper's ligaments or their natural history; it's just for reasons of comfort for most.



There's no solid medical literature to remotely suggest that bras somehow pose a hazard nor do they offer a protective effect.  It's purely a matter a convenience.

Actually I think you might be surprised how many of those kinds of women are still out there; I know several. And many of those women have jobs too. It is just a matter of finding balance, where said woman is still a modern girl but she has an old fashion heart. For instance my sister is all those things that you said. She is beautiful, smart, and one of the most loving people I know. She also holds a job and is taking steps to own her own business. She does all this while taking care of house as well. Also she knows when to be a woman and let her husband be the husband. She knows it’s ok to be feminine sometimes. IF I ever get married I pray that I can be half the wife that she is.



As for WHO CARES, I too gave you a thumb down. You are so far off base with that statement in regards to both men and women.

I guess I must be a rare find because I clean the house ,do the laundry,run errands and make sure dinner is on the table for my man before he gets home from a hard days work.Then I go to work at night,when I get home I ask him if he is hungry and if he is I'll make him something to eat.I also let him be free and I don't hold him back from what he wants to do.Why should I complain to him as soon as he walks threw the door,he wouldn't wanna come home if that was the case.I believe in treating him like the king if the castle and the man of the house and I get appreciated for that.I don't believe in controlling someone else's life,people can make their own decisions and if they mess up then they will learn from their mistakes.If you have already found her than keep her and treat her with respect.

OH wait&gt;&gt;&gt; let me write what you really mean by this question. Men if you found someone who would take care of you like your MOMMY did when you were younger would she be a rare find??? I mean a woman that can cook for you and clean and do all the chores and take care of the kids and run those errands everyday and at the end of the day she can still want to spread her legs for her man so she can get HIM off???  ( well we know mommy didn't do that )  BUT I think you men might have to go to china to get this. Because us american woman have changed. And if you don't like not getting your *** kissed by us anymore&gt;&gt;&gt;then order a catalog bride??? LOL LOL LOL  I wonder if us woman could find us an old fashioned man around?? I wonder if he'd be RARE???? You know&gt;&gt;the kind that went to work every day and brought enough money home to pay all the bills and put food on the table??? and was sitting in his easy chair relaxing and taking it easy after a hard day at the office&gt;&gt; instead of sitting at the bars drinking and picking up other woman and cheating on their spouse and not paying child support and not taking care of his family???  UUMM  I wonder woman??? Is he rare to find today??? LOL LOL  OH I SEE THAT I GOT 3 THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS ANSWER????  GEE?? LET ME GUESS WHAT SEX VOTED AGAINST ME???

Avoid him.  Post something on your facebook page about this jerk and why he is worthless to spend time with. If his social skills are insufficient to get him to back off, maybe peer pressure will work.



Maybe you can refer to him to another girl - one who is really good looking and has a mean personality....either that or get some girls to pretend they are really really interested in him and have them start stalking him madly.

Remind him that treating you like crap in an attempt to "punish" you won't win your heart, or anyone else's for that matter.



And then just ignore it. He's hurt and disappointed and handling it in a very childish manner (think "House"). Eventually he will give up if he doesn't get a rise out of you.

The best advice I can give you is to ignore him. He's hurting right now and lashing out. Ignore him and let him have his time to move on.

He's just trying to get attention from you. He feels like he's been rejected so to feel better about himself he will talk you down to other people. If you would have shown that you were interested in him he would be telling everyone how great you are. It's his way of coping with his ego. Just ignore him and don't worry about it.

Ask him if he knows the definitions of two phrases...
"Sexual Harassment" and
"Slander / Libel"



Next, ignore him.



If he's stupid enough to escallate, PRESS CHARGES!



He's a bully, and bullies can not stand to be ignored and their efforts laughed at. They take one of two tacts...slinking off, or violence. Fortunately, bullies are also cowards, so violence is unusual.

Why are some men whining that more women get undergrad degrees?



When SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEN THAN WOMEN are enrolled in trade schools learning well-paid careers?



These blue-collar trade schools aren't counted in the traditional data about university enrollment because its not university:



“For many, women economic incentive is primary.  Jobs that are nontraditional for women pay more than traditional female occupations



This study examined the meaning the adult women enrolled in Penn-



sylvania College of Technology gave to their life and work experiences that led them to enter nontraditional majors….



Pennsylvania College of Technology is a public institution within



central Pennsylvania offering educational programs in traditional and advanced technology.  It is an affiliate of the Pennsylvania State



University and offers associate and baccalaureate degrees with a strong emphasis on hands-on career programs. Its student body numbers 5000; 67% are male, 33% female.  Minority students comprise approximately 4% of the student population."



Women Who Opt for Nontraditional Careers (2002)

</question>



<additional details>



Don't kid yourself: there is plenty of book-learning involved, in addition to the hands-on stuff.  I would want my electrician to have a "sound grounding" in what was discussed in the textbooks.



The idea is to make you "well-rounded", and so to make you educated.  I had to take linguistics and my degree had nothing to do with linguistics.  I know a nursing student who was moaning about having to take an english literature (essay writing) class.  Get over it, its good for you.

I think it's so true that employers these days look towards trade school. A college degree is just a piece of paper to them. If you had hands on experience, like a lot of it, they like that. They are looking towards a more practical approach when choosing employees. Not sitting and reading books, but actually doing work for a couple years with someone guiding you.



Edit:
yeah..but you read books and do hands on work for a couple of years, concentrated more on practical part. But in university, it's four years. maybe a couple of semesters doing co-op, then the rest is theory. The first two years of university is basically just learning stuff that doesn't have anything to do with your major. I find that kind of annoying. My degree has nothing to do with math, and I need to take math in university.



Edit:
sigh...I'm trying to praise trade school....maybe you need to get a clue.
btw...bashing another member personally..not cool...

ProfessorC: Are you referring to Obama? He hasn't released his records yet. And he's a heavy smoker and admitted drug abuser, so for all you know he could have AIDS and lung cancer. That would leave us with a president who thought televisions were in every home in 1929 and FDR was president then.

Can you be a feminist and still believe in chivalry?



is it hypocritical?
are they separate issues? can anyone justify that they can co-exist?



and what do you think about chivalry in general? men and women's opinions, is it out of date? romantic? a pain in the butt?

gosh, i didn't realise the need to be so extremely specific
by chivalry i meant in modern day life and as there are no knights etc who ride around on horses carrying oversized poles to prod people with in my part of the world i'm going to make generalisation and apply that to every where
and by romantici meant in the idealistic sense of the word not the love sense (there's more than one meaning)

Feminism is not about becoming a man (in the body of a woman).  It is making sure you can handle yourself, can think for yourself, can support yourself when needed, can do this life all by yourself is you need to.  You don't have to wear pant suits and combat boots and have a butch haircut (but you can if you want to).  Feminism is more a state of mind and being.  Which doesn't eliminate a certain degree of chivalry.  And a woman can act chivalrous too--hold the door for the guy coming through after you, help carry a large box by carrying one side, etc.  Nothing says a woman can't do these things.  It's kind of nice when both genders are doing the sensible thing without letting gender get in the way.

they are totally separate issues. I believe in feminism and I see feminism as being mostly for women to get equal jobs, pay, promotions, education, housing and all economic issues just like men do.



But then I see issues about safety (walking alone in public or after dark) and reproduction as being important feminist issues where womens' needs are very different from men's.



As for opening doors etc if that is what you mean by 'chivalry' - I don't see these as what men owe to women but rather as courtesies that both sexes should extend to any person who needs some help.

Well would there be any reason why a feminist could not be as chivalrous as old Sir Walter Raleigh?  I think in the 21st century a woman can just as easily hold the door open for a man.  Simple courtesy based on your personal standards becomes chivalry.

well you mean by chivalry that a man should treat a woman special? well, it depends, i suppose what kind of context it is used in. when a man opens the door from a woman, for example, is he operating under the assumption that the woman lacks the physical strength to do it herself so he must go in as the big man and save the little girl ? well obviously that would very sexist, very anti feminist. but if a guy opens the door to be nice, that's perfectly acceptable. although, he also ought to do it for guys if you think about it. if this extends to a man paying for the girl's dinner, i think that is against feminism as it puts the male in a position of power of the female. i guess if any action that is part of chivalry could be reciprocal, then it can fall in with feminism

Three types of chivalry,



1. intelligent chivalry, where the more suitable person assists the other person. eg: the physically stronger male might carry the ladies luggage inside.



2. consumer chivalry, where the person is effectively working for that person eg: they might have done something stupid and are making up for it by reducing her workload.



3. get in your pants chivalry, where the male is doing everything to try and make the lady feel comfortable so she will have a better time, thus increasing the chance for him of getting a home run.

I'm definitely a big fan of chivalry. I think it adds color into a relationship.  What's a relationship without these little sweet gestures? I'm definitely a sucker for the romantic views. I'm extremely ideal when it comes to romance, especially in the beginning of the relationship. It makes me happy that a guy is trying to win my heart. Of course, I'll eventually give in and he wouldn't have to be chauvinistic anymore. It's altruistic. Doesn't mean the guy have power over me. Just means he's being nice. lol..in a general sense, when a guy is chauvinistic, I think he's graceful to the opposite gender.

chivalry is not dead.
or out of date.
or a pain in the butt.
it is beautiful, and wonderful, and terribly romantic, i think.



but the way i look at it is, it's a beautiful quality in someone. but if they don't have it, that doesn't necessarily make them a jerk. it shouldn't be required, but it should be appreciated when it's there.



not sure if that makes much sense, but that's my opinion. :)

No...People confuse chivalry with simply being polite and having manners.  I fervently believe that society would be a whole lot nicer if we all followed simple rules when it came to good manners, but chivalry is a male preserve that has it roots firmly in the idea that men must 'protect' women who are 'weaker' and subordinate.  It comes from a time where women were mere chattle, the property of men. Many won't agree..the thumbs will fly, but try and remember the last time you described a woman as being chivalrous, if it applies to both sexes!



We are told that it is a benign paternalism, in fact it is a reinforcer of male subjugation of women, patronising and often quite cloying when on the receiving end!
And when mentioning this in relation to chivalric medieval orders etc...those knights had a propensity to be men, and the codes were a male preserve...read Chaucer's A Knight's Tale..just to get a taste of that, but we are talking about how this notion impacts on society now.  And although I am pleased to be a woman in the 21st century as opposed to a 15th century maid..it is all still relative...knights had more fun!



Eoghan..does have some rare old ideas...lol about women...women's prisons five star hotels eh? lmao...If society incarcerates the most who threaten the safety of the public...then by that reasoning alone women's prisons would and should be virtually empty. If people are locked up just to make sure punishment is seen to be done then more and more women are going to prison.  Non payment of fines..TV licences...prostitution, shoplifting etc... crimes yes, but hardly the ones that make you wet your knicks on a night!!

Of course, radical feminists are pushing for more chivalrous legislation all the time. Chivalry is alive and well, its just institutionalised these days.



One example. They want women's prisons, all ready 5 star hotels compared to mens, done away with altogether in the UK.



Louise, sugar and spice hey? Not sure if I believe that. Recent high profile crimes here include one woman plotting to have her husband and son murdered and two sisters who murdered and cut up their mothers boyfriend.



Non payment of fines rarely results, in prison same with prostitution and shoplifting.



Shame on you for promoting this idea of the better gender, there is no better race. colour or gender. You people and your bigotry.

Sorry, but a pedantic response here is called for.  "Chivalry" is not about the treatment of women.  It was a mediaeval code of honour for sworn knights (and some others) and mainly regarded how he associated with his superiors and the rest of society, which was feudal.



The code of manners to which you allude is mainly based on 18th and 19th century romantic writings and re-interpretations of mediaeval society, especially in England.



Now, as regards these manners, I exhibit them because I feel it appropriate to do so.  I do not use them to recieve acclaim or appear overly romantic.  I also expect good manners in return, and the people with whom I associate are like minded.  I have been rebuked, bith by feminists and non-fems for being the way I am, but that is simply their opinion and people who stand out a little often cop it.



Should these manners be aimed at women, for their benefit alone, and should women feel entitled to special treatment?  I leave that to the individual to decide.  I tend to think that feminists who expect special treatment are being a little hypocritical, but then again, I use the manners for personal reasons anyway, so their opinion matters little.  I will not change for behaviour for an entitled princess any more than I will for a feminist who rebukes me for alleged misogyny.



EDIT:  The devil is in the detail, and as a history teacher, I guess I do get fussy about such details.  I am well aware that the only knights roaming around these days on horses are usually members of re-enactment groups.

Ok, I'm answering as a conservative woman (not feminist) and to be honest, I have a lot of respect for women's rights, equality, and all the sacrifice and effort women made to ensure we have these rights today. Now, having said, that, I'm definitely not a feminist, and what can bug me  about the feminist movement is it just seems some women are going above and beyond equality, and are acting more superior. I'm a successful, independent career woman and I know my potential, but I don't believe in a woman losing her femininity over trying to make herself superior to men. Men and women were created very differently for good reasons, and characteristically masculinity is the height of male, whereas femininity is the height of female. I know some feminists and they just seem to be so concerned with making themselves superior that they lose their feminine touch. And being feminine is a special and unique thing. I just have yet to meet many feminists who still have that.

I don't hate feminists, but I just don't like women who are radical about it.  Plus, I truly believe that a lot of our social and economic ills occurred in this country as a direct result of women's rights.  For instance, women leaving the home to have careers.  Now instead of children being raised by their mothers they are sent off to daycare for strangers to take care of them.  And it is now impossible for a family to make it without two incomes in the household, so if a woman would like to take care of children at home she can't because no one can afford it anymore.



Don't get me wrong, it's great that we can vote and be treated equally, but the breakdown of the family in general is very closely linked with women entering the workforce.

Speaking from my experience, I don't think some women hate feminist, its just the associations they create and the situations they create.



I have friends who are happy to be submissive to their partners, stay at home, raise the children, and they hate the idea of being forced to go out to work, and they wish feminists would shut up as it means they have to spend all their time justifying their lifestyle decisions to women who want to liberate them from the stereotype that the stay at home woman is conforming to.



Personally I don't agree with the feminists who argue women should be equal. I think we should be treated fairly, but not equal. I don't want to have 2 weeks of maternity the same as a guy, I want the door held open for me and to have a man offer to pay for dinner. In the same way that I expect my partner to let me cook, and run the household.

I don't hate feminists, I just don't agree them. I support first wave feminism, but I feel that the movement has gone too far and is now discriminatory towards men and traditional women. Women have equal rights already; there are some social inequalities that both men and women face, which should be addressed as human rights issues, not gender-based issues. I've never met anyone, male or female, who was against gender equality. Gender equality and modern feminism are NOT the same thing though.

I think some woman like the traditional way of staying home to raise the children. Maybe they don't like the pressure of haveing to be a mom and a bread winner because that 2 jobs and more work for the woman. People do tell stay at home moms to go get a job to bring a second income into the home, so they can pay someone else to raise their children. I know the Bible says the woman is a weaker vesel, physically built smaller, the man is sappose to be head of house hold, a woman is not sappose to be a preacher according to the Bible. The head of a woman is the Man in the headship arrangment in the Bible, and some woman don't like Gods arrangment. A woman is also a compliment to the man makeing him whole she has qualities that he lacks she can make him a better whole. Also if a man does not treat his wife right his prayers are hindered. The Bible does not say that a man is better then a woman but the woman and the men have jobs and a place, God made a woman nurturing for her children. So I think woman who respect Gods arrangment value it and want to keep it.

Some women don't like it when other women don't conform to what they see as traditional values, and basically 'spoiling' what they think is a good thing. They think of these feminists prevail, that somehow all women will no longer be respected.



but then it could just be a case of plain ole competition between women.  Sibling rivalry as it were.

I think there are many answers to this question, but there are two main things that spring to my mind.  Firstly, there is a stereotype of the militant feminists as being man-haters, and also hating women that still value relationships with men. This stereotype of a doc marten wearing, short-haired, hairy woman is often the first image that a lot of people get in their heads when they hear the word 'feminist'. Therefore in their eyes, it is not possible to be a feminist and still be feminine, and respect and appreciate men.
The second reason that comes to my mind is a lot of women will say that they think feminism is a load of rubbish, because they like the fact that men will hold doors open for them, pay for meals at restaurants for them, and actually are happy to gain their sense of security from being with a 'strong' man.  Part of the reality may be that the women that feel they need these things to feel more secure are actually somewhat envious of the more feminist types, who may be more self-reliant and happy to live independently.  I am basing my views on nothing more than personal experience, and conversations with women.  I have worked in a predominantly female environment for some time now, and although I don't claim that my colleagues are an accurate cross-section of society, I have heard their views repeated by quite a few others.  I think you really need to bear in mind that although there are many different branches of feminism, a lot of women are not fully aware of the movement and its intentions, and they only think of the militant stereotype when they hear the word 'feminism'.

They believe the propaganda spread by anti-feminists.  They think that feminists hate men, want female supremacy, and are hairy and ugly.  Some of them believe that women are already treated equally, though we aren't.



For those who believe that feminism is strictly a western phenomenon, I know feminists in India, Pakistan, and Iran.

Assuming your observation is true, there are several possibilities.
--They might feel threatened in that feminists seem to suggest that women take personal financial, legal and social responsibility for themselves, when their goal was to be good wives and mothers and have husbands support them.
--They might feel that some feminists have a different sexual orientation and again feel that violates their own social mores.
--They might feel that if they embraced the feminist ideas that they would not longer be appealing to their husbands.
--They may feel feminist ideas go against their religion or culture.
--There is often fear involved with change, and it appears that the fear may be masked as anger.
Remember that feminism isn't a recent development, women campaigned for the right to vote for women, the right for women to own property, and the right for married women to sign contracts.  (A woman once told me that as a 21 year old married woman, she had to get written permission from her 20 year old husband to get a drivers license when they moved to a new state, and this was only about 40 years ago.)
It  doesn't seem possible that women who now complain about feminists would be willing to go back to the way it was 100 years ago.  Rights won in the early 20th century seemed as radical and as likely to tear apart the family then as some of their new goals do today.  Therefore, women hating feminists seems illogical.  Let's hope this is either another urban myth or a truism we can soon report as over and gone.

Edit @ Joanne 99: Don't hand me that crud. I know what feminism is all about it; you see, I make it a practice to understand that which I loathe. I don't give a rotten egg about being equal to any man and, or woman; and that's exactly what feminism is all about. You feminists think I should because I'm a woman, well, I say no.

I think it's just because not everyone has the same opinions about life and society and all that.
Also it's easy to hate the stereotype of feminism, I definitely wouldn't be a feminist if it had anything to do with hairy legs, man-hating and chauvinism. Fortunately it's more about being able to walk home alone at night without fearing rape, being able to enjoy your sexuality as you see fit without being labelled, having the choice to work in whatever career you want or to stay at home and raise the kids if that's what you prefer, etc etc. There's too much to go into! I think perhaps some people need to read up a little on what certain political movements are actually about.

I think that in order to answer that question you have to first generalise all feminists.
People are all different, and "feminists" are all different.
You get the ones that want to reclaim the word c**t for no particular reason (I'm sure there is a reason, I just don't know what it is!) and want to change the word "woman" into "womb-an" so as not to have the word "man" within it.
In any group/ cult/ movement you will have people that are willing to push it as far as possible, to reach their view of perfection.
Personally, I believe that feminism is all about woman having an equal right to do what they want with their life, and to be treated with equal respect. Who doesn't want that?
The problem really is that men and woman ARE different, so how can you treat them the same?
Anyone who claims that they hate a whole set of people based on maybe one or two views of someone they met once is just stupid. It's as bad as being racist or homophobic in my opinion.

It annoys me how the majority of answerer's talk as though there is only one type of feminist. There are at least 5. The "Germaine Greer" type. Most of the critiques against feminism by women is directed at the more controversial feminist arguments put forth by the more vocal, radical feminist who seem to get the most attention. But for the most part, if you actually take the time to read feminist theory from sources which are more academically credible then you will see that the majority of feminist theory is anything but "man hating" nor does it solely revolve around getting one over men . Most of it revolves around the idea of getting the best for women in light of the fact that women have many different social and economic standings. The biggest problem facing feminism today is that it has just been recognised that the word "woman" is a broad generalisation, there are huge differences cross-culturally between women. So feminism today is more about overcoming this, not necessarily geared towards between reconciling the two genders.

<question>



When discussing verbal abuse...?



When a male talks about verbal abuse, women often make snide comments. (just more verbal abuse)



I was reading the question asking if nagging should be a crime. One person said



"Oh please. Get over it, and yourself. If you can't handle the harsh words of a woman, then don't be around them.



If crimes of the tongue were prosecutable then yeah, but fortunately the justice system has real problems to worry about. Grow up, learn to deal with it like a big boy."



Another said



"If nagging does "far more damage" to a man then maybe a kick in the balls is in order instead.



"years and years of pointless nagging". If you stick around for the abuse, then who is the stupid one in this scenario?



Grow up"



If someone asks why a women stuck around in an abusive relationship, people get angry and basicaly say "she had no choice" perhaps that applies to the male being abused.



Why do they say grow up? Man up? Make all sorts of snide comments?



</question>



<additional details>



See, another snide comment. whoa, you showed me.



And besides, you never answered the question.



Nice red herring.



Regardless of the definition of verbal abuse, you did not answer the question.



Oh, so I am a boy, am I? Why not adress the issue instead of using fallicies?



...Ginger...I hope you are not serious...If you are...
I asked why men are insulted when they discuss verbal abuse. You respond by saying this is misogynistic, sexist, and say grow up, grow a pair, and compare me to a whiney child.



So to make this clear...I asked something about verbal abuse against men and why they are insulted when they bring it up...then you go on to insult me...



I simply reffering to a question about nagging. It was just an example.



However, that question, I was asking about verbal abuse. From my experiences, it often accompanies nagging.



It is not "Why didnt you unload the dishwasher" it would be "Ugghhh, you're so lazy, get off your *** and unload the dishwasher. Why do I have to take care of everything around here? You're just a big ,fat, lazy good for nothing. you go out with your friends and get drunk, then expect me to..."  "Wait a minu-"  "Dont you interrupt me!!, why cant I ever talk? You are so rude" etc... (Now, when I say experience, I have heard things like these. Not directed towards me though) (And that was just an example, I have heard far worse, which would be censored here)



Again, I was asking about verbal abuse, which like physical abuse, women often make snide comments when a male is the victim. And again, I was reffering to the other question because it was an easy example.



And I was pointing out some of the comments, because I found it amusing. I am asking a question about verbal abuse, asking why men are insulted if they bring it up. Instead of answering the question, some decide to call me a whiney child, to grow a pair.



It proved that point of the question, but did not answer it.



I have a typo. It should read



However, unlike that question, ...

Your premise is sexist,  your ranting misogynist.
"Nagging" is done by men and women.



Nagging doesn't necessarily constitute verbal abuse.



"Verbal abuse" means the use of malicious or hostile language, swearing, yelling, and so on.  Just because someone tells you repeatedly to hang up your coat doesn't mean you are being verbally abused.  You really need to grow a pair.  How did you boys get to be so whiney?

Excessive criticism and nit picking are forms of abuse. They are a bit like water torture, individually these criticisms mean nothing but accumulated over time it can be very damaging to a person. Its worse than a slap because it is done repetitively and consistently over long periods of time. Any angry response could land a man in serious trouble.



Its recognized as bullying in a work place setting but the same form of abuse gets the green light in domestic situations, presumably because it is a feminine form of abuse and we are supposed to pretend that female abuse is ok.

Nagging is not verbal abuse.



Nagging is repeatedly asking someone to do something that is not unreasonable (ie nagging to get someone to do the dishes, nagging for sex).



Verbal abuse is repeatedly insulting someone with no cause and no concern for their well-being.



"You promised to do the dishes and I've done them for the last three days, why haven't you done the dishes?" is not verbal abuse, no matter how many times it is repeated because it is a reasonable request and isn't meant to hurt someone.



I have a very big problem with verbal abuse, but nagging is not in and of itself verbal abuse.  So your question makes no sense.  Give an example of actual verbal abuse and then you can complain about any insults you recieve.

A question about abortion?



How come hitting a women is a horrible crime, receiving great outcry from feminists, but aborting a fetus is acceptable?



</question>



<additional details>



I am not taking a side on the abortion issue. I am wondering why terminating the development of a fetus is acceptable, but hitting someone warrants jail time.



For some reason, I think most people would choose to be punched in the face, rather than killed.



So when does it go from "not person" to "person"?



That clump of cells has hypothetical potential. Who is to say the person being hit does not deserve it? The person being hit may be a worthless burden upon society, yet the fetus may grow up to be the next brilliant inventor. And again, I never stated I support abortion.



Previous edit ended early...what I meant to say was



I never stated that I support or oppose abortion.



Alright, I have an opinion on abortions. Terminating a life at any time is hilarious, and there are many who are worthy of an early grave. Age is irrelevant. That one person who survived the holocaust, then was shot in the VT massacre, that was death catching up to him. It took a while, but a freak occurance corrected a mistake.



I expect this to be banned. Don't dissapoint now.



Anyway, I was asking why someone striking another is a crime, even if the person may have deserved it. But aborting what may or may not be considered a life is not seen as a real issue, except when the freedom to do so is threatened.



If a man was to strike his wife when he finds out she has an affair, he will be the one who is looked down upon, though she deserved it (though some will argue that she was right to have an affair). When she goes to the clinic to dispose of the unwanted cells, she is hailed as being able to make her own choices.



Probably doesnt make sense anymore, dont care, out of text.



If someons is pregnant, chanes are the willingly engages in intercourse. They knew the risk when they did so.



What about the autonomy of the child?



And people are not free to do as they please to their person. If someone attempts to commit suicide, people will intervene, assuming they know.



So I guess laws stating I cannot take crystal meth is a violation of my autonomy over my own person.

You don't like abortion?  Get yourself neutered so you don't make anyone pregnant.  This way you won't have to worry.



*That would depend on the laws where you live.  Where I live the Supreme Court has ruled that an embryo (most abortions occur prior to 9 weeks gestation) and a fetus are not "persons" under the law.



"Tremblay v. Daigle [1989] 2 S.C.R. 530, was a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in which it was found that a fetus has no legal status in Canada as a person, either in Canadian common law or in Quebec civil law."



A battered woman is, by contrast, indeed a "person" as defined by law.

hitting a woman doesn't do anyone any good. Getting an abortion is good for the mother and the baby if the mother is not capable of taking care of the baby. It's wrong to dump a baby in an orphanage. The pain the child receives might be greater than dying as a fetus. I guess there is no way of knowing if this is true. It's just my guess.

If you really want to discuss this, it's because both involve the autonomy of someone's body.  Invading that body, by hitting them is unacceptable.  As is making a law saying I have to have a child just because it was concieved in me.. both are violations of my autonomy over my own person.

<question>



Why do people confuse socially defined gender roles with sexual preference?



Just because a guy likes activities that are normally prescribed as "feminine" that doesn't make him gay. And just because a girl likes traditionally "masculine" activities that doesn't make her a lesbian. It's harder to apply this concept to a female because it is more socially acceptable for a woman cross gender lines.



To take this question a step further, do you think these stereotypical labels push guys/gals to explore homosexuality when they wouldn't have otherwise? (Labeling Theory - People either embrace or reject the label placed on them by society) Do you even think it applies to this situation?

I'm not talking about someone who has been told once that they are "gay"
I'm talking about the male or female who has gone all their life hearing people tell them that they are gay because of the things they like

Wow, very insightful! Thank you for you well thought and articulated answer!
I actually have a degree in sociology w/ a minor in psychology, so I have studied these things. I really believe that sexual preference is not innate, but sexuality is. Tabula rosa, baby! :-) I  don't think homosexuals choose to be homosexual either.  It indeed is a complicated subject.



What about the studies that show that the structure(shape/size) of the brain can actually change because of certain behaviors?



I'm also curious about people who say they've overcome homosexuality. What is your opinion on these people who go on to have happy and healthy relationships with the opposite sex?



My husband is one of those former homosexuals and he gave me a very detailed description of his transformation. Also, I have no doubt that he is attracted to me. He's not pretending!

I think I am about to think about this and muse for a moment.. or two..



Many people find it interesting and hard to believe... when they find out that most male cross-dressers are actually completely heterosexual!



We're conditioned to believe that feminine is synonymous with liking men sexually, and that masculine is synonymuos with liking women sexually.



Why, you ask?



Because of our social norms and the way we were raised..



We're raised to have certain very specific gender roles and to fall into these roles at all times.. or we could possibly be considered homosexual.



It's not even close to true -- but -- I can see where people can go wrong..



Lack of education and fear-mongering (i.e. religion, social conditioning through teasing and often physical violence against males who don't fall into proper categories, as well as SOCIAL violence against women, sometimes physical) help to create these stereotypes and help to also create fears and hatred.



I think that people that are gay sometimes are more masculine / feminine than their sexes standards.  Sometimes.  Sometimes they're a man's man who happens to be attracted to men.



Sometimes they're not, sometimes they're more feminine.  Same applies with women.



But the mere fact that a man's man could still be homosexual is what you are probably asking about.  Probably a lot of people would assume that a homosexual man would be "prissy", "weak", "feminine", "talk girly", etc. and would expect that sort of behavior out of that orientated person.  However -- this is entirely untrue...  but WHY?  Like I said before.. social norms, lack of education, stereotypes, and in some cases.. simply because it can be true.



People will also take one instance of this -- and apply it to ALL the gay people they meet.



It's like someone meeting a radical Christian and then assuming all Christians want to burn down abortion clinics.. Entirely untrue, but people somehow find a way to rationalize this.



Or racism -- someone will meet one black person in NYC and get mugged.. and then when they back to their little town, somehow make the link to ALL black people.



Or sexism.  Or homophobia.



Fear of unknown, fear of difference, social norms, conditioning..



Not everyone that believes these things we're talking about are even necessarily homophobic -- though!



My fiance, for instance, is not homophobic -- but seems to believe gay men all speak with a similar feminine tone.  He's not hateful, he just is misguided and has been indoctrinated in one of many misbeliefs that people commonly have.



It's an extremely complex thing you've asked, one that's answer could only be found if you studied sociology, psychology, and anthropology for quite a while -- and we still probably wouldn't fully understand, I know I sure don't.



------------ Second question



And, I don't think stereotypes push people to explore being gay.  I think people are born gay due to genetic and brain differences and will eventually explore this and realize it as a fact about themselves.



So.. do I think it's possible for a guy who .. say ..  loves babies and kittens, cooks, cleans, dances in the ballet, likes to wear red high heels in his spare time, enjoys manicures and pedicures, envisions himself as a "diva" or something.. Do I think it's possible -- if he's labeled "gay guy" enough.. for him to actually become gay?



That's ridiculous.



Gay can't be a self-fulfilling prophecy or applied with the label theory the way "loser" can be..



I realize people often rise or fall to expectations upon them.



Someone labeled "overly emotional" will probably come to end up being "overly emotional"..



But ... homosexuality is innate sexuality.  Innate attraction cannot be changed by words or no matter how much you push someone toward this.  It may open up someone who was already going to discover that they were homosexual -- to experiencing and experimenting to DISCOVER that they are in fact homosexual....  But it would NEVER create this in a person that it did not already exist in.



Homosexual brains, from birth, have distinct differences from their heterosexual counterparts --- in both women and men.



And female and male brains have distinct differences, too..



Look up studies about boys who are changed into girls because they were born with both sexes sexual organs or because their penises were damaged in early life..



These people pretty much NEVER conform correctly to the gender role bestowed upon them..



Because it is not their natural sex!  Someone that is male in the mind is male.



Or, people who insist they are "in the wrong body" -- these people also have distinctly different brains.  Men who believe they were born in the wrong bodies and consider themselves women often have brains more similar to that of lesbian women -- not brains more similar to men.



It's all highly interesting, and the studies I'm talking about can generally be located in



Source(s):



an anthropology, sociology, or psychology college professors arsenal ;) You may locate them at the library, in many documentaries (especially about people who have reassigned sex & gender due to a penis being malformed or damaged) and in a many textbooks, as well.



-edit- I think size/structure of certain bits can change... "use it or lose it" -- but, I think the basic set-up will never alter. That make sense?



And - I feel.. that is a mystery ;) Gay folk don't generally change sexual preference. Perhaps he was never completely gay -- but instead bi-sexual with a completely different brain from gay or straight folk. And is just denying his homosexual tendencies (beliefs CAN be strong enough to overcome instincts) and realizing his heterosexual ones?



Monks sometimes were gay and just denied the gay until they were a-sexual.. You can deny sexuality -- but it's always part of who he is.
-edit  I do not doubt your hubby is attracted to you, especially if he always had bi-sexual tendencies. Nor do I doubt the relationship is happy and healthy.  But would I say he's totally heterosexual?  In behavior, yes.  His brain is probably still inherently attracted to men (AND women, more specifically you!), though.

Most people don't understand things they have never encountered.  Many will close their minds out of fear and avoid encouters with things they are afraid of.



However, I don't think being labeled "gay" will make someone more likely to be homosexual.  Now, they may investigate what homosexuality is a little more, but actually being homosexual has been shown by numerous studies to be something people are born being.  For instance, people are born being labeled straight for the most part, but if they are homosexual, they figure it out sooner or later through their natural instincts.  However, being bullied may lead them to other sexual and/or relating problems that make them confused about intimacy and dating in general.

Well that depends on the activity.



Yes a guy can enjoy cooking and not be gay.



Yes a guy can enjoy soaking in a hot bath and not be gay.



Yes, a man can prefer wine over beer and not be gay.



And yes, a man can even enjoy shopping and not be gay but there is a line and when a man tells me he's into "flower arranging" as opposed to "gardening".....he's gay.



And I'm fine with that, just get out of the damn closet and be who you are!  I couldn't care less who you're bonking but I hate phony people.



And I will guarantee no man is going to explore homosexuality just because one of his buddies tells him it's "gay" to like cooking!

Excessive criticism and nit picking are forms of abuse. They are a bit like water torture, individually these criticisms mean nothing but accumulated over time it can be very damaging to a person. Its worse than a slap because it is done repetitively and consistently over long periods of time. Any angry response could land a man in serious trouble.



Its recognized as bullying in a work place setting but the same form of abuse gets the green light in domestic situations, presumably because it is a feminine form of abuse.

I believe you're right.  When a woman resorts to nagging there has to be something wrong with her method in handling her man.  Men respond better to a softer touch, for instance when I want my husband to do something for me I speak to him in a kind and gentle manner, and I get a lot done.  And I never ask him to do what I can do for myself.
By the way; were it a crime a lot of women would most definitely shut their mouths, that's for sure.

I take it you're trying to make a point rather than actually suggest it should be illegal to nag. You can't legislate against something as grey as nagging.



I've never received large amounts of it, certainly not from my wife, but I imagine it would be soul-destroying. It sounds trivial, but it really grates away and probably just makes the nagee even less willing to do what the nagger wants.



If you are being nagged, there are two possible issues. You are either doing something you shouldn't be, or the nagger has some problems. Sort it out.

you are correct!!!
why do you think that men die first before women?
because we are constantly nagged and stressed and we have the most heart attacks than women too because of the constant stress.
they live longer because all of their stress is released and given to us to take so yes you can say they are killing us and they are murderers and they have allways got away with it.
i have been saying this for years!!!



p.s.  even after you split up they pile more on by scrounging your money, taking your kids away from you (not personal experience) and not letting you see them and all that and more a you're knackerd for life

i believe i read that in some third world muslim countries that it was against the law for a wife to verbally harass or abuse her husband. The punishments were harsh. Years of nagging will certainly wear a man down to his limits of patience. everyone has their limits. if the choice was a quick slap in the face versus the years of nagging, of course the quickslap would become the choosen option. But lets give the women the same option, would the women rather have a quick slap in the face or endure years of verbal abuse from some fat, greasy, drunk alcoholic who continually critisizes hers, insults her, disrespects her, ridicules her, ignores hers, trivializes her, and threatens her. It is my guess that if you asked any man or  women who had endured years of this kind of abuse, if he/she could make it all go away with one simple slap in the face, either the man or the woman would say yes. The result would be living in peace for years and the sacrifice would be a small sting on the cheek for 15 seconds. where it is true that there are some horribly bitchy women out there, there are also plenty of male assholes out there that don't deserve a relationship with a hog. When a relationship gets to the point that one or the other in a relationship is making the life of their spouse miserable, its time to move on. we learn as children to treat people the way you want to be treated, but as adults, very few people follow this rule, they give it a lot of lip service, but very little action.

<question>



Do women in porn feel comfortable engaging in extreme acts more because it's the norm- or because they perso..?



.. they personally are ready and comfortable for them?



So, for example if an average new potential porn woman had hardly seen porn and didn't know what the norms were in the industry- yet she obviously knew regular B/G sex was a part- and she was used to the idea and comfortable with it.  &gt;&gt;If I asked this woman about having sex with 2 or 3 guys at the same time- (generally) how do you think she'd take that request?



Now keep in mind that nowadays almost all women in porn do scenes where they have sex with at least 2 guys a few times in their careers.



Now, do you think these women agree to these type extreme (things that they've likely never imagined doing in their own personal lives) because they personally say "oh ok sure that sounds good"? - Or do you feel it's most likely that most women only agree to do this because it has become the norm expectation in the business?



</question>



<additional details>



___
In fact, you can ask this of personal relationships and dating. Do most women when young give oral because they personally think it sounds fun? - Or is it more likely they heard from their friends and media and such about how men like this and they felt peer pressure to accede?

Its a proven fact that most women in porn had dysfunctional child hoods they were abused or raped.  Some just enjoy sex. They all agree to do the acts a head of time and they know exactly what they are doing because they want to get paid or need the attention.

Incorrect. Women in porn do more "extreme" things because they get paid extra for certain acts. For example, anal is more pay than vaginal and double penetration is more than simple anal. It is simply about the money (which is the only reason women join porn).



Young women give oral because they know guys like it and they are usually curious themselves.

I think that since most women in the porn industry are abuse survivors, drug users or both that they just do what they have to in order to survive and get through it by the use of affect....they cut off from all emotions. Many ex-porn stars talk about observing themselves in the scene as if they were watching someone else.



This is just like they are being raped all over again. So if you enjoy watching porn you need to accept the fact that you are engaging in another form of abuse on an abuse survivor.



This is not a truth that many men are comfortable with hearing....but it is the truth nonetheless.

Porn is an act . It's scripted and choreographed. The women are actors. What they portray is not real. Nothing about porn is accurate to the real sex experience. Women may feel comfortable because they have to make a living. Other than that it's just a job.

Age of new gender roles ?



In the past women could not even vote and very few were being educated.Since girls and boys have equal access to all levels of education, Females have significantly higher GPA's than males in all levels of education, Since 1995 girls constantly outnumber boys in colleges,today 60 % of all college degrees were earned by women and this fourteen point gap is expected to grow more lopsided with each passing year. Girls now outnumber boys in student government, honor societies, school… This gender role inversion is starting to translate in the workforce, in business and in politics,causing women to exert even more controll  within their personal relationships with men and this is happening in almost every area.



Is that gender role inversion in the world to come  ?

Thing is... girls are better able to sit quietly and pay attention.  In the meantime, the boys are running around in circles.  Which students are likely to receive better grades, those who are able to sit quietly and pay attention or those ADHD cases running amok?



There is no discipline at home, or in the schools anymore.  This development has been to the detriment of the boys.



Earlier this evening I watched a documentary called "Rude: Where are our Manners?", and that's where I plucked the following quote:



"People's perception of our world is that we've become increasingly uncivil - kids are out of control, people talk on their cellphones everywhere and the f-word is a standard greeting."



This is the world we live in now, one where kids have an incredible sense of entitlement.  They fear no authority figures.  Teachers are authority figures, and teachers have lost control of their classrooms because the kids have way TOO much self-esteem.  They're not taught any manners, yet this is absolutely necessary for civil discourse. If everyone did whatever they wanted at any given time and didn't care about the people around them we would have a state of anarchy .  Boys in particular need to be controlled, and they're totally OUT of control.  This is the end result of all that "self-esteem":arrogance.  Oh yes, and low test scores for the boys who couldn't sit still, listen to the teacher, and read their textbooks.



So feminism isn't to blame for lower productivity by boys:instead,  its the amount of control the teacher has over his/her classroom that matters.  When I was in school ("before feminism") the boys were NOT running amok as they are today.  If they did, they would be punished (corporal punishment, detention).  So this experience shows that boys can learn to sit, be quiet, and listen to the teacher and their grades will reflect it.  But nowadays we just let them run amok instead.

The last thirty years has seen us change from a support/taxpayer pairing to full participation in taxation. The coming downturn may well wipe out the middle class. The old idea of a SAHM is just that. These changes are more to do with the ruling classes getting more from us that anything else. A couple does 80hrs work and has less money to spend and less leisure time than a single income couple did 40 years ago. We do twice the work for less.



So the female role has changed, before she had no choice but to be a sahm now she has no choice but to work. Will we sucessfully socialise the nesting and nurturing instinct out of women or will they be unhappy with this, will taking away the role of sahm lead to a new generation of perscription drugs?



As America reshapes itself into a communist style economy I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if women were pegged to be the admin and management and men the grunt.



The current education system does hold boys back and there is some research being done on it. There is also a deliberate dumbing down of education and the competitive edge that boys thrive on has been removed, they get bored and lose interest.



"Sue Palmer is a former head teacher, literacy adviser and the author of 21st Century Boys. She says it is a biological necessity that boys run about, take risks, swing off things and compete with each other to develop properly. “If they can't, a lot of them find it impossible to sit still, focus on a book or wield a pencil,” she says, “so their behaviour is considered ‘difficult', they get into trouble and tumble into a cycle of school failure.”



Boys are three times as likely as girls to need extra help with reading at primary school, and 75 per cent of children supposedly suffering from ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) are male. “We are losing boys at a rate of knots, particularly in literacy,” Palmer says, “because at some point in the past 30 years, masculinity became an embarrassment.”



Research by Simon Baron-Cohen, a respected Cambridge professor, that began as an investigation into autism, puts a solid case for biological male/female differences in the brain, with boys tending to be “systematisers” and girls “empathisers”. This explains why boys generally are less keen on reading and comprehension, and lag behind girls in literacy. A lot of boys find it easier to explain the workings of a watch than to discuss how a character in a story is feeling. “But now,” says Palmer, “apart from the very bright ones, boys aren't even doing better at maths and science.”



Some people blame this nosedive, first noticed in the mid-Nineties, on the “feminisation” of education - too many women teachers, girl-friendly classroom environments and modular exam systems that suit girls' study skills but disadvantage risk-takers. “Geniuses are much more likely to be male,” Palmer says, “but if you don't tick the right boxes, you fail.”

Male dominated society.  Talking about Western society specifically.  Bear in mind that for centuries women hadn't just been unable to vote.  They'd been the chattels (possessions) of their husbands.  Girls were not popular as children as their father was expected to pay a dowry to get them married off - so they cost money, whereas sons brought in money (and inherited a dowry when they married).  Girls were brought up to know how to sew, sing, and that's about it.  They were there to be trophy wives, were believed to be the weaker sex (literally as well as figuratively), would never have the intelligence to cope with the things men could do, and were basically there to say very little, "lie back and think of England" instead of enjoying sex, and to bear children.  They were given a limited - if any - education, had no rights, spousal rape didn't exist because they belonged to their husbands no matter what, were not to exercise or even leave home much, and were to put up with this for life.  Any real wonder feminism emerged?



Sad thing is, in some places things haven't changed - e.g. China and India where girl babies are abandoned in favour of boys.



PS. I don't think I know what a feminist is any more?  I never used to think I was one, and I'm not militant about anything, but I'm studying Human Development at Uni, which questions what we take for granted about society.  The more I learn, the more interested I become in the place of women in Western society - but I don't hate men at all, I think they're great *lol*

The first wave sought the right to vote, although: "women have been voting in some parts of the US since 1869 (Wyoming) i.e. years before the term feminism was even invented (in 1882 by Hubertine Auclert).



Women have voted all over the US since 1920, in New Zealand in 1893, in Finland in 1906, and in the UK 1928, but it is worth noting that many men (of colour, or non-landowners for example) were barred from voting in times past too.



I support equal opportunities for women but modern feminism has been mainly about picking fights with men rather than promoting gender equality.

Why do some feminists think that people shouldn't change the definition of what constitutes abuse...?



When they've done it themselves in the past, with various questionnaires about rape and assault, resulting in the famous 1 in 4 statistic of rape.

It is interesting that excessive criticism and nit picking is considered work place abuse but in a domestic situation female on male it is not.



Current definitions of rape indicate that men are getting rapes and assaulted as much as women are.



Its a farce in my opinion, and that's a shame for the real victims.

Of course it does.  Alcohol is one of the worst drugs (yes, I said it... drugs) that is legal and readily available to all who are overage (or for those who have older brothers, sisters, friends, and sometimes even parents willing to buy it for them).



Alcohol causes people to act a way in which they ordinarily wouldn't.



I have been drunk and have done some things that I could never ever do when I am sober.  Drinking causes people to lose all of their inhibitions... they are usually no longer able to tell the difference between right and wrong and this causes some of them (a lot, actually) to commit violent crimes.



Great point made in asking this question.

Hmmm, it's something I'd like to give more study time to, certainly.



In some ways, *anecdotally* I do think it's a bit of a toss-up ... I have known people who have used alcohol to 'get fuelled up' for something they already have in mind, and have also seen people behave incredibly atypically 'under the influence', as well as people who are fine after one or two drinks but don't seem to have an 'off' switch until they are almost comatose.



It might depend on the person, BUT there is also a large body of evidence nowadays about the 'inheritance' effects of alcohol, particularly where both parents are heavy drinkers.



Perhaps that does cause a kind of 'warp' that brings out the darker side of someone when alcohol is in question.



Probably because alcohol has been around in human society so long, most people regard it with a kind of familiar contempt ~ a good friend but a bad master kind of thing.



The fact is, however, that we DO know that alcohol is an incredibly powerful drug and the effects of taking it are not predictable from person to person, or situation to situation.



More study needed, definitely.



Cheers :-)

Three Waves Of Feminism
On a forum that I moderate and in which I have (proudly) become known as the resident radical feminist, another member asked me to elaborate upon the "waves" of feminism to which I frequently refer in my postings there. Since most people do not take courses in Women's Studies, Equity Studies or another social science and therefore may not have the background, here is a short and non-academic summary of the three distinct feminist movements of the 20th century.



The First Wave: This era of feminism lasted from about 1900-1920. It is characterized by the suffragette movement which was concerned primarily with women obtaining the right to vote, rather than having their political preferences represented by their husbands/fathers. Other aspects of this era of feminism include causes we would now consider "right-wing", that is, anti-abortion and for prohibition of alcohol. Don't let groups like this fool you; Susan B. Anthony and the others who were against abortion opposed it because it would allow men to have extramarital affairs and keep them secret (since in this pre reliable birth control era, babies were a frequent product of extramarital unions), rather than due to some perceived personhood bestowed upon the unborn fetus. These women opposed alcohol because their husbands often "drank away" their paycheques thus depriving the woman of income with which to care for (often numerous) children.



The Second Wave: This era began around the same time as the Civil Rights movement in the US, and occurred throughout the 1960s-1970s. This is the era of Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer and Simone de Beauvoir - the one that my mother was raised on. Bra-burning has become a symbol of this supposedly "radical" brand of feminism - a feminism which asked for women's work both in and outside of the home to be recognized as equal to that of men, and asked for a woman's right to sovereignty over her own body. The pivotal 1973 case of Roe v. Wade in the US ushered in a new era of women's reproductive rights, while Our Bodies, Ourselves taught women what they didn't learn in Biology 101 about their genitals and how to enjoy them. This era of feminism has been critiqued for its privileging of white middle class womens' needs over those of others, which is what led to...



The Third Wave: This era began during the 1980s and is arguably the one in which we currently live. In response to concerns raised by groups like the Combahee River Collective (their statement can be found here) that the movement was not meeting the needs of women of colour, lesbian women, transgendered women, disabled women, and working class women among others, the feminist movement as it had been known until this point began to splinter and separate into several smaller groups, many of which formed and pursued its own specific mandate and cause. The idea of the "universal sisterhood", of all women sharing a bond and common interest inherent to their gender was seriously questioned since the most visible movers and shakers of the feminist movement up until this point had been white middle class women. Oppression between groups of women was explored, and the idea of "equality" was complicated so that it was no longer between "women" and "men", existing in a dichotomy of "good" and "bad". This era has been marked with major theoretical breakthroughs and the adoption of ideas like postructuralist theory in discussing and writing about feminism.

Actually, I think the 'three waves' is a misrepresentation of the women's movement.



There never has been a time when everything stopped and waited for a new 'wave'.



There have been times when there is less public activity and action, and times when there is more.



Women's lives are not linear and neither is the women's movement.



But y'know, that's just me.



For a scholarly look at the concept of 'three waves', try the links below.

Shouldnt abortion be illegal?



I think abortion should be illegal except for cases of rape.



After all a man cant "walk away from hisresponsibility" when he gets a women pregant...he knew what he was doing so he has to live with the consequences



So if men have to man up to their responsibility, shouldnt women



you may say oh shes not ready to have a kids or she doesnt have money......so you never thought about that with the guy



So if men have to be responsible so should women



</question>



<additional details>



It should be used for rape and rape only...after all if you didnt want a baby, you shouldnt have spread your legs



for those that said what is shes young....do you take that into consideration with the man..NO you say you did the deed so live with it



If she is too young but spreads her legs, she knows whats gonna happen so she is responsible



After all it doesnt matter if the guy is too young, broke or whatever, he doesnt get the choice so why should women in the same situation get to walk away



Kins you say all that...but if a man tried to use those excuses...what would he be told...DEAL WITH IT and get an extra job....so why does HE HAVE TO DEAL WITH it but she walks away



Property lol your a sexist pig for assuming men dont take responsibility....but you say if she is poor or homeless....well when was the last time you saw a man using that excuse to walk away from parenthood....hmmmm....NEVER



Not one person has got the point...your all whinning about if she is too young or has no money....well what do guys get told...get another job...we dont get to walk away...we get told...you made it now live with it.....so should women dont ya think??????????

well maybe, but only if we were in a totalitarian fascist state.
a lot of abortions are agreed between the couple, not just the womans decision, and what about those who are out there and know they are unfit parents? they know they would never be able to raise children and one day the contraceptive fails.



abortion is not taking a life, the child cannot survive without the mother, it is part of the mother, it has no brain, at the time of abortion most are just a slightly complicates lump of cells dependant on the mother for life. she has the right to decide if she will aloow these cells to come to life, to get to the point where they can survive without her, or would you take away the choice of creation from somebody?

Grow up, all sorts of things can happen that mean bringing a baby into the world would be a bad idea.
Violent partner, losing your job (is it better to have a baby that will starve because you have no money) or being mentally unstable enough that you would harm the child.
It's better to get rid of a foetus that is a bundle of cells than to bring a baby into the world that isn't wanted.
Adoption is wrong to, you can't expect to bring life into the world and then give it to some potential psychos (checks mean nothing if you want  a baby to abuse that much you can act up for the agency).

What about when an earlier enough scan, shows that the baby will be severely ill if allowed to progress to term - A short life of pain and suffering will await that baby- should it be allowed then? As an act of mercy?



What if a contraceptive method fails? Nobodies fault? What then?



What if the mother realises she will die shortly after the birth due to a medical condition and there will be nobody to raise the baby? What then?



What if the 'parents' are young kids, under 17 who had unprotected sex through being too young to think properly, what if neither are mentally ready, mature enough, or financially capable of looking after a baby? What then?



I could go on thinking up extreme scenarios but you get the point. There are too many times, too many variable that can not be accounted for to make a blanket abortion is illegal law. It should be discouraged, it should be the last resort, NOT a final line of contraception but in all of the cases above and for many reasons wholly individual to each woman, there are too many reason, logically, to ban it.



The only reason people often give is based on religious grounds, which as an atheist, mean nothing to me. Before a certain time, there is no life there just a bunch of cells on their way to life - It still saddens me to think of that life not ever emerging but if it is to emerge in to pain and suffering or to be abandoned and unloved or to live a life not worth then SOMETIMES, abortion is the only solution. For that reason, No it should not be illegal.

This question pops up in the R&S section quite often.



Personally, I think that abortion is misused. Although a woman should be allowed to make decisions about her own body, it should be taken into consideration that during an abortion, the fetus has no say in the ending of its own life. The fetus is killed in a most brutal and painful fashion. (Yes, a fetus can register pain.) Often, abortion is done out of a fear of ones parents finding out, at the insistence of the pregnant women's partner, or because they feel unable to go ahead with a pregnancy at this stage in their life. Others are, as you rightly pointed out are the victims of rape. Either abortion or carrying the child to term would be torture for the woman involved. Abortion is also used when there is a severe risk to the life of the mother (no right or wrong answers here) and when the fetus has a severe disability that would cause it much undue suffering (again, no right or wrong answers).



Adoption, although traumatic, is a kinder, solution.



However, any women making the decision has the right to end her pregnancy in a safe sterile environment. And at the end of the day, an abortion is a personal decision that will cause much hardship for the persons involved, regardless of the outcome.

ok i get what your saying in that courts will make the man pay...but paying child support isnt as big a responsibility as actually raising the child. I mean sure it might be a pain sending a cheque to pay for a child you never wanted, but is it quite the same as the woman who not only had to endure pregnancy and labour, but breastfeeds the child, raises the child alone all her life...money isnt going to help when a screaming child needs to be consoled. Babysit a baby for a day and tell me thats not hard, does the money u get at the end of the day make it easier?...imagine looking after a child for years.



Sure courts make a man pay, but they cant make the man take any interest or have any other part in raising the child. In situations where the man doesnt want a child, thats all left to the woman.



As for the abortion issue, i dont think such an important issue should be decided upon you wanting to get even cos ur annoyed men have to pay child support. You say they have no choice, well they had a choice to wear a condom didnt they?

inherently related to the patriarchy? This isn't a diss against my fellow feminists (I'm one myself), but there was a question a while back about methodology used by academic feminists and sociologists, and it seemed that some were fearful of using  traditionally "masculine" forms of data collection, and thought that if this was really rife within the movement, then it's just superstitious polemic ready to be destroyed by rational feminists. I'm just wandering if any here with any experience in women's or gender studies could tell me whether or not there is a bias against more "feminine" forms of date collection and referencing, and why and how this bias still exists.

Do women in porn feel comfortable engaging in extreme acts more because it's the norm- or because they perso..?



.. they personally are ready and comfortable for them?



So, for example if an average new potential porn woman had hardly seen porn and didn't know what the norms were in the industry- yet she obviously knew regular B/G sex was a part- and she was used to the idea and comfortable with it.  &gt;&gt;If I asked this woman about having sex with 2 or 3 guys at the same time- (generally) how do you think she'd take that request?



Now keep in mind that nowadays almost all women in porn do scenes where they have sex with at least 2 guys a few times in their careers.



Now, do you think these women agree to these type extreme (things that they've likely never imagined doing in their own personal lives) because they personally say "oh ok sure that sounds good"? - Or do you feel it's most likely that most women only agree to do this because it has become the norm expectation in the business?



</question>



<additional details>



___
In fact, you can ask this of personal relationships and dating. Do most women when young give oral because they personally think it sounds fun? - Or is it more likely they heard from their friends and media and such about how men like this and they felt peer pressure to accede?



___
I disagree with many of your assessments that -they do it because they are comfortable, or that they find it easy. I feel women do these things because they have no leverage and they'd better get used to the idea of doing whatever men ask of them if they want to be paid.



For instance, do you even think women would be having sex for a job if selling cookies paid $700/hr? Hell no they wouldn't. And they would stop at getting nude if that paid $700. Or they'd stop at giving oral if that paid the same. Or having protected vaginal intercourse-- you see what I'm getting at. Women go only as far as they need to go. Why would a woman be comfortable having sex with 10 guys she doesn't know and them peeing on her face&gt;&gt; if she could just as easily bake cookies or model clothes?



Women LEARN to be as comfortable and go as far as is necessary. - This is all I'm saying.



____
In dating, do you guys deny that young women feel pressure to have sex in order to keep a relationship or keep a man? Sure some women want to have sex, in fact most do-- BECAUSE IT'S THE NORM. Ok check this, if I pull a girl from out of a cave. She's 19, say she was homeschooled in the cave and is of sound mind. Say we start dating because she thinks I'm a good guy. Do you think she'd come out of nowhere and ask "hey, I wonder what It'd feel like to apply oral sex to you"? That sounds pretty remote a topic right? Women don't get breast implants because they help them swim better, .. they get them because they (assumedly) augment their social standing.  &gt; This is the same concept. In a world without prostitution where women make $200/hr to work at Walmart- no woman is gonna jump out and say to a stranger "hey, how about $150 bucks and I'll F you ?" Right?

Incorrect. Women in porn do more "extreme" things because they get paid extra for certain acts. For example, anal is more pay than vaginal and double penetration is more than simple anal. It is simply about the money (which is the only reason women join porn).

I think that since most women in the porn industry are abuse survivors, drug users or both that they just do what they have to in order to survive and get through it by the use of affect....they cut off from all emotions. Many ex-porn stars talk about observing themselves in the scene as if they were watching someone else.



This is just like they are being raped all over again. So if you enjoy watching porn you need to accept the fact that you are engaging in another form of abuse on an abuse survivor.



This is not a truth that many men are comfortable with hearing....but it is the truth nonetheless.

having sex with 2 guys is hardly what i would call extreme. Its not a big deal loads of people have had threesomes. I know loads of girls who hae done 2 guys they o it cause it is their biggest fantasy. its no big deal and they are single so fair play. i havent but it does turn me on. Things like that arent viewed as extreme anymore they are just things people do to live out their fantasies.



I first gave oral so i could recieve it back obviously! I was 14 and obviously wanted to know what it felt like to get oral of a guy and its a turn on to do it. What other reason would you do it for?

Edit: No I never felt pressure t have sex. I had sex cause I was horny all the time as you are when you hit puberty. Its hard to resist sex and you just want to do it. When you are in early teens all girls and boys start masturbating and its just natural they are going to have the urges to have sex. No one ever teaches you these things when i first started masturbating I didnt even know what it was. I dont even know what made me do it. thats why I think it is built inside everyone. I bet you didnt know what masturbating was when you started either, not many people do. Its just something you start doing. Thats why young children do it.



When I was a child me and my friend who was a girl used to rub up against cuddly toys as it felt good when we were playing together. We used to play games together that involved. We didnt even know what sex was at the time so we just discovered it. We didnt see anything 'wrong' with this at the time as we werent young enough to realise what we were up to. Thats why I think sexual urges are inbuilt.

It is a business.  When you read their stories or hear them interviewed that freely admit that sometimes actors enjoy and their pleasure and it is absolutely genuine, but at other times they don't enjoy and occasionally certain acts hurt, but they are paid to perform and agree before hand rarely is anything in porn spontaneous.



Straight sex  vaginal, oral and solo as well as same sex contact are expected as the base level of performance for females in the business.  If you expect to work with any regularity you must be willing to do anal and DP scenes.  Fetish pays the most and the more severe the better the pay.

I think porn is like prostitution, many women do it just for the money. Also consider that being in a porn film is a form of acting. Many actors do things on screen that they would never consider doing in real life. They justify this by saying that they are playing a part - i.e. pretending to be someone else for a while, so therefore it is not them committing the act but their character.



I also see what you're saying about women feeling that they have to do certain things that make them uncomfortable because it is considered normal. I do not know many men who would want to do anything that made their partners feel uncomfortable, though. Also what is the big deal about oral? I know some men who hate it, but do not know how to tell their partners, because socially, they are expected to like it. Perhaps better communication is needed?

Women like to get flattered on the things that they like best about themselves. For some women, it is their looks.  For others it is their brains. For me, tell me that you thought I was good at something I did, and I love it.

We want to be flattered on the things that we think are our best qualities.  So each woman is different.  (Big surprize right)?  Some women work very hard to dress nice, so they want people to compliment their clothes.  Others work very hard to write books or raise children so they want compliments on that.

I was born in 73 so I grew up in an atmosphere in which being male was somehow shameful and wrong and embracing your feminine side was right.



Yeah, all those messages came from the media and from school teachers in the culture I grew up in.



All bollox, social engineering based on a now disproved theory that gender is learned.



We are learning that this experiment is actually quite damaging to boys.



We really need to keep feminists out of gov. law, media, the social services and education. Our systems are supposed to be secular, letting a kooky religion have this much influnce was a mistake.

It's not so much the culture as being one large entity - but rather, there are various cultures within our societies.



Often when women (yes, I refer to women) say 'be a man', it often seems to mean "do something you know is against your own interests, and don't complain about it."



When men say it, often it means "don't whine about something"



When feminists say it - it means "take the blame for everything and treat women better than yourself or other men"

Probably race is involved along with changing times but 5-6 not being friendly toward you any more is too many for a coincidence esp if they are all still friends...but think about how lucky you are to find out what loser b*tches they really are and now you know they were never real friends at all so ultimately you come out the Winner because in time seeing as how phony and superficial and shallow they all are, they will not be speaking to each other a few years from now, and your life will be vastly improved for not having them in it.
Something similar happened to me, all my lifelong friends ran out the second they found out after my father left us we no longer had money and boy, you should have seen them run,. like we were lepers, rats deserting the sinking ship and although it hurt terribly at the time, now I know it was for the best.

I am not sure.  I am white.  I have one friend from childhood, the rest are all from college or thereafter.



I am sure you did face some discrimination, but I would really look to see if these things you say happened really "seemed" (as you put it) to happen or actually did. This can be very difficult to do on an objective level...perhaps think about what you and these other girls did and what the punishments were.  Were the punishments fair?  Were your punishments harsher?  Did you ever give people reasons to blame you and these other girls did not give people reasons to blame them?  Maybe the opposite?  Then analyze to see if there would be a logical reason behind it (like reputations if dealing with peers)..if not, you have your answer.  I hope this is coincidence, but I am not sure if it is.

I can't speak for your friends but I doubt race is involved. Just because someone is white doesn't mean they're racists. I mean this in the nicest way, but they may have just not liked you and it had nothing to do with your skin. By jumping to the conclusion that it was about race, maybe you often gave the impression that you assumed other whites were racist.

What makes you think it had to do with race?  Of course racism exists, but when you begin to think that every negative incident involves racism, a problem exists.  Unless there is a certain reason for you to think so (name-calling, for example), don't automatically think the worst.  People do change, and unfortunately, perhaps you and your friends just grew apart.

If you've been thinking that race is at all involved, it probably showed in your behavior. When people starting acting indifferent than the group, it's really hard to stay friends. Maybe the race difference made you more prone to being left out but there was probably something else involved that added up to the results you see now.

It's possible that race is involved on some level.



Racism goes a lot deeper than most of us realise, not just in ourselves but in society.



Recently I was at a formal dinner with some people I have known since childhood, who are great friends of another close family member.



During the dinner a particular political issue came up, and the husband said "Oh because of your background you will naturally think this way".



I was so surprised I couldn't even reply. Not only had he read the situation completely incorrectly regarding my opinion, but I was really hurt that he would think I thought a certain way based on my cultural background.



Sadly, this is an elderly guy who believes with all his heart that he is a fair and non-prejudiced person, and he is also a nice man with friends from many backgrounds who has been good to people in many ways.



So yeah, racism can hide out in many ways and come up when you least expect it. I'm sure your friends would deny they are racist to you, and probably truly believe they are not. And maybe they AREN'T.



If you want to remain friends with them you have to keep working on being a friend, and see where it takes you. Or find some other friends, in which case, you'll never REALLY know.



Best wishes :-)

Maybe, maybe not. If race is/was on your mind, either thinking it was their reasons for doing what they did in blaming you, or if it was their reason, then yes, it's involved. But if it was never a thought, or never influenced yours or their feelings about you or a situation, then no. At my school, we (unfortunately) end up having a natural segregation. It's not that the white kids only like white kids or the other way around - you just hang with whom you're the most comfortable with. I've got some black friends that I adore. :)



It could just be that you grew apart and didn't really have anything in common with them any more. It happens. Even if it wasn't racist, it could have been more cultural. Not every black person with white friends is an oreo, you know?



(Not that they should or shouldn't be. )



But maybe that's what happened. I wouldn't dwell too much on it, just the same. Focus on the future and the now.

I had a similar situation, I was a member of a group that was mostly white, some Asian and with me being one of the white people.  One of our friends was from Ethiopia, and he, after a while, was regularly making statements and comments that showed he was insecure in a group of non-black people.  Topics always turned to race, and how black people were opressed.  We live in Australia, and the history of black slavery never happened here.  Black Africans are a significant minority where I live, but it is not as if we have had anything compared to what black people in the US have been through.



Anyway, he left our group after a while, sort of drifted away.  I ran into him a few years back and we talked over this issue, and he told me he had been under pressure from other black friends of his, and he had begun to think f us as complacent, and ignorant of racial issues.  It was certainly true that we were not focused on racial issues as a group, as we were mainly a social grouping.



He did admit he found it hard amongst the Asians in the group because he felt they had it easier than him somehow and he did come to realise, after a time, that it was not any of us that caused him to drift away, it was his own insecurity.



The point he made to me was that race was an issue: he made his own race the issue, not any of us, and he did regret it.



Your situation might be similar.  Look carefully at how you behaved among these people.  Friends who get a chip on their shoulder (not necessarily consciously) about an issue like race are hard to hold onto: they can alienate themselves.  This might not sound PC, but a lot of ethnic minority members make it hard for themselves.  No mistake, white people do it too, but it is more common in ethnic minorities associating with a stronger (in their eyes) minority or the ethnic majority.
