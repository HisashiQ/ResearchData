Two black parallel cords across the road?



Recently two black parallel cords have been placed outside my local supermarket from one side to the road to the other about 50cm apart, I would assume that they would be police related but what do they do?

Not Police but your local Highways dept. At one end they should go into a box, which is probably chained to a lamp post. They are just rubber tubes and they count the number of vehicles crossing them. They work on a pulse of air moving a counter in the attached box, and the reason there are two tubes is they count axles. So as a car has two axles, the readings are compensated for.

The black fords are black air tubes.  When you run over them it causes a counter at the sideof the road to click one-up.  They are used for traffic counting.  It could have something to do with control (stop) lights, road repairs, etc.

Man tell me about it, i've got two girl chavs living next door to me and they have the parking ability of a blind man.



My only salvation is that i have 'keep clear' lines on the road outside my drive way, so if a polite request for them to move fails, you can call the police and get them to move it as its an obstruction (thats the legal view point) or you can start doing what I do, go out to work at 6am and ask them to move it 6am when you leave and then you point out it might improve their beauty if you did not keep waking them up at 6am.  failing that mate, fight fire with fire and start parking on the street.  good luck!!!

There's not a lot you can do about your view being blocked if the vehicle is parked legally .... however it doesn't matter what vehicle you have in the UK if it is parked less than 15 feet from a junction (for precisely the reason you complain of)  then it is breaking the law, and it is illegal to block the entrance/exit to any thing - particularly a person's home .... in the UK we can call the police - who will pay a visit to the individual and request they immediately move the vehicle .... if the owner is not up for playing fair and either refuses to move it or keeps parking so that your drive is blocked then the police will have it towed away and the owner will have to pay not only the towing costs but also the costs of the compound the vehicle is taken to ..... your neighbour is an ignorant !!***!!

have you been to ask them to move it? have you explained the problem to your neighbor?
Its always best to try and sort things out with neighbors by being friendly towards them before you go down the "council" way, they must not park across your driveway if there blocking your car from getting out, ( i take it you have your kerb dropped, if its not dropped then really they can park there as you haven't got the right of way just because you have decided to build a driveway, unless you get your kerb dropped of course then they cant park there)



if you have explained to your neighbours whats happening when they park there and there not taking any notice of it, then i would personally email the council and explain the situation to them, they will sort it out for you.

good luck

If that was me then, i would ask them can they move their car in their own drive way cause they can not block your drive way. If they don't then i would take matters into my own hands but that's just me, but for you call the police.

In the U.S.:

Blocking a driveway is illegal.

Parking within a certain distance of a stop sign (on the same side of the street) is illegal.

Parking within a certain distance of a fire house (on either side of the street).

However, if the car is the required distances from your driveway, the junction has no stop sign, and your house is not a firehouse, then none of these laws would apply.

Call the police and have them come over and see if they  are parked illegally so as to block your view and have them check the tint to see if it is legal.

As I passed my driving test in July 1982 I thought I was the best on the road!  Until I was involved in a 7 car crash ( I was 4th car). My car was a write off, but I got behind the wheel of my dad's car after a few hours and was fine. I then decided to go for advanced driving lessons. After getting a class 2 pass I trained harder and got a class 1 a few months later. I have kept it up since then, sitting my advanced driving test every few years. 
As I say too my pupils who have passed their tests, too drive every day like they just did on their test and nothing will go wrong. This is what is wrong with the driving test today.  17 year old teenagers given the keys to dads/mums BMW/JAGUAR/YOU NAME IT/ and going completely crazy with their mates.  Some of these teenagers aren't given the keys to the house, so why the hell do parents let them run riot with their cars. I had 1 pupil a few years ago, his father was a self made millionaire.  I took him out in my corsa, he constantly moaned about the power of the car, why do we need to drive like this.  I went to collect him one day and his dad appeared at the gate.  He apologised about his son's absence but he had grounded him. It seems that this boy got hold of his dad's powerful sports car (porsche) and took it for a spin, whilst his parents were out.  the boy had damaged the car going round a corner and he drove it back to his home, parked it and went to bed. Next morning his dad found it and was mad.  He reported his son to the police and was given a stern warning.. Needless to say this boy failed upteen tests.  When he did pass his dad took him on at his business as a "runner".  He was in charge of running to the bank, picking mail up etc.. He tried to outrun the police once in his souped up Sierra Cosworth 4x4.  He went to become a test driver for some car racing team and was hopeless.

If you mean with all vehicles? No - but it will work with most.



If you mean can you use a Graco base with say, an Evenflo car seat, NO! The base of the seat must be made for the exact model of infant seat or it is not safe and will not work in an accident. And even within a brand, they are not universal. You can not use a Graco Snugride base with a Graco SafeSeat1 seat. Only a safeseat1 base with the safeseat, and a snugride base with the snugride. Only an Evenflo Embrace base with the Embrace seat, and so on. They are not universal.

OK so do you need a driving school - ie instructor who teaches in an adapted car OR do you need adaptors for YOUR personal car?

If it is the latter then there are numerous companies online that sell adaptors for drivers with disabilities. It really depends on what you require - whether it is adaptors for pedals or steering wheels.

Many instructors will do lessons in YOUR vehicle - just phone and ask them.

Please visit the following links for info on driving / learning to drive with a disability - any other questions queries give me a shout :)

SPECS speed camera's.......Do they take a picture of the driver? 
Question Details: I think i got caught by a SPEC's speed camera yesterday doing 55 ish on a 50 mph motor way speed enforcement motorway.Does anyone know what the trigger limit is for the SPECs camera on a motorway that has had its speed reduced to a temporary 50mph?
Also
Does anyone know if the picture of the driver is taken?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Voters</evaluation>



Do they take a picture of the driver?
Yes.  The system is similar to the congestion charge cameras.  If you've ever received a penalty notice for the congestion charge you will see that the driver and surroundings are pictured.  That does not mean it will always be possible to identify the driver from the image.  The congestion charge cameras are mounted higher than the SPECs so it is more likely that the driver will be identifiable in a SPECs image.

Does anyone know what the trigger limit is for the SPECs camera?
Because the accuracy is better, the trigger for a SPEC is usually lower than for a GATSO.  For a GATSO, it might be up to 10%, whereas for a SPEC it might be 5% or lower.  However this limit is at the discretion of the enforcing authority.  Another thing to bear in mind is that the indicated speed on your car is up to 10% higher than your actual speed.  This is done deliberately by manufacturers so that in the event of an accident, they are unlikely to get sued because the car was indicating a speed lower than the actual speed.

Will you get a penalty notice?
If your average indicated speed was 55 throughout the restriction, then you will almost certainly not get a penalty notice.  Your actual speed would have been around 50, plus you've got a slight tolerance from the system.

Hope that helps you relax.

If you don't receive anything within two weeks then it's very unlikely you ever will.

Drive safely.

Safe driving tips to help pass your road test:

STEERING Steer smoothly whether you are driving straight ahead, turning or backing up.

ACCELERATION Accelerate smoothly and moderately. Don't race the engine or cause it to stall.

BRAKING Bring the vehicle to a stop gently. Start braking well before your stopping position to avoid "jerky" stops. Make sure you stop your vehicle in the proper position of the lane.

CLUTCH/GEAR Always be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. With either an automatic or a manual transmission, shift into the proper gear at the right time without "grinding" the gears.

SPEED Obey the posted speed limit, of course, but also adjust your speed properly due to weather, road, visibility and traffic conditions.

FOLLOWING DISTANCE Keep an adequate space "cushion" between your vehicle and those you are following. Use the "two second rule" described in the Driver's Manual. Be sure to increase your following distance in poor weather or visibility.

TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES Know the meanings of signs, signals and pavement markings, and obey them consistently.

STOPPING POSITION If a stop is required, stop your vehicle before it reaches an intersecting street. If stop lines or crosswalks are present, stop before crossing them. If your view is blocked after stopping behind the crosswalk, move up until you can clearly see your way, then stop again if necessary.

LANE SELECTION AND POSITION Keep your vehicle in the proper traffic lane, especially when preparing to make turns. Don't allow room for another vehicle to pass you on the side that you are turning toward.

COMMUNICATION Let other drivers and pedestrians know which way you want to go. Use your directional signals or horn consistently and at the proper times.

OBSERVATION Look for and identify potential problems or hazards in the traffic around you - not just straight ahead, but behind you and on either side. Check your mirrors frequently, but be sure to look over your shoulder behind you when changing lanes or backing up.

ANTICIPATE & REACT TO OTHERS Anticipate possible driving errors by others and be ready to react safely to make up for their mistakes.

Where I live if you don't shoulder check three times, you fail. Shoulder check every time you signal even if your pulling into a turning lane! It makes should checking a good habit. And after your done parallel parking, do you 360 check before you pull out and be prepared to tell the tester all the hazards you see (residential area, intersection, cant see pass which cars,school zone, etc...) If you mess up on your parallel park the first time, don't freak out, just pull out again and fix it. They won't fail you if you know how to fix it. They aren't interested in how fast you can go ( despite how fast the rest of traffic is going) - do 5 under the speed limit in case you lose focus and start going a bit faster, you likely won't go over and if you do go over, correct it immediately and they will recognize that you did correct yourself. If you have the chance go driving for an hour before hand to get rid of any jitters. Be calm, and take deep breaths - you'll do fine.

If at any point you think you've messed up, don't give in. Carry on and think "right it doesn't matter anymore but I'm going to do the rest of this perfectly so that when my mates ask what I failed on I can say it was ONLY this one stupid thing."
I thought I'd failed mine quite early on and nearly lost motivation to try any more, but thinking what I've just written above made me keep going. It turned out the fault was borderline and because I didn't do it again was only given a minor for it. I passed.

Good luck!

Hi, i think that the best thing to do is to pretend your just taking a normal driving lesson. Dont let the constant jotting of notes put you offf.

Stay focused on the road and things you should look out for (indicaters, mirrors etc..)

Remeber the times you made mistakes whike driving and make sure you dont make them again.

The key is confidence.

Good luck!! xx

a first-fail on 'nerves' is very common.  Something which is a lot worse, is a first-time passer who SUDDENLY is the king of the road, and who goes on to have a serious accident in the first few months of driving.  Some of my friends were in the latter group.  I failed first time, never had an accident yet in 25 years.

Why do cyclists constantly put themselves at risk by not having lights?



The other day i nearly knocked a cyclist off his bike i was going up a hill which was not very well lit anyway and then just out of no-where i noticed a cyclist who i had to swerve to avoid, the only thing he had was reflectors which are about as much use as a chocolate teapot, it is not the first time i have come across cyclists with no lights, i would never drive my car a night without lights so why should it be any different for cyclists.



</question>



<additional details>



I see a couple of anti-motorists have added their piece so just for their information i am actually a sensible driver, not perfect just like no-one is, believe me other motorists piss me off just as much as cyclists. The point i am trying to make is if i knock a cyclist off due to him/her having no lights and wearing dark clothing then i am the one who has to live with that especially if they get killed, as i said before i'd never drive my car a night without my lights on so why should it be any different for cyclists.  This is not aimed at all cyclists only the ones who have a total disregard for themselves and other road users.

Not only do they need lights, but I think all cyclists belong on the sidewalk. They think they own the road when they pedal in the middle of the street at 2 mph, with a line of cars waiting behind them. Cyclists must think they are cool when they do this, but they are just supremely annoying.

I know this sounds heartless, but there's just too many slow "Lance Armstrong Wannabes" who are taking up the road.



STAY ON THE SIDEWALK, CYCLISTS!!!! YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG. YOU'RE JUST SLOW.

It would appear that they are a different breed of  human being.
They are obviously aware that they are invincible to all vehicles.
This is why they choose not to display any form of being present
on the road during the dusk hours.Or maybe they are just stupid.

Cyclists really piss me off when they ride their bikes at night.They
wear dark clothes so you can`t see them and to top it off they have the cheek not to have any lights on their bike.Come on cyclists use your
lights or become roadkill.

Because most do not ride on the road but illegally use the footpaths endangering pedestrians.

Mind you there is not much room left on the pavements after the cyclists and parked cars have finished, so do you propose that all pedestrians be fitted with lights also as they are most likely to be in the road due to the above reasons.

surely his reflectors should have alerted you to his presence?You should get your vehicle lights checked out and adjusted.If the road is poorly lit as you say then perhaps you could slow down to a safe speed yourself. Why do motorists look to blame everyone else for their bad driving? However , I agree the bike rider is not helping himself by riding without lights , he must know there are careless motorists about.

Hello,
You Certainly don't need a Tachograph in a Passenger Carrying Vehicle based on a van. The D1 test does not include driving any form of long goods vehicle.

Tacho's are usually for lorry drivers only, and are Optional in vehicles such as the Ford Transit's, just to keep an eye on courier staff.

Yes he can.
You must tell the Examiner before you leave the test centre and he/she will brief your husband.
Your husband will not be allowed to communicate with you in any way at all.
If you havn't driven with 3 people in the car before, then you will have to take into account the extra weight in the back, especially if your husband is heavy! You may need to be a bit more careful with the clutch when pulling away - especially uphill.

Yes Matthew and Trevor are both correct. If you are serious, then I suggest (assuming you are having lessons with an instructor) you have a word with your instructor to see if they will let you have a couple of lessons with your husband in the back, this might help you get used to having him there and the extra weight in the car (not saying your fella is fat - but anyone extra makes car perform different - esp if it is a small car) you may find it different when trying to slow down also!

tip - in order to combat the extra weight in the car - just before you move off uphill, ask your husband to lift himself off the seat to make the car lighter!

get yourself some practise when the roads are fairly quiet.driving better and more confidently comes with experience, so the more you drive the more relaxed and confident you will become.always keep focused on what you are doing(as even the most experienced drivers nowadays with the roads being so busy struggle to relax) just take it one step at a time and practise whenever you can.the driving exams that you passed are only to say that you are a competent driver. the real driving only comes with experience and even drivers that have been driving for years are still learning today.with driving the learning never stops.so just take a deep breath and drive like you were taught and the rest will eventually fall into place. hope this helps.

Get some lessons or go read the driver's handbook on the DMV web site of whatever state you are in for a refresher.

As long as being nervous doesn't make you get in the accident, then you are fine.
You should stay attentive when you drive.  It will take more effort and concentration when you are new at this.

Let your mom or dad drive you around, and watch them when they drive.  Watch their face and see what they're looking at, watch what their arms and legs are doing, watch what the car is doing when they do what they do.

Once you've had more experience you will need less brain power to process what's going on around you, and you will become more relaxed.

I would say go out on Sunday when the roads are quiet and you can drive along at your own pace and get some practice in. I would advise either going to an industrial estate or out into the countryside where traffic will be light and you are under less pressure.



Driving is stressful when you start so it is best to drive when it is quiet just to practice controlling the car without having to worry about other drivers behind you who are in a rush.

Hi, I am an ex driving instructor and can help you.  It is perfectly natural for any new driver to be a bit nervous at first after they have passed their test or taken a break from driving.  Their are 2 ways you can handle this problem:

1.  Go out in your car only on some quiet roads so you can build up your confidence again.  Go where you had your first few lessons and drive about there for a couple of hours.  It will build up your awareness and confidence once again.

2.  The alternative is to book a 2 hour lesson with a driving instructor and tell him your situation.  Instructors are also qualified to teach qualified drivers as well as learners and I can assure you he will get you back on track.

Unless it says Permit Holders only, and you have not applied for one, even if you live there.

Otherwise, I cannot see how they can enforce it without adequate signage, kerb or road markings.

If you still think you have done no wrong, then take photos of the area and get an appeal sent in straight away.

The ticket will state reason for issue, ie No Permit, Parking on Yellow Lines, Obstruction etc .......

Sure.  If you are parked in a way that it does not allow traffic to move in both directions of if you are parked in a place that is obstructing something, it could happen.

If there are signs that say "no parking" in place on that street, you cannot park there, and can be ticketed if you do. No parking means everyone, regardless of where they live.

Of course you can.

In Los Angeles, you can get a parking ticket if you leave your car in the same place for more than 72 hours (but usually someone (a neighbor!) has to call to complain).



You can be cited for leaving your car parked at a red curb, too far from the curb or blocking a driveway (even yours). You can also be cited for parking on the slightly rounded point of the intersection (too close to the corner).

You must tell your friends you do it for them to know in the first place, so it your fault for making it their business ??
Just because they disapprove that is their opinion, I would not hitch hike myself but if you do thats your decision and your risk, if you are happy to take the risk then thats up to you.
When you meet a psycho driver that ends up killing you, just make sure you don't disapprove of your friends for warning you and caring when you look down on them from heaven (if it exists that is)

If it was done deliberately, or through sheer carelessness, I would take a good look at the person driving if I was the examiner. This may sound trivial and comic, but its actually illegal as others have pointed out, it constitutes assault, and besides is extremely discourteous to others.

If is seemed genuinely unintentional and was the only error on the test, then no I don't think I would fail them.

Yes.

Splashing people on the pavement by driving through puddles is classed as Driving without due care and attention or Driving without reasonable consideration for other road users. It is an offence punishable by having 3-9 points added to your driving license.

The people splashed or any witnesses could have reported the event (that includes the instructer) and the learner could have points added to the license that would stay on if and when a full license is obtained.

You can also be liable for compensation claims by the victims for damage to clothing and possibly more expense if they were on their way to an event for which they'd paid but had to cancel.

As a driver it is your responsibility to watch the road ahead for hazards and react accordingly, which in this case would be driving around the puddle, or driving through it slowly so as not to splash people on the pavement.

the "law" on trailers is that you dont pull what you cant stop. your car or truck has limits listed in the owners manual. your  license will allow you to tow anything up to a 2-5/16th's ball size provided you have a vehicle of the proper size to do it . anything you tow over 20,001 (combined weight) pounds requires a class "a" or commercial license. the only way otherwise is if you're a farmer. they dont require the same things. and no-- i dont know why.i assume its because they move most of their things on their own property and when they are on the road , its for a short time and usually very slow.  you're only allowed the two right lanes in most states and you should nevr be in the fast lane if there is one. in some state you must remain in the far right lane only except to pass.

Pull a trailer if your state has passed you.  Each state has its own quirky laws.  You need to check with your DMV.

I presume you're in the UK, in which case it depends om the weight of the trailer or combined weight of vehicle and trailer. See the attatched link for more info.....

If you are in the UK and the train weight (car plus trailer, caravan etc) is over I think 3.5 tonnes, you need a to sit another test if you passed you test after a certain date which I think is 1980 something.

UK answer:

- The total vehicle weight must not exceed 3.5 tonnes (metric).

- The "Maximum Allowable Mass" (MAM) of the trailer must be less than the unladen weight of the towing vehicle.

- The trailer weight should not exceed the towing vehicle's manufactorers recomendations.

- If the trailer weighs more than 750kg, it must have brakes.

To tow anything heavier than the above laws allow, you must get a higher licence (B+E is the next level up).

Bear in mind that the national speed limit reduces by 10mph when towing, and that you are not allowed in the fast lane of a motorway with a trailer.

In any car, the airbag warning light should come on when you first turn on the ignition (so that you can see if the bulb fails), then go out a few seconds later.
If it stays on, that indicates a fault, and you should take the car to a dealer for a proper investigation. An i car should still be under warranty.

This is definitely a fault. Your car's handbook will explain this.

You must get it looked at by a dealer as soon as possible because it means that the airbag may not work in a crash - or worse, it may go off while you are driving.
If you are very lucky it may just be a loose connector in the wiring loom but please don't take any chances.

Sometimes you get different sized wheels fitted to similar model cars.



For example Mondeos can have  14 15, 16 17 or 18 inch wheels.

You'd never get a 15 inch tyre to fit on a 14 inch wheel, it just wouldn't go.

Best thing is to check with the manufacturer.

Not a Corsa by any chance is it?

Difficult one - if you have a proper driveway with dropped kerbs, and you've tried speaking to the owners of the cars, then as a last resort you can go to the police, as anyone parked across a planned access way is causing an obstruction. It's not a nice thing to have to do, and it's very difficult if it's not the same persistent offenders, but there's not much else you can do.

As long as they are parked on the street and dont set tire on your property, it's legal, but if there car is parked right in front of your driveway preventing you from getting your own car out, then you can probably have the vehichle towed at the owner's expense.

I would suggest to contact the local authority if you could draw yellow lines prohibiting parking on that space. Ask them you'll do it by yourself, this way they will suggest you they do it anyway. If they don't help, cones are good solution.

This happened to us a few times.  I spoke to the Council and was told that we could pay to have a white line painted in the road (we already have the proper 'dropped kerb'), and this would cost us about 60pounds but really, what good does a white line do?

I was also told that we are within our rights to phone the Police if the vehicle is blocking our driveway as they are causing an obstruction.  The Police will be able to trace the driver via their link up with the DVLA records and will then have words but of course, if it's a neighbour they could then turn nasty on you.

Maybe have a polite word with them - tell a white lie that you had to leave the house in a screaming emergency and couldn't get out or do as I had to do once, sit in the car and blast the horn repeatedly until stupid car owner realises.  Then smile sweetly and say "Oh, I didn't know who owned the car but I really needed it moving".

I used to have the same problem.  I bought a big yellow sign off ebay which says 'Do not park across this driveway' on it and stuck it on my fence outside my house.  It helped.  Plus if you know who is doing it eg Mothers from school, report it to the school.  If it carries on report it to the council and they may consider putting some parking restrictions on the road outside your driveway.

How can I report an unroadworthy car?



There's a car near where I live that I believe is not fit to be on the road. It is smashed in at the back with no numberplate (I have the details from the plate at the front) and all the lights are completely smashed, so they light up white instead of red, for example, when breaking. It's really old and a complete wreck and has been out and about on the roads like this for several weeks. Who can I report this to? The police, DVLA etc? I'm not being malicious - I just think it's a danger to other road-users.

Check its tax disc. If it's expired then the car may have been dumped.

Call either your local police station (get the number from Yellow Pages, do not call 999) or, better still, report it to your local council as a dangerous obstruction on the highway.

You are right to do something because it is probably not insured either.

I have done something similar- went to the police first and they called the council to come and remove it. The car turned out to be stolen and abandoned.

You should contact your local police station. They will not give out any of your details to the car owners and you may be right in getting a dangerous vehicle off the roads.

If it's that bad the police will stop them when they are driving it. They aren't going to have a stake out trying to catch them so it would be a waste of time calling them.

Depends where it is parked.  If it's off the main route then maybe the police haven't come across it yet and need to be aware.



I agree with above, they aren't gonna stakeout for this but if so little care is taken in vehicle then maybe it generally is not insured (which it would have to be to be parked on the road, driven or not) or maybe it's a stolen vehicle... who knows.

As long as you use the local police number and not 999/112 to report then no harm done, better still pop into the local station with details.

Make/Model/Plate Number/Color and exact location.



Maybe also (if you really want to) keep a few dates of when vehicle used... wouldn't go being a nerd and recording for 8 weeks to the minute, just a few examples

Report it to the police as they will go and see the driver themselves.  With the reg number they can track all his registration details through their national computer.

Mobility scooters punctures?



My mobility scooter kept getting punctures & repairs were getting expensive.
So I have recently bought hard tyres for it. No more punctures BUT the ride is so very much rougher & bumpy. Do they do sprung seats or anything else that I could get to improve the ride without too much extra expense.
Cant afford a new scooter !

What is the best course of action when approached by an emergency vehicle trying to pass in a queue of traffic?



For instance, if I am at the front of an intersection (lights or give way) like on a motorway exit slip.  Do I carefully pull out and block opposing traffic and allow the emergency vehicle to pass.



Are there any good websites showing actual Emergency workers most hated actions (probably including drivers just slamming the breaks on) that I can gain an insight from.



Similarly, if I see a new accident up ahead on a highway is it appropriate to stop traffic heading in that direction if safe to do so or would police be annoyed that a civilian is interfering with the traffic.

i am a professional driver...your best bet is not to move at all. let the operator of the emergency vehicle find his way around you. if you happen to move you may compromise his "plan of attack" for the intersection the vehicle is approaching, the only time i would suggest moving is when the vehicle can not get around you at all, i.e barriers on both sides...then move slowly into the intersection and pull onto the right shoulder and try not to impede traffic.

As you have said "intersection" and "highway" I am assuming you're from the US, so asking this question on UK and Ireland is gonna give you misleading answers. As a general rule, get out of the vehicles way as soon as safely possible. For and answer more relevant to where you live try http://answers.yahoo.com as opposed to http://uk.answers.yahoo.com :)

The rules are: You must give way (move out of the way) of the emergency vehicle at the first SAFE opportunity.  If you cannot move out of the way safely and may put yourself and/or someone else in danger then stay where you are.  The emergency vehicle driver will know this.
