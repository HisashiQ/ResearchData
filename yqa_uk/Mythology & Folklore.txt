I believe in some cases, yes. It would depend on a few things: How open to this possibility the deceased was, and how "in touch" with these things you are.
As for what to look for, it would depend a lot on your mom. Case in point: (It's a kinda long story, but I think it will illustrate quite nicely)



My grandmother was an amazing woman... born in a blizzard in a little flyspeck in WV. If it was raining when we were kids and we were at her house, as long as it wasn't thundering or anything, she'd kick us outside to go play in it, and most of the time, she'd join us... she couldn't resist a walk in the rain. She passed away at the tail end of Hurricane Irene... we could tell she was ready to go, but there was something wrong. We had her in a hospital bed under one of the windows and mom figured out what was keeping her... Granny would have NEVER had all the windows closed during a hurricane. So mom opened the window, Granny smiled and was gone. Now on the west side of my parent's house, there's a small ship's bell hanging on a fencepost... for some reason it's never rung during a hurricane... I guess it's just a sheltered spot (there's a few around their house... spots where you can stand outside when a storm's blowing it's hardest and you can light a match no problem.) This storm was the same... wind blowing like mad, and that bell hadn't made a sound. Right after Granny left, the bell started going mad. It wasn't just one ding, it was CLANG CLANG CLANG like someone was out there swinging it by the rope.



I also had a dream the other night that I ran into one of my uncles (who passed away several years ago)... one of the most vivid dreams I've ever had, I still remember all the details. Basically though, we discussed a few things and I got to show him my 5 month old daughter... In cases like this, I believe a dream's a dream, but it made me feel like he knew and he was happy... I had the oddest feeling that entire day...



Anyway, just keep your eyes (and perhaps ears) open as well... if you're prone to listening to cds or mp3s in your car, turn on the radio for a while... (another long story that I won't get into.)

No. Nobody can prove it exists just like nobody can prove it doesn't or that God exists. To believe in heaven or hell you would need to be religious and have faith that they exist and if you do, then proof is irrelevant.

Why would we want to?  If you've ever read Karen Armstrong, who is a great writer about Monotheism, and one of very few agnostics who are licensed to teach theology, she has essentially shown that Fundamentalists of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim religions are almost universally using MODERN ideas of truth and reality which have NOTHING to do with the core teachings of these religions.  This is NOT an attack on Kosher Laws or the Shari'a but rather, based on the study of them and traditional interpretations, an analysis of many of the modern thinkers who have studied them.



The poet Robert Graves, in his bracing, (sometimes wrong headed) and well-researched essays about Goddess Worship and the Pagan philosophy, repeatedly differentiated between Poetic Truth and Prosaic Truth.  He complained that in the modern world we too often confused the two, and Armstrong shows that in this case he is right.



If you are a Believer, Faith is one of your obligations.  If you are not a Believer, then perhaps you might feel no obligation to Faith, but there is a perspective that you are definitely missing out on.



Whether Heaven and Hell exist is less important than whether Good and Evil do, but it's Good to Believe.

Here are the words that changed me... in my dream



My dead friend and I was playing a computer game.



I ask him instantly my unanswerable question..



Is Heaven Real? He answered a big "Yes", You know I am dead and you know I have sin, I can only go to heaven if I erase that sin.



Even though I am dead I am given a chance to exist in this world to erase my sin and be clean to enter heaven.



"My mind isn't thinking about heaven or hell when I dreamed this it just pop out so I think that God gives me a sign to erase my sin while I am still in this world". you know what I mean

never heard that bad luck comes in threes...........i have always heard that DEATHS happen in threes



i worked at a nursing home once and it really did seem to happen that way often



and in the Bible, it says to celebrate death, and to morn any births. we obviously have got this backwards, but if we should indeed be celebrating the deaths that occur, perhaps that is why the third time is also lucky

Is America Headed for Hell in a hand basket?



Well I can't think why we are not now that we have a "black president" who is probably not even technically an American Citizen.  How long do you think it will take in four years for white people to become the minority?

On what grounds is President Obama not an American Citizen, and don't try to justify it by saying technically, either he is or he isn't.



Oh and you're worried that at some time "whites" will become a minority.  So wouldn't now be the right time for a president who is determined to have the right person in the right place, sod their ethnicity, in charge? (better late than never).



Final question, you would prefer John McCain?  I can only conclude that you are indeed deluded!

I don't give a rat's rear-end what "color" our president is - so long as he works hard to do a good job.



"not even technically an American citizen"? - please clarify what you mean by "technically", because according to what I know of our citizenship laws - O'Bama has been a U.S. citizen since birth.  (Born in Hawaii, which was a U.S. state at the time of his birth which automatically makes him a citizen.  And his Mom is a natural-born citizen as well - it doesn't matter that his father came from another country.)



If anything, it is continued ignorance, intolerance, and bigotry by the majority of people in this country that will send it to "hell in a handbasket".

Then I go and read such questions, my heart sinks.  Your President elect has a really hard task ahead when there are obviously still so many small minded racist people ready to judge him because of his skin.



Blimey I remember when you had a  B movie star cowboy in charge who by the way had Alzheimer's, get a grip and do your duty, support your new President and maybe, just maybe America might be able to hold its head up again.

No one person can be responsible for how messed up the nation is, not even the President though that office and any partisan cronies can influence things to a significant extent.



I suggest you try being grateful that we don't have people in office for whom part of their PARTY PLATFORM is religious nutbaggery, which includes discrimination against homosexuals and stem cell research among the things it considers wrong according to God, which I'm sure deep down they feel everyone needs to obey regardless of individual choice.

do you think that blind people are afraid of the dark. we are afraid of the dark because, we fear blindness, the insecurity of not knowing what is in the room with you. i was once afraid of the dark, but i over came it, because i know that demons and ghost are around in light, so what is the difference in the dark, they are their regardless, you can not see them in the light neither. the best way to over come this is practice staying in the dark. remember that it is a childhood fear that you developed and needs to die.

What are the differences between the Knight in The Knights Tale and the real medieval knights?



Canterbury Tales



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The difference between knights in the canterbury Tales (IE Knight's Tale - one of many tales) and real knights is mainly one of Chivalry.



Chaucer loved the ideal of chivalry - of unrequited love, and knights always being honorable - a theme carried on until today.



realistically, a knight was likely of the upper classes because he had to be able to afford his own horses, armor, assistants,etc - and the average person just didn't ahve the funds to own a horse.



Consider them the sports heroes of their day - they traveled about- like in the movie- competed and won prizes.



yes, if you dehorsed a knight, you did win his horse, but if you were decent, you let him buy it back from you - if he could.  Prizes weren't often as frivilous as statues and such like in the movie, but unless they were noblemen, those statues often got treated just as they did in the movie - broken and sold, melted down for the gold.  Usually a purse of some cash value was given as a prize.



Chivalry - nice concept - didn't exist.  Lots of knights thought they were entitled to whatever they wanted, so they took it - women, food, lodging, etc.



They were ultimate party boys - compare them to some of the sports stars of today - they did their best, and often had things like rape, drunkenness, theft overlooked because they were sports heroes.  Not that they had to rape much - women were often throwing themselves on them.



However, the more serious side - in wartimes, the knights who were nobility were indeed expected to go off to battle and war.  They did often stay out of the main frays, because you didn't just waste a perfectly good nobleman like that.



Knights were often bound to another noble or king for periods of service - and realistically, most knights were mercenaries - they worked for the highest paying person, regardless of the job he would have them do.



they were tough men who lived very hard and died very hard, often young.



many knights lived right on the border of poverty, because they didn't believe in saving their cash - they were either flush with money, or they were broke and on the edge of starving, because they would buy drink, food, gamble, buy women,buy nice accomdations untilt he cash ran out and they were back to sleeping on the side of the road.



Those who did live to older age often became guards or swordmasters for various nobles.



being an old knight would NOT have been fun, due to all the injuries they had gotten through their career- as they aged, the aches would have been bad.

you might be running into the wrong people to ask these questions.  You need to talk to a true indian shaman to get straight answers.  people of the cults are not always so nice and you can potentially become a target.

Once upon a time, early in the morning at the Waffle House, I had a girl who believed in and thought she was a witch threaten to put a hex on me. I told her that I didn't believe in such things but that if anything weird started happening to me or around me that Brothers Smith&Wesson along with their 357 Disciples would deal with it! Further more, because I read the Scriptures every GD day, I could convince a Jury of my peers that I did believe in such things and that she'd 'scared' me and I'd get off for putting another hole in her head! The moral of the story is this: These people who believe in werewolves, witchcraft and vampires and the like are pathetic morons...

to openly ask about a certain group that is as underground as werewolves or vampires is rather taboo, but it is natural to be curious. what exactly would you like to know? if you email me, i will tell you all i know. if not, i hope you find what you are looking for.

You have to realize that to the native americans, any form that is not naturally - vampires, were animals - is dangerous, some consider it an abomination, and all consider them worthy of fear and a great deal of caution.  To those I've spoken to, these things are curses from gods - they as humans did something (this time around or last) that got them deserving of such a fate.



As for learning  about them, you're likely going to have to turn to books and do some serious research.  I'd read all you could, take a lot of it with a grain of salt and those things repeated over and over - especially out of texts written by serious scholars and ancient texts - take those few things as fact.



Otherwise, check a dream guide - here is what I found regarding dreaming about a werewolf - The werewolf may represents something in your life or in your own personality. When interpreting this dream, consider internal and external factors that generally seem normal but have a tendency to transform into undesirable, hurtful, or dangerous concerns in your life.

Aura (as I"m guessing you are meaning) is the magnetic energy that surrounds a living being. Normally, when referring to aura, someone is talking about being able to see this energy as different colors. Most would agree that children can see these colors- hence why they color in "weird" colors. Some people retain the ability to see the colors, even after they have left childhood. Reading aura is useful for diagnosing problems with someone's attitude, or chronic health issues.



It's really hard to learn to see them once you've become older. There are some books on it, though you could probably find most info you'd need through a google search.



Hope it helps.

Do you mean an 'aura'?  The Aurora is the band of colored lights you see in Alaska near the north pole.  The Aura is the bands of energy that surround living (and some none living) things.  Some people can physically see the auric colors without the help of special photography called Kirilen photography which captures the different electrical frequencies as different shades of color.  Another method of reading auras comes from using your own auric power to sense the auras of other through your hands.  This is the method used by T Touch practitioners and other energy body healers.  It is not as known as the sight readers and certainly not as 'flashy', but it works.  It does take training and work, and not everyone can do it.

Merlin, upon realizing that Uther was NOT the prophecied king, took the sword back.  Depending on which writing of it you read, Merlin then had the sword and put it in a rock, a tree, or hidden it from the eyes of everyone but the one who really was supposed to be  the promised king.



Arthur - fostered out as a child as was common in those days, grew up supposedly without knowledge that he was a king/war leader's son.  Merlin was either in his life as his teacher when Arthur was growing up, or he came later as Arthur reached his majority - about age 15.  Either way,. Merlin was his guide and mentor for a time.



As to how he aquired the sword - some versions say the sword became a holy shrine in the Christian sense, and was worshipped at and it became common effort to try to draw the sword from the stone - or the tree.  And that there was rebellion when a young, untried, unknighted boy managed to draw it.



More realistically, given the time and the religions of the area - Merlin hid the sword and gave it to Arthur and proclaimed him king on Uther's death - which in itself caused rebellion - becuse of Arthur's age and experience, and because that's just what the clan leaders in Britain did in those days.



Common agreement is that the sword was one of the three things given to humans by the Tuatha De Danann - the sword, the cauldron, and the spear.



When Arthur failed, the sword went back into hiding until such a time as another leader would surface who could use it.



A good source for reference - http://www.sacred-texts.com - look up King Arthur.



You're going to have to choose which legend to follow, or even better, talk about the disparaties in the different mythos surrounding it.



EDIT - wow  - thumbs down for knowing that the myths are different, depending on when and who wrote them? That Mallory's 15th century french version is a sissyfied version, that E.B.White did a better job in research and and historical basis when he wrote "Once and Future King" and that history itself shows that there never was a king named arthur, but that there may well have been a warlord of that name.  But thanks for the thumbs down, showing your ignorance on the topic

He went out seeking adventure and was challenged by King Pellinore the strongest man of the time. In the duel, his sword broke. Merlin made Pellinore sleep. Then, he took Arthur to Nyneve the Lady of the Lake. She offered him an unbreakable magic sword. A hand arose from the lake in which she lived, and it held a fine sword. Arthur went in a boat and took it. He was told to return it to the lake when his life was ending. Merlin told him that the scabbard would prevent him from bleeding to death as long as he wore it. He had a rematch with Pellinore and won. Pellinore became a Knight of the Round Table, and so did his sons years later. Lamerok was one of the five foremost of all, along with Galahad, Lancelot, Tristram and Gawain. Percival or Parsifaal was one of three sinless enough to find the Holy Grail with Galahad and Bors. I see that other answers have some confusion with the sword Arthur drew fom the stone to prove he was rightful king when he was a boy. He evidently  broke that one fighting Pellinore though. I go by Sir Thomas Malory's "Le Morte d'Arthur" that is the definitive version of the story. Each troubadour invented his own chansons about Arthur or Charlemagne, so you'll be very confused if you try to hear all of the versions of the Arthur saga. Excalibur was most surely the one the Lady of the Lake gave him that he returned to her when he was dying.

You should be afraid. What is in your closet is probably one of several things. While you haven't posted much information on it, I suppose that is because you have limited information on it yourself. On this basis, I am going to say it is either a khokhan or a barghest.



If you're over the age of sixteen, you have very little to fear if it is a khokhan. It will try to frighten you, and probably take the form of the darkness itself. However, if you ever percieve even the hint of a doglike shape, if you smell sulfurous emissions, or glowing spittle, run as fast as you can, as your home is infested by a barghest.

Sounds like you have a really nasty infestation! They are tricky little beggars, they lurk in the cupboard, having entered the country illegally, do no work and then sneak out at night and ravish your wife then give her genital warts (at least that's her story...)



You can get an ointment for this. You apply the salve morning, noon and night,  to the knob (of the closet!) so the grip is slippery from both sides then the goblins can't escape from inside and your wife can't let them out for her nightly servicing without leaving greasy fingerprints on the paintwork.



These fingermarks are legal grounds for divorce.



Good luck!

Subdued light mean lowered in intensity or strength; reduced in fullness of tone, as in color.  A dark street with a single dim street light would be subdued light.  Subdued lighting is some things used to make a room more friendly.  All it takes in turning down the brightness of the light.
Godspeed.

Are we really really lucky?



i mean, just think, our generation has seen the best of almost everything in sports, eg:
1)Schumacher, possibly the greatest F1 driver
2)Loeb, possibly the finest Rally driver
3)Rossi, best ever Moto Gp rider
4)Fedrer, best of the best
5)Zidane, arguably the finest footballer



earlier generations were lucky to see any one of these, but we can talk about so many of these legends wit our grand children (i'm not gonna have any)
seriously, what do you think?

Help with my SUPER scared Bunny.?



I got a bunny last April. When we first got her, my little brother wouldn't stop touching her. My parents keep her in our garage(BUT we always make sure that shes nice and warm!)
Shes so scared. Every time I open the cage she bolts to the other side of the cage. she will NOT let anyone touch her. Im worried that we broke her or something.
Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I don't want her to be so afraid of me. I want to be her friend!

Difference between telltale, talltale, folklore, and urban legends?



What is based on real events, what is made up, I can never really tell the difference!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Tell tales (derived from telling tales- lying) are stories that are usually made up entirely by the originator.
Tall tales are usually based on a real person or event, but have been exaggerated (ex. Paul Bunyan).
Folklore is usually tales within a certain people group or region and don't necessarily have to be stories (superstitions are regarded as folklore).
Urban legends are similar to folklore, but are usually more modern, like Hook-hand.

Guy Fawkes (13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606) sometimes known as Guido Fawkes, was a member of a group of English Roman Catholic revolutionaries who planned to carry out the Gunpowder Plot.



The Gunpowder Conspiracy of 1605, or the Powder Treason or Gunpowder Plot, as it was known at the time,[1] was a failed assassination attempt by a group of provincial English Catholics against King James I of England and VI of Scotland. The plot intended to kill the king, his family, and most of the Protestant aristocracy in a single attack by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening on 5 November 1605. The conspirators had also planned to abduct the royal children, not present in Parliament, and incite a popular revolt in the Midlands.



He was catholic, government protestant, catholics and protestants were essentially at war.

Guido Fawkes was a English Catholic revolutionary who planned to attack and kill the Protestant King James I of England.



The attack was planned by Robert Catesby. They wanted to kill the king because he was a Protestant and was persecuting the Catholics in Britain and had decided to translate the Bible into english, which the Catholics thought was sinful.

Fortune telling/mystic worlds i.e. dream's granted true ect?

Depending on what you mean, you might want to check out;
http://www.sanguinarium.net/
This is for enthusiasts and those who call them selfs vampires (or vampyres). They produce an almanac which cover their special days, mostly birthdays of famous horror writers and anniversaries  of historic events.



If your talking about actual undead blood suckers, you can still check with these guys, they should be able to point you in the right direction

If you buy a board in the store, it has magnets in it and its a game. If you handmake one however, that is different. There are differing views (aren't there always?) and basically here is mine. If the intent is positive, no harm should come from it. If the user is being silly and asking questions like "Is Elvis Alive?" or "Does Hell Exist?" they are not going to get very far with it. The board is meant to communicate with a spirit. Some people beleive demons come through the board, I personally do not as I don't beleive in demons anyway. I do think that sometimes the experiences can be merely reading the energies in the air that are actually coming from another person, like reading auras in a way. If Amy is asking about Suzy's grandma, whom she knows nothing about, and Suzy is thinking hard about grandma....Amy could easily pick up on some very interesting facts about grandma and then in a sense "convince" Suzy her grandma is there. I don't use one often, but I have. I don't recommend anyone using one whom has an obsession with them. That is just simply not healthy.

I would avoid ouija boards. They are too open, uncontrolled access portal. When summoning and calling, unless you already have alot of protection, you need to contain the entity, be able to control the entity, then discharge the entity. What controls do you have with ouija, none.
It is like posting online, anyone can answer,
as opposed to emailing someone you choose, more controlled..

look- I've seen people play it. I'm not a big religious person ...far from it- but I do believe in God and just as well I believe there are evil spirits in this world. This game is an enabler and gives an opportunity for one of these bad spirits to manifest it self. I thought it was just a game and I thought nothing of it- Until i saw a show on the History channel that was talking about demonic possession in history and it gave a very viable case of a teenage boy that played the ouija board with his aunt and ended up getting possessed. The Catholic church had to several exorcisms on him.



Weather you believe in this type of stuff or not I think it would be wise to just respect it and keep your distance.

I  have used a Ouija with no ill results. I have had friends that have used them with disastrous results. I have always thought it to be a benign way to contact the spirit world. However i always say a spell/prayer of protection before starting and a spell/prayer of thanks when I am finished. I have a current contact that tells me that she believes that she is now being stalked by a demon after her experience with the Ouija. I still think that it can be a fun safe way to contact the spirit world if the proper precautions are taken.But of course ultimately it is up to you if you want to take the chance. Peace&Love be with you...~M~

I used to believe that it was only a game and nothing more,  sort of like seances.  Until I actually saw a demonic manifestation.



I was at a slumber party when I was about 17,  and a bunch of the girls wanted to have a seance in which they levitated someone.  The idea was to have one of them lie on the floor while the others sat around her with two fingers from each hand underneath her.  Another Christian girl and I didn't want to do this,  since they clearly were going into the occult. So we went into a back bedroom and played cards while the others did their thing in the living room.



After about 30 minutes we wondered if they were done yet.  So I crept down the hallway with Beth right behind me.  What I saw I will never forget.  8 girls were sitting around "Cindy", who had been lying on the floor.  None were touching her, and they looked scared to death.  "Cindy", didn't realize that they were no longer holding her up,  and she had a good 6" of daylight under her.  The lights were on, and I had an unobstructed view.  These were not trained illusionists, just girls who got more than they bargained for when they decided to seek the occult.



My first thought on seeing this was, "How DARE those evil spirits touch my friend?!" and she dropped like a sack of potatoes onto the floor.



They had played with the devil's toys and he came to the party, so to speak.  The rest of the night they asked us to tell them about God, and we did.



Any time you dabble in the occult you are opening a door that Jesus does not wish you to open.  You are taking a risk with creating a foothold satan may exploit. Jesus is  way more interesting and exciting than any party game!



Try praying for someone in a group and watch Him heal them!  Now THAT"s cool!

It's a phenomenon that has been recorded throughout history and is a type of sleep paralysis (also called a visit frim the "night hag").



What happens is that your brain wakes up but your body doesn't and for a minute or so, while you are still paralysed by sleep you are convinced you can't move.  Throw in your active imagination and you believe that there is someone holding you down.  Some people even see someone.

Yeah, I think that there was one on the old tonight Show with Johnny Carson. I saw this many years ago. I will find something about it...



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search



A cabbit is supposedly a cat-rabbit hybrid creature, the existence of which is an urban myth.[1] Manx cats and other cats with tailless or bobtailed mutations incorrectly account for many cabbit sightings.



Cabbit is also a term that has been applied to half cat, half rabbit creatures in anime. It is derived from the words "cat" and "rabbit," a mixture used by fans to describe Ryo-Ohki in the series Tenchi Muyo (although the term is never used within the series).



The exact year of coinage of the term "cabbit" is uncertain, but the term was used in 1977 to describe a specimen found in New Mexico, featured on the Johnny Carson show and exhibited in Los Angeles.[2]

[edit] 1977 Talk Show Appearances



In 1977, Val Chapman found a curiously formed cat in New Mexico. This was the alleged cabbit that appeared on the Johnny Carson show in 1977/78. A similar white "cabbit" was shown on a Discovery channel pet programme in 2008, and though the term cabbit was used, it was revealed to be a young white Manx.

No, they aren't real.  A cat and a rabbit are too far removed from each other genetically to be able to form a viable embryo.



Only animals that are very closely related can form hybrids.  For example,  dogs and foxes cannot crossbreed; they are too distant from each other and a viable embryo doesn't form and survive.  But two different species of foxes, the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) can crossbreed and form sterile hybrids.  This is done in captivity frequently.  Some of the cats can crossbreed and the offspring have some degree of fertility.  The Bengal cat is a cross between a domestic cat and the Asian leopard cat (Felis bengalensis).  The females from this cross are fertile, but the males are not.  When the females are mated back to domestic cat males,  female kittens are fertile and sometimes the males.  By the 3rd generation cross back to domestic cats the males are fertile.  And the genus Canus shows incomplete speciation. Dogs, wolves, coyotes, and jackals can all interbreed and produce fertile offspring.



Bottom line, it's the degree of genetic relatedness that determines whether two animals can produce a hybrid and whether the hybrid will be fertile.



If you want to see another interesting man made hybrid, look up "jackalope".

Why not state one where a deity or guardian spirit of the ocean had a love he could not be with because she could not swim. Try all they could they simply could not be together because he lived in the water and she would drown. Once day she drowned herself so her spirit could be with him in the deep blue sea and so this could not happen again, the spirit had blessed all future generations with the ability to float.
Just for arguments sake humans do float on water but no species of ape (chimp, orangutan or gorilla) does. One of the many mysteries of evolutionary theory that scientists still cannot explain.

Here's a true one, about me.  It's kinda long though.  I had this boyfriend that I wanted to leave, but he's the kind that doesn't like to be left.  Abusive, you know.  So one day I got a bus ticket to my parents house and went to my friend's house to spend the night before catching the bus at 6 a.m. the next day.  Well, somehow this boyfriend found out about my plan and came to my "friend's" house (note the quotation marks.)  She let him in, I don't know why, and he dragged me out of the house by my hair.  Then he made me get into a car with his family (his MOM included) and wouldn't let me leave all day.  He had other friends of his guarding me all day, and at like 8 p.m. he said I had to call my family and ask for $600.  This is where it gets good.  I called my grandparents, since they live in the area, and JUST MY LUCK my cousin answered.  My grandparents might not have understood that I was in trouble, because they're hard of hearing and their English isn't perfect.  Here's how the conversation with my cousin went:



Me: Hey, I kinda need some money, can you help me?



Cousin:  I don't have any.  My bank account is literally empty.



Me:  (breathing a sigh of relief)  Oh thank goodness, that's exactly how much I need!  Can you bring it to a motel that I'm at, on X street and Y Ave?



My "boyfriend" was listening, so he heard my end of the conversation.  He asked what happened, and I told him, "She said she only had like $600 in her account, so she didn't know if she could help me, but I told her that's how much I needed."  Since he had heard me say that, he believed me. Meanwhile, my cousin knew that I was in some trouble because who asks for money, and then says "That's exactly how much I need" when she told me she had none.



She arrived about 20 minutes later, and I walked over to the driver side, as if I were going to get the money from her.  Mr. Asshole stayed away, on the sidewalk, maybe because his tiny little conscience was trying to act up.  I just dove in the backseat and told her to punch it (meaning the gas).  30 minutes later he was arrested, and I got to smirk at him while I was testifying.  He got charged with assault, assault with a deadly weapon, battery, and kidnapping.



He's still in jail, and they'll notify me before he gets out.  I hope he's loving it in there.



I, meanwhile, don't put up with any type of bull from guys now, and if a guy raises his hand to me, I'll stab him.  Not that it's ever come up, but if it does, I will.  I'm in school, have an awesome husband who loves that I'll stand up for myself, even to him, and two great kids.



I realize that there are lots of details missing here, but when I typed out the whole incident with all the details for the DA's office, it was like 3 and half pages long.  So this is the short version.  Plus there's a lot of stuff I don't want to go back over, you know?

In terms of faires/pixies/sprites which were sometimes termed "Little People" occasionally, but mostly not. They used to steal children, cows, milk, valuables... trick people, etc. So, no.



In terms of people who are short, which is what "midget" tends to mean, then they are not actually frequently the subject of fairy tales and as trustworthy as other people.

Depends. I won't take any astral fairies-midgets word as Bible.
Depends on their classification. Plus what are they talking about.
They would be generally mild wish granting if you could trust them, and they trust you.
I think they can be interesting company, enthusiastic little folks, merry meets.
I think some people would find them more annoying, then frightful.
They can cheer up the place, lighten the mood.
But for secrets to the mysteries of Life, I contact God, or expect to talk with a Holy Angel.



*** I think fairy tale wise it would depend on their classification. Trolls, trolls under the bridge, presented as tricksters.
Fairies generally helpers. Fairy Godmother, big helper.

Little people are just as trustworthy as the rest of us.  Do not trust fairy tales.  In fact, in the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, Kings and Queens kept little people at court and often times they were trusted confidantes.  A person's size does not make them any more or less trustworthy than you or I.  Judge a person by his or her merit, not by the size of his or her body.

Huh???!!!!?????
You're kidding right?
OK, just in case, here's the correct answer:
"Little People" are no different from People.



People are People. You can base your own trust of people based on their actions: their integrity, compassion, honesty, character, or lack of.  That is the best way to judge a person's "trustworthiness", by their actions and their character.  NOT by their gender, color, race, size, sexuality, religion, or any other external factors.



Hope that helps (=

I think "little" people are just like anyone else. It's not about what you look like, it's who you are inside. I have met all kinds of people, and the old saying is true....NEVER judge a book by it's cover!!  So, weather big small thin or heavy, just use your best judgment!

If you have to ask then no you will not. To do anything great, you 1st need to have the will power to believe you will achieve it. Just go at it for all you've got and don't let nothing stop you.



As for the teacher don't worry about. Teachers always love students who do there best, Besides their always a chance to get a class change right?

I've got one, but it has more to do with a haunted doll I had when I was 8 years old. It was one of the baby dolls that closed their eyes when they're lying down.  I looked down at it, it was on a chair by my bed. It opened its eyes, and turned its head toward me. It might have been an optical illusion though, since I was tired. I got out of bed, took the doll into my sister's room, threw it into her closet, and never saw it again.

I was scared to death when he said that. we lived there for about 3 years and i always felt like someone was watching me even though i never seen anything myself. my son was always afraid to be alone anywhere in that house and when i would take a shower it would feel like eyes were watching me. then again it could have been that my son freaked me out but things he would say. all i know is that in my current home i don't feel like i did in that other house.

Being a UK resident I'd have to site the Freemasons. British history portrays them as something of an omnipotent force throughout the middle and upper classes, at the height of their powers in Victorian England. As a members-only "boys club" of the great and the good in society, their sphere of influence was known to spread throughout the police, judiciary and the higher professions. Their activities where protected by ritualistic initiations and punishments for transgressors against the secrets of the lodge, and although these rituals are nowadays merely symbolic, with the movement acting overtly as a benevolent charity-supporting brotherhood, who really knows?



Masonic influence is often sited in modern or historical fiction (e.g. the "From Hell" telling of the "Jack the Ripper" story featuring Johnny Depp, and a series of BBC's "Messiah", with Ken Stott).



Who knows to what extent their influence still pervades the UK's corridors of power, and exactly how much is promotion through the echelons of Britain's professions still dependent on allegiance to the brotherhood and the "special" hand-shake????

Bobby boobie come on now the Davinci code?  echeewawa the trash Hollywood puts out these days.  BTW I'm not going to see any future films by Ronny Howard and Tom Hanks.



I enjoy some historical fiction but the fact is..........the author of that book is marketing it not as fiction but fact.  Today the general public doesn't take the time to separate fact from fiction and persons like Dan Brown are dangerous as they spread slander as enjoyment under the protection of freedom of speech.



Word to the wise,  there are no monks in Opus Dei.



With close to a third of America calling itself Catholic today I'm one of those many getting tired of the evil priest role rolled out by the California studios.  How about an evil rabbi film for once.  You get the point right here don't you?  I remember a Larry King interview with Brando making the same observation.  Next day he had to retract it I've always wondered what pressure was applied to this tough outspoken guy.  Well good old Brando saw it like it was.  The stereotyping of Catholic priests is getting very old I think Hollywood needs and influx of originality.



Try the masons if you want a truly secret society and I'm wondering why there hasn't been at least one movie somewhere on them????

If it was that secret then nobody would know. The secret ones are the ones that stay secret! BUT.....if you had to pick one of the secret ones that are not THAT secret then it would have to be Majestic 12 (also known as Majic 12, Majestic Trust, MJ 12 or MJ XII).



They are thought to be the code name of a secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, supposedly formed in 1947 by an executive order of U.S. President Harry S. Truman.



The purpose was to investigate UFO activity in the aftermath of the Roswell incident, the purported crash of an alien spaceship near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947. This alleged committee is an important part of the UFO conspiracy theory of an ongoing government cover up of UFO information.



Why would I chose them? Because they have everything! Spies, UFOs, conspiracies, etc.

I find the very wording of your question most interesting.  To enthrall:  to hold spellbound or captivate; to enslave.  The most dangerous "secret" societies are those that surround you but don't make you afraid because you aren't aware of their significance..because they have enthralled you.  They show you one thing in order to hide another.  To ask which secret society is the most enthralling is not a question that can be answered because we will never know everything about the societies mentioned in the blogs or those that have not been.

As an english person enjoying a much needed snack after a few drinks, I'm sure other people have noticed the secret society that seems to revolve around Kebab shops! There have quite a few times, in different kebab shops that I've been standing waiting for my kebab to be ready and from 'out the back' there have been people leaving the shop in a way that makes you feel that your suddenly in The Godfather! With lots of kisses and handshakes... while you stand there reading the menu again and again feeling slightly awkward...



I'm sure this must have happened to other people. Not sure what the society could be called though.. the Kebab Mafia...?

I have heard of various secret sect and societies....
One of the worst in my view is a sect called 'The Ones' they seem to originate from the Asian continent and derive great pleasure from torturing people for no apparent reason....i will Not go in the gruesome details as for the TOS of yahoo...
the best i believe is a Japanese society called the 'Kensai' or 'sword saints' in english...they seem to have been created during the Hojo dynasty and have been an instrumental force in shaping japan as it is now...
Their priorities include keeping alive old traditions and protecting the descendants of various daimyo of the ancient Japanese culture...as some of these families control great wealth...it has even been rumoured that the CEO of Sony is one of these warriors...they do not fight with guns and weapons but in the traditional way of the Samurai... with the sharpened blade...

As per another response.. the Knights Templar have captured more than just our imagination.
Closer scrutiny will reveal, as per the direction of todays powers that still maintain control, the secret of not only our past but also that of our future.
How painful that the vast majority of earth inhabitants should scoff at the fortune that awaits for those of like heart and the misfortune for those who walk ever so blindly along their created path of self destruction.
To know their secrets, at even the most least threatening of levels, is more a revelation of the secrets that lie within, than most of us could possible fathom to understand, be willing to accept.. or dare I say possibly appreciate.

It's probably the masons. This is becasue all sorts of people belong to this society and they all come from different backgrounds and are involved in very different kinds of work.  I think you also get invited to join as opposed to trying to join yourself.



I would have once said the Mafia, but nowadays everybody knows who's in the Mafia even though nobody will ever admit it - at least here in Italy. Look forward to reading the answer Bobby!

There are 2 very influential societies in the world today who are probably both connected and have plans to set up a one-world government.



The freemasons and the Smithonian Institute.



These are the most secret societies of all time because there is so much being kept from the public. For the past few thousands of years, the freemasons which were derived from a group of people called the Assyrians living in Egypt, became what we know of them as the Knights Templar.



The Knights Templar have had one common goal along with the freemasons of today. When the Knights Templar raided Jerusalem, they removed and confiscated any evidence that would back up claims of the Old and New Testament bible. Nobody really knows the reason why, probably to do with religious beliefs, but there is a secret scroll in possesion of the freemasons in even in France today that shows real places where artifacts are kept.



The Smithonian Institute on the other hand, is active in hiding evidence that goes against modern day scientific theories on history and origins. Not all this evidence is successfully hidden, and I have managed to obtain pictures, images and facts that show this evidence in my book, "Discover The Truth: The Hidden Secrets Of The Ancient Scrolls". There are numerous accounts though of the Smithonian Institute removing evidence from museums and even firing the discoverers of these items. I find it rather conspicuous.



The truth is, nobody really knows the truth!



However, if your really Robert De NIro, then you could possibly comment on my book, I'm sure it will shock you.

dear Alex, if there existed spells for changing your identity, nobody would be human anymore.
Also, if a vampire has to feed at least once a day, and if this results in a new vampire every time (per the original legends) then the original vampire creates 365 offspring in just 1 year. The first one he creates then sires 364 more that year, and the second sires 363, and so on and so forth, do the math - almost a million vampires in the first year alone! Reproducing at an exponential rate, even with today's global population, they would totally convert every human on the planet in less than five year's time! (In 1 week's time alone that would be 35 vampires, and by the end of the 2nd week there would be 7 more for each of the 35, for a total of 245 plus another 34 for the new ones, or a grand total at the end of 14 days of 279 vampires!) This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.

Any magic practitioner can tell you that there is NO spell that turns a human into another creature, physically. So did your "spell" work? Maybe in your imagination. So the people around you should be very safe, except from the annoying insistence that you ARE a vampire.

Drink a pint of Jack Daniel's while walking around a graveyard three times counter clockwise. With the last sip walk straight to a new grave without looking at the words on the stone (if one has been placed there yet) and pour the sip onto the grave. Toss the bottle over your right shoulder and sleep until after sunrise where the bottle lands. You will have dispersed the vamperic desires away from you.

See what happens when you go messing around with things you don't understand? Once a spell is out, its out. There's no "go back" spells. Maybe you should think about that.

Someone's witch name is a name they go by as per their own choosing. Some believe that selecting your own name better defines you and many in the witching community prefer to have a magical name to set them apart and also to personify their magic and their dispositions. Dion Fortune was a co founder of The Hermetic Order Of The Golden Dawn, a magical community established in the 1800's. She was born Violet Firth. Her name was inspired by her family motto "Deo, non fortuna" (Latin for "God, not fate"). Another reason is that in the times of heightened persecution, practitioners did not want their names circulating in public in connection to witchcraft. Sometimes witches would take their full name and switch the lettering around to form a new name. Unice may be a witch name, I have no clue. You can never be a hundred percent sure that someone is a witch. I reccomend  you do not investigate though. A good witch will never be found out. Never judge a book by its cover :)

I'm not sure about books on black magic...really I don't believe in it. Magic is magic until you place intent, therefore any spell out there could be deemed black.



As for grimoires, a Grimoire is like a Book of Shadows. It's individual to the witch or practitioner. There is no one book containing everything under the sun and moon regarding magic.

yup mate you should be. you should be very very worried. i am not explaining this more because you cannot do anything about this even if you understood it.



i suggest you donate all your belongings and get back to that god that you believe in. pray very hard and hope that you get to heaven or whereever you want to get to depending on your religious belief



you should also talk to as many people as you can and please let them know this is happenening



you can donate your clothes to the salvation army, food to the redcross or the UN and to make things easier for you i have set up a facility for you to donate money. please donate to 432111228839##



if the world does not indeed end as predicted by the mayan calendar with the obama co-ordinates and the bible tying, then you could have your money back.



else the money is not useful to you and by donating you look after the welfare of a few of your underprevilaged brothers on earth (me and my pals).



Now you would ask why i am underprevilaged, simple bud, i dont have the sort of time you do to ask such questions here in yahoo answers, i need to work for a living.



hoping to see your money in the account as discussed

Well that answer is very simple. The mayan calender and obama have nothing in common. However, Mr Obama will do one critical mistake that all Americans should punch behind their ears because mark my words this one event will lead to americas doom and possibly also the world. Whatever other mistakes he does are irrelevant to this they might make the situation worse than it will become.



What is this election/was about. Most of the people in USA want to see an end to the war in Iraq and Afganistan because it was started based on a lie by George Bush and as war always is it is not a nice affair. Senator McCain has a great idea in that he would leave a peacekeeping force in iraq... which would allow the majority of soldiers to leave. It is essential to do this because of one major rule of war. "When you start it you finish it". Why do I say this. Look at the mentality of the terrorists that USA is fighting. Walking out of their territory will let them celebrate with joy knowing that Americans are weak fools and that they have won the war. What will come next is a global mobilization of terrorist forces and more attacks on USA. Who knows given time USA might become the second country to feel the destructive power of a Nuclear weapon. That is the rule. You give up and don't finish be prepared that the other person will feel invigorated and decide to now go on offence, because he as a breather to do so and believe me these people will.



What should the war have been like to prevent this and what did Bush do wrong. Well war is inhuman and cruel and before you do it you must be prepared to do the most horrible things. The bible says it clearly. If you do war kill their men, women, children, dogs, cats.... everything. Leave nothing of their society or so hear my warning their childrens, children, children will come back and cost you your empire.



So basically USA good luck for just shooting yourself in the foot.

curses only work through the power of suggestion. If you ignore it and forget about the arrow, then all will be ok. If you assume the arrow is something bad, then you will attribute every mishap to this!

I believe so. It doesn's sound good :/ I would reccomend putting some quartz in your house, maybe sage candles or putting some sage leaves on  your window sills to keep out negative energy.  You can also buy smudge sticks, a sitck of sage, and burn them throughout the house to cleanse it.

Hitler had it in WWII, I am not sure what happened to it after the war, but it is most likely either in a museum in Austria or the Vatican might have it, it shouldn't be too hard to find, just look it up; although I think it might have been stolen during the war, not sure.

the spear of destiny (otherwise known as the holy lance) wuz used to pierce jesus while he wuz being crucified on the cross and by the way i HIGHLY doubt that you can end all life with it unless the whole constantine movie thing came to life (you wish) even if that happened (which it wont) it would have to be an angel to do it not a mere mortal and as for the location of the spear its supposedly located at the treasure house of hofburg or is still in possesion by...someone else good luck getting it

Purple: indicates spiritual thoughts.

Indigo: The color of the seeker who has inborn psychic and intuitive abilities. It represents an astounding ability in the handling of practical matters.

Blue: Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive.

Green: restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in their Auras are natural healers.

Yellow: joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous and not attached to anything.

Orange: uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power. Ability and/or desire to control people.

Red: materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body. Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person.

Brown: unsettling, distracting, materialistic, negating spirituality.

Gray: dark thoughts, depressing thoughts, unclear intentions, presence of a dark side of personality.
How to see Auras

Now do you want to see the Aura? If yes take this exercise:

1. Situate the person in front of a very softly illuminated PLAIN WHITE background. A color background will change Aura colors, so you need additional knowledge about combining colors. Some combinations of background and Aura colors may cause misinterpretation problems.

2. Choose ONE SPOT to look at. The middle of the forehead is VERY GOOD. This is a location of so called Brow Chakra or the Third Eye.

3. Look at this spot for 30 to 60 seconds or longer.

4. Resist temptation to look around. You should see that the background nearby the person is brighter and has a DIFFERENT color than the background further away. This is your own perception of the Aura. The longer you concentrate, the better you will see it. Remember, concentration on one spot increases your sensitivity by accumulating the effect of the Aura vibration reaching your eyes.
How to see your own Aura

Stand about 1.5 m in front of a good size mirror. In the beginning it is best if the background behind you is plain white and there are no shadows. Illumination should be VERY soft and uniform not bright. Follow instructions above for seeing Auras.

PRACTICE for at least 10-15 minutes each day to increase your sensitivity and develop Auric sight. Remember that practice is required to develop Auric sight.

PS: Aura is very sensitive. That’s why sometimes it gets captured on normal cameras too.

Well some people may not beleive in it.  But think about this.  The static electricity a person generates is quite high in voltage, the actual current is very low. That is why it is pretty much harmless.  Electricity is light and with light there is always color. Even though a person may not see this static electricty coming off of people I do beleive it is possible for someone to be able to feel someones aura.  There has been many cases where people can feel colors with thier fingers and just know what color it is.  Now I will tell you HOW to read someones aura.  First it starts off with finding out how your body and senses react to certain colors by surrounding yourself with them and become familiar with them.  It takes practice and time.  That is how you will be able to sense other peoples auras.  Also through self hypnosis you can make yourself be able to better be in tune with how your body reacts to colors.

If you can find ANY book by a guy named Jack Schwartz, get it (buy it!)  I met this man years ago when I was dating a guy who was a ghost-writer, and this man, Jack Schwartz, read my aura and he was RIGHT ON with everything!  It blew me out of the water (he had not met me before or anything.) 
I can't do it and I beleive that it is a true gift.



Look up Jack Schwartz.  He has been mentioned in books by Robert Anton Wilson.  I bet he is still alive even tho he was old when I met him WAY back in the late 1980's!

You have to really focus.  It takes lots and lots of practice.  I suggest you practice on yourself everyday for about 15-20 minutes.  All you have to do is look at yourself in a mirror.  Your chest and up and just focus on it.  At first you might see white that is your energy/inner aura around your body then if you focus harder colors might start to form.  Just keep practicing and be patient.

Some of us will, but no more than in any other given year.  It's just that the Mayan calendar ends that year and so people see all kinds of dreadul and dire things. Our calendar ends too; once a year, and then guess what--it starts again!

Yes, everyone on Yahoo Answers has heard about it 50 times per day for the last year or so. It has just as much validation as all the previous "end of the world" predictions that have come about for the last 10,000 years or so. And for the record, none of the "end of the world" predictions of the last 10,000 years or so has come true, so why in the heck would you think this one will? Get real.

if it's gonna happen then its gonna happen. why stress over something you cant control. the way the world is, I wouldn't doubt it. I guess what I'm saying is you need to live your life while your life is still going. Be worried about you and yourself. If you have lived life good, happy and right, then you have no worries? Are you a good person, have you done things the right way? Don't stress over it. Just live and if it happens it happens. Seems like your afraid to die, but don't be. Don't think of it, just live your life to the fullest!

The origins of this paranoia is that, since the Mayan calendar will officially "end" on December 21, 2012, the world will end as well in a catastrophic cataclysm. However, most Mayan scholars consider this to be a misinterpretation.

I think that some pennies are lucky. I've heard that if you find a penny heads-up it's lucky but if you find a penny that's tails-up it's bad luck. I don't believe that because whenever I leave a tails-up penny alone I end up needing it later. So it goes either way for me.

Well, I was lucky I found it.  And if I pass it on to a charity collection box (what I usually do), then they are lucky to have got another contribution, and the end recipient probably needs it more than I do.  If I am willing to share, instead of keeping it all for myself, then I find  life has a way of returning the favour.  Win Win all round.



Lucky penny?



Of course.  Some people call them Angel Kisses.

I think the penny becomes lucky because you pass it on  -  whether you find it yourself or if you start the cycle by giving one of your own  -  or indeed if you buy one, but pass it on to someone who may need it more.



Hugging it to yourself suggests a little ...  greed  ...  wanting it all just for you  ...  unless you really are in dire straits

Oh, by the way, over here in Ireland the rhyme goes "see a pin and pick it up...."



I'm not at all sure about the luck element there, except that perhaps you were lucky to find it.

Thats right Ptlomee! Mythical! As in myth. You draw upon a character in the Bible. Does that mean you don't believe in the rightings of the Bible? Missing books or otherwise? Comics can be looked at as modern day myths! They are stories of characters that do not exist. Or are no longer believed to exist.

Mine is Lilith (Adam's first wife from the Garden of Eden).

She was a feminist through and through, willing to accept persecution from her creator and being cast out from all she knew and held to be true to be able to live by a strict belief that she was equal to Adam.



(I'm not necessarily claiming that she implied that men and women were equal, just that her and Adam were, since they were both made of clay and soot by G-ds hands. I don't want to over generalize a verse of the bible because that was how the Sodom and Gomorra rumor came about, that homosexuals were the cause of its destruction, not the truth of their inhospitality. Though, come to think of it, she may be a feminist icon because of a deeper meaning to the verse, "come from the same place = equality". Therefore man and woman are born from woman, so possibly she stands for equality in a general sort of way, that male and female are equal because they come from the same place.

I think it really depends on where the person is from and if they believe in superstitions.



Unlucky 13
The number thirteen has been regarded as an unlucky number as early as 1760 BC. Fear of the number 13 is termed triskaidekaphobia. The thirteenth of a month is likewise ominous, particularly when it falls on a Friday in some English-speaking cultures, Sweden, Russia, Poland, Belgium and Germany (see Friday the 13th) or a Tuesday in the Greek and Spanish-speaking world. Thirteen may be considered a "bad" or "unlucky" number simply because when a group of 13 objects or people is divided into two, three, four or six equal groups, there is always one leftover, or "unlucky", object or person. According to another interpretation, the number 13 is unlucky because it is the number of full moons in a contemporary year, but two full moons in a single calendar month (mistakenly referred to as a blue moon in a magazine article of the 1940s) only happens about every 5 years.

Early nursery rhymes stated there were thirteen months in a year because of the natural moon cycle that was used to count the lunar year. In England, a calendar of thirteen months of 28 days each, plus one extra day, known as "a year and a day" was still in use up to Tudor times.

It was suggested by Charles A. Platt writing in 1925 that the reason 13 is considered unlucky is that a person can count from 1–12 with their 8 fingers, two thumbs and 2 feet, but not beyond that, so the number 13 is unknown, hence frightening, hence unlucky.[1] This idea discounts the use of toes or other body parts in counting.

Another hypothesis about the origin of Friday the 13th as an unlucky day is attributed to this being the day that the Knights Templar were slaughtered in a collaboration between King Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V finishing with the burning at the stake of Jacques De Molay.

The legion with which Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon was the Legio XIII Gemina or the 13th legion.

13 is the 6th prime number. 6 is sometimes considered an unlucky number due to its association with 666.

Lucky 13
In Sikhism, the number 13 is considered a special number since 13 is tera in Punjabi, which also means "yours" (as in, "I am yours, O Lord"). The legend goes that when Guru Nanak Dev was taking stock of items as part of his employment with a village merchant, he counted from 1 to 13 (in Punjabi) as one does normally; and thereafter he would just repeat "tera", since all items were God's creation. The merchant confronted Guru Nanak about this, but found everything to be in order after the inventory was checked. April 13 also usually turns out to be Vaisakhi every year, which is the Sikh New Year and the major Sikh Holiday.

Several successful athletes have worn the number 13. Alex Rodriguez is said to be one of the most talented baseball players ever; he has also signed the biggest sports contract and wears the number 13. Dan Marino, an American football player known for passing the 2nd most yards in NFL history, wore the number 13, although pundits in the sport have often cited him as the greatest quarterback never to win an NFL championship. Basketball great Wilt Chamberlain wore the number 13 on his jersey throughout his NBA career. Also, FIBA rules require a player to wear the number in international competitions (only numbers from 4 to 15 could be worn, and as there are 12 players, one must wear 13); Chris Mullin, who wore #20 in college and #17 in the NBA, wore #13 for both (1984 and 1992) of his Olympic appearances. Shaquille O'Neal wore #13 in 1996, Tim Duncan wore #13 in 2004, Steve Nash is currently wearing it for the Phoenix Suns, Yao Ming is currently wearing it in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, and also Mats Sundin, wears 13 in the NHL. One of Iceland's all time best handball players, Sigurður Sveinsson, wore the number 13 when he played for the national team.

In Italy, 13 is also considered to be a lucky number.

Colgate University also considers 13 to be a lucky number. They were founded in 1817 by 13 men with 13 dollars, 13 prayers, and 13 articles. (To this day, members of the Colgate community consider the number 13 a good omen.) In fact, the campus address is 13 Oak Drive in Hamilton, NY and the all men a capella group is called the Colgate 13.

In tattoo culture, where symbols often represent the opposite of their most obvious meaning, 13 sometimes symbolizes good luck, especially in "old school" style tattoos.

I always thought my great-grandfather was kidding when he used to say number 13 was lucky. Apparently he was serious as the Italian concept of lucky and unlucky numbers is different from other parts of the world. Some older Italian Americans still hold the belief of lucky 13, especially when gambling, but it seems that in Italy the number 13 has started to have unlucky properties as well. The number 17 is considered unlucky for at least two reasons, both having to do with how it is written. When 17 is written using Roman numerals XVII, it can be rearranged to spell the Roman word VIXI meaning "I have lived" and was found on ancient tombstones. When written using Arabic numerals 17 are still considered unlucky since it resembles a man hanging from a gallows.

A further reason 13 is considered lucky is Totocalcio has been for 50 years (now not any more) the most popular betting game (along with Lotto): based of Italian football, people who manage to guess all 13 results won the largest part of the jackpot (12 won as well but lot less). The jackpot was used to be very high till the end of the 90s, so "fare 13" was in fact synonym of being *very* lucky.

In the Bible, Chapter 13, the number 666 is the mark of the beast, or the devil.  In today's modern world, many believe that he will use computer chips or microchips or something like that to mark people, supposedly for their own good, but the Bible says that it will be to show who belongs to the beast and the who does not because without the mark, it is prophesied that no one will be able to sell or buy ANYTHING without it.  Some people back this up by using the following formula.  If you take the letter "A" and give it an evalutation of 6, the letter "B" and give it an evaluation of 12, the letter "C" the evaluation of "18" and so forth, then spell out the word "computer".  Add up the total of its numbers and they are 666.



Say what you will, but this was taught to me when I was 13 and I thought that it was way out there like the Twilight Zone.  But these days we are putting chips in animals, some hospitals want to put them in infants and patients to track them, and now there are some who want to put them into military personnel to know what happens to them in case they come up missing in a war.  All of these reasons "seem" to be a good thing for the individuals, but if they can "track" and "know the movements of" an individual, then it seems too close to the prophecy for me.

the number of the Beast is the one you are referring to, not the numbr of the antichrist. i find it highly amusing that a non-christian has to point this out. the older texts have this number down as 616, although there are one or two individual cases where the number is different. later, the number appears as 666, which has been interpreted in so many ways it's hard to keep track, although the most popular theory is that the number refers to Nero (but if that is the case, then christianity is beyond a fallacy {not that it isn't already})

My thoughts:  when this card is used to describe a person then this person is a loving and affectionate person.  Also, others are drawn to this "Sun" for many reasons such as this person gives others the feeling of acknowledgment, comfort, recognition. The glass is always half full even when half empty.  Yet, be careful because this "Sun" can also be childish and playful.

I hope you find what you are seeking.

The sun is the ultimate positive card it radiates happiness and joy to others. Some may find this energy captivating whilst some may be repelled by all this positive energy. It is a very content and secure person who knows themselves, but like the sun they can sometimes seem distant and become lost and obsessed in their own happiness and thoughts.

Hope this helps!

It would indicate a powerful or influential person, or one whose presence otherwise radiates about. Ever meet certain people who "fill up the room?" Those would definitely be Sun people. Think of maybe a Luciano Pavarotti type. Whether the card is upright or reversed would give some further indication about the state of their personality or social situation.

If the Sun card alone is on the ascendant this person would have masculine qualities. Physical appearance would be a bright and warm person and be very good looking. Often the center of attraction. All about him is him and him first and only him (or her). The best actor of the whole show, the most bright. He (or she) takes the lion share. He creates new ways of doing things and likes children, all the children.

The Sun is not a human archetype, it is a card that influences rather than describes. These influences are strong and paternal as well as radiant and charismatic. It also depicts new dawns, enlightenment and fertility. So the person it is describing will have access to all these talents. To a certain degree they will have the qualities of the Leo of the zodiac.
The negative side of this is too much Sun, So whilst you can basque in their glory and benefit from their generosity, remember the effects of to much exposure. Keep this in mind and take note of the other cards, though in general it is very positive.

Sinse Bible times Snakes have been associated with deceit and trickery, also temptation. In modern times a snake is said to mean a sexual desire or uncontrollable passion.

An ankle is meant to be the support and a possible sign of weakness.

Perhaps you are giving into your desires, or are falling to them?

ok, i'm not a child seeking attention i'm 25 and a mother of 3 and this is a genuine question.
my grandad died in april of this year and i was close to him, i lived with him and my nan since i was 9. my grandad had alot of health problems and sadley died at the age of 61.
not long after after his death i had a dream which frustrates me as i couldnt remeber all of it but he was sat where he always was in the living room looking so healthy and all i can make out was he kept saying everything will be ok.

then i had another dream where i saw him at a party with me and my twin boys.

Yes I do know what it means, your Grandad knew you were missing him so much and wondering if he was OK and if you would ever see him again.
This has happened to me so many times as I have lost a lot of members of my family, your Grandad wants you to know he is perfect now.
He no longer is suffering from any pain whatsoever and just wants you to know, and you will see him again, what you saw very few people see, you have been blessed.

I think you miss him and that is why you are having those dreams. When my cousin died I also dreamt about him as well. But be careful though Satan has a way of manipulating peoples dream in order to encourage them to contact the spirit world. The bible therefore warns us not to contact or communicate with the dead. This is because there are very bad demon spirits who love to deceive people into thinking that a relative who have died previously is communicating with them. In fact demons have the ability to change into the appearance of a dead person in order to trick people into communicating with them. So be very careful.

When a soul passes over, it normally takes some time to find a way to at least observe their loved ones. If a child is drawn towards make believe friends and fantasy, they're simply using their abilities to actually create their own little world. They can be prime candidates for sighting the spirits of a close relative. When that option isn't available to a spirit, it finds a way of meeting a person halfway when we dream. Sylvia Browne contends that, on average, 2 out of every 7 sleep periods are spent out of body. They have easy access to the astral realm, as do we when we astral project. 
It's clear that your bond has remained very strong. You might want to spend a bit of time exploring the events in your life at those times and see if there is some connection. That he's keeping an eye on you and the boys is obvious. So did you encounter any situations where you might have felt threatened in some way? I ask that because perhaps he's appeared in your dreams already knowing what's going on. Additionally, you might want to look and see if those dates have some significance associated with your grandad or family or even the lunar cycles. They may not hold an answer but are aspects worth considering.

When you start practicing Wicca. Just because you do research doesn't mean you are a witch. You must live your life by the three fold law among other things mentioned in the Rede. Pagan is a term for any non-judeo/christian religion and Wicca is a philosophy. Technically, you can be a witch without practicing Wicca.



I would say once you can cast a circle, participate in the holidays, are committed, understand charaks and other forms of energy. If you know any other true Wiccan's they can do a ceremony for you as well.

You can say it right now if you believe it to be true.  I am always surprised by how reluctant people are to say that they are Pagans or, say, a white witch.
Paganism is the belief in NATURE, and the belief that there is nothing more powerful than nature.  I am a true pagan.  My religion is Tibetan or Vajrayana Buddhism (if ever there was a religion that was pagan this one is it) and I practice it daily, with chants and prayers...some that I have learned from the center that I go to in San Francisco (where my Tibetan lama or guru resides when he is not out teaching the dharma all over the world) and some that I have made up specifically for self-improvement (daily affirmations) and for the healing of our planet.  Pagans in the past have had a bad rap from the "Christians" in the world who have just about destroyed this earth, fighting each other and almost taking all of nature down as a consequence of that horrible violence!  I bet Al Gore is a Pagan in his heart.
Be proud of yourself and boldly say you are of Wiccan blood!  You are  spirit, soul and flesh that wants to name Wicca as her religion...so do it!  I am happy to know you are a fellow pagan. There are plenty of born again pagans right here where I live in beautiful N. California!!

At the moment, you are searching for an identity.....a label to stamp yourself with.



You have made the decision to label yourself with the label "Wiccan" because that's what you want to be. No doubt there will be lot's of othe labels you latch on to over the next 20 years.



When you give up, you may start asking who you really are.

The Story of the Stone Cutter.
--------------------------------------...

There was a stone cutter who carved large stones all day in the hot sun. Tap tap tap with his chisel and hammer all day. One day he saw a prince being carried by servants pass by. He wished to be the prince because the prince was more powerful than he....and his life would be better.

He became the prince and thought, 
"Now nothing is more powerful than me."

For some time he was happy but he started to notice the sun was very hot. He realised he could not control the sun and that the sun must be more powerful than him. So he wished to be the sun. And like magic he became the sun.

Every morning he would beam down and make people hot and sweaty or hide and make them cold. So he thought "Now nothing is more powerful than me, not even princes!" He was very happy being the sun untill one day a cloud passed in front of him. No matter how hot he became, the cloud would not move.

So he wished to be the cloud which he felt was even more powerful than the sun. He became the cloud and sat there in the sky. He made the world dark, rained on those people out in the fields and made lots of thunder and lightening. He laughed at how much power he had. He really thought that now he was the most powerful thing in existance. Then he felt himself moving away from the sun. He was being pushed and could barely believe it.

It was the wind. The wind was able to move him no matter how much he rained or made thunder. So he wished to be the wind and like magic, he became the wind. He felt a new lease of life and celebrated by blowing all over the land. He blew the clouds away and made storms at sea. He blew roofs off and blew haystacks down. He rushed across the land spinning and blowing thinking he was really so powerful. Then as he blew accross a field he blew in to something so heavy and hard that it did not move. He could barely believe it. Something was more powerful than the wind. When he looked, he saw it was very large stone - twice as tall as a man.

He wished to become the large stone which was even more powerful than the wind. He became the stone and sat there while the wind and rain tried to move him. He was satisfied and smiled thinking, "Now I'm more powerful than all those things I was. I am the most powerful thing in existence!"

Then he heard a sound. Tap tap tap and realised something was chipping away at him. As he looked, he saw a small man with a hammer and chisel chipping away at him....a stone cutter! Then he smiled.......and he wished to be the stone cutter once more.

--------------------------------------...

If you have only just started researching Wicca, how would you know that there will be a time when you would say "I am a Wiccan."

Spend some time observing your own heart so you can really say what you are.

Don Juan (the Mexican holy man) was due to go to town and wanted to give his apprentice a lesson. He told him that he would be going to town and that while he was gone, the apprentice should find his place in the house.

The Apprentice looked confused. Don Juan explained that in every room or building each person has a place where they belong. So he said "Find your place in my home by the time I get back tonight after sunset."

He went to town and the apprentice started looking around the house and the land around it. He sat in the kitchen and under the tree.He climbed on the roof and sat in the bath. He stood on his head in the kitchen....but none of these were "his" place. He was sure he'd tried everywhere and looked around for anywhere else. He was feeling very frustrated because he would fail the task when Don Juan returns.



The apprentice looked around some more and got angry. He shouted and went red in the face. He gave up. He went and sat down on the wooden porch which wrapped around the old house. After sunset he heard footsteps around the corner on the porch by the front door. The footsteps got closer and then Don Juan walked roundaround the corner.

"You found your place?"asked Don Juan.

The apprentice shook his head, looking unhappy.

"I didn't know what to look for. I looked everywhere.....all day. then I got angry and gave up." said the apprentice.

"Then what did you do?" asked Don Juan.

"I came out and sat here to wait for you to come home"

"Why sit there?"

"I don't know, I didn't think about it. I just came out, walked round the corner and sat down here. I thought you would be angry because I couldn't find such a simple thing." said the appretice

"You have found it. You're sitting in you're place. That is where you belong."



Source(s):



The stone cutter story is a slight variation of a taoist tale which is best told in a book called "The Tao of Pooh"

The Don Juan story is roughly from The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castenedas.

OK - Am going to get myself a whole heap of thumbs down here, but I honestly don't care.
You cannot be Wiccan unless you have undergone initiation into a Gardenerian or an Alexandrian coven.
Wicca was created in the 1950's by Gerald B Gardener, and it was created as an initiatory, mystery tradition.
The VAST majority of responsible covens will not even consider you for membership unless you are over 18 years of age.
You have to undergo a great deal of study and hard work as a coven  neophyte (usually a year) before you are ready for initiation to first degree.
To call yourself Wiccan without undergoing this is an insult to all the people who have.
You can be a solitary witch that follows wiccan teachings, but unless initiated, you can never be Wiccan.

<answer>



As a Wiccan for over 20 years I strongly disagree with two of the posts here, one claiming you must be initiated (as Doreen Valiente, the creator of most of the current Gardnerian and Alexandrian Liturgy said otherwise, and Gardner, who created Wicca, said that his group was one of many evolving separately...therefore, the rules of other groups differ...obviously.)
Even if one disagrees with Valiente and Gardner as to the requirement for all "Wiccans" to be initiated and instead one claims all must, the simple fact remains that even in traditional groups, before initiation it is acceptable for a member of the outer court to label himself a Wiccan. The title Wiccan has no meaning in Traditional Wicca, which uses the phrases of the Wica and Witch, but not Wiccan. Indeed, up until the 1990s, many of those of the Wica considered those who used the term Wiccan, pronounced Wick-en, to be poseurs and outsiders by default. After over 30 years of opposing the term, they do not get to dictate who uses it now!



I'm also going to strongly disagree with the recommendation of the book Faery Wicca, for reasons that are outlined here: http://www.cyberwitch.com/wychwood/Libra...
No book should ever be published that tells lies. Seriously. Not intentionally.Likewise, no book should ever be published which plagiarizes. Try this website to learn about that: http://www.geocities.com/ferigold/truthf...

As for when you can call yourself a Wiccan, in general, I recommend not using the term until you've accomplished three things: 
1. Researched at least two traditions, one to the second level (there are a couple of traditions which actually have books that go to that level...whether I approve of those groups or not, the fact remains that you can get an understanding of how Wicca works in general from such books.)
2. Learned at least the basics of Wiccan ethics and embraced them. Sadly, many Wiccans don't get this far. I recommend the following two links as ESSENTIAL to understanding Wiccan ethics:
http://www.paganlibrary.com/ethics/wicca...
http://www.cuew.org/thefivepoints.html
(both of these can be found elsewhere, as well.)
3. Developed a relationship with and or understanding of the gods and investigated the agrarian calendar that the Wheel-of-the-year  is based upon. If the temperate wheel doesn't work where you are (you don't have four seasons, for example, or you're in the Southern Hemisphere) you need to work out what the wheel means where you are.

In general, these things are deal-breakers in Wicca. You can't ever call yourself Wiccan if you think the gods or seasons are unimportant, don't know the ethics and have no idea how it works.

That being said, as some posts here always show, just claiming the word Wiccan means nothing....some claim to be Wiccan and disregard the gods or the ethics. They may be Wiccan, but they probably suck at it.



My advice to you won't make you Wiccan, but it might make you a Wiccan who does not suck.

Edit: Chakras aren't Wiccan, and Wicca's a religion, not a philosophy.

There is no easy answer to this one.  When you are ready then you will know it and then you will find it natural to declare your spirituality and beliefs.



Some do this straight away, others study and do their self dedication and then announce it to those in their lives that matter.  I personally waited until I had done my dedication even though my friends and family had already figured it out for themselves.

Some wait until they practice the craft and cast circles, celebrate the sabbats, others don't.



You see, it's all a matter of when the time is right then you will know.

"Pagan" is such a nebulous term you can pretty much call yourself that whenever you want.  However, never expect listeners to have a good idea of what you believe when you just say "pagan," which technically means nothing more than you are a Christian, Jew, or Muslim.

There is a difference between studying a religion and following it, and that's something that a lot of people interested in Wicca confuse.  You can't know whether Wicca (or any other religion) is for you until you know something about it.  So you need to give some serious study to Wicca to understand what it teaches, what to expect out of it, what is expected of you, and so forth.  You also need to come to grips with whether you actually believe it, or whether ir just sounds kind of nice.  Because Wicca is a religion, and religion is about sincere belief, and it takes time to form that.

I personally recommend studying for at least a year and a day before making the decision to embrace Wicca as your faith.  And when you're ready for that commitment, most non-initiatory Wiccans perform a dedication ritual declaring their loyaly and intents to their gods.  And if you're not ready to make that declaration, that's a great sign that you're not yet ready.

Merry Meet SnowCanWait,

I will try to make this short. Many Eclectic Wiccans, Witches and Pagans will disagree with me but seriously in order to be considered a Wiccan by most Traditions around you will need to at least Self-Dedicate yourself to the Craft. This usually starts with a walk of one year and one day of study of Wicca. You see a Dedication marks your walk in the Craft and it is a place from where you can begin as a new creature in the universe. Once you Self-Dedicate most Traditions in Wicca will accept your claim to be Wiccan without proof of your dedication. You can find information on Dedictions from http://witchvox.com/.



Please be advised though that if you claim to be Wiccan but cannot form a sacred circle for ritual or even perform a basic Esbat ritual, you will loose credibility as a Wiccan in the community. There is a lot more to Wicca then just the name. I hope this Blurp helps some.

Always in Light and Love

When you feel as though you are one.

If you've only just begun your research, then you won't be able to truly understand when its time. You need to be one with nature and the god and goddess.

If you want to be a coven witch, then you will need to be accepted. But really, I judge religion not by some title, but by what the persons knows and feels :)

Depends.. you want happily ever after, or drama.

Happy would put the girl with the guy she loves after being saved from some deadly peril.



Drama would have the girl dying.

Im a romantic so i would go with the having to marry the prince to save the thiefs life.. prince regrets making her unhappy and gives her to the thief..



or prince could fall in love with another girl.. or funnier yet.. another man..



hope that helps. I get writers block too.

Before you write a story, you should really come up with a plot. It should be YOUR plot, not ours and not the thinly disguised plot of The Little Mermaid. YOU can think of the story, and YOU can think of the names. That's what writers do. If WE do it, it's just like doing your homework for you, it's not YOURS. Take your time and work these things out on your own.

There is a rather large one in Kent.  I"m not sure, but I think it is Hever Castle.  I think it was turned into a hotel.  Hever is where Anne Boleyn spent her time before marrying Henry, and where Henry exiled Ann of Cleves.  Look up the television show "Most Haunted"  they have investigated all over the south east.  There was even an entire village that is supposed to be the most haunted place in britain.

I doubt that there will be any empty haunted houses that the owners are going to let you spend the night in, un-supervised and alone, (for obvious reasons) so your best bet would be a Haunted hotel.

Just to add some more possible options for you - this page lists several reportedly haunted places in England (and throughout the UK) that may be of interest to you.

http://www.theshadowlands.net/places/uk....

I would check out any haunted inns and hotels to start - places where the public is allowed and can stay overnight.  "Haunted houses" are usually private property and guests are not allowed to stay overnight without permission - unless you are a working paranormal investigation team, you probably won't get permission to stay at a haunted house overnight "just for fun".

there's supposed to be a polarshift in 2012 where the north pole becomes the south pole and vice versa. supposedly the last time that happened the ice age started. predictions of it go back to the mayans and nastradamus. theres even something about it in the bible. the polar shift is going to happen but no one knows for sure what the effects will be. check out these websites i put and aslo google the word polar shift for more info.

Wow! I don't know where the other answers came from but "Damn".

2012 is about he end of the Mayan calendar.
There is much debate as to whether there is any significance at all to the date. Scholars and theologians have predicted that it means every thing from the end of the world (by thousands of different means) to the idea that the guys making the calendars just got sick of making calendars.



So, there you go. 2012 is about the end of the Mayan calendar or the world. I'm banking on the former.

Thanks

Since the question is in the myth section I guess you mean the end of the Mayan calender.

Considering these people could not fore see their over cultivation of their land (therefore leading to the collapse of their civilisation) I know there will be nothing special just because their calender ends...

Atlas was a Titan and as a punishment for going against the God of all Gods Zeus, was made to hold up the Universe (Stars and planets) for ever.
Atlas holding up the Earth was a fanciful illustration in an atlas by Mercator. Totally wrong but the image has stuck.

As has been said, Atlas (who was a giant, not a god) held up the sky. Also, the ancient Greeks had already proved the world was round (I think it may have been Aristotle or Euclid).

Simply put, in the original story Atlas did not hold up the Earth - he held up the sky.  That 'globe' in classical statues is a sphere representing the heavens.

Incidentally, some Greeks knew, or at least suspected, that the Earth was round; Eratosthenes estimated its circumference with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

The ancient Greeks knew the world was round.  There were three ways to tell.  (1) A ship sailing over the horizon would dissapear bottom first.  (2) you could see the shadow of the earth on the moon in a lunar eclipse and (3) You could put a stick in the ground and follow the shadow and it moved in a circular path.  This was called a 'gnomon'.  One Greek (I forget who) was able to measure the circumference of the Earth by studying gnomons in two different places simultaneously, and he was closer than anyone was for the next 2000 years.

The ancient Greek model of the universe was picked up by Christians and they believed it into the 1500s.  The earth was in the center, surrounded by concentric spheres like the leaves of an onion. The moon and sun had their own spheres and moved in orbits around the earth.  The planets (five of them in those days) each moved in their own spheres, and the furthest one out was all the stars.  By the time Gallileo turned a telescope on the heavens and realized the earth revolved around the sun, the earth-centered universe had become church doctrine.  But that started with the ancient Greeks.

Greeks didn't really believe the earth was held up on the shoulders of a huge man. Atlas was a mythical figure, he was allegorical.

I am alone in my house all night and really want to scare myself senseless. I love watching videos of real ghosts, aliens, e.t.c. or reading stories of legends/ghost stories, looking at photos e.t.c. Even in films like the ring video that is creepy as ****. But I've worn all the resources out and can't find anything which scares me now. I've seen most of the ghost videos online and so on but I really want to be freaked out. So this is my request from you guys. Send me the scariest thing you can online whether it be videos, photos, stories e.t.c. Can you show me something I've never seen and scare me enough to keep me up all night?

i felt like i wa paralysed, and like something was sucking the life out of me. i took it as some sort of a phobia, or maybe becuz of the constant anxiety that i had.i've moved now, and my life's a bit more stable than before, too. so, this has kinda stopped happening to me.
 well, i couldn't figure anything out, so maybe you should talk to a doctor, or perhaps a religious personnel. good luck!

Sleep paralysis is a common condition characterized by transient partial or total paralysis of skeletal muscles and areflexia that occurs upon awakening from sleep or less often while falling asleep. Stimuli such as touch or sound may terminate the episode, which usually has a duration of seconds to minutes. This condition may occur in normal subjects or be associated with narcolepsy, cataplexy, and hypnagogic hallucinations. The pathophysiology of this condition is closely related to the normal hypotonia that occur during REM sleep[1]. When considered to be a disease, isolated sleep paralysis is classified as MeSH D020188.[2]

Physiologically, it is closely related to the paralysis that occurs as a natural part of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, which is known as REM atonia. Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain awakes from a REM state, but the bodily paralysis persists. This leaves the person fully conscious, but unable to move. In addition, the state may be accompanied by terrifying hallucinations (hypnopompic or hypnagogic) and an acute sense of danger [3]. Sleep paralysis is particularly frightening to the individual due to the vividness of such hallucinations[4]. The hallucinatory element to sleep paralysis makes it even more likely that someone will interpret the experience as a dream, since completely fanciful, or dream-like, objects may appear in the room alongside one's normal vision. Some scientists have proposed this condition as an explanation for alien abductions and ghostly encounters.[5] A study by Susan Blackmore and Marcus Cox of the University of the West of England suggested that alien abductions are related to sleep paralysis rather than to temporal lobe lability.[6]

The paralysis can last from several seconds to several minutes "after which the individual may experience panic symptoms and the realization that the distorted perceptions were false" [7]. When there is an absence of narcolepsy, sleep paralysis is referred to as isolated sleep paralysis (ISP) [8]. "ISP appears to be far more common and recurrent among African Americans than among White Americans or Nigerian Blacks" [9], and is often referred to within African American communities as "the witch riding your back

yes this happens to me sometimes although im not really sure what it is (i just try to..."ignore" it when it happens and try to fall asleep) im guessing that it only happened to you and your kids at that house cuz some supernatural force was messing around with all of you (probably trying to possess you...not trying to scare you on this) or you have some weird disability or physical sickness but by now you would have already known if something wuz wrong with you and you said that you were awake so theres no way you were dreaming about it idk if this would work but if you wanted to find out exactly what wuz going on with you at that house, go back with a scientist or a psychic (or both) and sleep at the house for a day while they monitor you this is just a suggestion though

There is a perfectly logical explanation for what happened to you, and it's appropriately named sleep paralysis. It's a condition that most people experience at least once in their lifetime, and it's when you wake up from sleep but you aren't completely conscious. It's hard to explain, but basically, you know you're not dreaming, yet all around you, the scenery of your room may be distorted or scary. (This is the explanation for people being haunted by demons in their sleep, or being abducted by aliens.)

Look it up on wikipedia, I'm sure it summarizes it better than I do.

Bottom line, you can choose to believe that what happened to you is a completely paranormal experience, or a completely NORMAL experience.

How old is this house? How many years to be more specific?



Have you had any other experiences?
 The souls-from other dreams are contacting your own body and your kids. It's trying to tell you something. Have you ever heard of the Winchester house in California? It has 160 rooms. She used to live in an old small house and it happened to her. The spirits told her to move to a new house so she did. It has 160 rooms. And the spirits told her to keep on building. She got annoyed of the spirits (the spirits were killed by her husbands gun store. So people that bought the guns and shot at people and the spirits got angry. There was an Earthquake later on and she died by getting trapped in the house.



It's a good thing you moved to a new house. Are your kids safe now? Maybe it was because spirits visit old houses and like to haunt it because it's like them-creepy/ghosts. And they kept freezing you to tell you to move to a new house.

As interesting as it sounds to attribute something mystical to your experience, it's actually just sleep paralysis. (Someone has given you a long, in-depth answer on this.)

So, not to worry.

What the hell happened? what did i see?



I used to work in a club that had the toilets upstairs. One night after work I went up to use the loo and saw my manager go around the corner at the top of the stairs and into his office. I heard the keys jangling and saw him plainly. When I reached the top I noticed the office door was ajar. I was going to pop my head around and say hi, but thought Id catch up with him later, so went to the loo. On my way out the door was still open and the light on. It was his night off so I assumed he had popped in for something. When I mentioned it to the assistant manager he looked shocked and run upstairs. The door was locked and light off. I called manager and he was happily watching tv at home and had been all night!! What the hell happened?



</question>



<additional details>



er, no I didn't imagine it. i was wide awake at work and CLEARLY saw him. He had a pink shirt, black trousers on i even saw and heard his keys jangling and walked past the door, which was open. I shudder to hink what would have happened if I had gone in the room

you either saw a ghost, probably a previous employer who had keys, or a doppelganger. a doppelganger is where you see the ghost of someone alive. usually its harmless and means nothing, but on rarer times it has been a warning of something foreboding, like the death of your boss or someone connected to him. but dont worry too much, apparently my mum saw and heard me in the house when i wasnt even there, but that was three years ago.

ok so you didnt imagine it that helps...either its some random burglar or even another person that works there that looks almost exactly like your manager and somehow he got out without anyone seeing with the door closed and locked and lights off or who knows maybe it wuz your manager playing some weird trick on you...somehow doesnt make sense though if he did pull that off idk how he could, otherwise its a ghost maybe someone died on the property and is haunting the club for watever reason if thats the case you should bless the club but you have to be 100% sure its a real live ghost and not a person if its a burglar you need more security upstairs, you should also question everyone that wuz there that night (meaning the ones that work there) to see what they were up to but most likely its a ghost and if a blessing doesnt work you need to perform an exorcism on the place, and if that dont work then move the hell out of there before someone gets hurt hopefully it doesnt come to that good luck figuring this out :]

My father had an experience similar to yours (and I also had one as well) so I believe you. My dad saw his co-worker at the office clearly but to his shock he found out that his co-worker didn't even reached the office as yet. (My father is a very practical person). I agree with the previous person that it could have been an imprint where it is as if the same thing repeats itself over and over like a time loop. Imagine for instance there is a camera recording your boss movements and it keeps on repeating and playing itself over and over again. The only thing is it is as if it is a spiritual recording. (I hope you undertand what I mean) Trust me there are things going on in this world that we will never truly understand.

I would also encourage you to pray about it asking Jesus Christ to protect you and even explain to you what you saw. By praying I mean simply going somewhere privately and just talk to God (like you would a normal person) and ask him to watch over you and to explain to you exactly what you saw. Even if it is an imprint it doesn't hurt to ensure that you have God's protection in case of anything. Sometimes even evil spirits has the ability to take the form of a person who is alive.

It is also possible that your boss could have been astral projecting either knowlingly or unknowingly. This is where his spirit leaves his body and goes wherever he wants it or wills it to go. In occultic circles astral projecting is a common practised and even encouraged. But astral projecting is dangerous and I personally believe nobody should attempt to do that. This is because that leaves the person body vulnerable to evil spirits.

If you had gone into the room, well, it might have been interesting. :)  Either, you would have been in a locked room, in the dark, or you would have been face to face with your manager, whenever he was there (past or future).



First, if it had been a robber, you would know it.  So, either you imagined it or you saw a doppleganger.  Since we say we imagine so much, your answer leads me to think you got to see your boss' double.  Or, well, er, your boss was lying and came back to the office for something...or didn't remember doing it.



Dopples happen for some unknown reason.  One man was reported to have met his own double coming back from Paris, while on his way TO Paris.  Years later, the role was reversed when he realized that he was wearing the exact clothing he had on when he saw himself coming from Paris years before.  In other cases, people have seen doubles just before the death of the person, in some cases their own death.  In these cases, they are called "Crisis Apperitions."



There is a chance that your boss did something called Astral Projection, but I have never heard of anyone else seeing someone do that, at least like you describe. :)



As for cameras, well, they can work with, or against, you.  Distortions like this often cause an enclosure that can't be seen by anyone other than the person seeing it.  Other times, only the camera can see things that we miss.  This seems to be based on a current event that is happening, as opposed to an event that happened, or happens, in the past or future.



I would have like to have been in your position.  The only time I have gotten close to this was with a guy who was messing with another man's wife, sneaking around, and wasn't supposed to be in his office.  For that, I got shot and fired! :)

I don't think it is nothing bad, to me it was his astral body. People leave them all the time with out being aware of them. Your boss was chilling at home, but he is more than likely one of them bosses that does not leave work at work so to speak.
My friend saw me at her hospital bed, whilst I was at home sitting on my couch. Nothing bad has happened to her.
I do believe there is alot more going on than most wish to fully understand, just most want proof..........
you saw what you saw, you know that........ you must also been sensitive to others around you, how many other coincidences have occurred around you that you cant explain. Its nothing to worry about you don't have to get worried about bad spirits etc, any other questions feel free to ask.

To see a UFO in your dream, signifies your desires to find your spiritual purpose in life. Alternatively, it indicates that you are feeling alienated from those around you. The dream may also be a metaphor suggesting that you are a little "spacey" or  have "spaced out" attitude. You need to be more grounded and come back to reality.

The buildings nearby were starting to be destroyed by the saucers and it was as though the 'war' had only just begun - it was a real mixture of excitement at the strange craft and total root you to the spot fear as it dawns on you 'these guys ain't friendly.

Why are creepy stories commonly revolved around mirrors?



I've been reading some scary stories on creepypasta, and in quite a lot of them it says 'if you do this in front of a mirror at night' or 'something will be staring at you in your mirror at night'. Why do you think that people revolve creepy stories around mirrors? Surely they're perfectly fine to use at night...

People use mirrors in scary stories because mirrors are known to have another world in them a world that's completely opposite to ours so ghosts and all other supernatural life exists inside mirrors



if you ever write a scary story putting a mirror in it will really scare the readers, they will never look at them selves the same way again Lol

good question. Some cultures considered the mirror was a manifestation of the soul. mirrors and glass have also unwittingly caused natural holograms which freaked out the less informed. flaws in ancient mirrors cause `images` to be seen in them. I look forward to what others say on the subject.

Hello

She is bound to be the queen, can't see that it would be anything else.



She is someone who has lost in love, even widowed, she has suffered emotionally & cut away from her harsh past, very direct & sharp minded.



The page of swords is immature, usually nasty words, gossip.



They do not boad well for love, & would show tension in any situation.

The characters of the Sword cards are evocative of the element of Air. This aspect governs the mental energies. These traits are those of the quick witted and intellectually stimulated, their reactions are swift and decisive, they are ruled by their heads and can sometimes appear aloof.
The Queen is also driven by the maternal urges, but acts with a cool head, so is sometimes percieved as severe, though her intent is to benefit and nurture.
The Prince or son is the rawer male potential. Again acting with a cerebal motive and a silver tongue, he is driven by ambition and the desire to experience and develop.
The swords, in beneral also highlight challenges of an intellectual nature and problems which require mental agility. The key is to keep a clear and honest attitude however daunting it may seem.

They could. I can't give a definite answer but I have dreams that happen the next day. Its just something our minds can predict. Its kind of like the chances of winning the lotto. You have a dream or vision and there is a slim chance it happens. But, that doesn't mean P.K. powers aren't possible or mind reading.

the bible says the flood was caused because of the appearance of the nephilim

the nephilim are the product of reblellious angels and human women

these produced demi gods who were also gigantic mythical men such as hercules



their horrible behaviour caused god to wipe them out

some left, they had the knowledge of angels and so were able to build space ships and ufos to colonoise nearby anf far away planetsw

this is why people think there is life on mars, as mars is one of the places the reptiilian went to

in order to mate with human women the rebellious angels had to materalise into different bodies



some chose animals, this is where we get mythical creatures such as quetzocotyl the mythical god snake lizard of the aztecs, to who they saxcrficied human hearts and other humans

or cythuluu an opctopus headed creature with repitlian skin,
popularised by films such as call of the cythulu or deep rising

some not all the nephilim by product were nephilim

somne ended up as greys, some as reptuilians, some as octopus men,etc

the film ET is about a nephilim known as igigigi in fact there are many cave paintings that show their bug eyed appearnace

it's understood that the reptilian nephilim were the most aggreessive or powerful, and it's these ones that were able to force the other rwaces to use their sicientific talents to help them successful interbreed with humans after the flood

this would result in humans that look like humans but have partially reptilian DNA

these important humans were to establish themesleves as kings and queens other the years

it is said the emperor of japan, hirohito duirng the war was supposed to be a direct descendeent of the sun god,

if he had parital reptilian or DNA this would make sense

some genetic mutations resulted from the nephilim
*** many of them in the bible had 6 fingers and toes

members of the royal family have had six fingers such as Anee of Boyeln who was the secodn wife of henry the 8th

just becuase you have 6 fingers or evben are maybe have reptiulian DNA does not mean god is going to wipe you out

Jesus said if yo are born of women and born of the spirit (bapti9sed nithe name ofg the father son and holy spirit) then you may be accepted as his children

it is uinderstood, that all these nephyilimn return to earth to try to fight the messiah as he returns fooling the humans inot fighting a different type of alien threat which even they with all their space ships and lasers cant handle

they will also seprform experiments on animals, making them look all advanced

they will then say this is why we cant find missing links, as we used our technology to evolve everything, which is why they are no missing links



the catholics, atheists, and everyonew else who beleives in evolution wil lap this up and admire ythe nephilim

but their presence here indicates thast things are similar to the days of Noah, which jesus says is a sign of the end of the age

peace in Christ

Sort of. They are Freemasons which is a group of men who have secret signs and handshakes etc. There have a hall where they meet, and various items of regalia that they wear when they are being formal. They have dinner dances with chicken on the menu and support one another in business etc and do good works. They have their own school and a lot of policemen belong.

Mason is short for Freemason. It is not secret, they are totally legal and open.

Freemasonry is the oldest and largest world wide fraternity dedicated to the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of a Supreme Being. Although of a religious nature, Freemasonry is not a religion. It urges its members, however, to be faithful and devoted to their own religious beliefs.

A mason is a person who works with stone, brick, ceramics.

The Masons, are a group, not really secret since most groups have open membership and some have recruitment, which are based on christianity and/or judiasm.  in most cases, it's a boys club who get together and pal around.  in other cases it is a charity organization.

lately, there has been a lot of unbased claims that they're a secret, sometimes satanic, organization which holds secrets or great knowledge and is currently guiding the world's events.  Da Vinci Code, Illuminati, National Treasure, are just some examples.

nothing wrong with the name mason.

My guess is you are talking about the freemasons (which use the term mason interchangeably).

Freemasonry is a social fraternity that studies morality (as taught in the Bible) through symbol, ritual and allegory. Its main tenets are faith, hope and charity, and it provides more charity than any other group on the planet.

It is not a religion, not a cult, there is nothing evil and there is no satan worship in any form of freemasonry anywhere.

Many of the greatest men in history have been freemasons.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask me.

If you didnt already catch it, mason is short for Freemason. It is a society mostly consisting of aristocrats, very rich and famous people. George Washington was a Freemason. It is not secret. Its open and legal. The freemasonry started during biblical times. King Solomon was building his temple, when one of his workers was murdered for his ideas. The quote,"Who will help the widow's son?!" is a legendary quote used by masons when in need of help.

it a secret society that built up our nation. they had some of our greatest leaders (george washington and ben. franklin). the money we use has their symbols (the pyramid, the Eagle with the 13 arrows, 13 leaves on the olive branch, and 13 stars above its head) it is believed that they are striving to to make the perfect nation, perfect the us and build a great empire (by changing foreign governments to more friendlier ones toward the us) so basically they are the leaders behind the scene/curtain (kinda like how it is in metal gear solid) and manson is short for freemason

so to simplify:
they are a secret group
the number 131313 is of some importence
have high ranking leaders involved
they have their signs involved in our daily life
the pyramid on the dollar bill shows 2 thngs their goals aren't complete and the empire isn't finished
they are total patroits
they are amoung us
they hide everything and control everything

Not trying to be glib, but what do they mean to you? I cannot read the Tarot, but my "brother" can and is almost 99% accurate.  That one percent is when his emotions get involved, so he sees what he wants to see, not what could be.

From what he has told me, the cards are tools to help the reader see what might happen.  It is not "written in stone," and it isn't a total picture, just a glimpse.  So, the two swords could be the conflict and the sun in the future could be a good outlook, to me.  He could give you a meaning to the cards, what they show him, and what they might mean in the long run.



However, the conflict could be ongoing with you and yours, and the sun could mean you find love with another man.



I know it is none of my business, but the cards aren't what you need to worry with.  They are just pictures and cardboard.  They can be played with.  To ME, this is what you need to work on.  You love/loved this guy but had problems with expressing your feelings.  The cards don't need you to express your feelings, but other people do.  You know you love him, or loved him.  Now, did you fall out of love with him, or was it something else?  Did he have problems with your inability to express yourself?  Did you withdraw from him, but still love him?



I may be wrong, but I'm getting some pictures that might be related.  How could you not express yourself?  I know very few women who can't related to their emotions, but a lot of men.  If you feel something, just dive in and say it.  It may come out wrong, but you can always try to be clearer.  But, not saying anything sounds like you don't feel anything.  The worst is that he won't return those feelings.  It hurts, yes, but it is better to know and not be used than to not know and be used the way most people are.  If the expression was to be physical, were YOU ready for that?  Remember, a relationship is a two way street, it works both ways and you have to be comfortable with each other, trust each other, and care, otherwise, well, it isn't what it could be.  You're not a door mat or a door knob.



Look into yourself and see what is going on.  Everything starts from you, including the cards. :)

Good luck, and if you want, I can check into those cards.  Just don't depend on them too much, they can be wrong.

calm down! i think that the mermaid should run from her father, go on an adventure w the thief, find her mother which she thought was dead, it be illegal to marry the thief bc she is a mermaid and he is human although he thinks she is human, then when the thief discovers her secret he leaves her and then the prince tells her that he is dead. then at their wedding, the thief shows up and says hes sorry and stuff like that and she finds out he wasnt dead. then when she thinks her father will finally disapprove the prince and approve the thief, her father gets terribly sick and she has 2 go and find a potion 2 save his life. im sure u can make up the rest on ur own and i hope this helps = D



p.s. i also would like 2 b an author. how old are u?

The questions you ask are the most basic plot points of your story. No one can write them but you. Basic writing advice: plot out your whole story before you begin writing. You can't start until you know where you are going.

I think you should let her be with the theif. Make something magically happen and permamently turn her into a full human. then she could go live on land with the theif. Let her dad send some kind of earthquake or something. You sound creative and imaginative. what's your book called?

Funny thing you should ask that.

The number 23 crops up in my life repeatedly, usually in connection with something good, e.g. I graduated when I was 23, I was looking for somewhere to live once and found a place on the 23rd of the month, etc.

I'm sure it's nothing more than coincidence.

Personally I think that doing the Joker drove heath crazy. I was taught that a good actor will become the character when they are on film. According to Heaths friends he would still somtime be the joker off screen. I think that to play him as well as he did, he would have to become him and that would make him and insane homicidal maniac. That why he killed himself.

Also i think that in a movie with that many stunts, some people were bound to get hurt.

Nope

Heath Ledger was a drug addict (OK legal derugs, but he had at least three different kinds of opiates in his system) - nothing to do with the film - Or the same could be said of Mark Speight and Art Attack

Christian Bale had been held on a verbal assault - In an argument with his family, I doubt very much will come of that, everyone yells things sometimes!!!!

I think Orpheus would have sounded like everyone's ideal.
By that, I mean that in each person's ears, his voice would have sounded like their individual perception of the perfect voice. 
That being said, I think it is up to each person to imagine what their ideal of the human singing voice is and then attribute that to Orpheus.

It would be in one the ancient Greek modes, the melodic scales which on a piano you play on the white keys only starting from any key - play eight keys to go through the whole scale.

It would be a single melody - no chords - I like the answer about it sounding like the ideal voice to each person.

Here are some additional verses that may refer to UFOs:

II Kings 2:11-12
Isaiah 66:15
Ezekiel 1:16-20

I have read the Bible 3x and somtimes wonder about UFOs when it refers to angels appearing or men suddenly appearing and then leaving.  Enoch was taken by God and no evidence remained of his existence and Elijah was taken up into the sky.  Jesus communed with Moses and Elijah who appeared suddenly and then went back up into the sky.



Who knows?!?

No they have concrete roads as well.

EDIT: The fish eyes and bird symbols are called hyrogliphics, thats how the ancient egyptians wrote things, modern egyptians write in arabic, although some of them do hyroglyphics for tourists.

Yes - all Egyptians walk barefoot across their sand-floored homes and they still write with hieroglyphs. Same as Americans today walk around dressed as pilgrims, Britain's overruling power is the monarchy and the Greek empire spans much of the globe.

The true answer to this is: nobody knows.

The reason for this answer is: nobody's done it yet.

As we evolve, we learn new things and new ways of understanding. If we evolve and attain a new level of consciousness, we might be more miserable, or more happy, depending on how we interpret that consciousness.

An old Zen koan says that a man achieved enlightenment, and after the Master announced this to everyone in the temple, one of the other priests asked him: "How do you feel?"

"As miserable as ever," was the reply.

No, he just looks black cos Mrs Thatch banished him back "to the pit from which he sprang" So he has been living a dark and lonely existance in the deepest Coalmine he could find,a bit like a big ginger Gollum, searching for his mysterious "Precious". This is believed to be the fabled Black Diamond of economic viability, which has not been seen since the Winter of Discontent. Over the years,the coal dust has stained his pallid skin to a Jet Black,so no-one ever recognises him.

Kidney stones.  I didn't know what it was and I was away from home. It was so sudden and so totally overwhelming.  I honestly thought I was going to die or, at the very least, end up disabled and kept alive by machines with tubes going in and out of me.  It was so severe I could not imagine ever getting over it.  Once I found out what it was and got hospital treatment the world slowly returned to normal but the experience will always be with me.  It changes your outlook on life and on risk.



Footnote:  They weren't even big or serious kidney stones.  They certainly FELT serious.

You should call a priest to bless the whole house and shower it with holy water. If I were you I will also use incense all over the house because it will drive away those ghosts and bad spirits staying in your house.

It is actually true because I have experienced it before. There was one night that I can't sleep and I feel like there's someone who's with me in my room and it's really freaky. I can't move because (embarassing to say) but I'm really afraid because I don't have any idea of whom is that and it was so dark that night that I can't see anything. In the early morning I called for a priest to bless the house and shower it with holy water. We also uttered some prayers for those ghosts wishing for them to crossover and then we used incense all over the house. After that, no ghost had ever bothered us again.

Spirits/ghosts who roam a house and has been there for a long time do not want to let of their eathly possesions. They have not let go of their material attachment. Some are not even aware that they're dead already.
From what l've read, they would not go away unless they are willing to do so. lt would help if you can look for a person (a real one) who specializes in dealing with spirits. You can try talking with the said spirit asking to leave the residents in peace and that no one means them harm. Of course it's scary at first and kind of awkward talking to "beings" you cannot see.

The colour blue, runes and candles....?



so i have this necklace covered in runes which is supposed to keep me safe and my friend said that the colour blue is supposed to be good for you and she has a necklace with a blue stone on it.

I was wondering what other things there are that i can do, things i can buy or things that you have personally done/bought/have which are similar to this. Good luck charms, cards, candles with prayers on them, things to hang on your wall, things to keep in your pocket etc.

Thanks a lot :)

Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven.

Blue is considered beneficial to the mind and body. It slows human metabolism and produces a calming effect. Blue is strongly associated with tranquility and calmness. In heraldry, blue is used to symbolize piety and sincerity.

You can use blue to promote products and services related to cleanliness (water purification filters, cleaning liquids, vodka), air and sky (airlines, airports, air conditioners), water and sea (sea voyages, mineral water). As opposed to emotionally warm colors like red, orange, and yellow; blue is linked to consciousness and intellect. Use blue to suggest precision when promoting high-tech products.

Blue is a masculine color; according to studies, it is highly accepted among males. Dark blue is associated with depth, expertise, and stability; it is a preferred color for corporate America.

Avoid using blue when promoting food and cooking, because blue suppresses appetite. When used together with warm colors like yellow or red, blue can create high-impact, vibrant designs; for example, blue-yellow-red is a perfect color scheme for a superhero.

Light blue is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness.
Dark blue represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.

Is it just a futhark (alphabet) or is a script, possibly made up of the so called ALU runes?

Its fairly common for runes to be "empowered" by rubbing tiver in to them (red Ochre + pine resins I think) You can obtain a blue tiver (think it's woad) but this less common, and tends to be used by female rune-workers (think it's something to do with Frigg who seems to have been Odin's magical partner)

Depends very much on the colour of blue: While it can represent the sea, and sky, some shades of blue can be thought of being the colour of slate, and death.

Ideas as to charms you can make. If you take a stick of about the width of your thumb (probably best if from the ground, rather than a living branch) it's fairly easy to slice it into discs using a hacksaw. Drill a small hole in the disc so you can hang it, and sand it smooth. you can then carve symbols onto the disc. Perhaps use ALE runes ,bind-runes (combinations of runes) or cypher runes to express what you're wanting. You can tiver if you want, and you don't need to varnish the disc.

Remember if you carve/empower the symbols yourself, YOU determine the meaning of the charm.

---
Be a little careful if like many you are attracted to the bind-rune formed by Gifu(a kiss shape) and Wyn (looks like a P) A literal translation can mean the gift of the Goddess, which has VERY different meanings when worn by the different sexes!

From folklore from various Slavic peoples (I'll give the Russian name, followed by various other Slavic names):

vodyanoy/водяной (wodnik [Polish],водник [Bulgarian]): lots of Slavic words with "voda" in them connote something to do with water; this is a being usually described with green hair, beard, and covered in algae with webbed hands and feet, responsible for drownings, breaking dams, etc.
rusalka (pl. rusalki): similar to the above and many water nymphs cross-culturally; usually said to be spirits of young women who committed grevious sins like having children out of wedlock or committing suicide, also responsible for drownings; there's a week dedicated to them in Early June called Rusal'naia/Semik, a fertility festival in many East Slavic lands, when the rusalki were said to be at their most powerful, coming out of their watery kingdoms and dancing the Khorovod (in general, any round dance; from "khor" meaning "round" or "circle")
domovoi (домово́й): household spirits, usually small and male, who help with the housework and guard the home.  Domovye (pl.) can cause a ruckus when angered from improper household care and improper language.  Usually live under stove or threshold (two places in the home which were held with great importance, even still today, in Slavic lands).
bannik: spirit of the bathhouse, a place of great mystery for the Slavs, most likely because one had to take off holy medals to enter to bath and births were done there (and with the high mortality rate of infants, the spirit was seen as viscious).  Traditionally, every third or fourth fire was lit only for the spirit.  Diviniations, done especially during Christmas time, were done here.

It's difficult to generalize Slavic mythology since there are so many variants across the many peoples.  It's difficult to do so in general, really.  Things evolve from other things.  It's not like one day people came up with an idea about griffins.  These things evolve in that amorphous field of folklore and myth.  Things are more complex than "Zeus is the god of storms."  Myths held deeper importance to the culture in question and varied individually.  I find Slavic myths and folklore interesting because of their obscurity and attempts to try and decipher what they really meant to the various peoples.  If you like this stuff, there are more creatures like leshii/leszi (Polish) (ле́ший--it's difficult to transliterate from the Cyrillic from Roman script; there're so many variations) and vila, and characteres like Baba Jaga, Kolschei the Deathless, and the princes from the Russian bylinas, as well as the ancient deities like Dazhdbog, Svantevit, and Perun.

Night terrors can be deeply disturbing.
Discount any idea some 'person' was hovering about your ceiling - doesn't happen.
Sounds like you are under stress - or overusing some drug of your choice.
Get some professional advice.



I've been in both places - often putting others to considerable difficulty - asleep against a bedroom door they couldn't open without pushing me out of the way.
That does happen - so you are far from being alone in such experiences.

Good answer Cook Rox.
Why do you get scared - I think you need to get to the bottom of that.
If there is spiritual activity in your place you can get it sorted by the right people.  There should be a spiritualist church in your region which you can google and they will be able to advise you.  Alternatively conact either the british or american society of dowsers, depending on where you live, and ask for someone who does House Clearance and they will be able to do it for you - sometimes without even visiting the house,
Hope youre okay.

It's a bit of both, starting with the dream. I think that you have some king of sleep disturbance. It would be wise to get the accurate type of sleeping pills from a medical doctor. Your trouble will go away.

succubus



where did she come from?
Why does she stay?
Answers i do not have, only this i do know.
My life has life has changed, my soul tormented.
Faith is always questioned, and she never answers
I turn a cold shoulder on the subject, as she subtly serenades me.
A succubus she be.
this i will never know.
Until my eternal soul is claimed.
Then finally, after i see the face of God, and hear her twisted laughs
I will know i have been swindled by the trickster.
She spits damned lies with her wicked tongue, and hypnotizes me to do the same.
However, now it is to late.
My yearns for redemption have become muffled by the echoing cries of my burning fate.

INCUBUS AND SUCCUBUS: 
DEMONS THAT HAVE
INTERCOURSE WITH YOU



--------------------------------------...

INCUBUS - A spirit or demon thought in medieval times to lie on sleeping persons, especially women, with whom it sought sexual intercourse.



SUCCUBUS - In folklore, a female demon thought to have sexual intercourse with sleeping men.



Above definitions came from Webster's Dictionary.



INCUBI - Demonic sexual attacks on females; may be caused by sexual sins, witchcraft spells, curses of lust, inherited curses, can attack children



SUCCUBI - demonic sexual attacks on males, may be caused by the same as Incubi above



Forget medieval times and folklore, these demons are for real! The demons have sex with both men and women as the person sleeps, AND YOU KNOW IT. It's not a dream, and it is not your imagination.



If you have encountered this situation, DELIVERANCE and Spiritual Warfare can stop it.



A woman called us once and told us about these demons, and that she was afraid to go to sleep because of it...



Another woman wrote to us and told us that a demons were having sex with her as she slept. Her husband, a Pastor, said it was just her "imagination". DEMONS ARE FOR REAL! She did DELIVERANCE and Spiritual Warfare, and we got an email the very next day saying,



"Praise the Lord. What a wonderful night's sleep I had!!! No demons attacking my body. NONE!!!" What a Blessing to us to receive positive reports ONCE a person DOES DELIVERANCE.

In Western medieval legend, a succubus (plural succubi) is a demon, who takes the form of a beautiful woman to seduce men, especially monks, in dreams to have sexual intercourse. They draw energy from the men to sustain themselves, often until the point of exhaustion or death of the victim.[citation needed] One such story relates to a man in the town of Coblenz, who has been bewitched by a succubus, with whom he is forced to repeatedly fornicate, whilst in the presence of his wife. The story goes on to say that "after an incredible number of such bouts, the poor man at last sinks to the floor utterly exhausted." From mythology and fantasy, Lilith and the Lilin (Jewish) and Lilitu (Sumerian) are in redactive Christian fables (folktales not part of official Christian theology), considered succubi.

According to the Malleus Maleficarum, or "Witches' Hammer", published by the Catholic Church in 1487, Succubi would collect semen from the men they slept with, which incubi would then use to impregnate women thus explaining how demons could apparently sire children in spite of the traditional belief that demons were incapable of reproduction through generative or gestative means. Children so begotten were supposed to be those that were born deformed, or more susceptible to supernatural influences.

From the 16th century, the carving of a succubus on the outside of an inn indicated that the establishment also operated as a brothel.



In other words... prostitutes.

i HIGHLY doubt they're real on earth you know what i mean? not many people believe in these kinds of things cuz theres no proof but unless you somehow manage to SUMMON a sexy demon chick that wants to screw you then yeah i guess they're real you have a better chance of encountering them in your dreams but you would have to know a lot about satanic rituals and black magic in order to do that even then i doubt it would work and if it does you would probably just summon a really powerful MALE demon that isnt sexy in anyway (like people always do...idiots) then it would most likely haunt you for a huge chunk of your life until you perform an exorcism my friend once told me that you need some black candles (black is the color of death), a satanic pentagram (upside down star inside a circle), the blood of a virgin which is used to make the pentagram and you would have to recite some words from the satanic bible in order to summon a demon...but dont try it SERIOUSLY DONT actually i think this ritual is used for SACRIFICES not SUMMONINGS anyway just dont try any of this i havent even done this but for the most part they dont exist sorry

Yeah, they do.



They have a long history, especially in the Church.  So do Inccubi.



They are not very common today, because men's urges are much more open and taken care of by willing women.  But, at one time, the need was so bad that they were called to lure men away.  The debate raged in the Church for years.

The scary thing is that some think that the Succubi and the Inccubi are the same creature, just changing form.  They take the male sperm and force it into women, to create others.



An issue often overlooked is that the man is seduced but the woman is raped, violently.  These are not nice creatures.

its all down to sleep paralysis, when you are dreaming your body doesn't want to be doing all the activities your brain is throwing at you so it stops you from moving, sometimes you wake while in this state but only vaguely concious as your chest is paralysed it feels like there is something sitting on it.
also comes with the sense that there is someone in the room with you.
my brother used to have this a lot and in this state used to see an old woman with 2 cats staring at him!

may also account for some ufo abduction theories!

it depends on what you want to do. do you want it to be scientific?
do you want it to be spiritualy?
for scientific ghost hunting you need some voice rcorders for EVP's, some video camera's, and if you can find one get a energy reader like something that will give you a number if you put it near a electrical source.
if you want to do it spiritually you will need to find a psychic willing to help you.

Being a UK resident I'd have to site the Freemasons. British history portrays them as something of an omnipotent force throughout the middle and upper classes, at the height of their powers in Victorian England. As a members-only "boys club" of the great and the good in society, their sphere of influence was known to spread throughout the police, judiciary and the higher professions. Their activities where protected by ritualistic initiations and punishments for transgressors against the secrets of the lodge, and although these rituals are nowadays merely symbolic, with the movement acting overtly as a benevolent charity-supporting brotherhood, who really knows?

Masonic influence is often sited in modern or historical fiction (e.g. the "From Hell" telling of the "Jack the Ripper" story featuring Johnny Depp, and a series of BBC's "Messiah", with Ken Stott).

Who knows to what extent their influence still pervades the UK's corridors of power, and exactly how much is promotion through the echelons of Britain's professions still dependent on allegiance to the brotherhood and the "special" hand-shake????

Being from India and a Hindu, I've come across some rare stories about a very small minority of religious groups that secretly display their love for God in extreme ways. For example, a couple were arrested last year for killing their children and offering the bodies to God,based on the advice of a holy man. I wouldn't say there is an actual society of this type, as there are too few of them, but there are definitely people scattered around the country who may call themslves 'holy men'. They have believers coming to them for advice, which can result in a cruel sacrifice.



Previously when I'd read reports of these incidents, I'd thought they were simply mythology, but there are more and more news reports these days, which mean these groups aren't as secret as they used to be. I don't find these groups enthralling in a positive sense at all, but I find it amazing that they really do carry out such rituals, which sound so fictional.

For me, the term ‘secret society’ is synonymous with some kind of wrong-doing or violent activity. I don’t like to think about that sort of thing really existing (I’m a pacifist) but I think the use of secret societies in fictional terms is where it gets fascinating.

There’s nothing like the use of imagination to draw you in and with a secret society, you are being let in on another world. If the plot of the film or book is realistic, it is almost like this could be going on in your own neighbourhood.  Like in the film, Fight Club, you have this underground boxing club where the characters vent their frustrations almost as a form of therapy. What starts of as just a fight in a bar suddenly becomes like a secret circle with the laying down of rules, one of which being: ‘You don’t talk about fight club…’ You were an onlooker, you’re suddenly a member. Confidentiality always gives it the edge. Rules are associated with a group or organisation so it automatically becomes a ‘thing’.



Think I’m going off on a tangent now, but its not always serious stuff. In Harry Potter, there are secret societies all over the place – fighting on behalf of good and evil. As a fantasy novel, tricks with magic such as invisible/hidden rooms and houses where the members meet, make these societies all the more exciting.

One of the most enthralling secret societies of all time (and remember that this happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...) has to be the Sith order, whose most illustrious representatives are Lord Palpatine and Lord Vader.
Nothing is said about the Sith order in the original Star Wars trilogy, as all we know is Darth Vader being referred to as Lord Vader at times. But this very title somehow implies that Vader belong to a caste of some kind. 
Roughly speaking, the Siths could be defined as a cult of warrior priests devoted to the Dark Side of the force. Their nemesis are the less-secret Jedi knights.



Several factors make the Sith a fascinating secret society. It is actually such a secret society that very little is known about them and their exact number, throughout the many galactic years, is relatively hard to determine. 
A little more however is known about the way the Sith order functions and there comes the fascination with it: Sith Lords are devoted to the dark side of the Force and are expected to draw on their anger, fear, and hatred in order to gain power. The Sith therefore maintain a certain psychological isolation.



Also, as shown in The Phantom Menace, the order, at least in the latter stages, generally works as a tandem, with a master and an apprentice (in that case, the film shows the relationship between Darth Sidious and Darth Maul), one to embody power and the other to crave it.



In spite of this, or maybe because of it, the Sith order managed to outmanoeuvre the Jedi knights and gain absolute power, thus establishing a ruthless galactic regime under Emperor Palpatine.

An enthralling secret society are the Triads. Their name literally means “black society”, which seems exceptionally sinister. Part of the intrigue is, unlike some mythical society throughout time, they actually exist, yet do so beyond the boundaries of my experiences in the West.



Although these days they are involved with illegal activities that should not be condoned, they actually began as a Chinese resistance movement in the 1760s. It’s only when they lost popular support in 1911 that they resorted to criminal activity.

By reputation the Triads are still active today but remain low key, unlike say the Mafia. Also in contrast to the Mafia, they usually only cause violence amongst themselves.



They use codes to denote rank and structure and  have 36 traditional oaths, which include examples like:

“I will take good care of the wives or children of sworn brothers entrusted to my keeping. If I do not I will be killed by five thunderbolts.” A sect that can be struck down by five thunderbolts? Now that’s enthralling.

Undoubtedly, the best ever secret society ever is G.R.O.S.S (Get Rid Of Slimy GirlS), the club created by Calvin and Hobbes!



Brief history of the club: G.R.O.S.S has only two members: Calvin and Hobbes. However, they hold many different responsibilities and ranks within the society. Calvin is in turn Dictator-for-life and Field Scout, while Hobbes is President and First Tiger.



G.R.O.S.S has one single mission which is the reason for its existence: to bug girls. And since Susie Derkins, Calvin’s classmate and neighbour, is the only recurring young girl in that comic, she ends up being the target for all of G.R.O.S.S's plans. These plans however generally fail or backfire, which definitely puts the club into a league of its own…

G.R.O.S.S club is also well-known for its popular anthem: Oh oh, Grohoooooss, best club in the cosmos!

Well recently Dan Brown has thrown several into the limelight with his Da Vinci Code book. Obviously the Knights Templar have an enduring popularity even before Mr Brown wrote his novel. Their link to the Holy Grail and the religious obsession with this has ensured that their presence in popular media continues to be prevalent.
Opus Dei are another very powerful organisation that seems to be shrouded in an air of mystery.

Surely one of the most important groups of the mid 20th Century was the ODESSA movement, which was alleged to have existed toward the end and after the Second World War, ensuring that prominent Nazi's escaped prosecution and that other key Nazi and SS figures were given powerful positions in post-war Europe.

Illuminati is another mysterious organisation which seems to be a term used to cover a range of groups. One of the most common references to them is from the US currency bills, where the pyramid with the all-seeing eye is printed on the back of the $1 note. With their origins in Enlightenment Germany it is still claimed that this groups represents powerful figures across the globe.

Of course we all love a conspiracy theory, whether it be hidden grails, dead princesses, presidential assassinations or strange flying objects. Whether some of these groups really exist and what their powers may be will probably never be known for sure and with the continued media attention on these topics the reality will probably never be separated from the myth.

The Illuminati



It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation systems (silent weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide

The Illuminati who were on the faculty of colleges and universities were to cultivate students possessing exceptional mental ability and who belonged to well-bred families with international leanings, and recommend them for special training in Internationalism. Such training was to be provided by granting scholarships, like the Rhodes Scholarship, to those selected by the Illuminati. All such scholars were to be first persuaded and then convinced that men of special talent and brains had the right to rule those less gifted on the grounds that the masses do not know what is best for them physically, mentally, and spiritually.

While it's not necessarily a 'secret' society, my favourite closed society is the Free Masons.  The discretion of membership creates a certain level of mystery to the organisation, but in fact the society is held together by common moral beliefs of charity and a higher good.



Despite the criticism of intrigue against the Masons, with prior members like Mozart, Kipling, Douglas MacArthur, Winston Churchill, Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, it appears like good a company of gentlemen.

To be a secret society hints at deception and threatening, so I can't classify any such societies  in terms of enthralling.

I admit to having very little knowledge of any secret societies (perhaps that is credit to them - remaining so secret I have no idea!) but the Masons must be one of the longest surviving socieites (willing to be corected) so that perhaps would make it intriguing rather than enthralling. Absolutely no idea why - who knows apart from the Masons what goes on??! If we all knew then the intrigue would stop so not much fun in that!

When I was 7 I made up my own - FROGS (Frogs Rule Our Great Streams) but I was the only member (funnily enough) but I made a badge so it was slightly enthralling, if not a bit lonely. I still think frogs are great creatures!



Just read David p's answer - I'm from Shetland too! It's a small world! And I do agree with him - it's common knowledge up here but not a lot can be done about it.

Aside from the question - it's quite amusing skipping past the first few pages of answers - the more answers there are then the less thumbs up/down are being given. Doesn't this just make over 400 answers seem silly when the majority of people are hardly looking beyond the first 30 or so? Answer nicky b's question - it's the same but he's only had 9 answers. Why does Robert de Nero's name make the difference?!

I would have to plump for the mason,s as well. They are everywhere, even  the Shetland Islands (pop 23,000) where im from. Example, a young man gets caught for drink driving for the second time and goes to jail, another young man who had drank more gets caught for a fifth time and recieves a cash fine, his father is a mason the others is not. Many policemen and judges are masons

I think, for me it has to be The Knights Templar.
This is thinking about their time and place in history - the locations, everything about them. They are also, I think quite romantic...does that make sense!
The Knights Templar have become surrounded by legends concerning secrets and mysteries handed down to the select from ancient times. Further fictional embellishments have been added in movies and bestselling novels, such as the Tombs of the Blind Dead series, The Church, The Da Vinci Code and National Treasure.
The story of the Templars' persecution has also proved a tempting source for many organizations to use to enhance their own dignity, history, and mystery. Many organizations claim traditions from the original Order. The Freemasons, for example, began incorporating Templar symbols and rituals in the 1700s, and have a modern title called "Order of the Knights Templar" to which members can aspire. A youth fraternity associated with the Freemasons, the Order of DeMolay, cites de Molay's loyalty to his fellow Templars in the face of execution as a bedrock moral imperative. Though there is no historical link between the 1300s dismantling of the Templars and the 1700s rise of some of these organizations, there is often public confusion which conveniently disregards the 400 year gap in the chain.
The highest profile of the legends are generally connected with the long occupation by the order of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, and speculation about what relics the Templars may have found there, such as the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant.[5] There is no historical record that they ever had the Holy Grail in their possession, and indeed, most scholars agree that the story of the Grail was just that, a fiction that began circulating in medieval times. One intriguing artifact that does have some basis though, is the Shroud of Turin. Though the last Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques de Molay was burned at the stake in 1314, next to associate Geoffrey de Charney, is is worth noting that in 1357, de Charney's grandson's family were the first to publicly display the cloth. The artifact's origins are still a matter of considerable controversy, but carbon-dating seems to trace the origin of the shroud to 1260-1390, during the last days of the Templars

I know alot abou the Masons, I'm a feminist, who hates sexism.  the masons think they are something that they are not.  A close relative was one, i have read all the secret books etc. and I cannot understand the fascination with them.  There is nohing secret about it, other than people don't know what is going on. Masons should all get a life and stop playing childish games.

Why is obama friends with bill ayers and rev. wright and is it me or....?



I am 16 and i have always been proud to be an american.  it seems to me a pity that the u.s loses troops protecting people who are not proud to be here. If you do not like why not go else where? People like Michelle Obama who for once in her life out of the blue is proud to be an american with how old she is need to consider moving else where or reconsidering how well she has compared to other countries. Am i right or am i just crazy?

Becoming extremely paranoid, zombies, HELP ME!?



Okay, So i have a huge fear of zombies. But stupidly, I watched Dead Set for the last 3 nights, and now I'm so paranoid.



I'm terrified that zombies/undead are going to come and 'get me' (no simpler explanation then that)



How can I stop this fear, regain my confidence and be able to look outside without fearing something's gonna jump out and kill me.



By the way, I'm 14, and stay alone at my house from 8am to 8pm due to parents working.

ok first of all I would advise you to stop watching dead set , its created to mess with your head and scare you producers and directors know how to scare people with these programs. Secondly zombies don,t and can,t exist for a number of reasons number one they are brain dead nothing can move unless the brain functions, when people die they decompose and turn to dust so they wouldn,t even have a body to move around with. Try to focus on something else if you are thinking about something else you won,t be scared. good luck.

Zombies do not exist. Don't know the TV show you are watching (and it is a TV show, remember that. The shows are make believe, even some of the news is make believe). They make money from making scary shows - but why do you have to watch them - there are other things on TV.
Also, I really don't think its good for you to be alone 12 hours a day. Your parents may need to work but you have needs too. So, how about going to see relatives, getting friends round, and whatever else may work. Tell your parents you don't really like being alone in house. Oh yes - doesn't school take up some of this time ??

if you are eating/drinking caffeine products quit it. get some good sleep, have some herbal tea (sage would be good), burn some incense, make big bubbly bath lite candles play some music...that all should make you feel more relaxed and remove paranoia.

first thing to do is to turn off the scary stuff. leave those movies until your mind is more mature. honestly.
the chances of a full blown, uncontainable zombie invasion are nill, so feel safe. but you probably still have some insecurities so lets think about this some more.
what if you made some fun with it? make up an awesome zombie plan! what would you do? where would you go? if you turn it into a game then it would seem less like horror and more like fun.



or maybe you just need to talk to a phsyce. the idea seems kinda like your phobias being blown out of proportion but i can guarentee that nothing works better than someone to listen.

You are obviously a sensitive person & as such should avoid scary films. The zombies in films are not real but you have given yourself a fright by watching horror films. What you need is something to take your mind off this & also remind yourself when you feel uneasy that horror film zombies are not real. There are however real zombies, though they are not dead. This site explains what I mean.
http://www.paranormality.com/zombies.sht...
That's pretty bad for the poor zombie but not something that should worry you. Perhaps you should try a little light reading/tv viewing & leave the horror films alone not everybody gets on well with horror stories, even when they are older & have families of their own.

Burn cinnamon or clove scented candles, or boil cinnamon/clove on the stove.  Zombies find the cinnamon smell offensive, and clove is poisonous to them and they're afraid of it.  Really.



That, and realize that as a child - and no, it's not patronizing to call a 14-yr-old a child, even if you don't feel like one - as a child, your imagination is stronger than your ability to control it.  This will change as you get older.  For now, stay away from the scary sh_t.  Minimally, follow up the scary sh_t with a Harry Potter movie or something light that you enjoy.  But you might want to stay away from the one with Dementors...

Three knocks on my door. I open it and there's no-one there. Not even a trace. Am I going crazy?



I'm an 18-year-old female university student. Sometime in January of this year I was sitting at home, typing away on MSN. It was a typical weekday night for me - fast food, music, movies, MSN, a pig-sty-like apartment, my anxiety-depression-suicidal-whatever-the... disorder and alone-ness. I lived at home then; my father (the only other household) was abroad at the time.



Just as I was typing something to my friend, I heard three distinctive knocks on my door. I was so into the conversation that I "jumped" when the knocks distracted me. I quickly went to open the door, and as I opened it I saw no-one. I looked around - still no-one. I think I said something, perhaps called out "Anyone there?" or something along those lines, but I don't really remember. There was no-one. I tried to remember if I heard any fading footsteps or voices, but I was certain I didn't. I closed the door. For some reason I got quite scared. During that week while conversing with my best friend, I told her about my experience. Just then her tone of voice changed and she said "It was a ghost. There's a ghost here in Halifax [Canada, that is] that goes around knocking on doors. If it knocks three times, that'll mean you'll die. Watch out for the other two times." That scared me even more.



I can't really remember now, but I think this happened for the second time. The reason it traces in my mind is because I was thinking of death while having a shower the day the "ghost" knocked on my door for the second time. The third time didn't happen for sure.



So my questions are:
- Is it true that Halifax has this certain type of ghost? and
- Why do you think this happened and what do you think it meant?

The old wives tale says that if you hear three knocks and no one is there, someone you know passed away. My Grandma heard 3 knocks twice in one night at her door and that very morning she got a call from her sister telling her that 2 of her aunts had passed away in the night. I guess it's sort of your loved ones saying goodbye as they pass.

Is there a ghost in my house?



This sounds like a silly question considering it is the night before Halloween but I am very serious in asking it. Please only serious advice. The night before last, I and three others were sitting in my living room watching a movie. My boyfriend left to go to the store. Approximitely two minutes after he left, the front door swung open in front of all of us. Nobody walked in so I got up, checked if anyone was there and seeing that there was no one I closed it. I figured that my boyfriend must have not closed it properly and the wind may have blew it open. This was at about 12:30 am. I sat down on the couch, a few moments passed and then again, the door swung open. A little spooked I made my way to the door slowly and peered out. No one was there. This time I closeed the door ensuring that the bottom lock and dead bolt were locked. I sat down to watch my movie again. Nevertheless, the door swung open for the third time...even though I had locked the deadbolt! The four of us sat astonished. My friend that was present decided he would go to the door and see what was going on. He checked the door and the front lawn for anything odd and found nothing. He came in closed the door and locked the deadbolt once again ensuring that we had all watched him do so. Five minutes later we heard a sound at the back door and the dog barking wildly raced off towards it. My friend jumped up and darted after the dog. He yelled across the house that he had found the back sliding door wide open with the curtain that covers it all the way to the side. This door is always locked. Within seconds of his revelation the deadbolt of the front door clicked and the door swung open yet again! Another friend checked the premises saying he had not seen a soul. He locked the door again. The front door swung open two more times on its own accord after that. My boyfriend came home shortly after from the sore with a shopping bag in hand. There is no way he was palying a trick on us because A. he did not bring the house keys with him B. he walked to the store and the time within the incidents and him goin there and comin would not match up C. it happened after he came back to the back door again. We were all together in the same room during all the happenings. As well as the door opening the stove turned on by itself a couple times and childrens voices were heard once by all. This all stopped at around 4 am. I am baffelled as to what happened. We have only moved in here 3 weeks now. This is the first experience of this although i do feel uneasy in the house at times prior to this event. What is the meaning of all this? Could a ghost or spirit exsist? What is the best way to find out?

What if you look ten years into the future and you weren't there? If you could see the actual future than that would mean your life is predetermined, and nothing you could do would change it, otherwise you're not looking at a future, only a possibility.

If you are serious about this, then I need to ask the following questions.............



1. Do you own a spaceship
2, Do you have friends who own a spaceship.
3. Are your Parents totally rich, and could they lend you a few bob.
4. Do you have access to the Tardis.



If you have answered no to all of these, then it might be a bit tricky.
But don't give up I have a few more....



1.Do you have a torch.
2.Are you near a mountain range.
3.Do you know morse code, or a friend who does.



If you can answer all of these with a yes, then sneak outside at night, climb the mountain and shine your powerful torch straight up into the sky.  Use morse code to attract a passing spaceship, of course you will have to think of something to entice them to the mountain.  Make sure you have a survival kit and and alien abudction kit.
Having done all that report back to me and let us know your progress.



Failing all the above, you could become and Actor and join Star Trek, they capture Aliens all the time.
Good luck, and keep taking the medicine.

I it's a fantasy/romance, and i want the main boy to  a mythical creature and i'm leaning towards vampire, but i think this is only because i'm reading the Twilight Saga, and though i do love it, i don't want my book to be too similar, as i fear it might if i make him a vampire.
I would be grateful for any suggestions at all as to what i can make him, without it being too similar to anything else.

Are fairies ever evil.?



As morality is a strictly human concept and obviously not applicable to lions, tigers, hamsters and other assorted carnivorous predators, are fairies exempt from moral censure too. Would for example. purely hypotheticaly speaking, for the sake of argument and for lack of a better example, a fairy bear be able to sneak into a Germans house in the middle of the night and deliver a most humungous wedgy to a sleeping Hun without anyone being cross and with no subsequent reduction or withdrawal of marmalade ration.

Well, when I was really young, I thought that parents went to the baby store to get a baby. The babies were on shelves in clear cellophane bags so parents could pick the ones they wanted. Twins were the economy packages.



Then, when I went to school, I knew that was silly because I "knew" that God "zapped" women and they became pregnant. God knew that nuns weren't supposed to have babies, so God didn't "zap" them.

My daughter was told by her brothers that our family found her in a lake by our house when she was a baby. She was a mermaid and we had surgery done to make her normal. They told her if she told anyone she'd turn back into a mermaid. They showed her a bunch of photos of her in the water when she was a toddler and I think she believed this until she was about 10.

My older sister was in charge of cleaning the bathroom.  She'd let the blue scouring powder (Comet or something like it) sit in the toilet bowl for quite a while before she scrubbed it.  So I wouldn't mess up her work she told me if I peed while the powder was there, the chemical reaction would cause an explosion and I'd fly off the seat with my naked as*.  Still have to make sure the powder is well rinsed off before I can use the toilet.

I haven't. I actually don't believe UFO's have ever visited Earth. I believe they very likely exist, but I do not think that their owners have to be smart enough to find a way to travel to Earth at incredible speeds. I am quite convinced "aliens" exist, but they are probably much like us, relatively constrained to their own planet.

I really hate talking about this because it gives me the heebee jeebies. I'll make it short though so I won't start getting chills.



I have had many astral projection and lucid dreaming experiences. Sometimes I would wake up and see things in the room and couldn't move, scream or anything. Like someone took my voice out. No matter how hard I tried screaming, no sound would come out. Then the objects would disappear I later found out out that it was more like a dream, in a dream, in a dream. I would also feel the blankets being pulled down.



After I'd really wake up from it I'd feel drained of energy and just weird.

The Paranormal Experience I had, was when I was about 6 years old. Me, My mother, my aunt, and my Oldest sister, were on our Way to Erie Pennsylvania. See, theres this house, kinda more like a Castle looking thing, between Ebensburg and DuBois Pennsylvania. My dad has always dreamed of having the place as his own, and fixing it up. The one year when we went to go see my pap, like i said, In Erie Pa. We decided to get some pictures of it, because my dad wasnt with. So when we stoped to take pictures, I could feel something was up about that house, and I never wanted to go near it. Well, We took three pictures of it. all at the same time, repeated shots.. In the first one, u could see hands that were Transparent, hanging on to the window pain thing by the bell tower. Then in the second one, it was hands and shoulder. and the third, was a Full bodied man, that was transparent, but u could clearly see that he was a man. It looked like he was in an Old Jail Uniform, had Redish hair, and glasses, and he was looking RIGHT AT US.!! We didnt see that, untill we looked at them on our laptop. then Unfortuniatly, the computer Crashed, not long after we got the pictures on the computer. that was a Crazy experience, and thats what made me believe. All these people on here who are saying that Ghosts arent real, obvioustly, have never experienced anything Paranormal. I suggest watching Taps. :). the Ghost Hunters. They are amazing. Watch it sometime.  Oh and also...something freaky that happened lastnight. I woke up at about 6 something in the AM, and I couldnt breath. I was trying to Scream for anyone to help me. i couldnt move, breathe, or make a sound...then finally, out of nowhere, i could sit up, and I coughed like Crazy...Hmm Paramormal much?

Ok so some people don't think that Ghost are real .



I was home alone and was in the bathroom



I looked up towards the hall way and a man came out of my bedroom walked across the hall and continued down the stairs . Later that day I was discussing what I had seen with some friends when a lady  asked me to describe him to her and I did . Well who I described her husband , they had lived in the house where I lived .
So if there  are no ghost then how did I know what that person looked and walked like  ?
I believe because that isn't the only time I have seen ghost and I am not afraid to admit  that I did see what I saw . Im not afraid of ghost either .

I moved to a different state for a girl. My first night out there, she had to work (night shift), so I showered, made the bed and went to sleep. The next morning she came in the bedroom and said, "Oh, you missed me so much you had to sleep with my jewelry". Along my side, in the bed with me was all her jewelry. This was my first night there and at the time she was in the middle of remodeling her bedroom so even she didn't know where it was.



I have also had several other experiences, but I am not the type who believes in orbs or "energy".



What you are describing has happened to me a couple of times too. I would have to guess you were asleep at some point when this happened. The last time, I remember opening my eyes and the TV was still on, but I couldn't move and I couldn't speak. I kept feeling somebody standing just out of eye sight and it scared me to no end.



What I've learned is that when we sleep, our body creates an enzyme that basically paralyzes itself to keep us from sleep walking. When I woke, I believe these enzymes were still circulating and the anxiety that it created led me to a certain level of paranoia.



If you actually saw something, it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to think it was in your mind still in a dream state that was projecting imagery in your reality.



Hope that helps.

My first one I wasn't scared, or didn't have a reaction at the time because i didn't know that is what it was. I thought I had seen someone on my couch but only glimpsed  the legs, as I went from 1 room to another , & thought it was my husband sitting there, a second after i saw it he honked the car horn, as he had been out there waiting in me to hurry up & come on. Then I Shivered & was afraid to go into the living room thinking someone was in the house. I took a couple of deep breath's , & stepped out the bedroom peeked around the corner into the living room & no one was there. Iran out the door made him go check the house & lock it . No one was in the house of course.



the second time I just got the willies real bad when I was in the yard picking up blown debris , happened to look up at the house , only to see someone looking out the kitchen window at me. & then just disappear. It looked like a really older lady , kind of like my grandma, but not quite her, just that kind of older person. I stayed out side till my husband got home & he checked the house & nothing was disturbed. A week later my son was home alone as I was & had the same thing happen & described the same lady, looking at him out the same window , while he was out feeding the dogs. I get kind of weirded out now when I am here alone. Although I don't feel it was a  bad Ghost, just maybe someone who may have lived on the property along  time ago, and was looking to see how things were going!

<answer>



1. There are no real vampires. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible.



2. Vampires do not exist. Period. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a bolus called chyme. It then passes into the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.



3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.



4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo.



5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.



6. Also, if a vampire has to (per my earlier example) feed at least once a day, and if this results in a new vampire every time (per the original legends) then the original vampire creates 365 offspring in just 1 year. The first one he creates then sires 364 more that year, and the second sires 363, and so on and so forth, do the math - almost a million vampires in the first year alone! Reproducing at an exponential rate, even with today's global population, they would totally convert every human on the planet in less than five year's time! (In 1 week's time alone that would be 35 vampires, and by the end of the 2nd week there would be 7 more for each of the 35, for a total of 245 plus another 34 for the new ones, or a grand total at the end of 14 days of 279 vampires!) This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.



7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.



8. There is no "virus" that can rewrite your DNA that radically - you would simply die from massive systemic shock as your body failed on a molecular level. Vampires do NOT exist, and those that claim they do are in need of serious psychological counseling.



9. Tell you what - I will be camping outside at Cedar Lakes in Ripley, West Virginia during April, at a little SCA event called Blackstone Raids. My medieval pavilion will be clearly marked with a heraldic banner the same as my shield in the avatar - an emerald gryphon on a silver and sable gyronny. (A better pic of it is on my 360 page.) Any "real" vampire out there should therefore make a nice little snack out of me if they really exist.



I'm calling their bluff.



I guarantee you I will still be posting here this time next year.

Well first of all, real vampires are not actually immortal or eternal. Real vampires just live MUCH longer than a normal human. But when that stage comes when we just reach that "forever bordum", I usually just spend WAY too much time on my comp. Or I work on my novel.

Penelope is the main woman as the other female figures are mostly either goddesses or demons.  Penelope is the idealized wife who is completely loyal to her husband, although he is gone for twenty years!  In all that time she has no word from him (he was probably illiterate) and does not know whether he is alive or dead, but she refuses to remarry, putting off the many suitors who surround her with a number of ruses.  She claims she must weave a marriage cloth, but tears out at night all that she weaves during the day.  Surprisingly, the suitors fail to catch on, although they are apparently hanging around her palace day and night for over ten years!  Not a very bright lot, I must say!  Her only child, a son named Telemachus, leaves the palace to go looking for her husband (his father) once he grows up, but to no avail.  So poor Penelope finally agrees to marry the fellow who can string her husband's old bow and shoot a large number of ax heads through.  Well, as luck would have it, by that time, old Odysseus has finally made it home (he keeps getting waylaid by one goddess after another who, of course, falls madly in love with him and keeps him around for years and years but, naturally, he doesn't care for her at all, no, no, he only has eyes for his dear, old Penelope).  So, in disguise, Odysseus strings the mighty bow (must have a recurved type, otherwise why was it so hard?).  He shoots the ax heads, then proceeds to shoot all those excess suitors in revenge for eating up all his food supplies all that time.  He makes his maid servants clean up the bodies, then hangs the maid servants for having been so disloyal as to sleep with the suitors while he was gone (well, poor ladies probably didn't really have much say in the matter, but then, back in those days who cared about maid servants anyway).  There's an odd bit about an eclipse in poetically obscure language.  Then Penelope and Odysseus recognize one and another and kissy kissy, love love and the story ends.



Well, he did run into one real princess, but she acted just like all the goddesses did and was number 3 so it was rather tiresome to my way of thinking.  I mean the old boy must have really been getting on in years by that time and rather rough around the edges what with all that washing up on shores shipwrecked all the time!  I mean really!  How good-looking could he be with the seaweed coming out of his ears?  But that's an epic poem for you!



Can you tell, I liked the "Iliad" much better, even tho' it was sadder.  Along the way, Odysseus does find out the real ending to the Trojan War and what's happened to the various heroes tho' because he takes a detour to talk to a lot of dead people, which I found rather interesting.  But I don't recall that there were any women ghosts in that conversation....



There have been a few folks who thought that a woman must have written the Odyssey since women are portrayed so much more sympathetically there than in the Iliad.  But having read both books, I don't agree.  Odysseus is the star of the show and the women are falling all over him from start to finish.  That's not very female-oriented in this woman's humble opinion.  The Iliad, on the other hand, while it's mostly about the men fighting and killing one another, shows quite clearly Andromache's plight, her love for Hector, and the tragic spot that Helen was in.  Helen was clearly raped and kidnapped in the Iliad, against her will.  The war was fought to restore her to her husband.  But still, the men occasionally talk as though she is to blame for all their suffering!  One would have liked to take a sword or shield and bash them over the head with it.

Has anyone ever heard this urban legend/story?



A guy I know told me this story a long time ago, but I've never been able to find any info on it to know if it was really true or not, and it seems very urban legend-ish.



What happens in it is that a girl, when she is home alone, decides to try and penetrate herself sexually with a hockey stick. In the story I heard, she goes on top of a fridge, holds the hockey stick down below so that the handle points upwards, lowers herself down so that it goes inside her, and then slips or does some wrong movement so that she slips and the hockey stick points up and "impales" her and kills her.



The story just sounds too messed up to be true, it sounds like an urban legend, but I've looked on Snopes and other things just curiously trying to find out. And the one guy isn't the only one who has heard the story, other friends have said they heard it somewhere too. Has anyone else heard this story and does anyone know if it's true or not?

Lost time...does it really happen?



I was watching Pushing Daisies upstairs in my bedroom. About 15 minutes into my show I decided to go downstairs and watch it. When I turned on the television the show after it was on. What happened to my show? It couldnt have been more than 2 minutes between me going downstairs and turning the tv on. Did the show turn off in the middle of it or am I missing time? Ah! NO I'm not crazy this really did happen to me.



</question>



<additional details>



Let me remind some that it's an hour show that just started. I went straight downstairs with no stops and when I got there that show was already done and a new one had started. That's at least 45-60 minutes gone at least.

A few explanations for this event



1. What you know is not right. As in, you timed yourself wrong, you remembered something incorrectly, the show itself might have been cut in the middle ..



2. Time skipped



I'm more inclined towards the former

Sweetie love spells interfere with free will and have some diverse karmic attachments. However that being said there is a bit of candle magic that may help. Take a pink candle and light it for 3 days at 15min. per day. while the candle burns think of the man that you wish to have as a boyfriend. Repeat this for 3 weeks. The best time would be Friday Saturday and Sunday of three weeks. Keep a positive attitude and I am hopeful that this will work for you. Peace&Love be with you...~M~

Wise energy workers don't share specific spells. If you want someone in your life, do a working to bring someone "right for you" into your life...not a specific person.



Do what feels right for you. Energy work is very personal...there are no specifics. You can just meditate on it or do something more formal with tools and verbal words.



The best way to get a boyfriend though, is to be someone others want to be around. Be confident, care about your appearance, and be the kind of person that you would want to hang out with.



The best way to get most of what we want in life, is the mundane way. Good luck!

Not in our world but they certainly exsist in our mind and that makes them just as valid as if they were the real thing....It does not matter what you say there will always be someone that will doubt you and so there fore youre statement is just as valid as their sceptism. Even psychiatrists are not qualified to say he is imagining things.... only the majority and of course that would meann the majority of the whole world.



another thing is I have seen UFO's on 3 different occasions but I just dont understand why if they could come alll this way why they would not speak to us. My brother has hd a clos encounter of the fourth kind....i.e seen alien and believe me he is sane and I believe him.

It was due to the Roman myths - there was the apple of life, Snow White took an apple.  In India it was a banana and I think the name of that fruit translates to serpent.  I'm an atheist so don't have any thoughts on the particular kind of fruit.

Eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a metaphor.  The idea that it was an apple is very old - predating Christianity.  In Giotto's frescos in Assisi it's shown as a pomegranate.

If the birthplace of Man was in Africa, it is most unlikely that is any variety of malus.  Does it actually cite "the fruit of the tree of Knowledge ", as an "apple" even in the King James' version?  The word doesn't appear in the Hebrew version of Genesis.

It was supposed to be a fig tree, in the myth, the goddess Astoreth was represented by her sacred animal, the serpent. The fig was her sacred tree, it was always planted behind alters, they were known as Asherim. Which is why the OT was so adamant that no tree or pole be raised anywhere near a Hebrew altar. Just do a search on the word Asherim in the OT.



Also fig leaves were readily availabe for them to cover up with afterwards. The apple acquired recognition due to the very well known Greek myths of course.

Dragons
Nearly everyone is familiar with these famed creatures and their frightening flights of plight. The dragons has crept through history in legends like Beowulf and novels such as "The Hobbit", and he has firmly grasped his year in the Chinese Zodiac beside actual animals. Although the dragon never actually evolved to be a physical creature, he has become quite an evolutionary legend within many cultures of the world.

Unicorns
The unicorn is possibly the most beautiful of all mythical creatures. Famed to be lost in a thick forest bordering on the real and magical realms, the unicorn is such a breathtaking creature that she commands respect. But her relationship with humans very often proves to be detrimental to her fantastic realm.



The unicorn is kept alive in art. Many of the mythical being's fans create pictures to demonstrate her imaginative beauty, and we see examples of the graceful creature in movies and as book covers.

Yes but only if you believe it.
You have the power to change your name if you believe it's bad for you.
You have the power not to believe that your name draw bad energy to you.



I think that satan is not a nice name to call a person because there are people that they believe this could draw bad energy to the person that is called that way.

honestly, i don't think your name is that bad. just cause its spelled backwards means something bad doesn't mean you'll have bad luck all your life or are evil. People are just consumed with superstition so much that i think its stupid. like friday the 13th, broken glass, spilling the salt, etc. do you remember the date 06/06/06? do you remember all the fuss women were having in the hospitals to have their baby born the day before or after this date because of 666? i thought it was stupid, its just a date and its 60606 so it doesn't count right? anyway if it really bothers you, you should tell them to stop or talk to your mom about it. im sure they will stop if they really care about u. don't take it so seriously though.

Who was Donald Rodney? Famous works, interesting information: any of this would be helpful?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Born and raised in Birmingham, Rodney completed a pre-degree course at Bournville School of Art before going on to complete a BA (Hons) Fine Art degree at Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham, graduating in the mid 1980's. It was there that he met Keith Piper, also from Birmingham. Piper was to influence Rodney's work towards more political themes. The works of Rodney and Piper, alongside Eddie Chambers, Marlene Smith and Claudette Johnson became recognised as a distinct movement within British art, whose attachments were to social and political narratives.



Rodney suffered from sickle-cell anaemia, a debilitating disease that grew steadily worse during his life. This led to an interest in discarded hospital X-rays and other medical themes that began to inform his work. Rodney used X-rays as a metaphor to represent the 'disease' of apartheid and racial discrimination in society.



In 1998, Rodney succumbed to the disease and died on the 4th of March. After his death, Rodney’s work was shown in the prestigious British Art Show 5. He was also included in the show Give and Take, Works Presented to Museums by the Contemporary Art Society held at the Harris Museum and the Jerwood Gallery.

I've had sex at a place where tramps gather and I didn't know this at the time.  We were in the middle of doing our business when this soup wagon arrived followed by untold amounts of tramps.  They all loved it.  We didn't know they were there.  It was so embarrassing when we had finished, we saw them all and we ran away with my trousers round my ankles!

I don't suppose it would help to say to all you adventurous (crazy?) people that the vast majority of countries have laws against this sort of thing, and that in some of those countries the penalties are severe, including the death penalty.  So you all have your little jokes, but remember God is watching. And if not God, someone from the local police, even in the God forsaken UK, would take a very dim view.

Heightened senses. A slightly "wild" look to them. During certain times they may possess an allure that seems to draw people to them. Also, the ability to heal faster than humans. There are other things as well, but that all depends on what book/movie you're reading/watching. If you're interested in a romance type novel about werewolves, try Blood and Chocolate by Annette Curtis Klause. It's a really good read. Just don't see the movie! I heard it was pretty bad and completely different from the book.



Hope this helps! :)

Actually, Weekly World News ran an article on it back in the 90's. About how the ghosts of lonely women would participate in chatrooms and even cybersex.



This was restricted to women who died after 1866, when the typewriter was invented.



Spirits are organized electromagnetic energy, much like what goes on in the human brain or in a computer.

I agree with you!! The best part is when the girl (Heather) hears strange noises outside the tent at night and she takes the camera along to investigate.The whole forest was pitch black and the trees make for a frightening surroundings! I was on the edge of my seat during that part!

David Vaughan Icke (pronounced /ˈaɪk/, born 29 April, 1952) is a British writer and public speaker who has devoted himself since 1990 to researching "who and what is really controlling the world."[1] A former professional football player, reporter, television sports presenter, and spokesman for the Green Party, he is the author of 20 books explaining his views.



Icke argues that he has developed a moral and political worldview that combines New Age spiritualism with a passionate denunciation of what he sees as totalitarian and Orwellian trends in the modern world, a position that has been described as "New Age conspiracism."[2]



At the heart of Icke's theories is the view that the world is ruled by a secret group referred to as the "Global Elite" or "Illuminati," which he has linked to The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an anti-Semitic hoax.[3][4] In 1999, he published The Biggest Secret, in which he wrote that the Illuminati are a race of reptilian humanoids known as the Babylonian Brotherhood, and that many prominent figures are reptilian, including George W. Bush, Queen Elizabeth II, Kris Kristofferson, and Boxcar Willie.[3][5]



According to Political Research Associates, Icke's speaking engagements can draw a substantial audience in Canada, with his organisers claiming as many as 1000 people attending one in Vancouver.[6] During an October 1999 speaking tour there, he received a standing ovation from students after a four-hour speech at the University of Toronto,[7] while his books were removed from the shelves of Indigo Books across Ontario after protests from the Canadian Jewish Congress.[8]

* Appearances (Goals)



Icke was born in Leicester to Beric Vaughan Icke (born 1907, Leicester) and Barbara J. Icke (née Cooke) (married 1951, Leicester), and was raised on a council estate, or public housing, according to the biography on his website.[10] He left school to play football for Coventry City and Hereford United in the Football League, playing as a goalkeeper until forced to retire in 1973 at the age of 21 because of arthritis.



He found a job with a local newspaper in Leicester and became a reporter, moving on to local sports presenter for BBC South's Programme South Today. He appeared on the first episode of British television's first national breakfast show BBC Breakfast Time presenting the sports news until 1985.[11] He later became part of BBC Sport's presentation team, often as a stand-in host on Grandstand and snooker programmes. He worked with the BBC team at the 1988 Olympic Games. He continued to work for BBC Sport until 1990. He also became involved with the Green Party, where he rose swiftly to the position of national media spokesperson.



He wrote his first book in 1989, It Doesn't Have To Be Like This, an outline of his views on the environment and his political philosophy.



[edit] Contact with the spirit world
In his online autobiography, Icke writes that, in March 1990, while he was a national spokesperson for the Green Party, he received a message from the spirit world through a medium,[12] identified by The Guardian as Betty Shine, a medium from Brighton.[13] She told him he was a healer who had been chosen for his courage and sent to heal the earth, and that he had been directed into football to learn discipline. He was going to leave politics and would become famous, she said, writing five books in thre

Entrance to hell myth?



There was an article in Back Street Heroes bike magazine some years back, as part of their Landmarks Tour, which details interesting places to visit. There was a place mentioned in the south east of england, called HELL, which i have been unable to find on any page on the net! I don't think this is the official placename, however, just a name given by the locals, as the legend goes: apparently its a hole in the ground which supposedly goes to hell, and a blind man once entered it with his dog as no one else was brave enough to go in! He went in playing his fiddle, people followed above ground following the sound. After a while the fiddle playing stopped, and the dog ran back out with its tail burnt, but the man was never seen again. Anyone know about this?

We can say with more certainty that the practice of bobbing for apples goes back at least a few hundred years, that it originated in the British Isles (Ireland and Scotland in particular), and that it originally had something to do with fortune telling. British author W. H. Davenport Adams, who attributed belief in the prognosticative power of apples to "old Celtic fairy lore," described the game as follows in his 1902 book, Curiosities of Superstition:



[The apples] are thrown into a tub of water, and you endeavour to catch one in your mouth as they bob round and round in provoking fashion. When you have caught one, you peel it carefully, and pass the long strip of peel thrice, sunwise, round your head; after which you throw it over your shoulder, and it falls to the ground in the shape of the initial letter of your true love's name.



Basically:
It is an ancient way to foresee the future. Th ebobbing part comes probably from Ireland or Celtic tradition where they would throw a bunch of apples in water and someone would bob for it and then they would peel that apple and tell your fortune. And that came from the Romans who celebrated in Fall by honoring Pomona, the Apple Goddess. They'd use those peels as a way to tell fortunes and who you would marry.

The custom originated among the Celts as part of their celebrations of the Samhain season, celebrations that grew into modern-day Halloween. The original custom generally took place during large gatherings of people. Apples were associated with love or fertility goddesses; the first person to catch an apple would be the next one to marry, a tradition that is echoed in the modern "throwing of the bouquet" at weddings.

Why do werewolves try to hunt/kill the one person they love the most when they're in human form?



I've never understood where that part of werewolf lore came from or why it supposedly happens.



For instance, let's take Oz from Buffy and his girlfriend Willow. He really loved her, considered her his soulmate. Yet, whenever he turns into a werewolf, if he were to see her in a crowd, he would ignore everyone else and go to kill her even if there were easier, closer targets.



What's up with that?

Are Bats Or The Colours Green or Black Unlucky in Japan?



I'm sending some of my Pen Friends Halloween Beanies The one I'm thinking of sending to My Japanese Pen Friend is a cute bat with a green head, feet and ears also I was thinking of packing it in Back shredded paper with a fake spiders web and spiders are any of these things unlucky in Japanese Culture. Please forgive my ignorance I wouldn't want to insult or bring bad luck to a friend inadvertently

The Japanese are quite familiar with the American Halloween thing, although they don't celebrate it themselves.



Bats (Komori), Green (Midori) and Black (Kuro) are not regarded as unlucky in Japan. (The name "Midori" is quite common among girls in Japan). The number seven (Shi or Shin) is considered unlucky because it sounds like their word for "die" or "death".



I am sure your Japanese pen friend will find your present quite cute - (Kawaii  ...  pronounced the same as Hawaii).

He was obviously wearing a helmet and it was pretty desolate at that time in the morning.  Anyway, he claims to this day that someone screamed "slow down!" into his ear despite the fact that he had no pillion passanger and there was noone around.

Me and my cousin were out in my back garden. We saw my neighbour watering his plants. We waved and he just looked at us. We didn't find this strange as he never really liked us because we used to go in his garden to get our balls back. Later that day his son came round to tell us he had died of lung cancer the night before!

I have not seen a ghost, but id like to write something on the subject, most people say seeing ghosts is all in the mind suggesting this must mean that ghosts do not exist, but ghosts do not have physical bodies only Spirit/Soul so the only way they can get you to see them is through the mind, its like saying the ghost is not out there going into your mind but in your mind going out there as this is the only way for them to get you to see them and this does not suggest ghosts do not exist anyway everything is in the mind..

a friend of mine, who is a phychic told me about this. seriously freakyy. im an aura reader and i have also seen spirits, but nuin soooooooooo scary.



One night me and four of my friends got together to play ouija. First we went to an unfinished house. With all the energy, the pointer was moving so FAST it was scraping the board. Whoever we talked to that night was a very nice man. We had to leave, but asked if we could continue talking to him later. He agreed, but that didn't happen.



We decided to play in a garage. We asked who was there and they didn't give a name. We asked for an age/sex. He said male/40. We asked "why are you talking to us"... he replied "young". At this point we could all feel a very bad vibe. We asked "do you want to kill us", he replied "yes," we said "who"... he SLOWLY spelled A...L...L... We said "ok we're leaving"... stupidly, he asked "why"... we said "uh, because you want to hurt us," and said good bye.



Later me and one other girl made her room pitch black and asked "is anyone there?" No reply... Then something GRABBED my leg under the blanket. I screamed bloody murder. After lighting the room and calming down, my friend got a sharp pain in her shoulder. It continued down her arm and across her forehead. Then to her ankle. She kept saying "I feel weird". She laid down. Her eyes started to roll to the back of her head. They would shut and she would sharply flinch. She continued to do so, barely saying anything. I was very worried, but didn't know what to do. I asked her "is there anything I can do for you"... she replied "there's nothing you can do" (in a very creepy tone). Then one more time she flinched at me, but something about it wasn't right, and I screamed VERY LOUDLY again. When I screamed, whatever was inside of her, left. She sat up and covered her ears, not knowing what had just happened. We were so scared we cried.



At 4am, we sat there wanting to sleep so bad, but were too afraid to. We ask ourselves to this day, "what was in that room?"

Yes twice.



Once it was my grandmother who had never ev er lived in England!



I was walking past a cemetery when she appeared in front of me...walking ahead of me and kept turning back and looking smilingly  at me. She was wearing black (the colour of mourning) and a hat.



I did not recognise her as I was very young when she died.  When I got home I told my mother about this old lady walking in front of me and turning round and smiling at me and then disappearing.  When I described her my mother instantly said "Oh that is your father's mother!".



I don't know how its possible because she never left Malta all her life.



2.



I was in my flat in India completely on my  own and as plastering work was going on in my ow bedroom slept in my childrens room.  There was a wardrobe with a glass mirror alongside the bed I was sleeping on when suddenly I saw a black mass in the room and a voice went through my head telling me  "Don't look in the mirror and look at it or it will harm you".



I lay there absolutely terrified not moving but with my eyes wide open not daring to look behind me into the mirror.  I have no idea how long I lay there for but it seemed like hours and then I must have fallen asleep.



I then told my neighbours on the same floor and they were terrified also telling me not to tell them any more as they were so scared.



Previously....about a year prior to this incident a woman had been murdered and her body was cramped into a suitcase and left in the portico of the building oppsite the bedroom.



I think it must have been her.I don't know.



I know that her tenant who lived about  a mile away was caught on his way to Goa and was arrested.

Well once i was at a school dance, taking pictures for the yearbook. Someone called my name and i turned around to see who it was and i had my finger on the button where you take the picture and i accidentally pressed it and it took a picture. I looked at the picture and it was of a person. Everything was black except half of the face which was white. However the left part of the face is completely black. You can make out the right eye, nose, and the lips. There is an outline of the right part of the face. It was very frightening. I don't have any idea what it was. It cant be a real person because i never had it pointed up when i turned around.

Yes gremlins, trolls want to disrupt and spoil, they sit back,  laugh and enjoy the fruits of their handy work,. Sometimes they are entertaining and creative. One person can create a number of different characters slipping from one role another. In some cases its a art form in my opinion.

Why do werewolves try to hunt/kill the one person they love the most when they're in human form?



I've never understood where that part of werewolf lore came from or why it supposedly happens.



For instance, let's take Oz from Buffy and his girlfriend Willow. He really loved her, considered her his soulmate. Yet, whenever he turns into a werewolf, if he were to see her in a crowd, he would ignore everyone else and go to kill her even if there were easier, closer targets.



What's up with that?

last night was trick or treat in my neighborhood and me and my friends who are to old for that went to the old cemmetary. we found this tomb stone that was growing into a tree (i guess cause its super old) yea so we look at the tomb stone and no joke, n the heading there was a lamb sleeping under a broken tree.... wat the hell thats weird... it turns out it was 1842 or something and some little kid died at 6...



so my friend looks up and and just stared (i look and dont see anything)



he and my other friend start running i just run behind thinking their stupid. but when we get out of the gate i look back and i swear to god i saw a pair of eys looking out from the cemetary exit. they were glowing and it really freaked us out.



should we be freaked out?



were thinking about going back tonight cause it halloween officialy should we bring anything cause we dont take the spirit thing lightly... advice?

You don't take the "spirit thing" lightly but you want to mess around with things you don't understand.  Not a good idea.

yes go back again! I wish I could go with you guys, and take a digital camera and take as many photo's as you can, and also take a tape recorder to catch and evp's! call out to the place (but don't be rude).
when you get home look through your photo's but make sure you look closely as some things are hidden.

Does this description scare you? ?



okay, so when you read this what emotion do you feel?  hopefully not boredom, but feedback would be nice.
It was a tiny, secluded clearing surrounded by the oppressive forest on all but one side.



It was in the perfectly unnatural shape of a triangle with the point towards the deepest part of the forest.  The open side ended abruptly in a steep cliff that went some distance to the river below.  A cold mist emanated from somewhere below that cliff, but anyone unfortunately brave enough to investigate probably would not have survived the descent.  However, all of this was overshadowed what stood in the center of the clearing.



It was a tall, narrow, conical tower.  It was made of some mysterious black-colored wood.  The top was just higher than the top of the forest and it was just wide enough for five men to stand shoulder to shoulder across the base.  That is, if they could get into the tower.  It had only one window and no visible door.  The window was curved smoothly and was located a quarter of the way down from the top; too high to see into from anywhere in the clearing.  There was an odd, disturbing flash of bluish-green light that would flash from the window at odd intervals.  Along the base of the tower were strange, crude symbols about a foot high.  These symbols roughly resembled human shapes fighting off some invisible foe.  Overall, the tower gave the impression of being very old and very formidable.



Around the tower was a row of tall wooden stakes.  From this area came a strange smell of decay.  It didn’t really smell like there were actual things decaying, however.  It was more like a memory of the smell rather than the actual smell itself.  Along with this almost-absence of smell was the complete absence of sound.  There was no wind to make a noise and none of the usual forest noises managed to fight their way into the clearing.  The silence seemed to have weight.  It seemed as if it was pressing from all sides, creating an unbearable suffocating sensation.

I would suppose it would depend on what the subject of the exam is.  I would not summon a demon for a Driving exam, or a Math exam,  or a History exam or... wait a sec!



Demons are stupid, self serving and will only 'help' begrudgingly under the duress of threats.  Methinks that you should take up Enochian magick and summon an angel assistant.

First of all, it would be impossible to summon a demon during an exam, as you need to have an enclosed, protected ritual space the demon could appear in.  I don't think your teacher would let you chalk a pentagram on the floor of the classroom, especially during an exam! :)  Then there's the candles, the salt and the spell, of course.
Try studying instead, it works better.  The demon won't help you anyway, most of them aren't very intelligent and the ones that are are too strong for you to compel and could even break the circle, and that would be bad.

I would be deep under the mountains of Colorado.  There i would be training my armies of mole men, in preparation for our invasion of Switzerland.  The underground factory's, run by leprechauns,  would continue to pump out enchanted tennis rackets, and meatballs for use on our foes.



The trolls will be perfecting the Window Gate, which will allow my armies to walk into any part of the world from the safety of my underground fortress.  Armed with our Rackets and Meatballs, my Mole Men Will be unstoppable.  Then everyone will rue the day they were Messin with Sasquatch!

Are fairies ever evil.?



As morality is a strictly human concept and obviously not applicable to lions, tigers, hamsters and other assorted carnivorous predators, are fairies exempt from moral censure too. Would for example. purely hypotheticaly speaking, for the sake of argument and for lack of a better example, a fairy bear be able to sneak into a Germans house in the middle of the night and deliver a most humungous wedgy to a sleeping Hun without anyone being cross and with no subsequent reduction or withdrawal of marmalade ration.

Hypothetically speaking, the fairy bear should go for it.  I will match any pledges for extra fairy bear marmy rations if the sleeping Hun wakes up and shouts "Ach Du Lieber" upon the administration of said humungous wedgy.  No one will be cross lil' feller, in fact it's rather endearing.  Hypothetically, of course.

What Could This Tarot Card Spread Mean?



Could someone help me interpret this spread? The theme of the spread was about "Love", and I used a Present and Future Spread:



Card 1: Five of Wands (Where I stand)
Card 2: 17 the Star (My Task)
Card 3: 20 Judgment (My Fears)
Card 4: Seven of Hearts (Attitude to help me get ahead)
Card 5: Ten of Hearts (The outcome of my efforts)



I've interpreted it myself, but I'm still a beginner, and I would like to see what others with more experience might interpret it to mean.



Thanks

I don't understand the Christopher Columbus story?



If Christopher Columbus was looking for a new trade route, then why did the Pilgrims go with him?
Were the Pilgrims going to find a place in Asia or India, free from persecution?
That is why they left, but I don't see how Asia or India would have been more tolerant of their new found religion.
Maybe they were an invasion force?

The pilgrims came to the Americas well after Columbus had discovered them.  For starters the pilgrims were English and Columbus was Spanish.  Columbus thought he was discovering new trade routes to India but the pilgrims knew exactly where they were going.  They wanted to go to an uncolonized land where there was no monarchy to control their practice of religion.

The pilgrims didn't go with Columbus.



Columbus sailed for the new world in 1492, but the pilgrims came along in 1602.



The pilgrims did not intend to be an invasion force, but it worked out that way for many Native-Americans.

If you want to get rid of your vampire fighting gift this is what you must do: 1st you must dye your hair brown and it can be no longer than your chin.2nd-eat spanish rice every day by 4:00 for 16 days-no dairy products whatsoever after 3:30.No salt,sage,or vinegar at all. 3rd-find a mole and keep its body wrapped in waxpaper and at a temp.of 60degrees.4th step-you cannot speak between the hours of 10:00 am and 3:33 for 15 days.Feeding wild squirrels corn on a daily basis will help ensure success.Also,avoid mice and deer at all costs.This may be a bit tricky cuz you can't confuse the mole and the mouse.Walk 15 steps to the right,turn left and hop 7 steps every hour on the hour.You must keep a leaf from a maple tree and 8 hairs from a dog under your pillow for 37 nights.Avoid the color pink.This will work if done correctly.Good luck!

If you really want to quit, here is what you need to do, but you must be truly committed or you will relapse.



First off, stay out of the high crime districts.  Vampires there are doing community service.  They are sentenced to go there for vampire crimes like feeding on animals instead of humans, falling in love with mortals, or showing mercy to food.  Vampires hate drugs because having no active circulatory system themselves, they can't metabolize the drugs like we do.  Community service consists of feeding only on drug dealers and gang members, which means they're tripping during the whole length of the sentence. It's awful.



By focusing on low crime districts, you will reduce the number of vampires you are exposed to and can start weaning off.  When you are ready, start eating garlic and wearing crosses.  This will keep them away and give them advance warning if you relapse into a hunt.  (Garlic also has many anti-inflammatory and other health benefits that will help you.)



Finally, there is a 12-step group called Vampire Hunters Anonymous that can help you develop spiritually so that you lose the desire and manage your compulsion.



Your life is unmanageable because of the vampires and you are powerless.  Give yourself over to the process and let yourself be healed.  It can be done.  There are many recovering VHs out there.  Good luck.

Alright, I'm more adept to answer this question than anyone else, I am POSITIVE this will end your gift.  Go to your local hardware store, and get a sturdy rope.  (Better be really sturdy) Come home.  If you don't already know how, look up online how to correctly tie a noose; proceed to do so.  Find the nearest, thickest tree you can.  You still with me?  Throw the noose over the tree until about 8 ft. from the ground.  Sprint into the house and find yourself a chair (stools are actually better) then return to the noose.  Now stand on the chair/stool and put the noose around your neck.  Now jump into the air and make sure you knock the chair/stool over.  Hang until over-encumbered with darkness and your "gift" shall vanish. I guarantee it.

As far as i know - from the show charmed - a triquetra is something that means to work as one. There are usually three loops that meet in the middle to form a triangle type thing. I would think it would be good luck but I cannot be sure. Here's more information on it if you want to learn what the different cultures thought it represented.

What Could This Tarot Card Spread Mean?



Could someone help me interpret this spread? The theme of the spread was about "Love", and I used a Present and Future Spread:



Card 1: Five of Wands (Where I stand)
Card 2: 17 the Star (My Task)
Card 3: 20 Judgment (My Fears)
Card 4: Seven of Hearts (Attitude to help me get ahead)
Card 5: Ten of Hearts (The outcome of my efforts)



I've interpreted it myself, but I'm still a beginner, and I would like to see what others with more experience might interpret it to mean.



Thanks

5W: There are many voices, could be a band or group, or just several people talking at once. It could also be an arguement about politics.
Star: This card could indicate a Yes to any question you have surrounding your task. Usually I associate this card with cameras, flight, and glass shop fronts.
Judgement:This card represents change in all forms and of any kind.
7C:Hopes and fears realized. You are able to indulge yourself without being addictive.
10c: A house, family and home. If someone near is suffering of a fatal illness this card in the outcome position often means Death, the end of suffering.

You stand in a place of much activity, but unfocused and not bringing you the results you want. Your task is to step back, realize your own self worth, "be the star of your own show", so to speak. Your fear is all the worries and judgments you pass on yourself, lighten up! It's not all about "am I good enough?", refer to the message of the Star to recognize that you ARE good enough. Your attitude, while positive, is again a muddle of many "what ifs", lots of daydreams but you need to decide what you want and concentrate you effort there. Your outcome assures you that your world can be as rosy as you could ever wish for.



So briefly--
Stop beating yourself up and scattering your energies. Value yourself, define your goal, and proceed accordingly. You can do it!

My girlfriend had told me that the gravel pits of a little town in south dakota had ghost all over the roads up there, so i had to see it for myself, well my girl wouldnt show me cause shes to scared to go back but she guieded me to the road, well first i notice a grave yard that dated back 1887, it was a grave yard for a town which now is a ghost town. The first time i went up there i did see a ghost right in front of my car, but only one, people have to seen many on this road so i was a little unsaitisfed with my seeings, but really its a creepy place

I worked late at Avon Cosmetics, Nunn Mills Road and I saw a shadow in the shape of a person walking through the desks as if they where not there.  Needless to say I phoned security and got them to walk me to the door and went home.



p.s. I am the original doubting Thomas type person and I was tired, had been working on Lotus spreadsheets for hours and have a great active imagination, but you asked,



I said what I remembered, interpret what you want, I just call it a ghost, but it could just as easily be said that the sound of a song on a CD is the ghost of the moment they recorded it.  The shadow did not give me fear, just as the music from the radio in my car does not scare me.  It just is, I do not get scared from things without physical form, nor the dark.  People with bad intentions scare me and even then I am resourceful enough to work out how to protect myself and stay calm.

alot of vamps on the brink try a number of methods.
trying to switch from one craving to another is pretty common. most go for coffee or cigarettes and have a drink or puff every time their fangs start itching. some of the lost causes go to drugs.



some of the attentive ones go for extremely rare steaks or even animals (more emphasis on the first one, really). thats a good one if you've got a strong stomach...Hey! it happens! theres vampys who get sick from the sight of blood...not a whole lot of them but everyone has quirks, right?



some of the inventive ones raid hospitals and bloodbanks. that one's extremely risky though and then you risk getting the attention of the WRONG crowd. you know the ones.



just try to hold onto yourself for as long as possible, try multiple methods if you have to.
oh and for Pluto sakes! dont acccept donations from over zealous enthusiasts. you have no idea how much trouble that causes.



take care.
Sara.



Oh, and this is just an unrelated sidenote: most vamps consider the "twilight" series to be a romance novel directed to a certain audience and a vampire novel to the major audience. funny to see how different cultures react, hey?

It depends on what you believe, but there is a documented case of suprnatural rape. It took place in California in the 70s about a woman named Carlotta Moran, who claimed (and still claims) to be raped by a supernatural entity. There was a book written about her struggles as well as a film called The Entity (1981).

Assuming ghosts were real(I don't believe so myself) then if they can manifest by moving things, then in theory they can "rape" someone. However, in most cultures, it's supernatural creatures of other sorts that seduce or rape victims while they sleep. Think Incubus and Subuci. Depending on the culture, both males and females can suffer this rape.

No, I don't.
Once you're dead. You're dead.
Just the same as before you were born, you simply do not exist. You don't know any different, because you're dead. (Likewise you didn't know any different because you were yet to be born into this world.)



The heart stops beating, the brain stops functioning. Dead.



Ghosts are simply the product of ones imagination.

What should I use to make my rune set?



Bone is a no-go, since people said that "bad energy" remains from the owner's death..



I'm looking for a great-looking set, equal in aesthetics and function..



It's between semi-precious stone (rose quartz/ amber/ petrified wood/ amethyst)
Or wood (ash/ oak/ willow/ rowan/ yew).



Which would you pick, and why?

<answer>



Use the material that you like. If no preference then ash is probably the most accurate, since it was from an ash tree that Odin hung himself when he discovered the runes.



Some people don't like bone, other's swear by it, just a matter of personal preference :)

I don't think it's a matter of believing in the tarot, it's a matter of how you "see" significance as pertaining to your life in it. The tarot consists of basic primordial symbols that have been deeply embedded in the human subconscious before christianity and developed before the first religion. Be it the devil, jesus figures, the tower, the magician, the hermit, the hangman, on and on, etc. They are all fundamental symbols in the collective subconsciousness that grew as we evolved, like Jungian or Freudian symbols. Sometimes coincedences aren't coincedences but I wouldn't bet my life on them, I would just say look into it for yourself and research these things to come to your own conclusion. Try google or wikepedia and research then form your opinon.

Is there a ghost in my house?



This sounds like a silly question considering it is the night before Halloween but I am very serious in asking it. Please only serious advice. The night before last, I and three others were sitting in my living room watching a movie. My boyfriend left to go to the store. Approximitely two minutes after he left, the front door swung open in front of all of us. Nobody walked in so I got up, checked if anyone was there and seeing that there was no one I closed it. I figured that my boyfriend must have not closed it properly and the wind may have blew it open. This was at about 12:30 am. I sat down on the couch, a few moments passed and then again, the door swung open. A little spooked I made my way to the door slowly and peered out. No one was there. This time I closeed the door ensuring that the bottom lock and dead bolt were locked. I sat down to watch my movie again. Nevertheless, the door swung open for the third time...even though I had locked the deadbolt! The four of us sat astonished. My friend that was present decided he would go to the door and see what was going on. He checked the door and the front lawn for anything odd and found nothing. He came in closed the door and locked the deadbolt once again ensuring that we had all watched him do so. Five minutes later we heard a sound at the back door and the dog barking wildly raced off towards it. My friend jumped up and darted after the dog. He yelled across the house that he had found the back sliding door wide open with the curtain that covers it all the way to the side. This door is always locked. Within seconds of his revelation the deadbolt of the front door clicked and the door swung open yet again! Another friend checked the premises saying he had not seen a soul. He locked the door again. The front door swung open two more times on its own accord after that. My boyfriend came home shortly after from the sore with a shopping bag in hand. There is no way he was palying a trick on us because A. he did not bring the house keys with him B. he walked to the store and the time within the incidents and him goin there and comin would not match up C. it happened after he came back to the back door again. We were all together in the same room during all the happenings. As well as the door opening the stove turned on by itself a couple times and childrens voices were heard once by all. This all stopped at around 4 am. I am baffelled as to what happened. We have only moved in here 3 weeks now. This is the first experience of this although i do feel uneasy in the house at times prior to this event. What is the meaning of all this? Could a ghost or spirit exsist? What is the best way to find out?

The story is a little chilling no doubt. I'm not a big believer in ghosts, but you could dig up a little history on the house before you moved in. Check out the history of the place, how much it was sold to you for etc. If there were any previous tenants in your contact, check up with them if this sort of thing happened before.
There is a general rule about ghosts, they won't harm you if you own the house. They just linger. Again, I am not a big believer...it could just be a string of coincidences or a little prank before Halloween.



In any case, try not to worry!

Who is the "they" who cannot pinpoint Atlantis?



Philippines are certainly players of past topography, but that of Atlantis it is not -- Atlantis centered in a different ocean compass.  What you say of Philippines coincides with that of Lemuria, which was a vast area, stretching as far north to that area now known today as eastern Russia and Siberia, where existed a distinctive province of Lemuria, the great Uighur Empire, the birthplace of the Caucasian race -- to as far south as that area now known as Australia.  Australia's topography, in fact, is the classic remnant of the dominant form of Lemuria, a massive, rangy flat land with crests of plateaus.  It covered a vast area of the Pacific Ocean.



What is now the east coast of Asia and the west coast of the Americas were the west coast and east coast of Lemuria, respectively.



Atlantis was a whole other realm, a vastly different mindset and people and in fact were its scattering of provinces that stretched all over the world relatively recent.



There are remnant descendents of both continents even to this day, however.



The dominant race of Atlantis was that of the red race, what we know today as the Native Americans.  [The anthropologists and paleontologists have it all wrong, especially regarding this "theory" about there existing a land bridge between Asia and North America]  The red race -- those who knew and heeded the signs of a forthcoming cataclysm -- migrated westerly and into what is now the Americas.  There they started anew, returning to Nature and abiding natural laws, having learned well the lessons of entrusting too much in technologies, for their great knowledge was taken with the destruction of the world as they knew it...



The dominant race of Lemuria was that of the brown race, which remnant descendents we see in the likes of the people of Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, and parts of the Middle East and Northeastern Africa.



Atlantis, centered in what is now the middle Atlantic Ocean area, was at its zenith a highly technological continent -- in fact, too much so, and shared in many characteristics with those of today's United States yet was much more advanced, but at its heights more foolish in its arrogance, tampering with natural forces with its technologies that inevitably brought the continent to its demise finally beneath the waters of what is now the Atlantic Ocean.



And there existed great continents and civilizations well before both Atlantis and Lemuria's existences -- there existed Melnibora and before this, Polara.  Still earlier great empires existed even before these.



The Earth is quite seasoned in terms of hosting human beings and the like and still others that would be wholly unfamiliar to modern sensibilities -- would be thought science fictional in appearance and make-up.

In some cases bad in other good.



In a open setting like in the streets, the zombies would run them down and take large chunks out of them, not to mention their large size and slow movement would make them a big fat target (pun intended). The more athlethic people will be able to get away easier while the zombies are distracted with the fat people.



But if a fat person where to lock himself in a room where the zombies could get to (like a bathroom or closet) then they would have more of a chance of survival since they can live off their body fat and outlast a thin person in that situation.

Since zombies are on the hunt for human flesh, I think that an over weight person would be sought out more so than an athletic, slim person would be. So my answer is "They would not have a very good chance against a zombie attack" They would also have a harder time at getting away from the attack.

What Ashley said there at the top is sometimes correct. I used to be a Wiccan at one time, and some of the girls dressed like that or in other typical costumes, more gothic looks, among other things, including sexy stuff! Mostly, they just dress up like others do. Then again, it depends on the witch or warlock! Every one of them is different, just like I'm different from other former Wiccans! I even though about dressing up as a priest one time! Hey, that's a thought for today!

They dress up as whatever they want to dress up as. Some don't celebrate Halloween, and some celebrate Samhain instead (it's kinda like the difference between Xmas and Christmas, one is a Commercial holiday, one is a spiritual one, but they occur on the same day).



But generally if I witch wishes to dress up as something on Halloween, it's down to personal preference what they wear.

DID I SEE A GHOST OR SOMETHING?



I was in a coffee shop and I looked out the window. I saw a bench with a woman with brown hair in a pony tail, and I saw and old woman wearing a ski jacket on even though it wasn't that cold. The old woman looked at me and pointed. She looked concerned. The woman looked at me as well. She was concerned too. I looked away. When I looked out the window again they were gone. The bench was gone too. WHAT HAPPENED?!?!?

It probably was.  What you can do is do some research on the area and find out if anything happened with a woman meeting that description in that area and when there was a bench across the street from the shop.

By ranting on for hours until she goes mad and drowns herself.  The moral is, whatever your parents get up to, just leave them to it and never feel responsible for righting any wrongs, enacting vengeance etc. The Simpsons take on this story is surprisingly accurate and beats reading any number of serious critics.
http://www.jibjab.com/view/175851



Wouldn't anyone find all this a bit much?
Hamlet comes upon Ophelia, kneeling at her prayers, the very image of innocent devotion. Yet he sees no fresh-faced virgin, but a painted whore. "I have heard of your paintings, well enough," he tells her abusively. "God hath given you one face, and you make yourself another. You jig, you amble, you lisp. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad."  Men in Shakespeare plays always seem to get it wrong - eg Othello, King Lear, Leontes. Some critics say Hamlet pretends to be mad, others that he really is mad.  By the standards of today, his behaviour is well crazy, but then they might have all been like that!
