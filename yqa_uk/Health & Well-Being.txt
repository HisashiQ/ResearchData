How to prevent scaring on a serious cut



Stop the bleeding



I cut my self badly with my razor it took off about a inch by inch and a half piece of skin, it took it clear off and it won’t stop bleeding. I am African American, how can I prevent it from scarring since I seem to scar easily and I have hyper pigmentation. Please help! Any tips, to stop bleeding and to prevent scaring. Do I cover it? If so when and with what. Do I leave it be. What do I put on it. I heard that your skin scars when it stretches and dries out, will coco butter or Vaseline be good for it. What products are good if so how many times a day do I put them on? Please give detailed descriptions. Thanks! Also I got it 2 nights ago and it hasn’t stopped bleeding, how can I make it stop? I am also welcome to natural remedies.



</question>



<additional details>



Its been bleeding really heavily for the past couple days, like dripping down m leg and stuff



P.S i dont have the type of parents who will take me to the hospital/doctor, i'm kinda on my own here, with this one. I actually got in trouble because i woke my mom up by telling her it was bleeding really badly and asking for advice on what to do



My mom will freak if i seek any sort of medical attention and she's scary...shes what some call an abusive parent if you know what i mean...

Make sure the wound is clean..Use TCP or rubbing alcohol...then go to the pharmacist and get "steri strips "available in the UK and USA These are small strips of extra strong plasters that can be used instead of plasters.( if you google them there are many sites explaining their use".Use them horizontally across the wound, using them to pull the edges of the the wound together. Place them very close to each other and leave them for 4 weeks. I had plastic surgery 4 weeks ago and this is what the cosmetic surgeon recommended I do on top of the stitching he had done to prevent the scars from expanding. Don't take the scabs off..let them heal and fall off them Once the wound has healed there are products on the market. creams etc that help to minimise scarring I use " Bio Oil"..It also helps even out skin tone Products like these cost from approx £13 or $25 if you can't afford this  you can concoct your own as the main ingredients are..Vitamins A and E. These can be bought in liquid capsule form and you just burst the capsules and mix them together and apply 2-3 times a day.
If the wound is too large to pull together and on your face you may want to have skin graft with skin perhaps taken of your leg and and grafted onto the wound and I would advise you to seek medical advice if possible. IAlso if it looks infected..pus,weeping, red etc you must see a doctor as you may need antibiotics.
I hope this has helped...good-luck

Low-dose valium can help with the muscle tension caused by such an intense pain - it relaxes your muscles and stops the painful effect 'spreading'. It is the only thing that helps with my slipped disc. That and Boots aspirin & codeine (as strong as anything you can buy).

Has your doc tried you on Neurontin?  It's supposed to decrease nerve pain, as is Lyrica.  Those might help, as well as what the first answer suggested- good suggestions, btw.  Sometimes taking Prednisone can reduce the inflammation as well.
Where is the pinched nerve?  That may influence the exact treatment, but a good physical therapist may be able to help you.  Aquatherapy might help you as well- PT in the water, takes the pull of gravity off your pinched nerves.

I tore a ligament in my knee when I crashed into somebody while I was skiing. I couldn't walk, and no matter what position the knee was in it hurt so bad. It was also very loose and unstable. I had to keep the knee imobilized and used crutches for like a week. Feel better soon!

=)



good luck, knee injuries can be extremly painful, and can take a long time to heal.

well i would go and see your doctor but tearing a ligament can be really painful...you shouldn't be able to walk easily and certainly not run! if your knee is turning purple then there is probably a bruise and bruising on a joint can be very painful and probably very serious. so go and see your GP whenever you can.

Try simple foods that are high in fiber... fiber will help regulate her digestive system. Stay away from sugar and get fruits and veggies. She could have something as simple as IBS, or it could be something worse. As embarrassing as it might be, she really needs to go to the doctor. Taking immodium all the time is not good for you.

don't poke a hole, it will only worsen the situation. just let it be. you don't have to do anything. just take some pain killers if the pain bothers you. after a few days, the blood clot will blacken and it will take some months to fully regenerate your nail. it will slowly be removed and replaced as your nail grows. just use black or dark nail polish so that it will not be obvious. hope this helps

Bad pain in chest and arm?



I am 14 and last night I had an incredibly painful chest (the pain was only on the left side, where my heart is) and also a pain running down my left arm. I had been doing a lot of exercise at school (a lot more than I am used to) because it was sports day. I also felt dizzy a lot while doing the sports. The pain I had seems to be gone now, but I am concerned about what it was and how I got it. It might also be worth mentioning that I had a small glass of water in the morning before the sports.

Too young for a heart attack but I experienced this pain a good few years ago - it was actually trapped wind (!) which left me dizzy and feeling awful.

T.W. is incredibly painful, all your internal organs get squished by the air inside you.  The only way to release it (apart from the obvious!) is to drink warm water, slowly, and to gently massage your abdomen.

If this doesn't work or the pain is still there after a few hours, off to the Doc's just to be certain although I wouldn't be overly concerned.

All the best.

Have you ever been checked for a heart murmur or any sort of heart problems? The symptoms you just described to me are somewhat indicative of a heart attack, but unless you have severe genetic heart disease or are leading an extremely unhealthy lifestyle, that doesn't seem reasonable for a 14 year old. Either way, any type of Angina is not normal at your age, so I suggest you go see a doctor about it.

I am strongly advising you to tell your parents immediately. This could be serious, and deserves attention. There is no such thing as "trapped air" causing dizziness. You could have something called unstable angina, and it knows no age. Tell your parents, let them take you to the doctor to be checked ASAP.

No one is to young for a heart attack. But it sounds like you probably have a pulled muscle. I would express my concerns with my parents. Pulled muscles can be really painful. How are you feeling now? It might pay to go see your Doctor just to cover every possibility. You might want to try a heating pad. Don't go to sleep with it  on.

Ceruminosis...  otherwise known as excess ear wax is no uncommon.  The Waxsol is an ear wax emulsifier that softens the was and allows it to drain out.  If you have put other things such as peroxide or rubbing alcohol in your ears, these are commonly used, but in my experience will dry out the tissue and don't work well. Your ears are itchy probably because the tissue is dried out, although you may have an undrlying ear infection in the external canal.

For the fastest relief, see your doctor and ask them to clean out your ears.  They will likely use warm water to "irrigate" the canals.  It feels strange, but will soften the wax and wash it out.  If there is any remaining, they can use a small currette to remove stubborn wax.  But that would be unlikely.

Hope this helps.

Your ears are sensitive, and the wax inside the ear canal has probably moved and started to unblock. A combination of infection and irritation, and the fine hairs that line the inner ear, mean that your ear is probably inflamed right now.

If at all possible, don't itch your ears, instead go back to your G.P and have them looked at again, it may be the ear infection is actually starting to heal or that you may need more 'deep seated' wax removing, it doesn't take long to remove, and you'll feel the benefits quite soon after.

do you swim? perhaps you have swimmers ear. I used to have this exact problem (though it was not swimmers ear) but i had the same symptoms. I reccomend asking them to flush your ears. They just put some chemical water in your ear wih a squirter and hold a tray next to it and all the wax washes out... it doesnt hurt at all it's just a little ackward... but my ears always felt some much more clear and opened a i could talk to people without asking them to repeat themselves! Also, after they were flushed, I think they also gave me some ear drops... talk to your doc... but i had a very similar disorder..

HI,
depends on what kind of stomach ache. Ginger ale sipping it helps.  if it's a low intestine thing...take imodium or something like that..pepto bismol or something.  If it's like nausea pain drink liquids as slowly as possible, just sip it.  You doctor could prescribe something called 'compazine" it works well for viral flu type thing or just general wicked nausea.

no your not a workaholic but you obviously care about your job. Try not to feel guilty I am sure that your employers would rather u took the time off to recover rather than go in to work under the weather.

Take some consolation in the fact you actually are ill. This girl at my work recently had a 2 week holiday she has since been off for the last two weeks using a combination of sick days and hols as her boyfriend has dumped her. Even at work she just sits and cries. Hope that makes you feel less guilty.

Hope you get better soon

Question about painkiller?



Years ago my doctor prescribed me a painkiller that was the only one that worked called Codydramol that has 10mg dihydrocodeine and 500 mg paracetamol and it can only be had on prescription. I found it so brilliant as I was in pain, but it completely went if I just took two in the morning and I didn't have any side effects.  I pulled a muscle in my back yesterday and didn't know if to go to my Dr to ask for the same painkiller, but I saw in the Chemists there's one you can buy over the counter with 7.46 mg dihydrocodeine and 500mg of paracetamol. I was wondering if the 2.50 mg less of dihydrocodeine would really be much difference?

A freeze Spray would probably be more effective, as regards your muscle spasm, and paracetamol taken as prescribed should relive the pain.

There are tablets (pain relief) that are now being withdrawn by G.Ps and pharmacists, due to their addictiveness and over-use, and co-proximal/co-cordimal was on the news recently as possibly the drugs most likely to be affected.

I would ask your G.P or Pharmacist before you decide to take any alternatives to what you would nomally take.

How to prevent scaring from a serious cut



I cut my self badly with my razor it took off about a inch by inch and a half piece of skin, it took it clear off and it won’t stop bleeding. I am African American, how can I prevent it from scarring since I seem to scar easily and I have hyper pigmentation. Please help! Any tips, to stop bleeding and to prevent scaring. Do I cover it? If so when and with what. Do I leave it be. What do I put on it. I heard that your skin scars when it stretches and dries out, will coco butter or Vaseline be good for it. What products are good if so how many times a day do I put them on? Please give detailed descriptions. Thanks! Also I got it 2 nights ago and it hasn’t stopped bleeding, how can I make it stop? I am also welcome to natural remedies.

Compress for a few minutes. Keep your thumb on the nick and press it for a few minutes, 10 minutes would be ideal.
Bleeding will stop.
If you still have the piece of skin, keep it on the wound and press it. Hopefully the skin graft would takeup and scarring would be minimal.

Keep it covered until it forms a decent scab, and then expose it to air as much as possible.  Keep putting something like Neosporin on it, several times a day, to prevent infection and help it heal quickly.  After the scab starts to dry out and is come off, try using a mixture of cocoa butter and vitamin E oil.  Massage it in so that it will get the blood flow going in the area.  This also promotes healing.

If you are still bleeding not good, call someone or seek help outside the house. about the scar, I had a bullet go through my leg in my thigh. I made sure I kept the wound clean and in your case your cut clean with peroxide, burns but if its clean, less likely for infection and getting worse. Vaseline while it the scar was still visible but afterward cocoa butter, my scar has a dip in it but the color of my wound to the actual color of my leg is coming back, no drastic results out of it because my injury happened in jan and its aug. and me to am african american just to clear the color of skin and wound.

To stop bleeding of any kind, use a bandage and hold pressure on the area for a minimum of five minutes. Peek at the wound and if it it still bleeding hold firm pressure for another 5-7 minutes. Most bleeding will have stopped by this time. Considering you acquired this wound 2 days ago, your main risk at this point is infection. Observe the tissue around the wound. Is it warm to the touch, red, or have red or dark streaks coming from the wound? Now look at the wound itself, is the area pink and healthy or is it angry looking, swollen, oozing any fluid other than bright blood? If so, I would recommend that you talk to an adult that will take you seriously ASAP and seek medical attention.  Otherwise, once the bleeding has stopped, apply a thin layer of tripple antibiotic ointment over the wound and apply a clean bandage that is large enough to cover the area without the adhesive sticking to the wound (large bandaid or telfa pad). Keep the area clean. Remove the dressing the next morning and lightly cleanse the area with soap and water, pat it dry, reapply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment and dress the wound again.  If you do not notice improvement of your wound in 3 days time or you see drainage on the dressing other than a little blood, worsening symptoms, or any sign of infection - SEE A DOCTOR.

I don't know what makes ears pope, but they commonly pop for all kinds of reasons to do with air pressure. Think of the passageways of the ear, nose and throat as a single entity, something like a blocked nose could cause ear popping, but never poping.

It is very common for ears to hurt after they pop.  Was there anything provoking this?  Were you on an airplane recently?  If so, then I wouldn't be concerned.  Air pressure making your ears pop is ok.  If your ears popped for no reason, it could be a possible internal ear infection.  But don't rely on me, see a doctor if the pain lasts or if your ears keep popping.  If the pain continues, try to avoid swimming or getting your ears wet.

maybe, or maybe not.  I have two kids that have gotten ear infections from swimming.  One from otitis externa, the other because of P.E. tubes.

Sometimes when you are smaller, it's harder to clean all the earwax out of childs ear.Some kids are prone to produce a lot of wax.  Sometimes if you have an ambundance of wax in your ear, water can get trapped and cause an infection from sitting there too long.  If you are able to clean your ears now  and if this was the case when you were younger...then maybe you can try.

Sometimes, swimmers ear has to do with cleanlinessaniness of the water you are swimming in and prolonged exposure.

sometimes, your ears are just sensitive.

Most children wears plugs because of ear-tubes they have inserted through their eardrum.  If you do not have ear-tubes(pe-tubes), then you can try.  If you do have ear tubes, then I suggest keep up with the ear plugs.

You probably can get your parents to get some ear drops from the store to help prevent swimmer's ear.

and lastly...
your parents would probably know what's best for you...consult with them.

Sound like it could be IBS or Diverticulitus, both can cause this kind of pain and both ore frequently misdiagnosed. Mention both to your GP and ask for a scan. IBS can be helped with diet, diverticulitus can become very nasty if left untreated.

Have them do a ultra sound on the galbladder. I thought for certain I had cysts on my ovaries and they went in through laperscopic surgery to look and took mine out. I had gall stones and luckily you can live with out your galbladder.

It may be Gallstones, is the pain up in the 'V' of your ribs, sometimes like a knife stabbing you, & you keep being sick ?
If this sounds right, go back to your Doc & ask them to check out your Gallbladder. They do it with an ultrsound, i had it, when the Doc kept telling me it was reflux. I ended up in A&E, having an emergency removal. 
So dont leave it.
Good luck.

Abuse has many faces.  If you really respect yourself and have allot of self esteem you will kick him to the curb and leave him there.  "Play" fighting is ok but not when bruises or scabs occur.  My wife and I wrestle all the time but we never hurt each other on purpose.

No.  The neck has too many bones, tendons, muscles, arteries and veins, not to mention the skin.

A piece of paper would never hold up to repeated back and forth movement through all that tissue.

with the risk of being labeled as captain obvious, your body (arm in this case) is reacting.  its an individual thing.  I would wait about four days (provided there are no other signs, ie.. skin color change) and if it didn't go away then, or show no signs of decreasing, I would go to the doctor.

Then this turns into a vicious circle where I cannot sleep due to worrying about it...any suggestions? Sleep remedies?

I think this has gone beyond taking a Kalms tablet! You really need to speak to someone. Go and have a word with your doctor and ask that they refer you to a counsellor. I know this sounds like mumbo jumbo but a counsellor is the best person to help you. You need to get to the bottom of what is causing you this stress and the counsellor will help you figure it out. Try not to accept tablets from the doctor as these may give you some respite by helping you sleep but they won't address the underlying problem.
It may take a while but it will all work itself out, but it is hard while you are going through this. [ Don't feel a failure, most people go through this sort of scenario at least once in their life].
Best wishes for a speedy recovery!

When I suffered from Anxiety & Depression I went to the Doctor who told me there are two ways of dealing with it, the first is going to the gym or doing something active to make you feel better about yourself, the 2nd was for him to prescribe pills, I took the latter and the Prozac he gave me didn't agree with me, so I joined a gym and from day 1 my sleeping improved and I felt better about myself.

Try to find out what it is that's making you so anxious and then allow yourself a set amount of worrying time about it during the early evening - say a half hour or so, work through the worry, try to decide what the worst thing that could happen is, and how you would deal with it - then forget all about it before bed. It's natural to wake at alarming sounds, you're not unusual. If you try controlling your breathing: in for a count of 2 out for a count of 4, you should gain control of your racing hearbeat.
If you are physically tired, you stand more of a chance of healthy sleep, so take some regular exercise (altho' not before bed when it can make you feel more awake!)
Lastly, get into a routine for going to bed at a set time and stick to it. If you haven't got off to sleep within 20 mins. get up and potter around doing things quietly until you feel sleepy and then go back to bed. Otherwise you're training yourself to stay awake in bed rather than to sleep there. Similarly, don't play music and ban the TV from the bedroom.
Milky drinks can help to promote sleep because of the tryptophan dairy products contain - cheese would help sleep, not cause nightmares! - but don't have them if you're going to be up half the night going to the loo!

You would be better to contact your local pharmacy about that really.
I have rung mine before now about this type of question and they can generally help.
If you are in the UK there is often a 24 hour Boots somewhere nearby (although as you are ringing  it doesn't matter how far away they are really!)

Can I use crutches only at night



I don't know what happened to my ankle. Ever since yesterday evening my ankle has been hurting so badly. It hurts constantly no matter what position the leg is in. The ankle and the leg are bruised and the ankle is a little swollen, although I can't really tell. It hurts to move it in any direction and It hurts to stand on it. I can walk and run but it kills my ankle. If I walk on it it hurts as I continue to walk. You don't think Ineed crutches do you, it really sucks to use them. The ankle is tender, and so is my calf. I don't remember hurting it though and it didn't hurt until last night. I could run and walk fine last night with minimal pain, but now my ankle really hurts. I'm 15.

I don't know if I should use crutches or not because I don't know what I did to it. it doesn't hurt that bad when I walk but the only distance I have walked is up and down the stairs and across the living room floor. It continually hurts worse though if I walk across the living room and the living room isn't even that big. I woke up today because my ankle hurt.

I only ask because I have an event that I have to go to on Wed. Night and I don't want to look like a clutz if I don't need to.

Back pain after c-section ?



I had a c-section 9 weeks ago with a spinal..15 months prior to that i had a c-section,and 5 years prior to that i had a c-section ever since having the sections ive experienced terrible back pains,when i asked the doctor if it was connected with my c-sections theyy said no..so now im just curious if anyone else has experienced back problems since having a c-section ??



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It could be the C sections or it could be lifting little kids, bending over to care for their needs etc.
I too, had back pain when my kids were young.
I would suggest that you ask to see an orthopedic specialist as soon as you possibly can. You need to have Xrays to make sure there is nothing out of place.
Good luck

Hi 
I have used a TENS unit several times over the last 10 yrs or so.  I also had a sciatica problem.  It helped the sciatica after a week or so. It took awhile to get to the nerve to relax it and help block out the pain.  I am a rather BIG girl so I guess that can contribute to it not working right away.  I don't know.  But the TENS did help.  I really hope you feel better, Rose.

I have been using one for a few months now.  I have 4 things wrong with my back, all are arthritis related (degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis are the main two).  I haven't found much relief most days.  Only on 'good' days it blocks the pain.  However, I have had these conditions for many years and have an extreme amount of pain, so I haven't found anything that works for me.  I know of other people who have found great relief through a TENS unit.

There are several potential causes. The most likely of which is high blood pressure. The higher your blood pressure, the higher the occular pressure. This can be very painful but is very treatable. High blood pressure is called the "silent killer" because some people don't even realize their pressure is high, until it is dangerously high. The second common occurence is an injury to the eye. Your eye is very sensitive and the smallest injury can create a ruptured vessel. If you are currently experiencing ruptured vessels in your eye, please see a doctor. Your eyes could be giving a signal that a larger problem exists.

Ouch! My elbow - what have I done?!



I caught the sticky-outy bone bit of my elbow yesterday on the bannister whilst carrying a basket of washing downstairs.

It's been incredibly sore ever since - I can hardly bear to touch the skin covering the bone and it feels like I can move what I can only describe as 'bits' around on the joint!  It's bruised pretty badly, but not swollen.

Anyone got any ideas, I really don't want to waste the hospital's time if I've only bruised it.  But, if that is the case, should it hurt this much?!

First of all, you need to get off the treadmill. A treadmill can be horrible for someone with a bad knee. Try either a bike or the eliptacal. It takes the pressure off your knee and more on your leg muscles. Swimming is also a good way to work out without hurting your knee. Good luck and I hope your knee gets better.

P.S. 
Consult a physical trainer or doctor on better workouts that would help relieve the stress on your knee. Good Luck.

The first thing you need to do is identify why youre having knee pain. If its because of a physical injury(maybe you held it the wrong way during labor), you can get cortisone shots from the doctor. That helps me alot with my shoulder which I was sure after 3 years was permanently damaged.

Swimming is a good exercise if you are experiencing knee pain as it does not put pressure on the joints (although if you have any self confidence issues I am sure that the thought of getting into a swimsuit is not appealing).

I have heard of one treatment which has never been tested, but people have claimed it has worked wonders for them. Basically they spray some WD-40 (the engine lubricant) onto the affected area and rub it in really well. It is supposedly very good. It has never been medically verified though, but it is cheap and small exposure should have no harmful side affects (I am covered with it all the time) so it may be an idea.

If you do use it though let me know if it works or not.

Good luck in loosing the weight. Getting started and getting the momentum built up is always the hardest thing to do.

Whats the pain in my ankle?



On the 4th July 2008 I had an operation on the inside of my foot. Since then, I have all bandaging removed and am now having problems with my ankle.
When I had the operation I was told not to walk on the ball of my foot which resulted in my walking completely on the outside of my foot.
Now I am still walking like this due to swelling on my foot. Even when the swelling has gone down, I am still have problems putting my foot flat.
From this, I am getting really bad ankle pains more so when I play football.
It is often swollen and doesn't feel very stable.
Going on holiday next week so want to know what to do about it if anyone could help. Will go doctors, but until then...a rough idea would be nice. :)
Thanks

See your health care provider as soon as possible. As soon as the pain begins to decrease, you can gently begin to exercise the joint again. Swimming is good because you don't have to bear weight. Start easily and slowly with your exercises. Sit on a chair, let the leg hang, and wiggle the foot up and down and in and out.
Later, walk carefully with an ankle bandage for support. Stretch the ankle by putting the forefoot on a slightly raised surface, such as a step, and lowering the heel.
As the ankle gains strength, you can walk on tiptoe and walk on your heels to stretch and strengthen the joint. Do the exercises several times a day. The ankle shouldn't be a lot worse after exercising, if you aren't overdoing it. Keep at it, take your time, and be patient. And good luck.

Pain in the corner of my fingernail.



Whenever I put pressure on my ringfingers left side, such as playing the bass guitar, the area where my fingernail starts to grow-outward hurts insanely. It looks normal, but there is a small white patch that look like it connects to the fingernail.

Pain is the body's way of telling you something is wrong. If you did something that might have strained your back a bit (like some heavy lifting or new exercise), then you might wait the pain out a couple of days and take some aspirin, tylenol, or ibuprofen. If the pain does not abate, then you should definitely see the doctor.

If the pain has come on abruptly and seems to be internal, then you might have a kidney infection. This is even more likely if you have fever or chills and/or feel generally ill. Your urine might be dark or it might be painful to urinate if you have a urinary tract infection. Any of these symptoms is a sign that you should see a doctor as soon as possible.

Drink plenty of water and cranberry juice.  This will keep your kindney constantly moving fluid.  There is probably no reason to rush off to the ER or anything.  Take some Ibprofrin.  Try relaxing in a tub of hot water or use a heating pad.  Monitor your urine to be sure that there is no blood or kidney stones being passed.  IF you get into severe pain or start vomiting then you should go to the ER  if not call your doctor in the morning.

Try to shift your hours one hour at a time.  So, if you have been staying up until 2:00 in the morning, try making yourself go to bed by 1:00 for a couple of nights.  Then by midnight for a couple of nights, etc.  You really should try to be asleep by 10:00 p.m. and wake up by 8:00 a.m. at the latest.  If you are having trouble sleeping that long once you can fall asleep by 10:00, then waking up at 6:00 or 7:00 is fine too.  You need to remember that when you are back in school that you will need to be up pretty early and try to stick with a schedule that you can follow once you are back in school.

totally normal.
Learned it in physics this year - your ears have tiny hairs that are the ones that receives the vibration of sound; if these hairs break, you hear a high pitched sound because you are not used to the frequency that hair receives. It is simply because that hair has received too much vibration that it breaks (i.e. blasting speakers/headphones with music way too loud). This is why older people's hearing is not that sharp; over the years of using their hearing, the hairs have broken down and there are not as many to receive sound waves/vibration. You're on your way to being an old person. =]

You just may be tired.  Life is busy and sometimes it catches up with us.  What I would suggest is to go have a physical.  Perhaps you need more iron or could be your thyroid.  It's probably nothing  but have it checked out to be safe.  Feel better.

maybe your low in iron, this is a big cause of tiredness, even if your period isnt particularily heavy you could just be annemic or something, you wont know untill you see your gp! in the meanti8me take iron supplements such as galfer, there brilliant and after a week or so you should feel the difference you wont be as tired and youll have a ot more energy! you might also need b12 tablets or injections?! maybe your sleeping too much, tired from work, stressed? there are many things it could be down to, best idea is to check with your doc and ask him for blood tests, that should soon solve your problem!

Most people over the age of 35 show some wear and tear on an X-ray of their necks, but not everyone over 35 has neck pain! X-rays only show the bones in the body and do not show the disc or soft tissues around the bones and joints. Therefore a patient can have a bad X-ray but be pain free or alternatively have a normal X-ray and be in agony because it is not the bones causing the pain. Cricked neck, trapped nerve and pulled muscle, are all terms which patients use to describe pain in the neck. In fact most neck pain is the result of a disc problem causing a trapped nerve. A neck problem can result from sleeping awkwardly and 'cricking' the neck; it can be due to prolonged bad posture such as sitting at a computer or at the wheel of a car; or it can be sudden in onset as a result of suddenly jarring the neck, or from lifting or pushing heavy objects. Patients usually complain of constant pain in the neck, across the shoulders or into the shoulder blade. Pain may even be referred from the neck up to the head or down the arms - referred pain - Neck pain may be one sided or both sides.

A cricked neck comes from holding your neck in an improper position while sleeping.  Usually your neck is in this position for a long period of time.  Then when you wake up and try to move your neck into another position, the crick pulls the muscle of that area and causes the pain.

If you haven't already found out the solution to this problem, put an ice pack on the sore area for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off and the pain will ease up after a period of time.

Good luck!

I do that all the time.
It's when you're in one position for ages and your bones kind of lock up. And then you move your head to a different position and the bones un-lock with a bit of a click.

You have just pulled(strained) a muscle in your neck. Put an ice pack on the affected area, frozen pea pack will do, for 7 to 10 minutes. Do this about every hour. It will probably be OK in a day or so.

Sounds like shortened tendons, you need to start walking around more but if there is swelling get an appointment with your doctor.  If you can't walk at all get someone to take you to the ER.

Yes, it's because you spend too much time on the computer.  Try not to spend long hours on it.  If you need to be on it often just go on often for shorter periods of time.  As for the pain, wrapping your wrist in a tensor bandage really helps with the pain, it keeps your wrist still.

Yes, it`s too much typing.  It`s a common complaint if you overuse a part of your body/joints or muscles.



It happened to me....tho I think mine was overuse of my `mouse` finger.

This could be your trouble too (wrist).
My idea was to use my other (left hand) to use my mouse...to give my right hand a rest.



I changed hands about 18 months ago, and am still using my left hand!  It`s surprising how you soon get used to it.

If you think the typing is causing it, make sure you have a soft `wrist rest` to rest your wrists on (say that with your mouth full) - just some sort of soft padding along the front of your keyboard.

yeah u can get repetitive strain injury and if it gets severe enough you could have to have an operation. the best thing to do is to have some time away from the pc and see if that makes it any better. if you cant stop using the pc completely then cut your time down.

How much to OD on Tylenol t3?



I have a friend who I am very worried about.
He said he took 8 t3s, and then said his legs, arms, etc, were going numb. This was over MSN messenger. 
He's about 6'6" and about 180 lbs.
He does not use drugs, but does drink. He is in good physical condition.

I have no way to contact him. Is there reason to be concerned about him?

Technically, an adult shouldn't take anymore than 12 Tylenol #3 per day.  Each tablet contains 300mg of APAP.  The maximum daily dose of APAP for an adult is 4000mg, anymore than that can stress the liver, possible damaging it if gone unchecked.
Each tablet also contains 30mg of codeine.  The maximum daily dose of codeine for a healthy adult is 360mg.
As long as your friend is not experiencing any respiratory depression (trouble breathing), he'll be fine.  His heart rate may slow down too, but the numbness is probably a result of the "high" codeine brings.
I think he'll probably be fine as long as he doesn't take anymore.  And of course drinking alcohol with T#3 is a no no.  Alcohol will increase the euphoria and stress his liver more.
He's a big boy, let him take care of himself.  If he OD's on his own accord, it's not your fault, but his.  Just be there for him if he needs help, that's what friends are for.

you should be concerned about him cuz obviously he.s got some issues........but, he should be fine........8t3s will not kill him...... the numbness is prolly due to the codeine and will subside when it works out of his system.....

Hi. Get to the doctors right away. You need to be seen by a Urologist and Haematologist. It may well be you have a simple urine infection and need antibiotics but as you have a bleeding dissorder you need to get yourself seen right away. Im sure you will get an appointment at the doctors if you ring now  Your GP should be your first port of call.However if there is likely to be a delay get down to your nearest accident and emergency department. Please dont just wait til it goes away as long term damage to your kidneys could be caused.

Hit my head when I'm asleep?



I'm a bit worried how i keep on doing this so any insight would be great thanks

I was still attending school and was sleeping at home the first time it happened. My mum hear a massive thud during the night and checked we were all ok...

The next day i had a massive bump on my head and a headache, dizziness for about a week after...my only explanation is that i hit my head in my sleep (on the wall behind me!) Which meant i probably would of had to sit up and do that in my sleep!! I'm also guessing i knocked myself out at that force!

Ok....Now 3 years on and about once every month i have a headache all day and i discover a lump on my head in the exact same place...

Why am i hitting my head in my sleep??! I don't get why and how I am doing it..

Anyone else ever had this?Know any ways of stopping? My husband has at times been woken up by a massive bang but never knew what it was..

Its not very nice cos I always find bumps on my head on the same place :(

Kinda weird i know but any explanations would be great

Thanks

Millions of people are feeling like that right now, as there is a bug going around. In fact, I feel like that right at this very moment too! I still went to school though as education is very important and you can't afford to miss lots of days off - just because you have a cold. You'll feel much better tomorrow if you go to bed earlier tonight and rest. Also, you should use vix on your chest, back and throat because it works very effectively and well throughout the night. (Put it on just before you get into bed). Also, you could have some paracetamol for your headache and to release some of the pain. Your cold won't last long, it'll be over before you can even say 'ACHOO!' =]

Alcohol - it can lead to domestic violence, street violence, car crashes and more. Weed does personal and societal damage too, but not as much. Just because something's legal - alcohol - doesn't mean it's not lethal.

Nothing wrong with you. Your environment could be the cause. I used to resort to sleep whenever I'm bored or inactive. Eventually, a few simple actions helped. 
- Avoid reclining postures. Don't do any reading or paperwork while lying down, or rest your chin on the desk. Assuming a sleeping posture would only encourage sleep.
- Try to move around more. Motion requires coordination and would keep sleep at bay.
- When bored, engage in some action, however mundane it might be.
- A cup of strong coffee in the morning wouldn't hurt either.
- Neither would a shot of Vodka, if you're not afraid of alcohol.
- Where all else fails, grab an iPod and fill it with some Vitamin R: loud Rock Music. If you can sleep through Green Day and Fall Out Boy, then you REALLY have a problem and need some major medical help.

How do you get someone to quit smoking?



My dad has been smoking for over twenty years now and it's getting really annoying. Our garage smells of smoke, and so does his car. He also has RSD in his ankle and it's annoying hearing him complain and we tell him that if he would just quit smoking, then it would get significantly better. He smokes about just under a pack a day. It's really hard for me because he tries to stay involved in my life, but I play soccer and ride horses and everything is so hard for him because he has little to no endurance now. I'm worried that somethings going to happen and he won't be able to see me graduate or see his first grandchild.



</question>



<additional details>



He quit at one point for 6 months, but started again (Don't know why). He tells me that he's ready to quit physically and mentally, but as far as stress goes, he's not. I keep telling him that the stress isn't going to go down and he just needs to eliminate his smoking habit and all the extra stress will vanish.



He's also really stubborn and complains that we waste enough of his time as it is, so going to any type of center won't do.

You don't "get" someone to quit. Trust me it never works. They really have to want it.I quit for 3 months one time. It was the most miserable 3 months in my life. I could smell and taste everything again.I gained 45 lbs.It was horrible.I could smell my neighbor's BO-with him inside his house and me in mine and the doors and windows closed!

Hey There
Stopping smoking was tough for me, but you can do it.  Think of being able to walk up the stairs without being winded and all that money you will save.  If I can stop, you can too. When I was looking to stop I found this site called http://doiop.com/44p09a . They had some really good information on addiction and nicotine addiction.



I found this one product where I was able to quit after about two weeks of weaning myself off cigarettes.  I have tried lots of methods and this one really made it easier.



I can't believe how much energy I have now after stopping and how much better I sleep. I highly recommend it.



You can find more information at their addiction section http://doiop.com/44p09a . Best of Luck To You

Good on you for being worried about your dad. This is a tough situation because at the end of the day it is his choice to whether or not he quits smoking.

All you can do is keep trying to convince him. Smokers are stubborn people, like you have already found out.

Let him know how much you and the rest of the family love him. Let him know the pain you will all go through if you were to lose him. Putting your dad through a big guilt trip is a hard thing to do but it may be your only option.



If you can, try to guide him to our blog. It has some really great ideas and information. Hope it helps. Sorry I can't be of more assistance but there is not too much you can do.

You will get a lot of people saying stop trying. Don't listen to those who say this. Never stop trying, if you quit trying then he sure as hell won't quit smoking.

Good Luck

You cant make people do anything they dont want to do, all you can do is calmly discuss the issue and point out your concerns and then he makes his decision and no matter how much you dislike/hate/wish it were different you respect his decision.
Thats life Im afraid, people make the mistake of thinking that they can change others, make others do what they want and will go to great lengths to try from nagging to bullying but it doesnt work, giving up smoking is difficult to ...probably one of the most difficult things you can do in your life.

You can't force someone to stop smoking or indeed take their health seriously. That has to come from them. You've explained your views to him and I am sure deep down he knows the harm of smoking, but the rest is up to him. As I said, you can't 'make' someone quit smoking

people really can't quit until they are really ready and want to for themselves. I have quit for 5yrs now, and it took me 6 yrs on and off to achive it finally. I had always said if ciggies got too expensive I would stop! I found it helped to use nicotine patches, but they also gave me nightmares and disturbed sleep. 
I went through some stressful things after I quit and I managed not to smoke, which I really wanted to do. That taught me, that I can get through anything without a ciggarette, so now I'm never truely tempted, as it only takes one to get me hooked again, and years to re-quit again.
I feels it's worse than heroin in addictiveness, I still dream about smoking and still sometimes get cravings, even 5 yrs on. 
I find it motivational that 10 yrs after quitting you are meant to be back to physical non smoker status, like as if you never smoked. So I am chuffed I am half way there, and I am working towards it.
Now, to have a smoke would be to chuck 5 yrs away, it drives me on.
I have a mini birthday each yr on the day I gave up, to celebrate that I gave myself a new life that day.
I really hope he can give up, but nagging him won't help, sadly.
Don't be too hard on him, it really is hard to stop, it gets into your behaviour , mind, emotions, and body, just like a serious drug.
One day he will be ready, and then it will be simpler, otherwise you have to just love him anyway.

At this point you eat to little but too often which means you have trained your body to eat at specific times. if you are not eating at these times your body begins to strain for energy.

Having flat feet is a condition not a disability because it hardly affects you from living a normal life, although it could prevent you from joining a military service, as roobeh says.

How long will my soon to be amputated left-ring finger take to heal?



After much consulting with doctors and fellow answers users', I am having my left-ring finger amputated at the first joint in a couple of weeks to enhance my chances of going on to play professional AFL football without the inconvenience of my dodgy finger. What I wanted to know is, how long will it take for the stump to heal? I know of a couple of ex-AFL footballers who went through the same process, and were back training within a week of having their fingers amputated.

That all depends on how fast you heal. Some people take longer to heal than others. It could be a week or a few day's.  Sorry to hear that you have to loose part of your finger. Good luck and hope this helps.

stretching and LOTS of WATER!!!!!Water at least a gallon a day if you are very active along with your stretching routine.keep an empty plastic milk carton full of water and try and finish it through out the day from the moment you wake up till the time you go to bed through heavy training periods.Hydration is key to your muscle, seriously what do you think there mostly made up of???



Source(s):



* EX jock and Marine! Also when I used to train really hard and was in the best shape of my life, have a little shock treatment  for you.But I warn you you must be dedicated.I used to work out heavy before I went to bed and after my work outs I used to take a hot shower then in the middle of it turn the shower to cold ending on hot and try and &gt;&gt;focus and control your breathing&lt;&lt;&lt; then to hot then to cold untill your body gets used to and comfortable with the current tempature then switch and so on and so forth as many time as you can do it till you feel your body naturally relax.The warm and cold water force your muscles to contract and expand  and actually relax you reducing tears and strains and you will sleep like a freaking baby I swear it !!! but like I said this method is insane and takes discipline but it works got it from an article in Muscle and Fitness years ago on how Russian athletes trained for the Olympics.Works was ALWAYS over exerting my self during Wrestling season and tearing hamstrings, rotator cuff injurys you name it till I started doing this AFTER ...RIGHT AFTER lifting.Will make you sleepy though.

You definitely need to see a doctor qualified in eye problems, they are more highly qualified than ordinary opticians. There is definitely something wrong if you cannot see properly. See your doctor about an appointment with a specialist.

Sound a lot like eyestrain. If eye doc says you are OK, and you have no other symptoms, then take care of your eyes! Glasses, sleep, etc.
If no improvement, see an opthalmologist. [ eye doctor ].

Firstly, you need to find out why you are doing this. Are you stressed or anxious? A lot of our unusual habits like this stem from some sort of unhappiness.



Then you need to go see your doctor for help and support.

But if you are just doing it for comfort, then I would suggest you get along to the chemist and get some hairspray. Trying to eat your hair roots with awful tasting hairspray should help stop you doing this.



Good luck.

Is there something you could put in your hair to make it taste bad?  Try putting hair product in it to change the text and have a funny taste like gel or hairspray.

If this is a serious issue/addiction for you and cannot stop, go see your doctor.  Maybe a doctor could shed more light on the issue for you.

Well if u keep on doing it then its seriously an addiction and go seek help from a doctor. He may refer u to a specialist which is responsible for ur kind of addiction..

What makes you think that you're eligible for compensation?  Was it a malicious act or just an accident?  Surely if you tripped, it's your own silly fault.

A GOOD LAWYER SHOULD DEAL WITH THIS,UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY GONE FOR A NO WIN NO FEE OUTFIT.You also have a duty of care for yourself under the health and safety at work act,this makes you also responsible for your own safety and can and will be used to affect any claim you may make.Any payment,before a result,will be pie in the sky and should be ignored,if it is found you were partly or mainly to blame then that also will affect the outcome drastically.Normally councils have that many claims pending it can take a long time to finalise,but is normally settled out of court if you accept their offer,this does not mean it was their fault,it just means they cannot afford the court time etc and is another reason why councils sometimes go into debt and have to put the rates up.

Honey that's really sad but I'm afraid all the prayers in the world won't save your boyfriends Mother. Instead what you can do is help make her as comfortable as possible and encourage her loved ones to talk about what she wants as she becomes sicker. Does she want to stay at home or go to hospital? What are her wishes? It helps terminally ill people if they can make known their wishes so they don't have to worry about what might happen later on. My thoughts are with her, you, your boyfriend and his family.

During pregnancy the pressure inside the veins in your legs is more from what it used to be due to the larger volume of blood in the body. The pregnancy hormone progesterone causes blood vessels to relax. This causes an increase in varicose veins during pregnancy, especially on the dependant parts of the body like the legs and thighs, although there are varicose veins on other parts of your body. Sometimes it gets painful and this happens when the veins pool in with blood.

Swimming helps and wearing support stockings, if your feeling actual numbness, it might be a good idea to see your GP. You haven't got long in your pregnancy to go, you may find once you finish your pregnancy, symptoms will greatly improve.

What do I use for muscle recovery?



In the past I've used 'Recovermax' for muscle recovery after running. There is no doubt that thet is very effective. However,it costs £30- £35 for 1kg. This is used quicker than people think if you train often. I come to the stage where I cant afford to buy these.What else can I use that is available in shops? (I dont want to use any tablets or anything like that)

Get an Ace bandage and wrap it. Not too tight but enough to hold the swelling down.



Elevate it whenever Possible. Also helps w/ the swelling.



Ice it for 30 minutes every 2 or 3 hours. Should fix it right up.



Ankles are one of those body parts that if you hurt it once.. you'll hurt it again. I say it's a sprain. But if you take my advice and it doesn't feel better in a few days go to the doctor. But that should help.

Hi, the best thing to do is to wear a support bandage on it when your playing, Christiano Ronaldo used to wear them on both legs when he first played at Man Utd. In the meantime time to help with the swelling put a cold compression bandage on it and use a product called "Witch Hazel" to bring out the bruising.

Please rest your ankle and give it time to heal. Keep your weight off it. For me, I had to use crutches for a couple of days. The advice already given is very good: I used comfrey. But you play football - can you afford a short break ? It's a compromise thing

Please help - children's health?



My nephew is 3 years old and will be 4 in Feb next. Ever since we can remember, he has a habit of shaking his hands vigourously several times a day. It can last for a minute or more. He isnt the most placid child but has not showed any signs of learning delay or disability. He attends montessori school and is due to start primary next year.

We are all quite worried about it as it seems to be getting worse but dont want to frighten his mum with a misdignosis. Anybody encountered this before in children?

Thank you

Could be just a habit, but he should be checked out properly by his doctor.  Does his mum comment on it?  If so it would give you a loophole to suggest a good check up before school.
You wouldn't be offering a diagnosis, just concerned advice.

im not sure the best way is to go to your doctor, maybe watch him when he normally does it maybe something triggers it off like hes scared or abit nervous. it may be a habbit hes got into and dosnt realise hes doing it, watch to see how it goes maybe mention something to him when he does it but dont say it in a bad way as this could knock his confidence. im sure if his mom was concerned she go to her gp.

He might be exhibiting one of the early signs of autism. One of the symptoms of autism is Stereotyped behaviors. These may include body rocking and hand flapping.. Repetitive body movements including pacing, hand flicking, twisting, spinning, rocking or hitting oneself.

Repetitive behavior — Autistic children often exhibit repetitive or "stereotyped" behaviors and narrow, restricted interests. This may show up as an extreme resistance to change, obsessive attachments to unusual objects, or inflexible routines and schedules. Repetitive body movements, or self-stimulatory behaviors, such as hand flapping and rocking are also common.



hile autistic children differ from one other radically; it is fairly typical for kids on the spectrum to engage in repetitive and ritualized activities ranging from lining up items to following a rigid routine.

He should be tested and diagnosed.

To answer your autism question, it does not sound like it really since this is the only sign you see.



You mentioned you don't want to give a misdiagnosis.  That's not your job...that's the doctor's job.  The only thing you can do is describe what symptoms you see to your doctor and he will likely refer you to a specialist.

If you can get a video of it happening, that might help your doctor since it might be hard to really schedule a time when it will magically happen in the doctor's office.

Good luck and I hope you come up with something.

I had a fall in a store due to the fridges leaking water....?



they immediately accepted liability and offered me money straight away! however, due to damaging my back and my knee I have had to decline until the docs, physio and hospital let them know the extent of my injuries. I have to go to physio and the knee clinic once a week. It has been over 3 months since the accident. I am still in pain and not sleeping and the physio said just for pain management will be a minimum of 3 months plus (so far will be 6 in total) not including other losses etc. Anyone know what is a rough idea of an amount I should accept as compensation. I am not a money grabber but have been in pain since it happened, had to leave college and also cant work or go to the gym like I used to. thanks

There is no magic formula for this.  You are going to need a lawyer for this but in my experience company's are going to fight you tooth and nail over this.  They will accept liability up to a point and then they are going to dig their heels in.  So as long as they are working with you continue treatment and get a good lawyer.  As for the therapy make them work hard with you as you sound young and there should be no reason not to expect a full recovery.  Try different things in therapy, perhaps aquatic therapy would be beneficial to you.  There are a lot of things that can be done to help you.  Just don't isolate yourself in the pain and stop the rest of your world from functioning.  Use ice for the pain for fifteen to twenty minutes per hour if necessary but just keep working on exercising and strengthening yourself.  Good luck!

you should definitely be claiming for full loss of earnings as well as the inconvenience of it all. keep receipts for everything you have had to pay for, including prescription costs for painkillers, taxis, etc and you can claim all of it back.



im not really sure how much you will get but make sure you have a solicitor to handle all the proceedings for you.

good luck and feel better soon xxx

Hip Replacement, recovery time?



How long does it take to recover after having a hip replacement?
when i say recover, i mean the pain has almost gone a nd you no longer have to walk with crutches, (maybe just a stick instead) And you generly feel more move able to move about.
My mother went in for the op on friday and is at home now.
Im glad shes got the the biggest part over with, but ill be even happier for her when shes almost back to her old self again.
Has anyone here had one, or know anyone whos had one?
Everyones different but i just want to know what is the average time to heal and feel better again?

it depends on if it was a full or a partial hip replacement.
full hips take longer than partials.

A former neighbor had a total hip, she was 55 and in very good physical condition.  As I recall, her total time from surgery to walking unassisted was about six weeks, but there are many variables.  We would take a walk on our crutches twice a day, which helped her a lot in regaining her mobility.

I've had both hips replaced.  Pain wasn't a real big issue for me.  I felt reasonably "normal" after about 2 weeks and the staples were removed at 2 weeks.  I didn't try to do any house cleaning for about 2 months (hired it done) but I gradually took on meal prep and laundry basically because I needed something to do.  I went shopping, out to eat and to the theater beginning the 3rd week.  I could drive at about 5-6 weeks. I used a walking aid for about 2 months, graduating from walker to crutches, then a single crutch, then a cane.  I don't know what is "average" but I consider that my surgical experiences were pretty much textbook cases with no complications and no surprises.

Try propping yourself as upright as you can with pillows in bed. If you find that is too uncomfortable, try to sleep on the couch or big chair in the living room. You can also try having a cup of caffeine free tea with honey in it. Other than that, there is not much else you can do.

Hot showers! Lots of em. It loosens and relaxes you and cleans out your nose and upper respiratory.  My daughter was in the hospital with pneumonia and they tillted her on her stomach head down a patted her on the back with a cupped hand to loosen the flem in her lungs. So if you don't have someone to do that and don't have an electicric tilting hospital bed and a machine to breath in steamy air...a shower works.

I don't know if staying up the whole time is bad, but from a number of studies I have read, it is best to get between 6-8 hours of sleep, more or less would shorten your life and is bad for you health, people who are getting less than 6 are said to possibly develop a breathing issue.

Surgery for tennis elbow?



Has anybody ever had surgery for tennis elbow as I am due to have the operation in about two weeks time. When I spoke to the surgeon yesterday he said there was only a 50-50 chance of it actually working. Just wondering if anyone out there has had the procedure and if it did work and also how long after surgery were you able to use your arm properly.
Thanks

What is the best way to clean out my ears without using cotton buds?



I know you're not supposed to use them but my ears fill up with wax and get blocked up really easily, so it's the easiest way of doing it, but just now my ear started bleeding so I'm starting to think I should use a different way of cleaning them before I cause some damage. I know you can use olive oil to dissolve the wax, but this always takes about a week of sitting there with a crooked neck and plugged ears every night.

Mix 1 part mineral oil with 1 part hydrogen peroxide.  Gently pour this into your ears (one at a time)..and let it sit for 10 minutes or so.  Then, with a water filled syringe (or turkey baster) hold your head to the side that you treated and irrigate your ear.  This will have dissolved the wax.

You can purchase ear cleaning kits at the pharmacy.  Or you can use a syringe (also from the pharmacy) not with the sharp part of course and some warm water.  If you can't find a syringe they have other little squirty things that work well.

Take a hot shower.  Tilt your head so that the water will run into one ear then tip it the other way that that the water will run out.  Do this several time in each ear.  If you do this daily in your shower it will not build up as easily.



However, if you have tubes in your ears you should not let the water run into them and you need to see the doctor to clean them out.

Good Luck to you.

You shouldn't really have to, and neither should you ever use ear buds or put anything down the ear canal. If your getting a wax build up, I suggest you use either olive oil or Otex ear drops on a regular basis to keep the wax soft. There is no other way I am afraid. (I know keeping the ear plugs in are a pain)

Varicose veins are veins that have become enlarged and twisted.. Veins have leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde). Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart. When veins become enlarged, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves don't work. One cause of valve failure is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can cause permanent damage to the valves. The blood collects in the veins and they enlarge even more.

<question>



Acid Stomach in Children?



11 days ago my 4 year old daughter had some sort of sickness bug where she was vomiting and had loss of appetite.

She got over that but ever since had been complaining of 'burning' pains in her stomach.

She has been to the doctor twice and see two different GP's who have ruled out appendicitis, cystitis or bowel problems and her glands are fine.

They think the retching from the initial bug may have strained the valve between her oesophagus and stomach and she is suffering from reflux which will hopefully get better over time. She has been prescribed gaviscon.

Meanwhile she is waking 2-3 times a night crying in pain.

Has anyone else had this in their child?
For how long did it last?
Any tips for helping her aside for persevering with the gaviscon?



</question>



<additional details>



I made sure she didn't eat anything for three hours before bedtime.  (The result of that was a moody child who is used to a glass of milk and a banana around 6.30pm but she got over that once I said she could watch 15 minutes of TV instead)

She is propped up, wearing a nightie instead of PJs and has a hot water bottle!  She is also dosed up with gaviscon.

Fingers crossed for a full night's sleep!



RE: Peppermint tea - thanks to those who suggested it but I have looked it up and found this:

Some believe peppermint tea has healing effects, as a result of the menthol that it contains. It is said to ease such problems as irritable bowel syndrome, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and baby colic. Its minty flavour can take the edge off bad breath. It is also said to control mild asthma, manage stress and ward off the common cold. In some countries, peppermint tea preparations list these proposed effects on their labels.

However, peppermint has muscle relaxant properties and therefore may relax the lower esophageal sphincter, allowing the contents of the stomach to move upwards into the oesophagus. For this reason, patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are advised to avoid peppermint.

I think that is best avoided :)

Sorry - not seen the problem myself but try peppermint cordial or peppermint tea to help the pain - if you can get her to take them they will help in between the Gaviscon.  Just sipping a couple of mouthfuls of cordial will help.

Try weak peppermint tea after she has eaten her tea, this helps to settle the digestion and counteract reflux. Oh .give her an extra pillow at night for a while which will also help to counteract the reflux.

Definitely persevere with the Gaviscon as it neutralizes acid and creates a barrier to the acid coming up the oesophagus.

However there are other general tips that can help avoid night time acid reflux:

Don't eat too close to bedtime (ie. not within 2 hours before bedtime). Also avoid milky drinks as high protein foods and drinks stimulate acid production.

Raise the head end of the bed a little so that the sleeper head is raised above the level of the feet.

Avoid tight clothing around the waist eg pyjama trousers

Hope this helps

I suffered terrible reflux and heartburn when pregnant, and oesophagitis - this was worse when lying down as the acid seems to creep up through the valve a little more and causes more pain. You could try propping the head of her bed up slightly to see if that helps. If she is still suffering then go back to the doctor as there are other medications to try that may be more effective.

I've had that exact same thing and it is SO annoying, I have carpal tunnel though so I usually get it from typing too much.  Just rest it (no typing!) and it should go away, stuff your hand under your pillow when you're trying to get to sleep :)

Obviously go see your doctor if it doesn't go away in a day or two since it could be a neurological thing.  I very much doubt it is though.

If you are otherwise healthy and have no weakness then this is very likely to be "benign fasciculations".  It often comes with stress, over-exercise, poor sleep, or caffeine.



Get some rest, chill, and see a neurologist if it doesn't go away...it almost always will and almost everyone gets this at some time in their life.

At 56 you may be entitled to incapacity benefits. You didn't say what ill health you have? You'd need to see your GP. You may also be entitled to disability allowance if you are disabled. Also have a chat with the deparment of work, benefits and pensions...they will at least put you in touch with the right people. They will need a letter from your GP though.

If you have been off work on Statutory Sick Pay and have come to the end of 26 weeks, your employer will give you paperwork re Incapacity Benefit.
To get Incapacity Benefit you must be 16 or over and under state pension age, (60 for a woman, 65 for a man). You must be unable to work because of sickness or disability, and not entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (see under Statutory sick pay). You must usually have paid enough national insurance contributions, although if you became unfit for work before you were 20 (in some cases, 25), you do not have to meet the contribution conditions or have paid national insurance.

You can carry on getting short-term Incapacity Benefit for up to five years after state pension age, if you would be entitled to Retirement Pension if you claimed it.

Incapacity Benefit continues if you go into hospital.

If you are not sure whether you can get Incapacity Benefit you should consult an experienced adviser, for example, at a Citizens Advice Bureau where they would be able to identify all of your benefit entitlement (household circumstances need to be part of the equation)

If you got it out you should only need to apply some hydrogen peroxide or alcohol or witch hazel to the wound.
I would apply some form of an antiseptic-like neosporin and a bandage. Keep an eye on it for awhile. If it begins to blister up I would soak your feet in some warm water to bring it to a head, this will help bring anything which has been left inside your foot to the top, and then you can take it out.
But I feel you more then likely got everything out so just keep an eye on it for the next couple of days , you'll be fine.

Absolutely! You may need an antibiotic. A puncture wound is the hardest wound to heal up, and it has a great potential for infection. Besides, a toothpick is wooden--and splinters may have come off in your foot. Go to the doc and get treatment before it becomes septic.

If you're sure you got it all out then I would clean it, and put neosporin and a bandaid on it and see how it is in the morning.

The way you can tell if you got it all or not, if you got it all then your foot is sore, but there's not really a stabbing pain.  If there's still something it there whenever you apply any pressure you'll get a shooting, sharp pain.

What Could Be Wrong With My Wife?



My wife right now is in Poland, last week she was sick, (normal cold sneezing stuffy nose, fever) Today she was walking to the store and out of nowhere she started having chest pains and could not take deep breaths because it hurt too much. She said that it lasted 15 mins and that was it. She went to the doctors but the nurse said that she could not be seen until Friday (Poland isn't like the United States or G.B where if someone comes in with chest pains they are seen right away).
Anyways I told her to take it easy, take some aspirin (just in case).

She is a medium smoker 1/2 pack a day, 21 years old, over all normally healthy. But she is not active as in sports. She goes for walks a couple times a week with her mother and dances on weekends with her girlfriends, but that is all the activity. Just thought it might help. She was also "not" dizzy at all. Just chest pains and shortness of breath that last 15 mins.

I would say you gave her the best advice. The other thing is she probably should stop smoking until she can be seen. Stay home and rest, and try to stay stress free until she can be seen. Tell her to try not to worry and keep her feet up as much as possible. No drinking any alcohol, liquor or caffiene just plenty of water and juice.

Perhaps bronchitis or pneumonia? Sometimes a cold can travel down the respiratory tract and cause them. It could also have been a panic or asthma attack. The doctor is probably the best thing. She should also try to limit her smoking and avoid exercise until she gets to that doctor.

It might be "wet" or "dry" pleurisy.  Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura which surrounds the lungs.  If it's "wet" that means there's fluid building up between the pleura and the lung.  If it's "dry" it means the pleura is rubbing up against the lung.  It CAN be very painful and difficult to take a deep breath and breathe; only shallow breathing is possible.  I would probably take some aspirin to help; which they also recommend during heart attacks.  If it's pleurisy ("wet" or "dry"), it's NOT life-threatening !  But she SHOULD see a doctor. . . .just to be on the safe side !

If you have chronic pain and good medical record history with all the info of your conditions, yes. Many doctors in California will, but you must find the right one. Go to Google and search for clinics that support medical marijuana in your area. I'm a 16 year old in Oregon, and yes no matter what you've heard or read, you can get your medical marijuana card as a minor (Oregon and California). Clinics are more likely to prescribe it then your normal doctor. You must also have you parents consent and bring them to your doctor visit.

I have a feeling that somehow this isn't true. Mainly because you spelled fibromyalgia perfectly, and marijuana, but not "ware"(which should be spelled "where") or "recamendation"(which should be spelled "recommendation")

BUT, if it is, yr doctor would need to prescribe it to you. Thats the only way you'd be able to get it. I wouldn't get my hopes up.

There is no evidence that marijuana benefits the symptoms of fibromyalgia.  Your best options are exercise, eating healthy, and getting enough sleep.  This should be your primary focus.  Also try to schedule your activities around how you feel, don't push yourself.  Rest periodically as you feel you need to throughout the day.  There are some new med's that have shown to help, but not for everyone.  You should be seeing a therapist, preferably one who specializes in living with chronic pain.  Holistic medicine is more likely to help you such as acupuncture, bio-feed back, also learning relaxation and breathing techniques are really helpful.  I would recommend yoga as a great way to keep your muscles stretched and limber.  It is really important that you live as healthy a lifestyle as possible and continue to do so through out your life.  You don't say if your doc has tested you for other diseases, if he/she hasn't make sure they do.  Lyme disease is often misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia as are other diseases and syndromes.  Good Luck from a fellow fibro sufferer.

I have severe fibromyalgia which is actually a nerve disorder. I am taking Lyrica which is a nerve defusser, slowing over-active nerve impulses to reduce nerve pain, it worked good for the first 6 months, then it started not helping the pain as much and and not lasting as long...my doctor (rheumatologist) said my body was becoming immuned.



When the pain becomes intolerable and causes high stress I smoke weed, even though it doesn't take the pain away, it relaxes me and lowers the stress which helps lessen and tolerate the pain. I told my doctor I smoke weed and why, he said it is bad for me but understood.
Since FM is just first being realized as a real disorder (it took 8 years before they finally diagnosed me with fm) they don't consider a person disabled (denied social security disability twice) so they would definitely "not" give a medical marijunna card to anyone with fm, especially to you since you are a minor.
So you will have to continue to get it off the the streets like I do.

I got mine done, and that never happend, it only pussed etc, like most peoples does. Many of my friends got it done and bruising has NEVER happend to any of us, it might be possible that your body is rejecting it. You might have an infection. 
Maybe you should take it out, its not worth the risk, it could end up scaring.

Good luck.

The drowsiness, and waiting game excites me. I have been taking 2-6 pills during a whole day. I'm sort of depressed now, so the pills helps me escape.

I would like to commend you on being honest about being addicted to the pills. I think however you should consult a physician about being depressed.



As to the damage of using Tylenol, it has many effects mainly the liver. Please when or if you see your physician let them know about your addiction to tylenol. So that they will be able to fairly treat you

Only to get you to the Doctor and you have nothing else...
Otherwise;
If it isn't cleaned out properly or if it is too deep then you can not use super glue.....
It is sort of a permanent thing... you'll need to clean it every 24 hrs  or  so....

don't even use superglue to hold until you get to the MD. that stuff can rip your skin apart, causing worse reaction than before. use gauze or a clean cloth to hold until bleeding stops. if anything put a band-aid over it, but if it's a deeper cut, you should get professional help. the body has certain clotting mechanisms it initiates upon the first sign of bleeding and you need to let that happen naturally. superglue definitely will not help. don't use it.

superglue was originally developed as a battlefield glue for exactly what u suggest.but only to stop/stem bleeding.closing a deep wound without proper cleansing is pretty much going to kill you from infection.you would have closed the bacteria into the wound,just where it likes to be/breed.

it depends what it was cut by, and if the wound would need cleaning. it can and has been used for that purpose. but i would close the wound with surgical tape, or a less tacky tape, if you dont have any, normal tape, de tacked by sticking it to cloathing and taking off would do.

put some tissue paper over the cut, a large amount befor you stick tape over it.

once this has been done, you should either go to a hospital, because it will require stitches, or you can go or get someone to go to boots, or a good chemist and ask for some butterfly stitches. these can then be placed over the wound once cleaned out, and there will be no need to go to hospital.

http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl...

Edit_

If the cut is bleeding and not stopping, or squirting out, you could have severed a vein, and you will have to go to hospital, it you wont even feel anythink when they stitch it up if thats what your worried about. the pain from your cut will 'drown out' and pain from the needle, which is minute since the needle is extremly thin. or they may even use sutures (dont know how to spell it) which wont require a needle.

but i reccomend going to a A&E department, rather then doing it yourself, and definatly not superglue, as you could trap air in the wound and bacteria which would cause more trouble later.

I'm in a dilemma with sleeping, help! ?



I've sleeping problems for the past 2 months due to stress from school and application for grad schools (I'm a 22yr-old female). I went to the doctor and got prescription drug for it. Now from reading and consultation, I know I have to practice good sleeping hygiene to re-set my circadian cycle. But the thing is that I have numerous essays to write and during the day I can't write for sh** b/c ideas don't come out.....until night time come. I want to go to sleep on a regular schedule but at night I just start writing and writing and won't go to bed til 12-1am (my ideal time was 10-11 b/c I have class at 8am everyday). I took the drug, drowsy as hell but still sit here and write b/c I know I won't remember it tomorrow or it won't come back. What do I do?

I assume you got Ambien or Lunesta, but it doesn't really matter. When you take it, you need to go straight to bed. Don't take it and continue working, or watching TV. It is possible to (unconsciously) fight it, and then of course the sleeping aid loses its purpose.

But as you already said, you need to reset your circadian cycle and improve your sleeping hygiene. In the long run, none of the sleeping meds work. Believe me, I have tried :|

Well a few things you could do would be to not take the drug until you are ready to sleep, also try eating 30 minutes before you are ready to sleep this takes some of the blood that is circulating in your head and moves it to assist your stomach, also try snorting or taking the drug via sublingually this puts the drug into your system faster. What is the drug by the way?

the best thing to give them is orange juice.  If they can drink.  If they are unconcious do not put anything in the mouth, you don't want them to choke.  If they are unconcious call 911 right away.  If you given them juice they should perk up.  And be sure to check their blood sugar regularly for a time after this.  All diabetics will have a blood sugar monitor to use.

did you receive proper training for lifting heavy fixtures? If you did then you don't have a leg to stand on. If you didn't then you have a case. Did they put the injury in the accident book and did you sign it? again if the injury wasn't recorded you cant do anything about it. Sorry mate. As for the lack of pay - you should have received sick pay for at least some of the time off, but this does depend on when you hurt yourself. If you work mon-fri and the accident occurred on fri, the company don't have to pay you for the 1st 3 days, they are classed as waiting days - therefore mon,tue,wed are unpaid but thurs and fri should be paid SSP. Did you supply your company with a sick note?  if you didn't then you recieve no sick pay, its just classed as time off without pay.

I would say anything between 1 and 6 days depending how effective your digestive system is.You must have an idea as to how long food takes to pass through you.As long as your bowel movements stay regular there shouldn't be a problem.When your movements become irregular it is recommended you see your Doctor and be checked.But everyone is different.If you're worried visit your Doctor.

It depends on whether your child has pain or some problem associated with a nerve exiting the spinal cord having some pressure applied - as from a spinal joint.
If symptoms are annoying or get worse in any way a surgical procedure might be used to release the tethered cord.
You do not say if your daughter has pain or any other symptom that lead to the investigations, if so I am sure her doctor will advise on analgesic that are safe for her, paracetamol, ibuprofen etc.

It works for some, not for others. The premise is that the disc is significantly protruded into the spinal canal. The disc itself is damaged and it it compressing nearby nerve tissue. The discectomy should decompress the space giving the nerves more room, eliminating the sciatica. However, you will still have an injury-related plus surgery-related damaged disc that may continue to be a source of pain.

You may have ovarian cysts or endometreosis.  Birth control that you take all throughout the year (without going on the sugar pills) can stop your period all together and help stop the pain.  Speak with your gyno about this option.

Men are not supposed to know how that feels.  But I 've been told the cramps I get are best described to a women as 'the worst ever period pain - & lasting for hours' [8 or so hours before I learned how to control it]

If the pain is very frontal and not hitting the small of your back too, then a warm hot water bottle will  most likely help quite quickly.  If the pain goes away for a while THEN you can try taking a painkiller to block the pain returning.  Any Pharmacist will probably tell you the best over the counter drug and dosage available in your area / Country.

If the pain is due to wind, then no painkiller will work particularly well.  Movement and hydration are then best.

If you take them wrongly the painkillers won't help but will cause other problems.  You should see your own Doctor for proper diagnosis and prescription.  Keep well hydrated and rest.



If you Doctor diagnoses Period Pain then you can ask how to avoid it getting so bad each month.

btw Dyhydracodeine is VERY dangerous and I found it quite ineffective compared to straight Codeine.  The delivery method & timing makes the difference.  Something like an effervescent soluble solution 8mg Codeine to 500mg Paracetamol [Co-Codamol] is often more effective than say 30 mg Codeine in tablet form.  Even though the Codeine is the more effective element for my cramps.  There are stronger versions with more Codeine, but the more Codeine you use the more chances of it becoming ineffective, and it can become addictive too.

Sounds like a soft tissue injury, these can take longer than a break to heal. If heat doesn't work try cold a packet of frozen peas will numb the area and reduce any inflammation. wrap the peas first and leave for about ten to fifteen mins. refreeze the peas to use again.

If it were a sprain or strain I think it would have healed by now. Go back to your doctor and emphasize how long your shoulder has been hurting you. If he doesn't listen then get a second opinion.

My mum had a bad shoulder and the doctor kept ignoring it. Turns out it was ligament damage and she had to have an operation. It could have been avoided if it had been diagnosed earlier.

It's really rather painless. You simply feel a warm pressure from the water and the wax will flow out, to be honest you feel a relief as the pressure is lifted from the wax build up and you can hear properly again! It takes about 5-10 minutes.

You should have been already putting olive oill/otex ear drops etc in your ears 7-10 days before they are syringed? You'll need to have done this to soften the wax. If your prone to a wax build up, it's probably a good idea you do the frequently anyways, to prevent build up in the future.

Assuming the wax has been softened prior to syringing, it is a quick and painless process. All you get is water swooshed into your ear and out comes the wax.

You really have to break up the wax first. dont keep jamming things in there hopeing to get it out.  the more you do the more compact and longer it will take for the drops/oliveoil to dislodge and breakdown the wax.

What has happened to my back?



Back in the 9th grade (7 years ago) I fell on my tailbone, playing basketball. I did it twice, I think during the same year. Ever since my back occasionally will just hurt in the lower left part, mainly. It's not a regular occurrence, probably ever few months or so.  I've had an MRI or CAT Scan (one of those) and they claim they didn't find anything. I've been to a doctor and he just told me to take Ibuprofen for muscle stiffness. But it limits my activity, I can barely bend down and when it's intense sometimes it even hurts when I'm walking. After a while it'll just go away and I'm back to 100%, but then occasionally it'll just come back after a few months or so. Anybody had this problem before, and if so were you diagnosed with any back problem or is it simply muscle stiffness?

I'm not sure, maybe you should ask a professional.  Why? are you planning on using date rape drugs on someone?  I'd be more concerned with the fact that some of these drugs can actually make you sterile, and that sometimes people use those particular drugs on purpose so they can rape a woman and not have to worry that she'll get pregnant as a result.

The drug is called flunitriazipam it has a half life of 18-26 hours so about 2 days or less until it is out of most human's systems.  It is in the same class of drugs as xanax and valium. It is the most potent of all the benzodiazepines and thus why is it illegal in the US.

possible causes could be DVT or restless legs syndrome(where you feel like you could chop the things off to relax them.they ache with an unbelivable ache and you have trouble finding a way to put them so its comfty,so you end up pacing and kneedind your legs) do you have any pain in the calf,can you pull your foot up towards you keeping your leg straight without to much discomfort?poss DVT,strained ligaments or tendons or muscles. what sort of work do you do? if it involves standing or bending the leg alot could it be wear and tear.if its causing discomfort you should ask at your gp or pharmacy for any advice.
hope this is of some small use. take care x

You'll find that if u had previously eaten supper and go to sleep without brushing ur teeth, ur breath will be even smellier.
This is because there's still some traces of food left in ur mouth and tongue.



when u sleep u keep ur mouth shut all the time and bacteria in ur mouth that may also come from the food u ate will act upon the traces of food, giving out acid/by product of some sort. They can be gas also..and these things give off unpleasant smell...

so when u get up all the collected trash-like smell is given out....

It'll help if u brush ur teeth and tongue b4 sleep =)

Because while you are asleep, the flow of saliva slows down. As a result of this oxygen levels go down and allows anaerobic bacteria to come out and play, letting off waste containing sulfur.

It is the sulfur that causes the smell.

There are a few other contributors but this is the main cause -- Anaerobic bacteria.

The following can cause bad breath:

Medications (including allergy medications) cause bad breath



Alcoholic beverages cause bad breath



Mouthwash with alcohol causes bad breath



Smoking causes bad breath



Dry mouth causes bad breath



The primary cause of morning breath or halitosis  is sulfides produced by either grain negative bacteria or in the normal breakdown and renewal of your oral mucosa or tissue. A bi-product of the bacteria is methyl mercaptan or hydrogen sulfide gases which produce these volatile sulfide compounds or VSC. VSC are also formed in the normal cellular turnover in the mouth. When tissues are inflamed or infected a concentration of bacteria is found and the normal rate of tissue regeneration is greatly increased, thus increasing the amount of VSC present leading to malodor.

The fact is that everyday common over-the-counter hygiene products, beverages an medications can be the "mysterious" cause of your bad breath. Medications and alcohol dry out the mouth, creating less saliva which leads to less oxygen in the mouth. This combination creates the perfect breeding ground for the Anaerobic Sulfur-Producing Bacteria that cause bad breath. In short simple terms, oral bacteria cause bad breath. Think of your breath in the morning, probably not top-notch. At night your mouth is at rest and drier than in waking hours, so bacteria grow. Upon waking you are greeted with "morning breath." Likewise, when you are sick and congested, possibly breathing out of your mouth, you probably noticed your breath smells. This is caused by dry mouth which creates bacteria which causes bad breath.

How do I Avoid the Bacteria That Causes Bad Breath?

Bad breath is caused by excessive bacteria in the mouth. Scientific study and clinical research on bacteria has helped experts discover why bacteria causes bad breath and how to best eliminate it. Surprisingly, those commercials and ads that tell us to pop a mint or use a mouth wash to deal with bad breath are always accurate. Infact many of the mints and washes people use to combat bad breath, actually cause bad breath or make it worse. How so? The bacteria that cause bad breath live and breed beneath the tongue's surface, on the tonsils and in the throat, not on the surface where it can be scraped or brushed off or dissolved with a wash or mint. Instead of getting rid of bad breath, many of these products contain alcohol which dries out the mouth creating a more favorable environment for these odorous bacteria to grow.

Does Food Cause Bad Breath?

You bet your garlic breadsticks they do. Certain foods like garlic and onions can cause bad breath because they contain the same compounds, previously discussed, that create bad breath. If you regularly consume these foods, it can create higher amounts of bacteria and lead to halitosis. The catch is that the Anaerobic Sulfur-Producing Bacteria that can cause bad breath are in everyone's mouth, because they are needed to assist in breaking down proteins in certain foods. Researchers are still searching for a reason why some people are prone to develop more of the beneficial bacteria, which in bulk are no longer beneficial because they cause bad breath.

The Secret to Getting Rid of Bad Breath (halitosis) is...

To truly eliminate the cause of bad breath you must eliminate the odorous bacteria by converting them to non-odorous volatile sulfur compounds. Okay, sounds complicated, right? In other words, make sure you are using the right type of bad breath eliminator to do the job for you. This cannot be done with mouthwashes or mints. These give your mouth a strong taste, which then leads you to believe if your mouth tastes "medicated" or minty, then your breath must smell good.

The site below will guide you on how to get rid of bad breath permanently:

Got hit in the head by a phone and after large bump went down, a small pea sized lump remained in its place?



I'm 16 and just over a month ago, roughly, i was hit quite hard in the head with a mobile phone. It quickly grew into a large sore lump, and after a few days had shrunk down. I noticed a small pea-sized lump in its place. The lump isn't sore, and it hasn't given me any headaches. Is this normal?

Sounds like you could have some damage to your Carpal nerve!
Go and see your GP so he can refer you for the tests. This is a problem easily solved.
Good Luck.

Sounds like it could be Carpal Tunnel Syndrome..
I'd get that checked out by a doctor.
:D Good-Luck!

Also,
Do you do a lot of repetitive motions with the hands?
ex: Typing, weaving, knitting, etc..?
