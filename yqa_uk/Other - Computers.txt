That sounds odd.  Is it possible that your PC is asking you a question once you put the CD in the drive?  My guess is that the Windows Media Player would start playing the disk even if it's asking you for a response, but I've seen stranger things before too.  Check the Windows Media Player program to see if there is an error when you put in the disk, of if it's asking you a question  like "can I connect to the internet to download the disk information.

There can be few things that are creating the problem



1. May be your disk player ( cd drive) is broken



2. May be media player software that you use for playing the cd is not able to read the format of the music file in the cd.
3. Or may be the cd is either scratched or damaged.



In case of the 1st and 3rd case you can't really do much, you have to either buy a new disk player ( cd drive ) or a new cd.



For the 2nd case though, I will recommend you to get VLC Player software. its freely available on the internet to download just Google -



" Free VLC Player download "



hope this helps

If you need real-time, bi-directional communication with your office PC then set up remote desktop, which someone in IT should be able to help you with, or you can use a 3rd party program like AnyPC. If you're just looking to transfer files, however, I'd suggest a USB Flash Drive (available in sizes ranging from 128MB to 64GB) -- they're small and portable, and fast with a throughput of 400Mb/sec over USB 2.0.

Frequently you can find these in a directory named Downloaded Programs or downloads. Different things tend to download into different places.



A great way to find some of these is by doing an advanced search. Use Search. Specify two things, a large file size and a modified date of within the past 90 days (example). If you remember that these were zipped, then search for *.zip for the past 90 days (example).



You'll then figure out which directory has these updates that you downloaded. Those are great to have when you re-install Windows.

At the top of the bar where it says AIM, Edit, View, and Help, click Edit and go to the very bottom and click Settings...



On the Left side of the pop-up, click Sounds.



Read through the options and pick your settings. Since you dont want defalt sounds, id fill in the, "Do not play any sound" circles under 'When i recieve an IM', and 'When i send an IM'.



there, no more annoying default dounds.



Hope this helps:)

How do I get Comcast to stop making excuses and give me the full 16mb connection i pay for.?



The past 6 months the highest I get steady is 4mb when I'm paying for 16mb. I have gone through trouble shooting and determined it to be on their end. I have replaced my ethernet card, modem , wires going to the house from the splitter, 3 splitters, placed a filter on the line, deleted internet history, cache, cookies, defragmented , ran an anti-spyware and anti-virus checked for packet loss, signal strength and power cycled all of my equipment and still after 6 months I have never been able to get 16mb on a steady basis although I had 11mb spikes from time to time.

File a complaint w/ the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
http://esupport.fcc.gov/complaints.htm



If it turns out the FCC isn't helpful with their response or findings, at least you will have learned what Comcast is obligated to do.  And maybe with the filing of a complaint in itself will make Comcast WANT to improve your service, as it is nowadays with the economy so troubled - all companies should improve upon services (even if it's just customer service) and take all complaints seriously as they could go under easily in comparison to a normal economy with the same complaints.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



well honestly i wish there was a better way but after doing research of my own i have learned that the FCC is heavily involved in this because many people are reporting Comcast and they are being forced by the FCC to stop throttling peoples bandwidth by the end of the year "or else"

You cannot use HTTP to access the image on your hard drive.



HTTP is a protocol used to access files over the World Wide Web. Unless your computer is running a Web server (and it probably is not) it is not part of the World Wide Web (even if it was there would be other problems I won't go into here).



The only way PayPal can access your image over HTTP is if it is stored on a Web server. Therefore, I suggest you sign up for a free Web hosting account somewhere. As you already have a Yahoo account, Yahoo Geocities (at http://geocities.yahoo.com/) is as good as any other for this purpose.



You will need to upload your image to your web space. Then make a note of the image's location and construct the HTTP URL to your image (the http:// you are looking for) so you can provide that to PayPal.



Any difficulty with setting up a web hosting account or uploading files, constructing URLs etc. just ask again.



Best wishes!

You need to upload the image. Go to http://tinypic.com/ (which is just one of the many sites you can host images on, but you don't need to register for this one), click browse, find the image you want to upload and click Upload Now. Tinypic will then give you an http:// URL for the image, which you can use anywhere.

HUH? An image on your hard drive doesnt have an http address in the first place. An http address is an adress of a website.  Now sit down and explain in simple form to us what you are trying to do without all the technical computer terms you think you know.

You're going to need to have a DVD burner and sometimes a special program to get the movie in the right format for burning.  Theoretically though, the only thing you would need is a DVD burner, a DVD, and a program to do the burning for you.



Before you run out and buy a DVD burner, check to see if your current CD drive actually has DVD burning capabilities.  Newer computers either come with one or are easily upgradable for 10-20 dollars.

ENIAC was the first general purpose electronic computer. It was built (not discovered) during the 1940's and turned on in 1947



ENIAC was conceived and designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University of Pennsylvania. The team of design engineers assisting the development included Bob Shaw (function tables), Chuan Chu (divider/square-rooter), Kite Sharpless (master programmer), Arthur Burks (multiplier), Harry Huskey (reader/printer), Jack Davis (accumulators) and Iredell Eachus Jr.

How do I get my lap top out of safe mode?



The HP Pavilion dv9000 I own has a mind of its own . It had refused access to the trend micro internet protection. And now it refuses to let me do anything to get out of safe mode. It is stuck with the wrong resolution, I can access the place in properties to change the text and icons back to small, but even that screen is wrong and does not work. The help menu has come up to give me lots of advice that my pc simply will not let me try. It suggested system restore, but the click on to open restore does not work. So I typed system restore in the search box. I was told once the program came up NO. sorry no access or some dern thing. So I shut off the lap top and got my recovery disks out. Set a date to restore to and it seemed to work as it had last time. It even told me it was completely successful. But then when rebooted the thing is still in safe mode with everything too big.  Oh when Trend Micro vanished I downloaded Avast. I do not know what to think of it either. The windows firewall says it is down but refuses to accept anything I do to try to change that. Safe mode started itself after I found the trend micro and clicked "fix it now". It got locked or stuck while I was out to dinner. So I rebooted to find myself stuck in this dark un fun safe mode. Thank goodness it let me go on line to ask for help.



What do I do? Please don't  be mean.. I already know I am clueless. Thanks Pixell

You had the right track by inserting Your system discs and rebooting, if at all possible You should try to get a full version D ofthe Windows version You have, and useIT in the drive when You reboot.



Although Your restore discs will allow You to do a recovery, they won;t provide Your system with the necessary drivers files if ou should have a drive error or virus delte the hardware necessities.



Using the full version disc will allow Your hardware to reinstall any necessary files that may have been destroyed from pre-set locations on the actual MS disc set.

If you have a laptop, there is most likely a small nutton on the slot were the disc goes in and comes out. If you have a regular computer, your computer may have a button somewhere on the keyborad, with a arrow inside of a box, if so, press that. If not, open your computers help and support, and type in ''cd drive''. If all else fails, look in your manual for help, and there may be a number to contact If you have problems. I had problems with that before, and I had to call the contact number to see how to open it. [Sometimes technology is more advanced then us :) ] I hope can be of help.

Usually you can go into My Computer and right click the drive.  From there go to eject, and it should open.



If that doesn't work, you could always get a paperclip, unfold it, and stick it in the little hole by the disk drive to force it open (not recommended, use only as a last resort)

Where does yahoo store all my emails?



i was just wondering, where do they keep them? Is there some sort of yahoo headquarters with everyone's files on one giant computer, or what? They must put them somewhere, how can they continuously hold ALL of that information from ALL of the users?



P.S.....what does a server do? My school has one and it keeps the computers running, i was wondering what it actually does....? Does it supply energy to the computers, or what?



And when we use the mobil lab (it hardly ever works), we always have to be close to the base where they came out of.....what's that about? Why won't they work out of the room, or anywhere away from the cart?



I may sound stupid not knowing this stuff, but i really want to know.....please answer to the best of your ability. thankyou! :)

Your modem, and yes.  Is there just that one box or do you have another hooked up to it?  I would just try unplugging it for about ten seconds or so and restarting your computer.  You may need to call your ISP if that doesn't work.

Did the Ethernet cable come unplugged from your router or modem or is the connection to your router, modem, or computer lose?



I would suggest that you check to make sure that everything is connected properly.



If everything's connected properly, perhaps you should try resetting your router by unplugging it for about fifteen seconds or so and then plugging it back in.



Good luck and I hope I helped you!

You can do that with Audacity. In the drop-down menu on Audacity's mixer toolbar, choose “Wave Out” or “Stereo Mix” as the input source. (The exact name may be different, depending on your computer's sound drivers.) When you press the Record button, Audacity will capture whatever sound is playing on your computer's speakers.



Audacity is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds. It is available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and other operating systems.

The step by step process is already written down.  It is called the instruction manual that came with the device.



This forum is not designed to rewrite a manual - there just is not enough space in the forum for this and it would take days to compile it.  Further, there is absolutely no valid reason for anyone to rewrite a manual that already exists.



If you have problems with a specific section of the manual after sincere effort on your part, then write to this fourm with the specific question and include exactly what you did thus far.



However, do not expect anyone to rewrite a manual for you.

None of the decrypting software will be necessary to make a legal copy of a non-copy-protected disk.  Note that use or possession of software that bypasses copy protection is a violation of the DMCA.



So, assuming that we are not breaking the law, you simply copy the data files from the disk to a directory or folder on your computer then use your favorite burning software to burn a UDF format disk from the data.  If this does not work, then the data is probably encrypted and nobody here will tell you how to break the law.

the speed depends on ur internet connection....if ur using wireless from a university or stuff like that it  probably is going to be slow as many people are using the wireless which makes the speed slower..but if its ur own at home..it depends on the speed u subscribed for ur internet connection....



i have used utorent before and it is slower than ares (another downloading software) so try using ares...so go to www.filehippo.com and search for ares to download..

as im having a wimax connection, ares would do the trick, but still its slow and slower than uTorrent. What should i do in this case? wanted to download X files movie and it has enough seeds and im using a 512kbps connection.

In my experience the single biggest obstacle to lightening fast torrent downloads is a blocked port.  But its easily fixed.



The best and easiest way is called Port Forwarding.  This is an alternative to simply opening up a port on your system (a port which may be blocked further up your network, by your ISP - your unblocking it is a little like leaving your wallet overningt in a bank vault.  Sure, it's out in the open, but it's still in a bank vault, so it won't get stolen.)



You need to get the data through a different port, one that your ISP doesn't pay attention to, and then reroute it after it crosses over the "bank vault" door back to its proper place.



There are too many different scenarios involved with the actual process based on your actual hardware.  But portforward.com will walk you through it with guides for every brand of router.  The whole process should take about 2 minutes to read, figure out, and do.



Now other seeds can see you, whereas you were invisible to many before the port forwarding.  When I first did this my speed on Dimeadozen was generally triple what it was before.

If you're going straight through wimax and there's no router in between, all ports should be open for utorrent. Otherwise, the provider is blocking them and there's no way to unblock them.

Usually file extensions is not your job to choose. Extensions are being set by the program that created the file. For example doc is the extension for MS Word files, exe is the extension of executables...



If you want to create your own file (or filetype) you should first check at http://www.file-extensions.org/ to see what extensions are used by what programs, and make your choice...

Ebay cheaters...Second chance offers?



Recently I have had two 'second chance offers' on ebay. So, I have bidded on an item, and someone has outbid me, so I maybe bid a couple more times, and then give up when I'm outbid a last time. Then, I get a 'second chance offer' almost immediately after the auction ends with a message asking if I would like to buy it at my highest offer. It has left me wondering if anyone is actually bidding against me except the seller on another account! Could this happen?



Thanks

People bidding on another account is possible but illegal on Ebay.  The main issue might be that if a person bids on different accounts with the same ip address then they are caught.  But if he/she has a way around this then he/she might get his/her way.



If you think your final offer is a reasonable price go for it, there's no harm in getting something you where willing to pay.  If i was you I would check other similar items and their winning bid to compare what you'll end up paying.



Sometimes the seller has more than one item and will settle for less than the actual winning bid. And thus is willing to offer it to you.  Other times the winner will back off from the deal and he'll offer it to you.
You could check if he left some negative feedback on the person who won the auction before you accept the deal or if some negative feedback was left on him. Either way I'd be careful if I were you.  The seller might not be necessarily cheating but there's no way you can really tell.

I know what you are talking about, Im that type of person, will wait till the last minute, and would bid and bid until the time is up bt



ebay has this system now, called automatic bidding



This is how How automatic bidding works:



When you place a bid, you enter the maximum amount you're willing to pay for the item. The seller and other bidders don’t know your maximum bid.



We’ll place bids on your behalf using the automatic bid increment amount, which is based on the current high bid. We'll bid only as much as necessary to make sure that you remain the high bidder, or to meet the reserve price, up to your maximum amount.



If another bidder places the same maximum bid or higher, we’ll notify you so you can place another bid. Your maximum bid is kept confidential until it is exceeded by another bidder.

Adobe Flash Player?



?



I've been trying to download the latest version of flash player but whenever I try to download it it says failed to install. I've ran the uninstall package to get rid of the old version but have realised that in C:/WINDOWS/system32/macromed there is a folder called flash. Inside this folder is something called Adobe Flash Player Helper 9.0, as well as 2 text documents, one called install and the other called set up information. Should this have been deleted when I unistalled the old version? I've tried deleting it myself but it says it cannot be deleted:access is denied. How can I delete it? Could this be what's stopping me downloading the new version?

I know its quite nice with with a bit of an out dated processor, but im happy with it... i use winxp professional on it and.... ITS VERY STRANGE.... normally it works just fine but like if i have an application crash on me and i had to do an improper restart or if i accidently do an improper shutdown... it boots into WIN XP PRO DEAD SLOW, and then WINXP runs DEAD SLOW till i restart.... once i restart my pc.. problem is fixed... what do you guys think is causing this behavior? o: oh i also have a quadruple boot setup with Vista, Win 2003, and Ubuntu Linux  &gt;:]

Is your 1 TB Hard disk a single physical hard disk ? How much cache does it has ?



I think it is a problem with the file system. And since 1 TB hard disks are like the latest and cutting edge technology product i think they are not very well tested. Also, did you really formatted your hard disk after you bought it ? Ya i know, formatting a 1 TB hard disk is a pain in itself, takes hours. Mine is 500 GB  ;-(



You better do a proper disk checking of your system drive. Disk checking all the other drives would be a good idea too, if only you have so much of patience..

You may obtain the files electronically via ftp from the following Internet address:

That would be it. There is no other way. Your choices are Bootcamp, VMware or Parallels. Bootcamp means that you boot up in Windows with all the drivers etc or you boot up as OS X.

VMware or Parallels mean that you are running a virtual environment of Windows with all associated drivers while running OS X. For gaming your best choice would be VMware as it does the DirectX9 drivers the best.

Out of a choice between Bootcamp or VMware I would go for VMware for convienence of running 2 OSes together rather than just one at a time.

They are both pretty easy to set up.

i don't own a mac but ill try to help.

there is the option of a virtual pc. this option will require a pc hardware acceleration capable VM. goto
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_...
to compare VMs to find whats right for you. This will be slower than a dual boot option

as macs now are based on Unix WINE may also be an option(im even less sure on that). if it is possible you will need to deal with its dependencies and this will not be easy, and will not work on the newest games.

i'm sorry to say if these two option wont work for you than a dual boot may be your only option. GL with your gaming.

you can email me if your looking for more details.

Need to know what operating system you have:

If its vista (a legit version) then the SP1 you have installed is the beta version which has an expiry date (alot of oem pcs had the beta version installed). You need to uninstall SP1 and reinstall the proper rtm version, that should stop the message :)

Clicking on audio or video links that open up WMP also begin file download as if I hit "Save target As". Why?



Not a huge problem, except if the file download completes before the video or audio file is done playing, it stops playing and the "Windows media player cannot find the file..." error pops up.  Basically when I just want to click to open a file, I have to stop the file download (very quickly for small audio files) in order for the file to play completely.  Any idea why this is?  The download is directed to "Temporary Folder" if that assists in the diagnosis.

Well the reason your computer is so slow is cause of your crappy virus protection. You're onw of the many who has so many problems and posts questions here with computer problems while running a free antivirus. Get a better antivirus like Bitdefender.

http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html

Use IE and go to the page, it's a free scan and virus removal. You will want to pay for it tho to get better protection instead of just using the online version.

BitDefender and AVG have the same low level of vulnerabilities revealed at this URL: http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1445

So the notion that AVG is the cause of your computer's lethargy is not likely, and switching to BitDefender is not likely to make any difference whatsoever.

Kaaspersky has the fourth highest level of vulnerability out of the ten anti-virus software packages that are compared in the chart at http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1445

What changes have you allowed System Mechanic to make to your computer?

Do you use anti-spyware and anti-adware?

Are you behind a firewall?

Have you looked at the the logs in the Windows Event Viewer to see whether there are problems that have been identified and marked in the Windows logs?

Your player might be installed but of the wrong version, or the site might have a faulty flash detector!!!

Go to Adobe, they will tell you which version you have:
http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewCont...

If it is wrong, then you might just uninstall and download again to reinstall:
http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewCont...

Alternatively, try another browser, (you can not fix the website, but it might work with another browser). Download and
install Firefox (you will probably have to install fash after).
http://getfirefox.com

Finally, ask a friend to see if the site works on their computer.

Yes ! you might be having an older Version of Flash player and 
Microsoft IExplorer is saying you to install Flash player bcozz. 
there is an updated version of Flash player.

Why don't Install Flash player. Then see, if same error occurs, it might
be due to virus in your system, or due to 
that YOU'RE NOT SHUT-DOWNING THE SYSTEM PROPER WAY.

Remember, remind of that day, when u installed Flash player.

Did you Properly shut-down Windows ??? Think again



Now do one thing. AGAIN Install Flash player. Shut-down properly.
And Re-start.

Hope it works !

That would depend on what you are best at doing and what you enjoy doing the most.
If you love what you do and decide to specialise in it  you will be paid accordingly.
There is no single job that earns the most compared to another job. It you like operating system archecture (like Bill Gates*)  then you can end up earning around 250k a year or more with 4-5 years of experience, but you can also earn big bucks as a systems engineer or as an IT manager...it just depends on where you prefer to be.

*Bill Gates got rich because of his shares in Microsoft. His actuall salary was around $1 million a year.
Steve Jobs's salary is only $1 a year - he is worth about $5 billion US because of his interest in Pixar.

Many of the designers and developers at Apple are not the highest paid people in the industry but they love what they do and they create great gadgets and wouldn't want to work anywhere else.

Many of Microsoft's employees are very well paid - they produced Vista after 5 years of trying and NOBODY wants it. They also produced the Zune and no one wants that either. The best thing MS ever produced was Office and most people use it because they are familiar with it.

<answer>



Most of flash videos on Internet are written with query strings(?videoId=xxxx)... The Flash player needs this string to complete some link or some script that works with a relative path. If you store the page on your computer but don't have the same path and directories the flash will not work offline. 
An example:
"swf/videos/viedeoID.swf" If you use this path on internet explorer it'll try to get:
C:/swf/videos/videoID.swf", and as you dont have this directory and the file on your computer it won't work. But if you open it online it'll probably get: "http://site.site.com/swf/videos/videoID... a path that exists, so the flash movie will be played.

So you have to store the flash/movie FILE on you computer and create the same relative path...

HOPE IT HELPS...

I think system restore is not responsible for the loss of data. But now only thing you can do is run a good system recovery software, some of the pics can be recovered or BEST thing , go for  data recovery but i will be costly.

To the best of my knowledge System Restore doesn't mess with the files that are present on your computer. It just restores your pc to the conditions and settings back to how it was on the specified checkpoint.

On the left hand side there should be a column of all of the slides in the presentation. Simply right-click one, click copy, open the other PPT, right-click between the slides you want to insert this one, and click paste!

How do I keep my computer from going to the sign-in screen when idle?



I have windows vista if that helps anything.

When I go to class, I want to leave my laptop on so people can leave messages via aim.  Yet every time I come back to my room, my laptop has went to the sign-in screen and when i sign-in into the computer again,  my aim is no longer signed-in.

I hope sign-in screen  is the right term haha. maybe it's like user account or administrator sign-in? instead of sign-in screen lol

SP3 has a few more security updates for your computer, there is really not a big difference in it but that. If you guys like customizing your computer a lot I do not recommend that you install SP3 because it limits the customization of your computer, also I realized that my computer ran very slow after installing SP3, so I do not recommend installing SP3.

Service Pack 3 is a conglomeration of all of the Security (and other) updates from between Service Pack 2 and now. I would definitely recommend installing it as it will help keep your computer secure.



Make sure that the hard drive is well defragmented and also DO NOT have any applications running during the update process otherwise it could mess things up.



Just in case, make sure to have all of your important data backed up in case the update fails, and your Windows gets corrupted.

Do you know all the updates you received for your system, usually a service pack is a roll-up of all the previous bug or security fixes plus some enhancements.

I suggest updated to SP3 as there are security/bug fixes as well as some enhancements for your system.  Most of the fixes/enhancements are under the covers, so you will likely not see any difference in the user interface.

I would recommend that if you are downloading A LOT of videos and episodes, 120GB is too small. Get at least 250 and preferably 500GB. Also, if you are buying a computer that runs Windows Vista, try to get one with at least 2GB of RAM.

HDD is a good size and is easily upgradable.
consider getting 2gb ram if you process a lot of high quality photos, this will make tasks faster.



also check out the processor. try get a duo-core processor, u can choose either intel or AMD. both good brands. I personally prefer AMD, less crashes. 
If you are going to be doing photo editing, u may want a better video card, perhaps something by Nvidia, don't let the salesman sell u a top of the line one unless u intend to do some hardcore gaming..u dont need it. 
there are a lot of systems out there and a lot of options..go with ur gut!

That should be ok & if you do run out of room you can always get an external hard drive which I recommend doing anyway to back up important files.That way if your main HD craps out you still have your stuff.
That is where I keep all my music,movies,pics & I even install my PC video games on it.If you get one big enough you can back up your whole main HD on it. ;)

You didn't mentioned your budget, all you need is a handsome HDD at least 320, 400, 500 GB. it's not a big deal at all these days. And try to minimize the use of Limewire ( I know what you do because i also do the same) because it easily invites deadly viruses that are not even detected by updated anti-virus.

Bacis dsl connection is about 1.5 mb/s. Next level up is 3. (Depending on provider of course). Cable usually starts around three but is commonly around 6 mb/s. A typical web page is about .5 mb (megabytes) nowadays with all the animations and such, so even a bigger 2 mb page will take less than a second to load. If you're just searching the web, checking e-mails, and watching regular definition videos online (youtube, hulu, etc.), then you're perfectly fine with 2.2 mb/s. Find out what you are paying for though. Look at your bill from your internet provider and go to their site and see how much mb/s you are supposed to get. If it is 6, then call their customer service and they can do a speed check for you. They should also point you to a reliable speed test site like speedtest.net to see what you get.

(yeah I know it's megabits and not megabytes. this is just for simplicity sake)

The best program to use would be Adobe Photoshop and Opacity/Alpha the images slightly so you get the overlap area correct.



Create a New Image that is a little larger than all your 5 images together (you can make it smaller later - canvas size or crop) copy and paste your images as new layers into the image and move them into the correct order - give them names 1 to 5 or something like that.

Change the Alpha on the second image and overlay it on the first trying to get the image as close as possible - may require you to edit some colour or parts slightly. When your happy with this change the Opactity/Alpha to 100% you can merge that layer down or lock it. Next do layer 3 and repeat.

If you need some help or would like me to do it for you. Just let me know.

VLC is really the answer to your question! if the file is already on your computer and it will not play in any Other Media player VLC will work.  once you have VLC installed go to your file and click open with...VLC Double click to expand and minimize the screen and it will play your videos. i have vista priemum and was having troubla with a video file that i downladed from Ares...VLC worked grate, so well infact that i just deleated Microsoft meidea player all togather and only use VLC now.  i had an Erickson...hated that phone by the way the keys broke in a week.

You're boring me now, Maureen.



Like I said last time, go to the site I linked to (www.videolan.org &gt; Downloads &gt; Download)

Once you've downloaded the file, double click it and follow the install instructions. Once it's installed either double click the new desktop icon to open it. The select File &gt; Open and navigate to your videos. OR right click your video files and go to 'Open &gt; Open with VLC Player'.

I hope this is clear enough.

They can if they have some pretty simple software installed, and if you want it erased from the server you need to access the server, with the admin password and manually clear it.

Yes they can...if they are good enough and you have given them a reason to look into your computer. I have no idea how you can erase anything from the company server. Best advice I can give you is to only work on your work computer...I had an issue with this at a previous job. Good luck!

Well, they can definitely get the detail about the sites you browsed. But, the mails, they can see it only if the mail server is hosted in your company itself or if they reset your official mail account password.

To find out what you write in other web mails (yahoo, gmail, hotmail, etc.) I don't think any company would do that by installing a spy-ware in your system because the spy-ware will record all the keystrokes (this includes your internet banking passwords and stuff) and store it or mail it to the Systems Administrator.

Unfortunately, you cannot erase the history from the server and the Systems Administrator himself cannot erase a particular log entry about a website or a user.

Yes most IT depts are obliged to track where the companies employees surf during work hours since you ARE surfing on COMPANY time and COMPANY hardware and not your own.

The only way you can erase your history from the IT dept server is to get the IT admin password....good luck with that...ha ha.

Press f8 justr before the pc starts loading. This will bring up a lot of options. Try booting with last good know configuration. It should start your computer up to the last time it worked.

yeah, try the F8 solution. If that doesnt work, you should be able to boot up in safe mode. Then do a virus scan. That might fix the problem.
