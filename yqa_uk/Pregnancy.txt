Is it possible that I lost my mucus plug? 6 weeks pregnant?



Just went to the loo and saw brown stringy, mucus looking stuff on the loo roll (Sorry, TMI but I wouldn't normally bother looking if it wasn't for browna dn pink discharge th last couple of days)



Is it possible this is my mucus plug? Or part of it?



If so, will the preganncy still go to term? I have an emergency scan booked for tomorrow because of the discharge.



Trying to relax as I know I'm making things worse, but everytime I try things like this happen!

Hmmm...it sounds like old blood especially if it's been going on the last couple days. . Don't fret too much about this and you will find out at the scan tomorrow. It's not your mucous plug.  It could be a lost pregnancy but hopefully not.

i had that a lot in the beginning.  it was caused by sex, because when you are pregnant your cervix is so sensitive that it bleeds so easy, so it was old blood coming out.  it could also be implantation bleeding. that happens too.  i know exactly what youre going through.. i worried every minute in the beginning of my pregnancy... i freaked out over every little thing and called my doctor like twice a week.  but it is better to be safe than sorry so oh well... i think you are okay, and congratulations on your pregnancy.

Hi



This does not sound like your mucus plug as this happens close to labor. I would suggest that it is from implantation bleeding, but any bleeding or strange discharge should be reported to your midwife/doctor straight away. Im sure all will be ok as it is not bright red blood, but better to get it checked out to be safe. Good luck with your pregnancy and congratulations! xx

It's not the mucus plug. I had similar discharge. It's just dried blood mixed with mucus. Don't worry and stay positive !



I'm in a worst situation. I had a previous miscarriage. Now i'm 13 weeks pregnant but been bleeding on and off due to my low lying placenta.



As long as there is no painful cramps and bleeding you don't have to worry too much. GOOD LUCK!

I too have been feeling movement and I don't think it's too early.  Most first timers feel their baby move for the first time around week 16 or so.  From everything I've read we will feel the baby move earlier this time because we know what to feel for.  So it's not that the baby is really moving earlier we just know what to look for.

you feel the movement much quicker with subsequent pregnancies than with your first.  this said, u r feeling baby quite early, this may have just been the position they were in, so dont worry about not feeling anything since, they have prob moved to get more comfy lol

Your first trimester will be over in a few weeks and you will slowly start to feel better.  Try not to let your emotions get the better of you.  You know that it is hormones and not how you are really supposed to feel.  Try taking a bath right before bed to relax you.

The emotional part is probably based on hormones.  Men need time to adjust to this new part of their lives.  You are embracing it, they are still wraping their minds around the changes that are going to happen.  We all know men are different, that's a given.  There is someone inside you who not only wants you, but NEEDS you.  You will have a special bond with this person for the rest of your entire life.  Focus on that and everything else will come together in good time.  CONGRATULATIONS!

Hi my wife and I had a darling baby girl just last week. I should say that although I tried my best to 'be there ' forr my wife the emotions and feelings she was going through actually made her feel other wise.



She was doing exactly the same thing youre suggesting...she was closing the doors to others and feeling unwanted.

Then just stay at home.  He'll start coming over soon enough.  But, don't let your hormones get the better of you.  Getting angry all the time is only going to push him away.  Just say, "I can't fit in your bed and I don't like sharing a room with your brother.  I'm going to stay at home.  You can join me or not."  Leave it at that.

No offence, but you two sound like your not really right for each other by this question.



Your partner dosen't seem like the kind of person to want to settle down and take care of you now you're pregnant. It sounds like he's actually trying to keep his distance. You should really sit him down and talk this through, he needs to understand that you need him now more then ever and not being in the same house is just not going to do it.

That sounds pretty distressing - I'm his age, 23, and I can't imagine life sharing a room with my brother and my pregnant girlfriend.



Still, pregnancy's a big thing to accept, and he probably needs time to come around. You need support, of course, but perhaps if you try to talk to your parents or friends for a while he might get a chance to think about it and realise he's being unreasonable. Perhaps suggest that you feel a little exhausted and want a few days of peace and quiet at your place, and perhaps he could find some apartments on the internet for both of you to look at.



Just remember that he's under pressure too, and I'm sure he'll come round and be there for you if it eases up a little.

you are pregnant now and things seem really uncomfortable you need to feel safe when your around your partner and he needs to make sure of this, however at the moment things seem really hectic, tell him that your parents wouldnt mind him sleeping over, theres a double bed and so on. hope things work you good luck

i have had the same thing, talk to him and make sure he understands that you dont like staying at his. Its uncomfortable as it is without having to sleep in a single bed.



With regards to the understnding thing, he wont understand at all honey, my fella just thinks im a moody cow, and just agrees with everything i say which makes me even more irate. All you can do is explain your feelings to him and mak ehim understand that you need some emotional help from him and would like to sleep with him in comfort.

I am sure he feels more comfortable at his home, as I am sure you are more comfortable at yours.Maybee you could work out a plan and stay at your parents 4 days and his 3 days of the week(let him pick the days)  may be that will help. Tell him that you are pregnant and if he cared about your feelings,he would compromise with you. Tell him that you do not want him to be uncomfortable either, however you are caring for the baby and need space.tell him it ais a very emotional time for you and you need his help(Guys love to be needed)  It may not hurt to say that you like the extra room (Double Bed)and privacy because you crave him sexually and want to do the wild thing without his brother in the room( This will get him to see things your way) Don't get mad get creative...

You could be pregnant if there was a rip/tear in the condom, or if it was used incorrectly.  Wait another week and if you don't have what you consider your normal period, try a home pregnancy test.  Good luck!  Try not to stress about it too much, that'll make it worse.

Pulling out isn't 100% effective. But nothing is other than abstinence. If you are having any bleeding at all, then you shouldn't be pregnant. Although some women do tend to bleed, it isn't that common. A simple pregnancy test can tell you everything you need to know.

if you have your period at all, it is official that you are not pregnant. when you're pregnant, you dont get another egg release, which is why you bleed because its the lining of your womb that is readying for pregnancy. it comes out because the egg wasn't fertilised. if it was and you were pregnant, you wouldn't have your period whatsoever.

i dont think you are pregnant. you guys used condoms.



sometimes you might bleed but its not your period, just because you had started having sex and bleed from the intercourse.
if it hurts, maybe you should consult a doctor.
if it doesn't hurt, it might be the real period.
it can also be affected by your diet. sometimes things like pickled tea leaves can make your period late or little by manipulating the hormone levels. you can make sure by getting a pregnancy test.

Don't listen to the people judging you honey. They don't know your circumstances.



It is free on the NHS, but often anything from 2 - 4 week wait from the first time you see your doctor... so if you are 8 weeks gone or more....



Speak with your GP; there's lots of support and advice available to help you come to a decision. You don't have to make it alone.



Good luck - and I hope you have someone who can support you whatever your decision. x

Don't listen to the people judging you. I to had an abortion once and it cost me 300 dollars to get it done. First on your consoltation they check to see how far along you are and give you your options. They schedule you an appointment and just show up on the day of the procedure. They give you a shot and you just feel alot of pressure on your stomach. I know my decision was the best decision for me because at the time I was way too young and was not capable of being a mom yet. So it's your decision of whether or not you should get an abortion or not. Just know that there are options you can choose, but whatever option you do choose you know I am on your side and I am sure there are others to who won't judge you.

I'm sure it can be done for free.



But guess what else is free?  You giving up your baby to an adoption agency, or leaving your baby at a hospital, police station, or fire department after birth.



So, they can both be free.  With abortion, you will most likely regret it for the rest of your life.  With adoption, SOMEONE will give your baby a chance at life, and you could even be a part of that life if you chose to.



Good luck and I really hope you give the baby a chance.  It is not the baby's fault it was conceived, so he/she should not have to die for something he/she did not do!



EDIT:  Yes Lola, here in the United States it's called the Safe Haven Law.  Any baby can be brought to a hospital, police station, or fire department within 72 hours of birth, no questions asked, and they will give the baby to a proper government agency for adoption.  So, yes, I am "for real", just like that baby in her tummy is "for real" and deserves to be treated as such!

The fertalized egg, that anna refers to, is no less a human being than she is. It has arms, legs, the profile of a human being, and soon it will even begin to go finger nails, small little hairs on it's body, and will even hear feel and see. Now I am not saying that you have the keep the baby. We all have different circomstances when we get pragnent, some of them not even under our own control (rape) but, no matter what, there is a family somewhere who wants a baby, and the pain and inconvinience that you go threw during your pragnancy/labor is temporary, the guilt of an abortion, WILL last forever!

Talk to your doctor and just do what's best for you. Most of the idiots saying nasty things care more about fertilised eggs than living people, as they don't care about children once they are born into a bad situation. They go on about religion, but don't remember the parts where it says god hates hypocrites the most. I don't think I could live with myself to tell a person to have a child and make a woman feel bad about doing what's best, and the child doesn't have a good life while I'm out enjoying myself. My friend is adopted and it has affected her all her life knowing her parents abandoned her and her adoptive parents don't treat her as equal to their natural children. I don't think I could have a child and then just dump it so it feels abandoned all its life.



They obviously care nothing about living people if they're going to make a woman feel bad all her life by calling her a murderer if she's in a bad situation. They would only care about your feelings if you weren't born as living people mean nothing to them. They only say those things to make themselves look good.



Just do what you feel is best and your doctor can help you.

Normally you can get it done quite easily on the NHS but you have to wait a little longer e.g. up to a couple of weeks for the op.



If you do go privately you can have it done almost straight away and it will cost around £50 for the consultation and £200 for the operation.

It doesn't matter because its murder! Check out this site and you'll see at 8 weeks your baby has arms , legs and heart beat. It even has the beginnings of a nerve system! Get educated then make your decision! I hope you choose life! There is always adoption!



P.S. Everyone always says its your choice but have you ever thought that the baby has no choice! How fare is that? Not at all!

no you do not count a miscarriage as a period.



did you speak to your doctor about when it's safe to try and conceive again. getting pregnant too soon can really up your odds of another miscarriage and you should always wait to try until after you've had at least one full cycle because you want to make sure all the materials passed or else you could end up with a wicked infection.



because you haven't had a period yet i'm not sure what the symptoms mean because they could mean preg or period. wait a bit and take a test.

Firstly you should have been advised to wait at least 3 months before trying to conceive again. As it will be hard to pin point when your last period was as you cant use the miscarriage as a guide. But sit back and wait a week to see if you do have a period, as most pregnant women have period like cramping etc when the period is due during pregnancy.



I hope this helps

There are certain pregnancy tests the claim to give accurate result up to a week before a missed period, but I don't trust them.  I'm a big fan of EPT tests.  You can get pretty accurate results 1 day after a missed period.  It's hard to say what you are experiencing right now.



My first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.  My doctor advised me to wait a month before actively trying to get pregnant again.  Which I did.  But then the following month a did get pregnant again and this time it was a healthy pregnancy and now I have a 19 month old healthy boy.  Hang in there.  It'll happen for you.

I had a miscarriage well an Ectopic pregnancy that was in my left tube and caused a ton of pain then bleeding I would get that checked out.  I would suggest taking a test in a few weeks because you may still have pregnancy hormones in your body from the miscarriage.  Good luck I would check with your Doctor an Ectopic pregnancy can be very dangerous for the mother.

The reason the doctor has you wait three months before trying to conceive again is that it gives your body time to get back on a normal cycle, the chances of carrying are higher, and it gives your body time to return to normal after being pregnant.
I had two miscarriages and now have a beautiful 20 month old girl.  We had another miscarriage after that but am now 5 months pregnant.
This all took place over five years so try to be patient....I know it is hard.  After our second miscarriage, I had genetic testing done on me to see if there was a problem on my side.  We were going to test my husband next however the small problem was on my side and was easily fixed.

Most women can notice a light coloring of the nipples in the first trimester along with the breast tenderness. Women and pregnancies are different though. It could be a light change that you may not notice or it could be dramatic, but if you are concerned with it, it should go back to normal after having the baby.

Why do I have to have prenatal care?



I know there are diseases and std's out there, but woman have been giving birth for thousands of years without any medical care. I know we are spoiled today with doctors and luxury hospitals, but if I choose not to have prenatal care, would I be judged? I am a married woman, and I am fully healthy, and I choose not to pay some quack to tell me if I'm having a boy or a girl. And I don't want to be told what I can and Can't eat. I don't want to be told what activities I can and can't take part in. It's womanly instinct. Why do I need some jerk off telling me what to do with my baby and my body?



</question>



<additional details>



How would it be selfish? I had NO prenatal care with my first, but she came out perfect. Now Xalia is a perfect healthy three year old.



About the diseases,... NO ****. I know about this, but weren't there diseases YEARS ago? And not ALL of the children born were defected, and 90% of them survived. Or else how do we have so many damn people on this earth? The only thing I did with my first was take those Wal*Mart prenatal vitamins. Even if I didn't, I'm healthy, all of my shots are up to date, so I'm not worried about my second coming out looking like Quasimodo.

Well there is an infection out there called the Strep B and if you have it and pass it on to your baby he could die from it. Also gestational diabetes and jaundice( wich jaundice can damage the brain). And to make sure you are healthy enough to carry to full term. Yeah, thousands of women gave birth without prenatal care, but how many of them died because of breeched babies and complications. Or there babies died. I think that I would rather go to the doctor and make sure that I was giving my baby the best chance of surviving possible. And its not that bad. And you can tell them that you don't want to know the sex of your baby. But its your choice and you'll be the one to live with the consequences.

because they test for tons of diseases and worst case scenarios, like chromosomal defects, which lead to developmental disabilities. also, if something goes wrong, or there is something that could be harmful to you or your baby, they'll tell you and do whatever they can to help it. It's a seriously bad thing if you don't get prenatal care, because so much can go wrong, and you need to be tested for so many things that could be harmful to the baby if not treated. If you want the best for your child i suggest you take that small amount of time it takes to get prenatal care, i think it would be selfish otherwise.



It's detrimental to your baby to eat certain things and do certain activities during pregnancy, it could literally kill your baby, and you need to know what those things are. these doctors arent here to control you, theyre here to help insure the best possible health for your child.

Well..no, you dont NEED it but if you could know if something is wrong with your child especially in todays day and age where so many many things can go wrong (due to the environment, stress, viruses, etc etc etc) I personally would not pooh pooh the tests.
Especially after (Im not saying to scare you) a friend of mine who has 5 kids choose not to go to any appointments till after it was time to have the baby. She figured 5 kids, no problems and the last one was born with massive heart problems that could have been corrected in utero.

It's completely your choice if you decide to not take the care. These doctors are here to help prevent/treat certain diseases and genetic disorders before birth. In some Cases they are able to treat problems that arise while in utero. I will always have my OB for my pregnancies. Today's medicine and technology are only here to 'help'

The prenatal visit is to make sure you and your baby is doing fine. If there is anything wrong, the doctor can correct at an early stage. You can choose not to know the gender of the baby.



For my case, i have low lying placenta. If i didn't go for any checkup like in olden days and have my baby naturally, i will actually bleed to death. i checked online and found out in the olden days, this condition is a sure death for the mother and there is no way of knowing if you have this condition unless you go for a ultrasound. Also I'm having a series of injection to make sure my bleeding stop also. I'm having on and off bleeding.



I love going for my prenatal visit and see my baby on the monitor. I cried when i first saw my baby move on the monitor. You can go to my blog and view my baby's ultrasound videos and pictures. Maybe you will understand better.

blood tests are always correct. those store tests can be wrong. i knew someone that took like 4 of them, they all said neg but she was pregnant! i would see a dct especially if your trying. and if you went off birth control recently that could be why your spotty. you might not even get a peroid. check w. a dr to be safe. goodluck!

The only way you will know is if you go and get a blood test done let us know if you are or not with a blood test they can see the amount of hcg in your system the higher the hcg the greater chance your pregnant

2 weeks overdue is a little extreme hmm.... my advice is yeah your right they will probably induce her. I was a week overdue and they induced me and my son is healthy and great so I dont think there is anything to worry about but I dont know why her doc is waiting 2 weeks.

Second children come out fast, meaning, less time in labor.  It's not true that 2nd children are born before they are due.



The doctor should not wait any longer.  They really need to take the baby out.  I think 2 weeks is the max because the placenta starts to get old.



Congratulations!

I'm surprised they waited 2 weeks.  My Dr said he wont let me go over 1 week past my due date.



They will probably induce her. Nothing to be concerned about, they will either break her water or put her on pitocin drip and that should start the contractions.  I have heard that contractions are more intense and painful when labour is induced, but I also have a friend who says she wwouldn'twant it any other way.
Her labour will probably be shorter than her first (This isnt set in stone, but generally 2nd babys come out a bit easier.)
Best of luck to you and, of course, your wife!

I wouldn't worry about it.  She technically isn't overdue until she passes week 42.  The doctors know what they are doing and I'm sure would not knowingly put your wife in any danger.  The second baby coming faster is a rule of thumb because her body is already conditioned to having a baby and knows what to do, but every pregnancy is different and so is every baby.  Good luck, I'm sure everything will be fine.

It sounds like you went through a really horrible situation.  Your parents love you and they will of course be angry and upset about what someone has done to you, but they will support you because you're their daughter.  You shouldn't be dealing with something like this alone.  Tell you parents what happened and start prenatal care so you do not harm the baby.  I would also look into counseling if I were and definitely take legal action against the guy that raped you.

Well one thing is for sure... you can't do the "VERA DRAKE" process. It is bad... so bad... and dangerous!



The only thing I can suggest is that you tell you parents about it. The baby is already there. You can't kill that... You will be a murderer... It will cost you a lot of karma...



Rape is rape. As soon as you're done telling you parents about this, then do the necessary legal actions. For sure your parents would not be happy about it(You don't expect them to be happy for you flirting with the guys at a very young age). But believe me, they will soon understand that it wasn't totally your fault (though, I can say that you also did your thing). They are still your parents. They know better than you...



Also, I would suggest that you pray for guidance... You're just 15... Don't do something that you would regret one day.... Life is beautiful... be positive for your own good.

2. Tell your parents, tough, live with it, that's what you get for having boys in the house when your parents are away

Sweetie, you need to tell someone.  If you were, in fact, raped, then your parents will understand.. I don't care how strict they are.  If they love you they will help you.  Afterwards, your parents will probably want you to file a police report.  Please tell them.

why does everyone think its not right to check yourself? my hands are as clean as when the midwife checks thankyou as i use the same sterile anti-bacterial liquid on my hands.

its ok to check it but if you do it alot then u will just be making your body go into labor, doctors usually only check ever now and then, i never checked my own cervix so im not sure about the hard thing your feeling but more then likely it is. watch for labor and if your before 35wks and go into labor then your baby will be small and may have problems. Good Luck and try not to check yourself no more than maybe once a wk .



At 31wks of pregnancy i would be very worried about preterm labor, pls stop checking your own cervix have a doctor do it from now on, you could break your water, or make your self dialate by checking all the time plus the posibilities of infections are higher with you doing it. You Do not want your baby to be born now. My daughter was born at 35 wks by csection because of my blood pressure and she was healthy but only 5lbs so try to do everything posible to make sure you dont go into labor right now.

Yes, it is possible to feel your baby's head through your cervical opening (os). When I would do my own checks when pregnant with my daughter I could even feel her hair matted against the membrane! That was really cool and weird at the same time.



It's OK to stick your clean finger in to feel around. It's natural and normal to get to know your body, pregnant or not. Sex during pregnancy is more invasive then a cervix check! Doing a check won't start labor for just that reason....a penis does more poking and prodding then your finger. As long as you're not tugging and pulling on anything you'll be fine. If a cervix check was all it took to induce labor then there would be alot more premature babies on this earth!

I don't believe for a minute that any decent midwife would give the all clear on that - it's dangerous and for about 99% of women, not even possible to reach your own cervix.
Do you have any idea how unhygienic your own hands are? You could be at risk of infection, you could induce labour when your body isn't ready for it, you could be risking your baby's life.



Source(s):



Add - In the UK, midwives won't even check your cervix till you're in labour unless there's some other medical reason, there's a reason for that, because sometimes it can be dangerous. And if they do it, they will use surgical gloves and well scrubbed and sterlised hands.They are trained in how to do it - you are not.
And MOST women, not ALL women cannot reach their own cervix during pregnancy.



Add again - Jayah - A penis is sterile. Urine is sterile and for healthy men, sperm is sterile. Do you know any men who cut chicken using their penis? Or wipe their backsides?
Jeez, talk about uneducated.

Now this is a mystery to me. Why on earth are you poking around your cervix? Are you sure the midwife is qualified. What is it you are supposed to look out for cause you say the midwife says its safe to check your cervix. I'd say it sounds very unsafe to me.

Yes it is possible to feel the baby's head through the cervix and there is no problem with you checking yourself as long as your full term. As other people have said you could stimulate labour and if you are preterm its not a good idea.
I don't know how many weeks pregnant you are but well done for being able to feel anything with a big bump in the way!!

I can't imagine why your midwife would say it's OK to check your own cervix, I'd be too scared I'd start labour off early!!  I suppose it is possible to feel the baby's head through the cervix if you're dilated slightly.



I use evening primrose oil to help ripen my cervix, which does involve inserting a capsule as near to my cervix as possible, but I'd be wary of actually checking how dilated I am!  Plus, it's too far back and my bump is far too big for me to be able to!

WOW! The lack of education here is astounding sometimes! For all of you who think it is gross or dangerous to check your own cervix, PLEASE!!!! Give me a break!! You let a penis in there but your own washed fingers are unsanitary and gross?..What a joke! I don't care how many thumbs down I get. Get educated people!! HAHAHAHAHA!



Ok now that I said that I think that yep, you are feeling the baby's head. I don't think you need to be told to be careful..lol. How far are you in your pregnancy? I will be starting checks at around 8 mos.



I think it's very sad that women feel so incapable of taking care of themselves and birthing their babies....too much A Baby Story and not enough talking to people who have had successful natural births. I am sad for them, their babies and families..so sad.



Good Luck with your birth and new baby! =)

i agree i dont think its wrong to check your own cervix you can feel if your doing any damage. as long as you wash your hands whats the big deal. i dont see how this can induce labour it sure didn't work for me and i was checking from 36 weeks and still didnt give birth till 39 weeks. to answer your question yeah it could be the babies head, im assuming you are unable to feel any hair on the head so i would say your membranes are still intact. im thinking you may not have long to go. i was checking and even about 4 days before my daughter was born i could never feel the head although she didn't fully engage until about 2 hours before she was born. good luck and watch out for the contractions they are a dead giveaway.

Every body is different. For most woman the sickness usually starts to fade away as you enter into the 2nd trimester around week 13 however if you are like i was during my first pregnancy i had it really bad and couldn't keep any food down at all right up until about 24 weeks. Just try to eat small and often even if you bring it back you still need to eat something. Also drink plenty of fluids. My midwife told me to try and eat dry ginger biscuits to relieve some of sickness feeling but not sure if it works as i never tried it as i hate ginger. Congrats on baby

Hi dear, first of all, congratulations on your pregnancy! well what you are experiencing is morning sickness, and with some women, its lasts till the 12/13 th week, for some really unlucky ones, it lasts the whole9 months. hopefully, you wont be that unlucky, losing weight is absolutely normal, i know someone, who always loses 12/15 lbds at the beginning of her pregnancy, and towards the end, she gains an extra 50lbds. it all depends on your pregnancy. for now, what u can do is survive on crackers, nuts, also if u can tolerate, juices, keep some crackers beside ur bed everynight, and put some in your mouth before u get out of bed, u can also keep some fruit flavoured candies, esp at night after brushing your teeth, u can put one in your mouth and then go to sleep, that might help you through the acidity that results from not being able to eat enough. i used to like chinese food at this time, esp pan fried noodles with beef n broccoli (not very healthy i know!) the smell seemed tolerable to me. this is all part of this wonderful journey, but trust me, all this will go away pretty soon............congratulations once again!!!

Dream of miscarrying?



Last night I woke up with some mild to moderate cramping, i could have been stretching, it could have been gas, whatever it was it made me lay in bed and think about miscarrying.



I finally fell back asleep and had the most vivid, clear, realistic dream that i had awaken, reached down and i was spotting bright red before running to the bathroom and passing what looking to be a baby. It was so real, i even remember looking at the baby to see what sex it was.  i called my friend who was in line to vote because i knew she was voting before work crying telling her that i had miscarried. I then kept screaming why?  and then finally woke up.



Is it normal to have such demented dreams, am i losing my mind?



I am 11 weeks, 4days with my second and i am so worried that i am going to go to my ob appt. next week because i am scared to hear something is wrong with the baby.

I have had several dreams where I've miscarried.  I really believe it is simply because I worry about it so often (even if only in the back of my mind,) that my subconcious feels the need to try and work it out as I sleep.



Even worse...I've had several dreams while pregnant that I murder people....



Clearly, I'm not going to do that.  And I probably won't miscarry.  Dreams are especially vivid while pregnant....but they do NOT predict the future!  Don't worry!  :)

Please don't freak yourself out!! First, every week that you are pregnant, the chances of something going wrong decreases. You are within days of being 12wks along, which is a milestone when the chances fall off drastically. I'm sure you will be fine!



When I was pregnant with my first, I was lying in bed one night and noticed that my heart was racing a little--so I said to myself, "you HAVE to calm down or you are going to freak out and miscarry." This made my heart beat even faster! and so on until i was thoroughly flipping out. Your freak-out moment happened in a dream, but I think that they happen to all of us moms when we are pregnant.



Something that comforted me was being reminded that women have been having babies for thousands and thousands of years. Unless you know that there is something wrong with the pregnancy, relax and enjoy growing a person! Your appt. will likely be a comfort and not be scary! Best wishes!

You should focus on peer pressure and why teenagers feel like they need to have sex. You should also touch on birth control and how EASY it is to get. And then you should touch on how teenagers with children are getting by. Can they finish school? Working? etc. Good luck.

Peer Pressure would be a good start.  Television programming created toward teenagers that always seem to give a "happy" ending when they become pregnant instead of the nitty-gritty details of how to pay for the formula, bottles, clothes, diapers, wipes, basic necessities, etc.  Look at the social life decline they endure.  Some school systems even make teens leave the main HS and move to an alternative school.  Look at the 4 choices they have once they become pregnant (abortion, keeping the child, closed adoption, open adoption).

Topic could be Teen pregnancies and how it effects them



Rember that highschool that had a whole bunch of female students all at one time who got pregnant recently I foget where that highschool was and the entire story but you can do a blurb on that topic. Do some research and get some stories on this topic it will help move along your writing. Include articles and discuss in your own words what the articles are about and if you know anyone whose gone through teen pregnancy you can discuss how it effected her life but dont give away her identity. Now go back to when you started writing figure out the who, what when, where, why and hows. Who-females in their teens from ages... to..., What-teen pregnancy, When-today, Where-Pick a location of the highest teen pregnancy rate whether it be more in the city or in the suburbs or the county, Why- Figure out why females are getting pregnant is it because they need someone to love them or is it because their friends are all doing it and dont want the peer pressure, was it a mistake, were they raped, and finally How- You could do something on oh gosh this is tough like how many partners do they have and how many times do they try to get pregnant each with in a weeks time or over a course of a months time. Finally conclude your topic. If you can have your paper finalized by getting an english teacher correct your paper for spelling errors, and gramer, etc etc. Good luck and have fun with it and oh dont wait until the last minute to start this or any paper bad habbit some students have. Trust me Ive done it a few times and belive me it didnt help my grade any If I did it when I was supposed to I could have had my paper checked over for any errors. so instead of a grade of an B I got a C plus. Never waited until the last minute again!

Despite going through fertility treatments, I was surprised to find out that it was twins.  I did have all-day morning sickness but it was not any more intense than my friends with single pregnancies.  Even at the end of my  pregnancy, people were surprised to find out that I was carrying twins as I didn't put on a lot of weight.



We saw them at a 6 1/2 week ultrasound but even then it seemed unreal.  Once they started kicking and I could feel one moving and then the other . . . then I really knew.  It was my "WOW moment".



Best wishes for a happy & healthy pregnancy whether it by one or or more!

Can someone who has done this before please tell me...is it safe?



Okay...I have a wisdom tooth pushing in in the back of my mouth...very painful. My jaw is swollen and it HURTS. At my last Dr. appointment I asked him if it was safe to take Hydrocodone..he said that we can take it but they are not sure how much is too much. I have 10 mg tablets...I have to find something to relieve this pain!!! Since I am pregnant I'm kinda scared to take anything but Tylenol...but it doesn't seem to help anymore. This pain started Friday...I had asked him about it like two weeks ago because the medicine I have is for my back pain from a car wreck I was in and since I am always on my feet my back is killing me since I'm pregnant. Now I need it for my mouth...has anyone ever taken Hydrocodone and it didn't hurt the baby??

its totally fine but im concerned about you and your baby so i would say no to any kinda medicines. you never know how things might turn out. i would say a big NO as i feel the baby is all that is and will be important to you. try putting up with the pain, it will surely ease out. i have bad teeth problem always and since im pregnant i bear the pain and i strictly say no to medicines myself. and i guess your someone special to me as your a day ahead of me. so i want your bundle of joy to be safe. god bless.

Yes totally normal in the early stages of pregnancy.  All of your energy and blood cells are concentrating on growing your little baby.
Your placenta will take over later on in pregnancy (cant remember what week sorry) and you will start to produce more blood cells and the dizziness will go away.
The second trimester is the best, your energy should return

yeah, all the time. the doc says to sit up or stand up slowly or sit up in bed for a minute before getting up. it still happens now and again though. it can't be helped really since now your body is supporting a baby as well there's simply more blood going round than there used to be.



you'll get used to it though, and it won't last. keep an eye on your blood pressure though k? just in case.x

Hi there,congratulations on your pregnancy and don't worry about this symptom.......it is completely normal.I have had this with all three of my pregnancies and it is due to your blood pressure being lower than normal.During early pregnancy your blood pressure lowers until you are 20 weeks pregnant and then slowly starts to rise again until you give birth at which point your blood pressure should be back to normal.As the other comments say try not to stand up too quickly or if you are standing and feel like this try to sit down as I have fainted twice with the same thing! Also try to eat little and often and try to keep hydrated .Hope your pregnancy goes well x.

Which way is the best way to sleep while pregnant? Tips for sleeping better?



Im 27 weeks. I've been having bad back pains on the right side next to my spine.. is it bad to sleep on your back? I feel like its the only way I can relieve the pain in my back. I did get a brace at babies'r'us it helped alot when I'm standing,.. also I feel like I can't breath all that great when I'm laying down on my back though..and If I lay on my sides it just makes my back start to hurt again so I lose either way! Last night I didn't sleep at all. Any suggestions or tips to help me sleep better? Thanks!

Sleep on your side, with a maternity pillow and pillow between your legs with your legs drawn up.  The maternity pillow can fit behind your back too, so it gives support there.  They say sleep only on your left side, but, that's impossible.  Usually either side is fine and if you roll on your back once in a while, well that will be OK too.  If you find it absolutely impossible to sleep, Tylenol PM is OK once in a while.

It's ok to sleep on your back for a few minutes at a time, but not all night at this point in your pregnancy.  I have some back pain too (29 weeks) and it's' better for me to sleep on my side- but it has to be very well supported....a pillow between the knees and one supporting the belly in front.  Sleeping on the side of the pain is usually better because it helps to stabilize that side- but I need to flip back and forth a few times at night.  It's horrible, i know, good luck!

We just lost our baby at 19 weeks.  I am scheduled for a D & E (similar to a D&C).  Has anyone been through this and can tell me what to expect afterwards?  Is there alot of pain? Bleeding?  Would a D &E be your choice over labor and delivery of dead baby?  It was a tough decision, but I just can't imagine goign through labor and not having a live baby.  Any thoughts or experiences will be much appreciated.

I am so terribly sorry for your loss. I wish I had more words of comfort for you. I think you are making the right decision. Make sure that you are able to see the baby afterward. Take pictures. Hold her close and say your good byes. Try to stay strong. I'll say a prayer for all of you.

Me and my wife lost our first baby at 10 weeks and she had a D&C and it wasn't bad at all. The worst part of the whole thing is the emotional pain. If you can get through that then there are no problems. We just had our first baby. She is 2 weeks old today. She is perfect and healthy. And if I can give you any advice you do not want to go through labor and delivery when your not going to have a living baby. It is very tough to have a baby vaginally and if it were working for nothing I can't imagine how I would be able to stand not even considering how much worse it would be for my wife than it would be me. The best advice I can give you is get away for a couple of days so that you aren't getting interrogated every day. If you will just pray about it and try to remember that it's not over, you can have a perfectly healthy baby, this one just wasn't meant to be and start trying again it will make things alot easier. Hope this helps.

Im so sorry for your lost. I lost my baby at 20 weeks do to an incompetent cervix, My baby passed away when i was giving birth to him, it was the hardest day of my life, when i was pregnant i always thought when it was time for me to give birth it will be the most wonderful day of my life and it wasnt, If your going to have the D&E i think is the best choice, Because its hard giving birth and not having a live baby, trust me its devastating.



The only thing that makes it better for me today is the fact that i got to hold my angel, and having pictures of him to remember him for ever.



Good luck

Its your choice! Either way its not going to be delightful.
Just remember that theres just a body inside of you now, the soul is gone and its basically just like "getting rid of" (doesn't sound nice but I cant think of another way to put it) a cocoon..etc.
I'm so sorry for your loss and good luck with everything!

If you haven't had a period since August you might be pregnant. The home tests are not always accurate. Go to the doctor to get a blood test so you will know for sure. It's really important to get good health care for you and your baby.

I'm so confused. I've just found out i'm almost 4 months pregnant and it's not my boyfriend's?



my boyfriend and i have been talking a lot about having sex and i was finally ready to have sex with him on his birthday which was about 4 months ago. When I went around to his house on his birthday I found him with another girl having sex. This girl was his best friend's girlfriend and I can't stand her and she can't stand me and treats her boyfriend like dirt.



I told her boyfriend everything i'd seen and he broke it off with her and i broke it off with my boyfriend. I ended up having sex with him because I was angry and upset with my boyfriend who I only started going out with again a month ago because he'd grovelled so much and he friend who I had sex with encouraged me to go back out with him because he was going into this downward spiral.



I took my best friend's advice to tell my ex bofriend I was pregnant and he got angry and hit me when I told him it wasn't his. He's been calling me a slapper and a **** and telling me that I sleep around. I know it's not the best relationship but he did say sorry afterwards and did make it up to me. I'm scared if i break it off he'll go back into this downward spiral.



I'm pregnant and so confused I don't know what to do anymore. I either abort it (I don't believe abortion is wrong. It's not alway's the woman's fault she get's pregnant. It could be rape or anything.) or put it up for adoption because I'm not ready to be a mother. I was angry and upset and I know I keep this baby my boyfriend will hurt me and the baby because it's his bestfriend's and he can't control his temper.



</question>



<additional details>



V.S. I never said I was. I was stating one of the reasons why a woman could be pregnant. It isn't always her fault she gets pregnant.



I NEVER said I was raped. God, can't you people read!



I was giving an example of when a women gets pregnant it it wasn't her fault. I don't see anything wrong with abortions. I'm not healthy enough to support a child in my body anyway. I'm hospitalized every year and christmas because I get so sick.



I live in the UK and because i'm under 24 weeks I can have an abortion if I want one.



No i'm not on drugs. well not illegal ones anyway. I have a terrible weak immune system because I was born at 6 months. If some one has a mild cold around me, I get the flu. I have to get a flu shot every so often I think it's yearly I dunno. I have to have my blood taken every six weeks to see if it's all ok.

Having sex with your friend's boyfriend because you want to give "payback" is not just something you do because you're angry.  You need to be responsible for your actions...and killing a baby is not the answer here.



If your ex boyfriend hits you ..you need to call the police. That is assault and battery and if he hurts your baby it could be murder.



Your ex boyfriend sounds like a serious loser and you're way better off without him. Thank god he's not the father.



Seriously though..grow up and have some respect for yourself and please take responsibility for your child no matter whose it is.

If you have to think too hard about whether to choose your own flesh and blood who you are nurturing inside your body...or a little boy who has the audacity to smack you around...and actually choose that low life you...there is an issue. young or not you should know it so prescious to bring a child into this world. you made that choose to sleep with a boy, but arent prepared for the consequences...God allows everything to happen for a reason....if you dont take this as a sign that you need to leave that low life alone he will eventually do more than just hit you. it only gets worse. and i can promise y0u most women/girls regret giving up their baby. So think long and hard about it...and realize you have been given the opportunity to bring life into the world and by that boy hitting you...he's slowing taking yours.
I hope you choose wisely. Good Luck and God bless

You say you don't think abortion is wrong "it could be rape or anything" , but that isn't your situation. You screwed up and now your using that as an escape goat. Have the baby and give it up for adoption. It's not the baby's fault he got into your tangled web. You are the one that messed up and that poor baby has to pay for it with his or her life. This is the reason kids shouldn't be having sex. Grow up and take responsibility for what you did. If your "boyfriend" is that bad break up with him and leave him alone.

Chances are he isn't going to change.  He'll find more reasons to hit you and call you things you don't deserve to be called and then he'll say he's sorry and apologize to you for it.  It's a circle, it'll keep happening over and over.
As for your baby, I strongly discourage an abortion in this case but if you have to go for it, it's your choice.
Just remember don't blame your child on your mistakes.
And I repeat, get the he!! away from your boyfriend.  If he loved you he wouldn't have cheated on you and he wouldn't hit you.

Break it off with him! He is not your responsibility and though you care for him, he will find someone else. What he done was wrong and therefor, you got revenge. I do not think that there is anything wrong with that. Do you really want to be in an unhappy relationship for the rest of your life because you are scared that if you leave him he is going to have a downward spiral again? Live your life the way you want to girl! Go have fun and do what YOU want to do! And I wish you the best of luck in whatever you choose to do with the baby scenario x

Have it and give it up. Get rid of the loser boyfriend also - It is never okay to hit someone. Look up fetal development and how at this stage you don't have to wait long and will be able to feel the little baby moving. He or she is completely developed. Get an U/S and you can see the baby sucking her thumb and kicking around...an abortion would be so selfish at this point. Give her to a couple that wants a baby.

Okay seriously, whether you decide to keep this baby or give it up for adoption you need to get away from this guy. Report him to the police. Don't put yourself in a situation where you are alone with him. He is clearly a loser. And just because he is in a "downward spiral" doesn't mean you have to get back with him. That's his own fault. He betrayed you, he hit you. GET AWAY FROM HIM. Also did you tell the father? What does he have to say about the situation? If you don't think you can handle being a mother then you should put the baby up for adoption so that people who will love it can look after it. But seriously get away from that loser. If he hit you once he will do it again. Protect your unborn baby and yourself

These types of things happen because of stupid decisions. You don't have sex with your boyfriend's best friend just because you're angry at him. And you weren't raped, so I do not suggest abortion. It's not the child's fault, it's yours. Consider giving the baby up for adoption if you don't wish to take care of it yourself. And leave that boyfriend of yours once and for all. Nobody deserves any kind of abuse. If you don't get out now, you'll eventually feel trapped, and he will make your life a living Hell.

look, you made it very clear you're upset and confused. so now isn't the best time to make a decision like this. you say you're four months gone? there aren't many docs who'll do an abortion now anyway, the baby is too developed.



i think, since you're asking our opinions, you either suck it up and be a mother to this child - after all it doesn't matter who the father is, it's just as much your baby and already on the way. or, put it up for adoption and give a loving couple the joy of bringing up a child that there's no doubt they will love beyond imagination.



it's obviously not a wise decision to try to get either guy in this situation to step up, they're both too immature. but at least you've got the childs interests at heart.



isn't there a family member you could talk this out with? perhaps show them all the answers you get on here and talk it through slowly. there's no point rushing to get an abortion, the babys already formed, so you may as well invest the next week or too thinking things over without any interference from these guys.



good luck hun.x

Seems like he is going to have a downward spiral either way, so, don't let him take you down too!
If you abort, you still need to get help to escape this guy.
If you keep the baby and do adoption... you desperately need to leave him ( Bad situation when I was young... abusive boyfriend said he was sorry... eventually got overly pissed and beat the crap out of me and I ended up with a late term miscarraige... its one of the most horrible things to see, and painful. Please please be careful).
If you want help on finding parents to adopt to, I know a couple sites :)

getting pregnant at a young age--worse things could happen in life.  That being said, your boyfriend is abusive and you need to break it off with him NOW, like yesterday.  You need to think better of yourself and realize he is not the one for you.  He cheated on you and yet you worry about him in a downward spiral?  Get away from him before it is too late.  Think about yourself and the life you have inside of you.  It won't matter about abortion, adoption or raising it yourself if he looses his temper and kills you.  You are worth more than what he can give you.  You are a good person with a great life to lead.  Stand up for yourself and your baby(whatever your decision is about keeping it) and be strong enough to put you first.

listen the guy that you had sex with should never have done anything with you because thats just  screwed up!!are you and you boyfriend still together if so the if you want to keep the baby he should support you and the guys best friend should help too.if you have told you mom then go you because not taking prenatal vitamins is bad for the baby.i hope you either decide to keep the baby or adopt it out because abortion make you feel horrible after wards and 7 out of 10 women said they regreted aborting the baby.so if your not ready give it up for adoption.i have had the same problem except i wasn't pregnant i was just scared i was so i asked my boyfriend what he would do if i was he said that he would get a job and support me and the baby he said aborting it was out of the picture because if it was his kid he was gonna take care of it because it was both of our fault for not using a condom so safe sex is better. so just don't freak out the baby can tell when your upset and talk to your boyfriend and his best friend together and ask them what they want you to do. then agree on a smart Solution

First off I am going to yell at you and hopefully get through. If he hit you and you stayed with him you are so stupid. No man should brow beat any woman no matter what. When he does get angry and does take it out on you IT WILL GET WORSE as time goes on. So Dump him. He will do it again and by you worrying about his feelings instead of your own, you are the DUMMY here. So be smart and tell him to take a hike because you are worth so much more than a beating and anger fromsomeone who caused the problem in the first place, That alone should tell you he didn't love you in the first place and all the sorrys don't fix what he has done. Now on the other hand when you did what you did it was because of betrayal and I understand that. It's like pay back but then again it was stupid and childish to give up your body for such a stupid reason , but you did and now your dealing with these feelings. Most men are out for themselves anyway and when they know they can have you all feelings of fuzzy kind of stuff is NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM. They want the SEX is all. No comitments and when threatened they lash out. Some day you will find a love who will respect the fact you are with a child and won't care and just love you both. You deserve so much more and if you listen... LISTEN , dump him he is trouble and will not change no matter how many times he GROVELS&gt; It's a ploy to get what he wants. Why I say this is because men that hit women are control freaks and when you are out of his control he will get angry again and over and over you will be the target of his actions. Get real and see this as it is. A big MISTAKE. Find someone else and always be up front and truthful and if that someone else leaves then be glad because you want someone who will respect you and love you and your child. As far as the name calling , hell, don't even let it bother you. It's childish and stupid and very imature for him to do this and again , I say it won't change. And if you stay with him the chances of this happening again is evident and probable that he will do it again and again, so just think for a moment ,.... do you want to live like this or do you want and deserve respect and love. Hmmmm!! Easy question for me to answer.



Be true to yourself and do the right thing or you may start living a hell you'll never get away from..



Trust me I have been there and I have learned the hard way. I just hope you are smart enough to get this and LISTEN to my advise.. He isn't worth it. You are....

Well, in your case you weren't raped and it WAS your fault, atleast 50% of it.  So, in your case, abortion is WRONG. It isn't BIRTH CONTROL.



You are in your SECOND TRIMESTER. Too late to abort. The baby has a heart beat, has 10 fingers, 10 toes, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, all the limbs. You'd be killing a baby and for what? Cause you made the mistake? That is selfish. Take responsibility, have the baby.



If you weren't ready to become a mommy, then you need to keep your legs CLOSED.

Good luck then finding a dr. that will do it. You selfish, heartless little girl.



Do you know how they are going to perform the abortion? They are going to induce labor, you'll have to give birth to the baby. They will deliver the baby feet first. And when it comes to the neck, they'll stop and puncture the back of the babys neck, killing it. Doesn't sound to humane, does it?

pregnacy week 16 (4months)
Because her muscles are developing, she can make some faces now. Your baby is able to squint, frown and open its mouth. There is enough calcium in the bones that they will show up on an x-ray. Your baby's fingernails are well formed now and the legs are longer than the arms. Because your baby is moving well now, you may begin to feel his movements! Some women say that the early movements feel like gas bubbles or a slight flutter.

First of all, if you don't want to raise the baby because you are afraid your boyfriend will hurt either of you, you need to leave his ***. It doesn't matter how mad he is, he has no right to hurt you. EVER. His downward spiral is not your problem. You should've never gotten back with him in the first place.... He is a loser, an abuser, and a down right piece of $&*#. Get away from him before it's too late.
Are you on drugs? Why do you get hospitalized? God I feel sorry for your baby. Oh yeah, and abortion IS wrong. It's murder no matter how you look at it. In your situation, you will be using it for birth control. Grow up and stop having sex. It was your fault that you got pregnant. Don't say it wasn't. You had sex, and didn't protect yourself. Don't kill your baby because you're selfish. At the very least, get healthy, stay away from that @**hole, have the baby, give it up for adoption, and get on birth control. Then you can be as selfish, and childish as you want.

Terminate your relationship with your boyfriend permanently and never see him again.  Any man who hits a woman when times are hard for him and his woman is a sign that he is a loser.  Granted he is not the father but he still has not right to do hit or beat you especially when he is angry.  Plus, this so-called boyfriend is not going to be there for you or your child in years to come.  Trust me on this.



Admit you did something stupid and you have to live with it for the rest of your life.  However, it takes two to have a child so the biological father is equally to blame and also stupid.  He should also know that he should not take advantage of you no matter how vulnerable you are.



Have the child and do not have an abortion.  You have two possible choices:



a. Give it up for adoption but you must keep knowledge of where your child is through out your child’s life.  When your child becomes an adult, he or she will want to know who the biological mother is and will want to contact you.  So keep the link going and be prepared in 25 to 30 years for contact.  I have seen this in a friend who was adopted and pursued this route to put closure in her life.



b. Raise the child yourself and try to get on many social programs as possible.  At the same time, if you can get support from your family then get it.  But you still have to finish high school and post-secondary education (vocational or college).  Try to get as much school aid as possible.  After that, you must get a job.  You need a job regardless if you are married, single, parentless, or have children.  The modern world demands it.



Remember, dating again and finding a man to marry gets more complicated if you keep the child.  Most men in their twenties do not want to date or marry a woman who has a child.  That is just the way most men are.  But do not let this detract you from keeping the child if you really want to.  The child comes first.



I hope this help.

Question about the Rhogam shot.?



I am due to get the Rhogam shot tomomorrow because of my blood type. I've read that the Rhogam shot does have mercury in it and am scared from what I've heard in the news lately about mercury leading to autism. I had a mini-dose of Rhogam two years ago also and I'm just looking to get some feedback to see if anyone thinks that that mini-dose could still be in my system. Of course, I want my child to be born perfectly healthy so am I just worrying too much or am I ok?

I haven't heard that, but I had it with both my children.  I got it while pregnant with my first and after he was born, then I got it while pregnant with my second, but not after.  She was negative blood type so I didn't need it again.



I would recommend talking to your doctor about what you have heard.  I understand your fears, but I think the fear of the baby's blood and my blood going against each other and possibly killing my baby, or however it happens is much greater.

Every woman with O- blood who has a baby with a positive blood type man needs this shot.  It is not dangerous.  It is only good for 12 weeks, there is nothing in your system from last time.



You don't need it just because of your blood type, if your baby's father is a negative blood type as well you don't need it, double check that first :)

I feel dizzy when I get out of bed some mornings. I know it's to early to test so i'm playing the waiting game but i'd like to know if anyone else has had these symptoms in EARLY pregnancy.

if you think you ovulate today and have had these symptoms for like a week or so now then I'd say maybe it isn't too early to test as you may have gotten pregnant last month and are already 5 weeks along.  Your 'period' might have been implantation bleeding, was it lighter or shorter than usual or early ?  perhaps go ahead and test today anyway to find out and if negative go ahead and try today to conceive.  you might just have some sort of virus running its course.

One of the biggest problems with ovulation calculators online (which is what I assume you used) is that they predict when the average woman with a 28 day cycle will ovulate.  Almost no one ovulates on day 14.  It's rare.  It's entirely possible that you ovulate early, even as early as day 10 of your cycle and you really are pregnant.  Like you said, wait it out until your period is due.  If you don't get it, then test.



Good luck!

You could possibly be pregnant already, and are showing signs, but it wouldn't hurt to try again today just so you know you're covered. Sperm can live inside you for a few days, but why not try again just to be sure!

How can you tell if it's an actual contraction?



I'm 36 weeks and 4 day's pregnant with my first baby.



Since about week 30 i've been experiencing real bad (what i thought were) contractions,and they kept getting worse, so i went to the hospital a total of 2 times.



They said the first time it was from dehydration, and the second time they said that those weren't even contractions, they were the ones that prepare you for the real thing.



So my question is what does the real contractions feel like? and how would you know they are real not false?



It's like this morning at 5 am after i took a shower and had breakfast i had that pain again but it only lasted for a min @ 5:58am-5:59am.



I just don't want another embarrassing trip to the hospital and then my husband thing i'm lying about it,kinda like the boy who cried wolf basically,lol.

they are right your body is preparing for labor, i went to a class last week, they said if you cannot walk through a contraction that is when it is real... if you can walk through it and it doesn't drop you to your knees, then you are not quite there yet. sounds wonderful doesn't it. they don't call it labor for nothing lol

They REALLY hurt...and progressively get worse and have a rhythm...like one every ten minutes then they become closer and closer together. If you think you are having contractions, walk around...if they go away, they are not true contractions. For me, it felt like my hips and pelvic bone were being squeezed in a vise...burning cramping pain. But, it is different for everyone. You should also have some other signs of pending labor...bloody show, loss of mucous plug, lightening, etc... Good Luck!!!

sounds like you are still have braxton hicks contractions they only last for no more than like a minute, and are not consistent.



They are uncomfortable and hurt a bit sometimes but they are tolerable.



The real ones last longer, and come in regular intervals. And you will know it when they come because they HURT!  If you start to have them in regular intervals of like 10-15 minutes for over an hour or two its time to call the doctor!



If you start to get them try changing positions, drinking plenty of h20 and put your feet up. If they are braxton hicks that usually makes them go away.

Well unlike braxton hicks they are far apart and they are not consistent with the onset to real labor the contractions are closer together more painful and they won't let up when your in labor you will be able to tell the differience because they will be stronger then the ones you are getting now I wish you luck on your delivery

It depends on the woman. When I went into labor with my first son I did not even know because my braxton hicks hurt much worse. (I was having a stress test because I was 41 weeks and my doctor came in and told me "you are in labor" and I was surprised.) Even after 4 cm, I was not in that much pain and I did not have an epidural. (It did get progressively worse in the hospital though, but it was hard to determine when I needed to go to the hospital.)



What everyone else has said is true for most women though, so try to wait until you have intense contractions every 5 minutes before going back to the hospital. That is what I was told for this pregnancy after going to the hospital twice in two weeks. And it is better to be safe than sorry, if you think they are real, then let your doctor know. And shame on your hubby for thinking you are crying wolf, many many many women have several false alarms before going into true labor. It is quite normal, even for a woman experiencing her third pregnancy. My hubby did not think this of me, but my brother and my hubby's boss thought so. They are jerks, do not worry. It is better to be safe than sorry regardless of what others think.



Keep hydrated and rest and good luck.

Plan B should be taken within 5 days (120 hours) of unprotected sex and can reduce the risk of pregnancy up to 89%. But it is more effective the sooner you take it.
you took in within 24 hours, so it should be fairly effective...
no one knows when you ovulated, it depends on you and your cycle length....better get on birthcontrol

plan B isn't effective birth control.
it's there to take on the off chances of having unprotected sex, or sexual assault.

Everyones different i felt mine around 13-14 weeks.  It depends on how in tune you are with your body and what position your in...  I found i could feel it more if i layed flat on my back...  But also its just like flutters like little butterflies that early lol but when u feel it later trust me no mistaking it...  And also they tend to kick more after you eat or drink because your stomach makes weird noises but thats when their older

I had the same concern as mine runs around 99-102 (which never happened before pregnancy). I asked my gyno and he said that it is absolutely normal and necessary. You body has to supply blood for the baby and a lot of changes in your body. According to what to expect when you're expecting, a woman's heart will continue to work harder and harder until around birth when it's pumping almost 50% more than the "pre pregnancy rate". I can get you the page numbers on that if you could like them.



Long story short, it's really normal. It's your over all blood pressure that they worry about. If it's okay, then you're okay. Also, if you're not having chest pains, then you're okay.



I would still mention it to your doctor, but I'm sure your doc will say the same thing mine did.



So, congrats on the pregnancy!!

Yes, that's very normal. When I was pregnant, my resting heartbeat was always over 100, sometimes up to 120. It went back to normal a few days after delivering my baby. Your body is really working overtime now, so it's to be expected that your heart is, too. Nothing to worry about!

Scared that something might be wrong or am i just stressing?



Ok so i had sex on the 19h of october just 2 days after i was done with my period. We used a condom and he pulled out even with the condom on just for extra protection since i am not on the pill yet. For the past couple of weeks though my boobs have been hurting but only really one of them, but the thing is they don't hurt when i touch them. Am i just thinking i am pregnant which is giving me symptoms? Is it to early to take a pregnancy test bc my cycle is usually 28-30 days and i am not due till the weekend or sometime next week. Like i said we did use a condom and he didn't do anything, but why are my boobs feeling like this, i also have had some slight cramping to for the past couple of weeks also but they kinda stopped about a day or two ago.

Since your period hasn't come yet, it's really hard to say.



You used a condom and he did pull out, but also there is precum and there could have been a chance some leaked out (probably unlikely though).



I wouldn't worry so much.  Give your period time to come.  Maybe you're just feeling early symptoms of your period.

If you really have a 28-30 day cycle then even if you didn't use a condom it would be unlikely to get pregnant 2 days after your period. I doubt you're pregnant. I wouldn't waste the money on pregnancy tests. You'll probably see AF this weekend.

Why isn't it showing?



ok so here's pretty much the whole story:
in the last year, i have been on and off different birth control pills and i have not had an accurate, steady period since.
i've been late, early, short periods, long periods, the whole 9...
right now i am 3 weeks late with some slight symptoms of pregnancy. tender breasts, slight headaches, nausea and mood swings...
i have taken 4 over-the-counter pregnancy tests (first response) and all 4 have read negative... i'm quite confused and thought something would have happened... maybe a period, a positive result... anything.
i have a gyno appt on the 13th of this month, but i was just wondering if maybe anyone thinks it could be from me not being steady on the pill or maybe i'm thinking about it so much that it stresses me and i'm giving myself the symptoms, lol... any answers are very appreciated.
thanks in advance.

on and off the pill can do a number on the body so you being late isnt a shocker. stress can also do a number on the body aswell.
if all preg test show negative, then just wait untill your doc appointment and see what she says,

I'm 37 weeks with my second little girl and therefore already a mum but its just hit me recently too!  I think after a miscarriage and ectopic last year I'd got so obsessed with the actual getting and being pregnant part I'd forgotten I'd end up with a baby!  Or at least how long before I get one!  I have another scan next week and then i'll get my induction date so I could well be holding my girly within the next 10 days (if my medical history and current condition is anything to go by!) and I'm suddenly rather gobsmacked!

i'm 40 weeks 1day, still waiting. Yeh dont worry it freaks me out even now. i have never changed a nappy, and i've held one baby, once. i didnt understand how many layers you put on, how many times you feed them, anything. I;ve read lots of books, and still worry that i dont know little silly things that everyone else seems to think are common knowledge. but remember your not on ur own. when u go in hospital ask all the questions u can, ask ur midwife and if u've got a mum or friend thats had a baby they will be a great help. everyone has told me as i will tell you, that you know ur own baby, and when the babies here you will know what to do, and you will love them and thats all u need.

Extreme Stress of break up in last week of pregnancy hurt my baby?



I caught my bf in bed with another woman this weekend. So I've had an extremely stressful weekend. I've had contractions that get down to 8-10 minutes apart and regular, then they just stop. I think my body just won't relax and let the baby come. Is this doing harm to my baby to have this much stress going on right now?

most likely not doing a ton of harm to the baby, the baby is pretty well formed, but you would either cause labor or prevent it... try taking a nice bath, and i know this sounds terrible but a small glass of red wine while in the bath (or tea) always helped me to relax when I was overly stressed... just let it happen, dont punish yourself because of his mistake, just remember everything comes back around in due time.

You haven't said how far along you are.  Stress isn't good though, no matter where you are in your pregnancy.  Especially stress of this magnitude.  As hard as it is, try to focus on the baby and staying calm and healthy for it.  I'd recommend calling your OB and speaking to her or the nurse about what is going on.  If you are far enough along, they might have you go to the hospital because of the contractions.



Stay away from your ex and lean on family and friends right now.  You don't need any added stress.  Good luck!

and don't stress yourself out, you're going to have a baby soon! And besides, you deserve better than him anyways. I know you're gonna be thinking about it and all, but right now you're baby needs you and obviously you're bf doesn't. There are plenty of guys out there and he's definitely not the one for you! You deserve better. You have to concentrate on your life and whats best for you and your children. Goodluck girly!!

It may have stress on the baby, but im not a doctor so cant say for certain if it would be a major thing, i would say go to your doctor and ask, and or try to sooth yourself with a nice hot bath scented candles and a picture of your boyfriend to throw darts at to relieve your stress.



P.s. I had a very stress full pregnancy with my boyfriend cheating then leaving me in my 3rd trimester but my son is perfectly fine.



As for the contractions allot of pregnant ladies get this i cant remember the name but its basically fake labour, you body it playing tricks on you lol, But make sure you mmonitorthem iin caseone of them is the real deal...

Try to relax and think about your baby. Stress can bring on labor, but since you are so close anyway it would be ok. Do things that keep you relaxed. . . Shower, tea, walking, movie, you need to keep your stress level down. I know your situation sucks and I'm sorry. Wish you the best.

First of all I feel for you! That is one crappy situation! Shame on him!!!!



You probably are not even close to being relaxed at this point. As long as your baby is still moving around try not to worry. Try to have a change of scenery if possible away from your bf. I am sure your body is gearing up for the birth very soon. Of course stress isn't good for anyone but at this point there isn't much option. Do your best, that's all you can do. Some labors just start and stop, that's just the way it goes.

Help with pregnancy test?



I took a pregnancy test this morning (brand: One Step Pregnancy Test) Its one of those +/- tests and less than 2 minutes after I peed on it the test showed + - (first being the pregnancy results, second being control line) The only thing thats bothering me is the vertical line on the + is very, very thin and very faint! I am worried it's an evap line b/c I read about +/- tests at peeonastick.com...anyways..what should I take it as..a positive or should I just assume its an evap line? Has anyone ever gotten results like this from a +/- test? If so, what happened..were you pregnant? Oh and the vertical line on the + was blue, not shadowy. i will be testing again in a few days. Thanks in advance!

I had one where 2 lines means pregnant, and I had a really hard time reading mine too. The second line was VERY faint, but from what I can tell, any line, no matter how faint, is a positive result.



To be sure, check out www.peeonastick.com where they have pictures of actual confirmed positive tests so you can compare what yours looks like to those. When I saw how faint those positives were I knew I was preggers.



I hope this means congrats!

This site is really good. Sign up and look at the HPT/OPK photo gallery. My line was SO faint I wanted to see if anyone else had a positive test like it. You can see positive tests, negative tests and evap lines from the brand you took.

Are these feelings normal at 37 weeks?



Hi all,
I am over 37 weeks and everything is going great. My Husband and I are nearly ready and are so excited.
The thing is, I have this horrible overwhelming feeling sometimes that something is going to go wrong and even that we will come back from the hospital alone. Theres no reason why I should expect the worse (although I have suffered from depression for 12 years) but I just find myself getting all excited and then having to stop myself because I dont want to get too excited if something bad is going to happen.



I have always expected the worst all my life and whenever everything is going great in anything I will be "waiting" for it to go wrong. But I just want to enjoy every second of the last 2-3 weeks we have left and stop worrying.



Are these normal concerns and feelings that every woman gets at this time or is it simply my history of depression that is causing it? I just want to know that I am not alone in feeling this way.



Thank you

you are not alone, usually every time something is going good in life like me and my husbands jobs or money and everything, something bad happens to us like well... death in the family.. so we had to stop trying to think of anything bad also b/c we are scared.  but our money situation and job situation sucks right now lol so that is helping us not to worry.  but you are not alone.. I think every pregnant woman has these fears, how could you not? especially if this is your first child at all like mine will be, I am so worried my body is going to mess up and hurt the baby.

You are NOT alone. It is very common for women with no history of depression to have scary dreams about things going wrong with the baby, or to wrestle with waking worries. Very very normal.



I was totally sure I would miscarry, although I have no history of miscarriage and I am young and healthy. But it haunted me until we passed week 12.



As someone with a history of depression myself, I can really admire the battle you are going through. But it seems like you are just where you are supposed to be: you know in your head that these concerns are not founded on fact, they are things that you are scared about. See if your husband can help you out, he seems like a nice supportive guy. Explain to him "I need you to remind me every day that everything is fine with our baby, that he is going to come to us happy and healthy and that it will all work out okay." Let him reassure you. When I was struggling with my miscarriage concerns and would cry about my worries my husband would hug me and say "This baby loves us already. He is safe and happy. You are doing a great job growing our kid! Everything is going to be fine. I am sure of it." and it was just what I needed to hear to calm me down.

I understand. When my husband and I went in, I was so excited to see that there was a baby in there! And was hopeful that it was healthy. I was worried that there would be a sac with no baby. I was worried it would not have a heartbeat. I was worried it had stopped developing earlier. You name it, I feared it.



Unfortunately, I did see a problem right awa on the ultrasound. It threw me hard. Until we got an all clear 2 weeks later, I was a wreck.



You can only hope for the best. For most women, the ultrasound will go perfectly smoothly.

You are going to be fine! Seeing my little baby for the first time (at 10 weeks) was one of the most amazing experiences of the pregnancy. Both my husband and I cried just watching him squirm around on the screen. he was such an active little guy, so completely formed already! It was amazing and I truly believe that by tomorrow afternoon all these worries will be replaced by that kind of love.



And it is VERY natural to have dreams or worries about things going strange with the pregnancy.

Hun it's completely normal to have worries about your baby, especially if it's your first. Just take a deep breath, get a good nights sleep and tomorrow you will hear your baby's heartbeat and see it's little body. It really is an amazing sight.

Do you think my doc will have me admitted?



I've been having contractions anywhere from 6 - 10 minutes apart since around 9:00 last night.  I refused to go to the hospial until after I voted this morning.  I'm still having contractions, but they have not gotten be consistently 5 minutes apart for an hour.  However, they are are getting stronger and stronger.  I have an 11:15 OB appointment, and just decided to keep that rather than head to Labor & Delivery.  Do you think my doc will have me admitted, or just send me home until they are consistently 5 minutes apart?

Sheesh, if you're in labor and you are going to vote, what are you doing here?  Why didn't you vote early?  If you DO go and vote, who's to say your water won't break, you'll have to go to the hospital, but it will be too crowded to get out of the parking lot.



How about call your doctor's office and ASK THEM what they think you should do.

My guess is that your doctor will check you and then make a decision.  I started a childbirth class last night and she said that the intensity is often more important that the span of time between contractions.  Based on that, I'd say you'll be admitted.



Best of luck!!!!!

I actually delivered my baby with contractions about 6 minutes apart they never got regular or closer together. Every labour is different and so is every woman. You should go in they will check you, it's not about the contractions it's about how dilated you are.

You really don't want to wait too long.  I'd head to labor and delivery now.  If they don't think you need to be there, they'll send you home.  But it sounds like your baby is ready to come so I'd make sure I was in the proper setting for delivery.  Don't want to be in your car on the way to the hospital when the baby crowns.  Good luck!!!

Thank you so much for voting in spite of your contractions! I wouldn't go to the hospital until your contractions are closer and more regular. If you are admitted your contractions will slow from being in bed unable to move. try walking around it should help move you along and help your dilate faster. Best wishes!

I miss my baby girl so much?



I have an infant baby girl that's less then 3 months old, and me and the mother are no longer together. I am taking her to court to establish paternity and 50/50 custody. I miss my baby girl, its been a real rough year and my baby's mother is making it so hard for me. I only wanted to do right by her from the beginning but she just doesn't want me, but either way  I have to focus's on whats important and thats my daughter. In the meantime my baby's mother wont answer my calls or return my text's. What can I do in the meantime until the court hearing finalized. I miss my daughter like crazy, I try to keep occupied to forget about the problem, but it's so real that I can't forget it. A part of me wants to through my hands up and say **** it, but I know that I could not live with myself by abandoning my daughter I can't do that and I wouldn't be a man if I did. I need some words of wisdom and help right now. Thank you

You're doing the right thing i'm sure it's real hard to not be able to see your daughter, but unfortunately you're prolly gonna have to wait for the court hearing. But whatever you do don't give up on your daughter because she deserves a daddy that will love and care for her, good for you.

first...don't give up!!!  Second keep a log of all the calls and text messages you send asking to see your child....also keep a log of what all the responses were or if nothing was responded. (dates and times are very important).  Take this with you to court.  This will help ensure you get partial custody.  Some girls will do this so they can say you never spent time with your child and to try to get full custody so they get more child support.  The father is a very important figure in a child's life.  Be there for your daughter, and never give up fighting for her.

So sorry you're going through this! I'm not sure there's much you can do until the court grants you visitation. You should continue reaching out to her but if she doesn't respond there isn't much you can do at this point. I'll pray that you get your visitation soon so you can be with your little girl. Hang in there, OK!!!

First, definitely keep up with the court proceedings.  In the meantime, try to have your ex have an adult conversation with you.  Let her know you want what's best for the baby and that's two happy parents - if they're together or not.  And assure her that you won't take the baby away from her (unless she's unfit, of course).  Let her know you're not trying to hurt her, you just want to be the best dad possible.  I recently lost my dad, who fought for custody of me and my brother, and there is nothing in the world like a bond between a father and daughter!  I pray the justice system works in your favor.  Good luck and God bless!

Look at this crazy pregnancy story..i didnt know this was possible?



i was wondering because i have read about some amazing rare stories about people being pregnant and not knowin..



i dont have a period because i just stopped birth control 3 months ago so i guess my body is still re-adjusting but i changed my diet and everything an im still gaining weight and my stomach is big and looks pregnant but i jus thought it was water retention or something but i had white blood cells in my urine but i had no infection so the doc gave e antibiotics but i still have the white blood cells which i read may increase wen your pregnant..but i keep feelig this fluttering in my uterus and stomach...its not gas i definately know the difference so i know its not that..i know if you think about something 2 long you can make your self develope symptoms but thats not the case..yes my fiance and i have unprotected sex a lot so there is a possibility but how big of one??



if not pregnancy why am i feeling these flutters that ive been feeling for about 3 months now, what about the bad lower back pain, the nauses feeling, or the white blood cells in my urine with no knid of infection wat so ever?? the doctors cant seem 2 give me any good explinations could you please help?????



its not my mind playing tricks on me..i never thought about pregnancy until a couple of weeks ago..i jus thought it was a kidney infection or bladder infection so its not me mkaing my body do this, my body has been doing this for some time now..i had amiscarriage back in feb and i was on birth control since march, i havent had a period since then, i only spot bled about a month ago i was asking could i have gotten pregnant in that time even though i was on birth control with no period if i was ovulating..i keep cramping and having mood swings like my period wants 2 come but it never does



</question>



<additional details>



yes i have pregnancy symptoms..nausea, frequent urination (why i had my urine tested for infection, NOT PREGNANCY), mood swings, and extremly tired but i pass them off as being just hormonal or because my body is trying 2 have a period but my period never ever comes, jus cramps and eveything else but NO PERIOD



i dont want anything from RUDE people..im asking if you have gone through this or know any stories dont be rude

Did you take a pregnancy test?



I'm not trying to be mean...but what exactly do you want from us?  If the doctors still haven't figured out what is going on...do you think a bunch of people with no med school under their belts are going to be able to diagnose you?



Maybe it is possible to be pregnant...if I were you, I'd explain that to the docs and have them do a blood test.

umm if you have  "unprotected sex a lot" pregnancy is certainly a possibility. You certainly have some symptoms that suggest pregnancy. In addition, increased urination and sore breasts are two very common early symptoms--have you had either of those? At the same time, yes psychology or other physical issues can also make you manifest some of the symptoms you describe.



A home pregnancy test is only like $7 at the drug store. Pee on a stick first thing in the morning and know for sure before your doctors start putting you through a battery of tests that could be harmful to the (potential) baby.

I just checked up on your previous questions and since you claim to be a med lab student why the heck haven't you tested your own blood for pregnancy.  also you have been asking over and over what do we think is going on and time and time again perople are telling you to test.  so go test and stop asking.  seem like you already know the answer and are justr wasting our time!



What I wrote before i check on you:
lol.. i watched a story on TLC yesterday and it was about 4 women who didn't know they were pregnant until they were delivering!!  one hadn't had a period is 17 years!  another thought she was perimenopausal, another took antibiotics while on the pill and hrmm maybe there was only 3..  but then they didn't think anything of how they felt during the pregnancy and then had all these crazy deliveries.. like one happened to be taking her mom for dialysis, she had twins!  another thought she had a bad stomache flu and went to a local hospital, another thought she had a really bad backache..  it was so crazy and the whole time the people this really happened too were swearing up and down they didnt know they were pregnant, as were their families!



i just re-read your 'question' and thought you were just relaying a story you read.. but now i realize you are actually saying this is you.. wow.. seriously go get tested for pregnancy.  and i hope you are just pulling our legs!!

We're not trying to be rude, but you keep asking the same question over and over and expect a miracle. Of course there have been people who have not known they were pregant and ended up being pregnant. I've had the same thing where I had all the pregnancy symptoms, and missed my period, and it ended up just being me being psychosamatic. I asked like a thousand questions on yahoo asking the same thing. Your not going to know unless you take a test. Every situation is different, just because someone else may have had the same thing happened and became pregnant, doesn't mean you will be. And since you just came off bc it seems like your body is just getting used to being off bc and the hormones are messing with you.

If you forget and take them asap and then keep going as you should, you will be ok. Because the chemicals are still in your body and it takes about a month or two to be able to get pregnant again after you stop taking the pill. However people who often forget to take it or are sloppy are not very well protected in the first place.

actually it takes about a month or maybe two for the pill to fully kick in anyways so you may not have been protected the while time, the doctor should have told you that when they prescribed it and/or it is on the package, but you shouldn't worry until you miss a period, and or feel like you might be pregnant, then you can take a test to know for sure.

It's very important to take it on time.  You also have not been on it for very long, so I'm not sure if you are even fully protected yet, even if taken on time.  Just keep taking it and cross your fingers.  fyi-those little buggers can live for a week inside you

If my last period was withdrawal bleeding from the pill...?



my last period was withdrawal bleeding from the pill because i stopped taking it in the middle of my cycle, i had sex on the 6th of october and came on my period on the 7th october but it was a withdrawal bleed from stopping the pills. i haven't taken any pills since then because we are trying to conceive we then had sex on the 29th unprotected, the pills would have been out of my system since the beginning of october right? i'm just confused because around he 29th i had the usual symptoms of ovulation, the gooey stringy discharge etc, so i was pretty sure i was ovulating, but i've been on ovulation sites and put in when my last period was, which would have been the 7th right, even if it was just a withdrawal bleed? but then obviously it says a different time i'm ovulating, although i definitely had ovulation symptoms then.
i'm just confused, what are the chances i'm pregnant, have i just completely messed up the system?

To be honest it depends from woman to woman.



It took 5 months for me to conceive after stopping the pill and I had many false alarms and always tried to have intercourse when I believed I was ovulating.  However since it can take several months for your body to get back to normal (my cycle ranged from 28 days to 35) it's difficult to pin point when you're most likely to be most fertile.  I'd wait til you're about 35 days since the first day of your last period and if nothing arrives take a test.  If negative chart how many days between your period so you can get at least an estimate of when you're likely to be ovulating.



Hope this helps x

You need to rely on your body's signals that you're ovulating not some stupid website.  Those things are designed for the average 28 day cycle with ovulation on day 14.  That almost never happens!  Rely on your own symptoms, not a computer that doesn't even know you.

Most doctors would tell you to wait 6 months after going off the pill to make sure that it is out of your system because you are more likely to have a miscarriage. Plus that gives your body time to get back together and your ovulating will be right.

Yes I did start having nose bleeds when I got pregnant and when I asked my doctor about it he said I was the fourth person that week to say the same thing. It must be pretty common with pregnancy. He said that it had to do with the amount of estrogen in your body and the membranes in your nose, he also said that it can cause your gums to bleed. I wouldn't think that I was pregnant just because my nose was bleeding though, take a home pregnancy test if you want to know for sure. Good Luck!

I lost weight in my first trimester also, I think its to do with you being a smaller size and only having a bit of exess fat on you, that when you get pregnant your body burns it up quickly for baby. and if you eat fairly healthy then you will notice it as you wont be putting weight on due to an unhealthy diet.  its nothing to worry about, as long as you start to put weight on now which you should do, its just one of those things.

Hiya, I wouldn't worry too much, I had a total lack of appetite at the beginning of my pregnancy. You have no doubt been busy getting excited about being pregnant and this has probably had an effect!

i think u are just showing your bum early, because you had a baby before. they say that the muscles are stretched from a previous pregnancy and you show earlier in your 2nd pregnancy/.

During early pregnancy you have alot of water retention and most women look bloated. I never got my bump till almost 24 weeks. This is child number three and I think I'm backwards cause each baby bump showed later in pregnancy.

Well, I  have wide hips, so I don't seem to show for a while.  I would say around 4-5 months is average for me.  On the other hand, I feel bloated right away and hardly fit into my jeans after 3 months.  I get jealous when I see a lady (whom I used to babysit) who is due 2 weeks before me and she already has this huge baby bump!  No one can even tell I am pregnant yet and I am about 15 weeks now.  I even had a tummy tuck after having children, so I started with a flat stomach.  I think everyone is different, but I'm trying to enjoy the fact that I can still wear my jeans and not worry about the baby showing that I'm not just getting fat.  Smile.  I'm going on and on, but I think it really depends on each pregnancy and the size of your baby.  By the time I am 8 months, people will be asking if I am having twins, so just enjoy the time of just looking bloated.  I always feel bloated too almost right away.  Hang in there.

With my first, I started showing around 16 weeks.  With this one (my second), I feel like I've been "showing" since I found out I was pregnant!  With the way I've been feeling though, I think I'm just bloated.  I was having tummy troubles for about two weeks, and I swear I looked six months!  So, I think you're probably just bloated.  If you don't notice a change, you might be showing!  Congrats and good luck!

Buy the monistat kit, it works, but my sister swears by canestin. You can get the one time treatment and it comes with a little tube of cream which stops the itching and burning on the outside right away.

Wow, you sound just like me..I am 32 weeks and just a couple days ago I started itching down there like inside (if you know what I mean) and its so uncomfortable. I looked on my paper my dr gave me of all the meds and stuff I can use but the only itching stuff they have on there is like calamine lotion and others nothing on what to use for yeast infections..grrr. So I was just gonna go to the store and look on all the labels and stuff to see if any say its safe to use during pregnancy or whatever...so Monistat got bad reviews?? I have never had one before so I don't even know where to start. I guess I will see what others put on here hopefully one will tell us a good one to use.
Its very embarrassing also when I am at work and I can sit still and wanna put my hand down my pants every 5 minutes..haha, the stuff we go through for our babies!

I agree with the answerer about the AZO. It works, it's safe, and it works FAST It also helps KEEPS infections away if you keep taking it. You'll notice a difference by the end of the day. In the meantime, you can get Vagisil cream. I don't have any problems with that. Sorry about your little problem. :| Yeast infections suck.



You can get the AZO at Walgreen's or Wal-Mart, pretty much anywhere. It's OTC. :)

Uh...my doctor prescribed me something like the monistat cream. He said that the cream itself could be dangerous to the baby but he wanted to treat it so that I wasn't uncomfortable for the remainder of my pregnancy. The cream he prescribed to me is called Terconazole Vaginal Cream. You use it over a period of three nights, I felt results after the first night. Perhaps you should ask your doctor about this.

Just needed to share this!!?



I'm now 22wks2day! I just found out last week that we are having a baby boy! At first I was a little disappointed only because I was mind set on a girl and all the things that I could do, but I'm so happy to have a little baby boy and kept thinking of all the fun that I will have with him!. The only jealous thing is he does A LOT of kicking at night around 9-10 and the nights that my hubby works until 9:30 he doesn't kick! He only kicks when my husband is around :( BUT I'm happy cause as of 10/28/08 I'm having a VERY healthy little boy and couldn't be happier, I just wanted to share with everyone

Congratultions!



My son loved kicking most for his daddy too. If you want to feel him move when daddy's not around, lie on your left side and relax as much as possible; and try giving him a gentle nudge with your fingers. If that doesn't work, he might just really like daddy's voice. Which is a good thing, though; since once he's born, he'll be addicted to you and the only thing that can sooth him sometimes is momma's voice. It's a little annoying, since you feel like you can't get a break, but sweet at the same time. Getting him started on daddy's voice as soon as possible is the way to go! :)

Can you get pregnant if you had sex a week or a few days before your period?



Is it safe to have sex a week or a few days before your menstrual period? I'm supposed to be having my period anytime this week but I just had sex with my boyfriend. We did use a condom but I just wanted to make sure if the chances of me getting pregnant is still likely.

I'm 13 weeks pregnant. Having a really bad headache. Been vomiting more too. I though it will feel better after 12 weeks. It's been worst actually.



I'm also having low lying placenta. So was on long leave. Just started work today and everything sucks. My job require me to stand for long hours. My cramps started again and my brown discharge has increase also. Pretty worried too.. Had a miscarriage in August.

I would consider myself one of the lucky ones too.  I only got sick once during my first trimester.  My energy is finally picking up and I feel like doing more.  My ownly downfall so far has been lack of energy.  Now that I'm on to the 2nd trimester I hope I get my mojo back lol.  Good luck and congrats!

Speeding up labor. A few questions. 10 points!?



I'm only 32 weeks right now. BUT I am already thinking ahead. I am due on Xmas day and we really want him to be born b4 that. Our doctor already said when I am 39 weeks, she will do a membrane sweep. I KNOW those only work like 70% of the time, but whatever. I'm still going to do it. I was wondering tho, after I get it done should I have a lot of sex and walk a lot? Or should I be doing that b4 I get the membrane sweep? What order should I go in to try and get things moving along quickly? I know he will come in his own time and blah blah blah. BUT what will be the MOST effective way for me to go about doing these things to try and speed up the process?

I would have sex after the membrane sweep.  You could also stimulate your nipples a lot, if you have a breast pump you could try pumpiing a bit.  After all that go for a long walk or a bumpy car ride.  Good luck!!!

Lots of walking and sex! let your husband c*m in you as much as possible to get things going. I would start now so that you might not even have to go in for the sweep. get on all fours and sway back and fourth. but WALKING is your best bet! I did this with my son who was supposed to be due 12/4 and i had him on 11/22!

I am taking a childbirth class and my instructor told us last night that walking does not induce labor.  She said that it can really tire you out and can actually slow down labor if it should start, because you are too worn out to work hard!  I've heard that sex can help speed things along.  My instructor said that the best thing you can do is try to stay really relaxed--that helps the hormones necessary for labor to start to work their best.  If you get stressed or anxious, labor can really stall out.



Hopefully you'll see your baby before Christmas!  Good luck!

It doesn't work 70% of time. I don't know where you got that statistic.  It takes three times for a sweep to work, and it works better at 40 weeks.

No form of birth control is 100 percent unfortunately.  Most like a beginning period of time to get to full affect and that varies with the drug and the agency testing the drug.



Get a pregnancy test done, because if you are pregnant, you will want to discontinue use of your birth control until the pregnancy has resolved itself in some manner.

My doctor told me that if you start taking it on the first day of your period then you should be protected after the first couple of days. If not then it should take a week or so to start protecting you. You should be fine. It is important to remember that it isn't 100% effective, and that it is possible for someone to get pregnant so if you're worried then wait a couple of weeks and then take a test but the chances are you're not pregnant.

just try to keep your skin moisturized. there isnt anything to get rid of stretch marks sorry to say. but you shouldnt cry over them. you got them because your going to have a beautiful baby. be proud of your body and what is going to come out it. talk to your dr about your bipolar and see if there is some medicine you can get on.

Everything is going to be ok.  Leaking milk is normal and you just need to go get some breast pads.  After taking a warm shower, is when I had the most leaking.  You will be ok.  Just make sure you keep going to your doctor visitis and make sure you tell them exactly how you feel with your bipolar and all.  Sometimes, they will be able to change out your medication so you can feel a little better.  It isn't good for you to be depressed during pregnancy either.  It's true that a pregnant woman has hormones out of control right now, but sometimes you can use a little extra.  Just hang in there.

You need a doctor if you are depressed. Leaky breasts are normal. I started leaking at 17 weeks! And about the stretch marks... theres nothing you can do. They will never go away. They are scars. You can use lotions and oils to fade them! Eventually they will fade from redish purple to a silvery white. But they will always be there. I still have and will always have mine from 5th grade from puberty!

Its normal for ur breasts to be leaking - no need to worry.
As for ur stretch marks - there is no way ur going to stop them, no matter what u put on ur skin.  Just try using coco butter cream.
I dont yet have any stretch marks on my belly and i am 30 weeks pregnant but thats not to say the pregnancy hasnt coursed any cause it has, I noticed 2 weeks ago i have them under my breasts.
I rub coco butter on my skin every 2 days.



If u want or need to cry - do it.
U will notice u feel so much better after u have had a good cry instead of bottling it up.



Hope u feel better soon honey :)

leaking breast are normal.
and as for the stretch marks bio oil will only help prevent anymore from showing up.
try coco butter too. and switch back and forth between the coco butter and bio oil.



after you have the baby they will fade a little.



but if you have really bad stretch marks the only thing that will get rid of them is surgery.

Are early pregnancy symptoms constant or do they come and go? ?



For the past couple of days I've been really nauseous, but today I feel completely free of any discomfort. I'm about 5 weeks now, but I want to know from any moms or moms-to-be out there if they had days when they felt completely normal. Nausea is the only pregnancy symptom I have (no sore boobs, increased CM, etc). My first prenatal doctor visit isn't until a month away and it's my first so I'm a little anxious (but very excited)!

Hey,
I'm a little bit further along than you, 7 weeks on Thursday.  I had bad morning sickness starting at 3.5 weeks, but it came and went.  Now that I'm getting further along in the pregnancy, it sticks around more.  The exhaustion was the one thing that hasn't given me a break yet.  Anyway, you'll probably notice yourself having more pregnancy symptoms in a week or two, it's when they tend to come on full swing.  Then again, you may be one of those lucky ones.  Good luck and congratulations =]

I'm about 6 wks and I was worried too at first about symptoms coming and going, but by reading previous Q&A on here, it seems very normal.  This whole week I've felt... not pregnant... but my boobs are still very tender.  There are days when I'm very nauseous and days when I'm not.. I guess we just have to enjoy it. Good luck in your pregnancy!

Weird pains in lower abdomen, pregnancy? or what?



last month I started getting this weird pain in my lower left abdomen. So I called my doctor, and was seen, first thought was tubular pregnancy. well it was negative. knew it couldn't come back positive because i had JUST ovulated. So my doctor thought maybe cyst on my ovaries, witch is what i was thinking. so i got a ultrasound, to look at everything. Everything came back normal, i started feeling a little better. Then I "started" my period. I normally start on CD 29, but i started CD 31. I normally have my period for about 4-5 days. it lasted 3. It was quite light too. after my period ended i started getting REALLY tired, and my back was hurting even more then it normally does. i was still getting that pain once and a while. well now I'm getting the pain pretty bad, for 3 days. now its more of a cramp across the lower abdomen. I really just don't know what it is.. i just dont feel right. so i told my boyfriend that i wanted to get a pregnancy test, just to clear my mind. of course it came back negative.



with my daughter i had cramping from about 5 weeks to 13 weeks. that's why I'm thinking so much that I'm pregnant, but nothings coming back positive. Ive looked everywhere to try to find out what this pain could be. I know that it can sometimes take weeks for a positive result to come, but i don't think i could be pregnant, but maybe?

Th third labour is reputably the most painful in respect of the after-pains but my second was the worst!



My third was a bit complicated, the baby had the cord around it's neck, not that we knew at the time, all we knew was that with each contraction the babies heart-rate would slow down. Because of this I was not allowed pain-relief and considering that, th pain was not too bad at all.



If you are expecting your third, good luck and here's hoping for a relatively pain free labour!

Bleeding at 6.5 weeks pregnant. Should I expect the worst?



I am 6.5 weeks pregnant. I had a rountine scan on Saturday which showed a fetal heartbeat and all seemed well.
However on Sunday I came down with a nasty virus and had a very high temperature for most of the day.
Last night (Monday) I started to have some light bleeding which is continuing today.



I spoke to the on-call doctor last night who told me it is probably a miscarriage and that there is nothing that can be done. I am hopefully going to the early pregnancy unit today to have a scan.



Has anyone else had bleeding at this stage of pregnancy - what was the outcome (good or bad)?

Light bleeding can be normal this early in a pregnancy. But it's always a good idea to get it checked out. I would get in to see your doctor as soon as you can so your beta hCG levels can be checked, and if you had them drawn Saturday compared to those values.



I am sorry that you have to go through this...it is difficult to wait. Hugs to you.

I had bleeding at 6 weeks and everything was fine.



It could be serious, it could just be normal spotting. Statistically speaking though, once a heartbeat is seen the chances of miscarriage go down to about 2%. So there is a possibility but not likely a miscarriage.

I am so sorry, but my experience as an OB/GYN office nurse and my experiences with 5 miscarriages says that this is PROBABLY going to end in miscarriage.  6.5 weeks is just to early to really do any medications or bedrest or anything to save the pregnancy.  Go ahead and scream, cry, yell, whatever...and don't let anyone tell you how to feel about this.  Early miscarriages can be just as painful as later ones.  God Bless you.

This has just happened to me as I turned 6 weeks. Sunday I started bleeding, I knew of many women who spotted so I wasn't to worried at first. Later on I started getting cramps and a few clot tissues, then I was pretty sure I was having a miscarriage. I went to the doctor today, had blood drawn and get the results tomorrow, though I already know what's going to be said.



I'm not sure if it's anything to worry about with only light bleeding, that can be normal. If you start cramping or clotting and having tissue like clots of blood, that's a sure sign of miscarriage.



I hope to God that everything goes well and your baby is fine.



Even so early on in the pregnancy, it's heartbreaking for a miscarriage to happen. I already loved the baby that was growing inside of me and I can't believe it's gone just like that.

I no how u feel. Iam on my fouth pregnancy and everyone i had blood present in three of them and one ended up in a miscariage.
This bleeding could be a misscarriage and it might not.
If the The blood gets heavy and cramping alot and i mean the cramps are really bad than it most likly to be a misscarriage and if u get clots as well.
But some women that experience misscarriages dont experience all these signs so just letting u no that okay.......
But my other did have heavy blood through different stages in her pregnancy and she said it turned out to be pacenta preclamsia, which mean that can be dangerious to u and the baby but women had successful deliveries and healthy babies. But through Csections.

Vaginal bleeding can occur frequently in the first trimester of pregnancy and may not be a sign of problems. But bleeding that occurs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy can often be a sign of a possible complication. Bleeding can be caused by a number of reasons.Bleeding can be a sign of miscarriage but does not mean that you´ll be having one.
Signs of Miscarriage include:
Vaginal bleeding (quite a lot,like a period or stronger)
Cramping pain felt low in the stomach (stronger than menstrual cramps)



Tissue passing through the vagina



I just hope your baby will be OK.
I was bleeding on my first pregnancy,when I was 8 weeks pregnant.The blood was darker than the period blood,and just small quantity.My baby was perfectly OK.So I just hope you don´t have a miscarriage.I´ll keep my fingers crossed.

You should certainly be ready to find out the worst, although it may not come to that. I've twice had spotting at that stage of pregnancy that was the first sign of a miscarriage. I've also twice had spotting/light bleeding at the same stage, that wasn't a miscarriage. It just seems to be the way my body reacts to pregnancy. Hopefully you will be the same. Try to get as much rest as you can. Good luck.

Honey, all I can say to you is - get it checked out!!! I will honestly keep you in my thoughts, and keep us posted....sending tons and tons of baby dust your way angel!!!

hey hun,



as you know I am also pregnant (6 weeks 6 days) I have bled twice throughout this pregnancy and am going to my early pregnancy assement unit at 1.20 pm to find out what has happened with my baby.



I know what you are going through but I still have the symptoms - so I am thinking hopefully, but I am also preparing for what might be.



Remember after you have seen the heartbeat the chances of miscarraige are low.



Good luck hun I know too well what you are going rthrough - as I am going through the EXACT same thing.



I wish u lots of luck xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Is it normal to get pains in my lower stomach while I am pregnant? ?



Hi I am 23 years old and am pregnant with my first child. I am only 7 weeks into my pregnancy and feel some discomfort and pains in my lower stomach. Is that normal? It comes and goes some people tell me its my uterus stretching to make room for the baby. But while reading alot of articles online, I am a little freaked out about miscarriages and making sure the baby is healthy. There is no bleeding with these cramps, but sometimes hurt alot.

If you don't have any other miscarrige symptoms, then it is most likely round ligament pain. these are being stretched by both homones and your uterus. If you do experience bleeding or other symptoms go see a doctor.

Many women experience lower abdominal pain during early pregnancy.  While there are a lot of bad reasons why you might be experiencing it, most of the time everything is just fine.  It could be a sign of preecmaplsia, miscarriage, preterm labor, ectopic pregnancy.... but I don't mean to scare you!  Most likely everything is just fine.



As long as this pain is not accompanied by bleeding, excessive discharge, or other worrisome symptoms, you should be ok.  But do not hesitate to call your doctor!  These days most doctors would rather have you come in and get checked out than leave you to worry by yourself.

I have twins, they're nearly eight years old now. When I was pregnant every symptom seemed to be exaggerated, so what you're experiencing is perfectly normal, you have double the amount of hormones in your body, you are literally twice as pregnant as everyone else! It's hard having twins because the softening effect on your ligaments is worse as is things like heartburn, you'll be okay, just get lots of rest and try not to worry too much. Good luck, having twins is awesome!

ye its totally ok,
it is a bit earlier than normal but theres no definate week when its ok to start leaking.
maybe the extra hormones you would have with twins is bringing it on earlier.
i leaked from about 16 weeks on and had very sore and cracked nipples so maybe you should start using a nipple cream now to prevent it!



good luck threw the pregnancy and congratulations x x x

Did we do the pregnancy test correctly?



I'm just suspicious about the results of the test. My wife hasn't had her period yet, but the test gave us a negative, meaning she isn't pregnant. A little bit more details: she was expecting her period to come around the second-third week of October. Up to today, it hasn't "arrived", so we did the test. By the way, she's irregular, but her period hasn't arrived for a month already, prompting her to take the test. I just wanted to make sure if we did it correctly. Is there a specific time (meaning week or hour) to take the test?

no the test should work right no matter what time of day it is.  it test for hormones in your body.  you might want to go to the doctor and have a test done there.. or wait a week and try it again, if her periodis already irregular it may just be way off this month

they usually say first morning urine is best because it has the most HCG that is what they are testing but since it's still early maybe she needs a blood test, my dr. wrote me a prescription for one which you take to the hospital and they tell you with an hour or so depending how busy the lab is.

Honestly, since she is irregular... you cant rely on her period alone as there are bigger issues involved it seems.  There is no specific time to take it.. some are better depending on how early you test, but it wouldve definitely showed up at this point if her missing pd was the culprit to being pregnant.



She may want to get checked out for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.. basically cysts that prevents her from ovulating. That is a symptom. If she has it, the cysts will prevent her from ovulating normally... and obviously without ovulation there would be no period or 'cleansing' of the female system.

Best time to test is early in the morning. The 1st urine as it's more concentrated. Otherwise maybe you could go to the doctor to get a blood test done. It's more accurate. My friend miss her period for 2 weeks and all 5 urine test are negative. In the end she went for a blood test and it's a positive result. She has a healthy baby boy now. GOOD LUCK!!

the very best time to do a pregnancy test is first wee of the morning as more hormones are present in the urine.  test first thing tomorrow. you can get a false neg test result but not a false positive as the tests check for a hormone only present when a woman is pregnant or on certain drugs (her doctor would have told her if she was on these meds).  if the test result comes back neg again you can arrange a blood test to check if she is preg.  best of luck!

Since her period is irregular it will be hard to judge by that alone.  Is she having any other pregnancy symptoms?



As for the home test coming back negative, you can't always trust those anyway.  With my first child and the one I'm carrying now the tests I took a week after missing my period came back negative because my body was not yet producing enough of the pregnancy hormones for the test to pick it up.



I would say just give it time and wait for other symptoms, if she has none and her period still does not start go to the doctor.

It helped me conceive baby #2, and I don't mind getting my period anymore since it's PMS free and cramp free! Really!



MAM is so great I decided to become a practitioner.

To all those girls out there who think fingering leads to pregnancy, IT DOES NOT.



Just make sure the semen does not come in contact.

ahem...wellllllll..i was in the same situation as ur friend last month...andddd i DOUBT that she's pregnant because it's TOO rare to get pregnant by fingering...UNLESS some of his C-U-M/sperm got on his finger and then had some sort of contact with hers as well. (but remember that the sperm cannot survive once it reaches the outside world, altho it CAN live inside a girls vagina for quite a while.) so it's highly uncommon to get pregnant that way. (assuming the sperm did not reach up the vagina/C-U-M) so she should not panic or worry at all. make sure she just takes a pregnancy test just to be sure and safe. (: SHE IS PROBABLY JUST PARANOID. that's all.



if it's any reassuring at all...i TOO missed MY period as well and i was like 2 weeks late seriously so i was freakiiin' out, (like my boobs were swelling up & i was pretty happy bout it, but shiiiit i seriously thought i was pregant) like i was even hallucinating and feelin kicks in my stomach....butttt turns out...i was just paranoid. (: Luckily & thankfully.



You are very welcome.

I have this EXACT same problem!
This is exactly what me & my bf did & now I'm scared I may be pregnant too!
I havn't missed my period yet but the month is just starting & mine are irregular so I never know when they're really coming. Is she like this too because that could explain it.
Maybe it's just taking a bit longer, maybe she's stressed that could be it as well.
A lot of girls miss periods especially if it's the first year.
And it is also only possible if he had some sperm on his fingers.
Tell her to deffinately go and get a pregnancy test to reasure herrself, because she could be pregnant, or it could just be stress or other factors.

Better to be safe than sorry whatever the circumstances



Pregnancy tests are so cheap to buy and a lot more advanced than they used to be



Sometimes the stress and worry of wondering if you are pregnant can also delay a period as well

Chances are she is not pregnant, but sometimes when you are under alot of stress it can cause a delayed or missed period, tell your friend to take a test if she wants to know for sure, But I am pretty sure she isn't

If it's her 1st time, she could miss a period or because of the stress (like i did).

It happened to my friend for no apparent reason.  If you think you might be in labour prematurely, go to the doctor and get it checked out.  My friend was given steroids for a week (which helps the lungs develop) and he was born soon after about 32 weeks.  He was in an incubator for a while but is now completely fine and a normal healthy child.

I've never had premature labor but was always overdue which is also a risk factor. Premature labor can come from stress, caffeine, over activity, or uterine complications. There is no precise answer for that because women I know that are very healthy have gone through premature labor. If you're overdue, the baby can pass a BM in the womb and inhale/swallow it which will cause infection and lifelong respiratory problems.

there are no particular reasons for it happening, stress, high blod pressure, trauma like a fall or other causes can bring it on. but if the baby is born about 30 weks there is a good chance that it may be ok esoecially with all the medical advances. if you were to go into prematire labour you would be given an injection of steroids to strengthen the babies lungs and there are drugs that you would be given to try stop the labour and you would be put on bed rest. but there is no definite causes for it

I can answer the metallic taste, but not the single boob tenderness question.



The reason your mouth tastes metallic is because you have a sinus infection and it has irritated your tissues to the point that they are bleeding a little. A neti pot will fix you up pretty quick.

Unfortunately they wont have you take anything but Robitussin/Tusin generic! I know it sucks because I had bad bronchitis when I was early on in pregnancy and had to wait it out and only use that. They will let you use a rescue inhaler/ inhaler if it is necessary! That will depend upon if you have asthma and if you are having constriction in breathing! I was able to use an inhaler on a limited bases because I have asthma! The doctor said she would rather I be able to breath and get oxygen to baby then not to be able to breath and the baby be deprived of vital oxygen! If you can't get in you should be able to at least speak to a phone nurse whom can assist you with the meds you are taking and let you know which are safe and what you might take instead! Good luck!



P.S. Zyrtec is not safe! It is too strong and my doctor said to use Claritin non- drowsy! She said to look for the active ingredient Loratadine 10 mg and no stronger, one a day! She also said to only use that is it was very necessary from my allergies! Again consult your doctor to be sure!

Ah it most likely is stretch marks starting! My stretch marks always start out looking like a rash and begin to form in lines after a few days! Use lotions and vitamin E on your belly! Also use co co butter creams by Palmers. The lotions and creams may not seam to be helping at first but in the long run you'll have less and they will fade faster! Also next time your at he doctors ask just to be sure! Good luck!

You probably have the "pregnancy rash".  If it's really bad your Dr can give you a steroid injection to make it go away.  It's common towards the end of preg.  I have one right now on my right shin, but I am only in my 2nd trimester, so I don't know what's going on...but I will ask the Dr on thurs!  Good luck...hope it goes away soon for you!

You won't be sure to get pregnant, there is a small *chance* you will get pregnant. The problem is not every woman is regular in her ovulation and some women do ovulate during the period sometimes.



Really, though, you should use some kind of real birth control, either something hormonal like the pill or the shot or the ring or the implant, or an IUD or condoms. If you think you can't afford it, go to Planned Parenthood, they have a sliding scale, and if you're poor enough it's free.



Use one of those methods properly and you're 99% sure not to get pregnant.

during periods if you have sex means the chance of pregnancy is too low... its better avoiding sex during the time of periods as it is bleeding time and there is a lot chance for getting infection to both boy and girl.... if you want to have sex means do sex after her bleeding stops (bleeding will be over within 7 days you can do safe sex after these for 3-5 days) or within before 7 days before the periods starts.

abstinence based sex education at work.



a) If you're going to have sex practice safe sex- if you don't want to get pregnant use condomns or the pill, or the injection, or the hundreds of other options available to your and your partner that you can get from your pharmacist or doctor- no ifs, no buts, no other method but those prescribed will properly prevent pregnancy- and ONLY condoms will stop you guys from sharing diseases- don't take my word for it- ask your doctor- they are paid to tell you this stuff in strict confidence and hook you up with whatever contraceptive you decide upon.



b) don't have sex during periods- it's gross, it's unhygienic- it's really unhealthy- once a month, no sex for a few days- deal with it- this is how humans have always lived- there are lots of good reasons (and a few of them end in you losing that thing between your legs that gives you so much joy and frustration- seriously- an infected penis is not going to make anybody happy).

If you take closer notice on the Pepto Bismol bottle it clearly states that you are aloud to take Pepto up until the end of your pregnancy.  So I would not worry yourself at all.



It also sates that you should not give to a child or teen who is recovering from vomiting or diareah because it could be Ryes Syndrome.  It doesn't say that they can get it from the Pepto Bismol.



Don't worry at all about it.  You are not the first or the last pregnant person to have to take Pepto.  We have all been there.  May I suggest keeping Gavascon in the house for the next bout of heartburn, as the doctors don't recommend taking rolaids or tums.



Good luck!

Am i pregnant, please help?



It is now october first, the month of september i didn't have my period at all. My period comes different times during the month, but is over the whole skipping thing. My boyfriend and i decided a while back to have sex and we have been every time we are around each other sometimes more than once. Im not on birth control my mom and i were talking about it but she thinks its for my period. Im still young. We didn't have any condoms and we've been doing it. Yeah i know were stupid and dumb right. Well my boobs have been hurting nipples alittle tender. My stomach kills, and back pains. Ive always got headaches alot but not like in different places. I took a test last sunday and it said negative alot of people said i might have took it too early, and there are many false negatives. Any advice? Could i be pregnant?

I kept getting negatives until my period was due, and even right now they(the positive line) are sill faint (im due today). I would say you have a very good chance. Defiantly take another test. If you aren't you will be lucky and take it as a lesson. USE SAFER SEX! There's really no way of knowing all the places your boyfriend has been either, its always safe to use a condom before you get something that wont wash off, or worse catch a baby!

It seems like it could be either. It could be the start of early labour and if it is they will increase is strength (get more painful) and they will last for longer (lasting 30-60 seconds) and become more frequent. They will slowly become closer together until they are every 3 minutes lasting 30-60 seconds it is that time you would need to phone delivery suite. You would also need to phone if your baby does not move as much as normal or is you start bleeding of if your waters break.



But the contraction which you are feeling now could be a false alarm and they could all settle down and stop and start again when they feel like it. It could be your body having a practice run.
I hope this helps you.
Good luck you will be fine!

look for other signs that you might be going into labour. it might be just braxton hicks. check for a pinky discharge, abdominal pains or your waters breaking. theyare ten mins apart so don't get stressed. you got a long time till they are 2 mins apart. give it another hour and if the pains are getting more painful and the contractions are getting closer together then get yourself to your doctors so you can be checked over to make sure.

Hey the first scan is so amazing you see it moving around on the screen all they do is put gel on your tummy and scan it they check the size of the baby and  tell you your due date and if you have the test done to find out if your baby will have downs syndrome they just check the cub sizes on the babies neck i wanted to just stay there all day looking at it it really is amazing make sure your bladder is full but not too full mine was too full i had to try emptying it about 3 times you will also get pictures away with you and get to see the heart beat  Good Luck x

it seems from reading other questions and answers on this site that different countries have scans at different times but in Australia the first one is usually at 12 weeks and they briefly check internal organs and arms, legs and measure length and heart beat etc. but the main reason for that scan is to measure the fold on the back of the neck to determine the chances of your baby having down syndrome it goes for about half an hour you cannot find out the sex at thyis scan but the next one at 18 weeks they can and they spend about an hour checking everything they can see (the baby wont always cooperate) good luck and have fun



ps I had to go back twice for my 12 week scan because baby was facing the wrong way to measure the neck

Well, I'm currently pregnant with my second child & no matter how many children you have the excitement is still the same.  As you are only a few months into your pregnacy you may not be able to tell much from the scan.  My first time around, I had a scan at 10 weeks and my baby looked like a jelly-bean.  It wasn't until around the 18-20 week mark that your baby will look like a baby on the unltrasound screen.  The first scan is done to tell you the exact day that you are due.  The appointment doesn't go for very long at all and these days you get a disk with all the pictures on them.  Hope all goes well.

aww i was sooo excited too. i got mine about 2 weeks ago and i was 16 weeks pregs at that stage.



the appointment itself wasn't that long but it was great. i had heard the baby's heart beat at my 12 week appointment with the midwife but when i actually seen it on the screen it was unbelievable. that was when it really hit my that i am going to be a mother. my man loved it too, we just lay there looking at this little person squirming around in my stomach.



and i got a picture too, which i cant stop looking at!! i carry it everywhere with me.



it only takes 5 mins to do the scan, you will prob see midwife too but she will only take blood pressure, i was only about half an hour up there altogether.



you will love it though.

Normally at this scan you will need to have a full bladder (not so full that it's uncomfortable!) as this will push up your uterus and gives a clearer view. That's all you're expected to do for it really. At my scan, the sonographer put the rather cold scan gel on my belly, got a picture up on the screen but kept the telly turned away to she could check everything first (I was told this was totally normal procedure, so don't panic if this happens!) and then turned the screen so we could see it. Words can't describe how amazing that is. I don't know about you, but before I saw my baby I didn't feel pregnant - I had all the symptoms, but due to my morning sickness i'd lost a lot of weight and I wasn't really showing at all. It's truely incredible to see this little tiny person on the screen, knowing that she was actually there! (Obviously at this point I didn't know the gender, but have since found out). Seeing her heart beating as well hit me hardest, it brought tears to my eyes. The sonographer checks out everything - limbs, heart, kidneys etc. and record them on notes within your maternity notes. Depending on how co-operative the baby is, this could take anything from 20 mins to an hour.. there's no set time as to how long they should or will take. At my scan though, I think what made us laugh the most was that my daugher wouldn't co-operate for the sonographer haha. I had to lift my bottom in the air and wriggle my belly to try and get her to move, and had to repeat this about 3 times before she obliged!



Make sure you ask questions about anything if you're not sure, make sure you ask for photos (if your hospital allows this of course) and have some change in case there is a charge for photos. Enjoy it hunny!!

If you are just telling that, you thought of a creative way to tell them, I would love to hear what it is, since you didn't mention it.



Now, If you are looking for suggestions about how to tell them, my mind is already burning with ideas.



1. You could go over to your in-laws home.  Before eating dinner, you could secretly(and strategically) tape the announcement to one of the dinner plates.  Under the guise of being overly gracious, put the plate aside.  Then, If you would be eating at the table, place it where you mother-in-law would most likely sit.  Then, Make sure she sat, where you put the plate.  Make it so she sees' the letters on the note, without any problem.  On the note(to be taped to the plate), write the 'Grandma',  Wait to see her reaction, to see if it sinks in, what the word means.  Even do that with your father-in-law's plate.  Just look out for broken dishes, from the excitement.



2.  Even if you live close by, another idea would be sending them a telegram and, being there, the day the telegram is delivered.  I think you can get an idea of, how long it would take to get there.



3. If you can get your hands on a video camera, videotape you n' you husband telling his parents, they are going to be grandparents.  Then, Tell his parents you have a video you would like them to see and, that you would like to watch it together.



In all three scenarios, I can imagine, your mother-in-law, jumping up and, screaming out of shear joy.

Mine got more and more and more swollen with each pregnancy.  It's normal  b/c of increased blood flow, hormones, etc.  The only thing that helped us was LOTS of lube, even if your not dry.

If its swollen then you might have an infection such as thrush- we are both at the same stage in pregnancy and i had this issue a couple of weeks ago. Either that or you just need to use lots of lube- but if its making sex uncomfortable too then maybe wait until you've seen the doc who can tell you whats really wrong- i'm sure hubby won't mind waiting a bit!!!!

39 Weeks Pregnant - FRUSTRATED!?



im 39 weeks pregnant, almost 40.  For the past couple of weeks ive had stomach cramps, backpain, baby has dropped, generally feeling like I might be in labour - or approaching it.  Last night I was getting quite painful cramps (low down), and found it difficult to walk.  However, this morning I feel OK, no stomach pains, a little backpain, I have a tightening feeling but thats nothing strange.
whats going on.. do you think i should just go to hospital to get checked out or wait and c what happens as im not late yet.

I think your getting Braxton Hicks. Usually women will notice them by casually brushing their hands against their protruding belly and notice that it has tightened, while others will notice the tight feeling without having to feel it with their hands. Don't panic if you don't notice them. Some women only notice them because they find them to be uncomfortable.



While Taber's medical dictionary may say that they are painless, pregnant women tell a different story, though most would call it uncomfortable rather than painful. If you experience discomfort or pain with these practice contractions, try out techniques you've learned in class to deal with labour, such as breathing, relaxation, massage, movement and more. Often women will find that simply changing position can help with any pain from these contractions. A nice warm bath or shower can also help relieve any achiness and promote relaxation.



So how would you tell the difference between a Braxton Hicks contraction and a true labor contraction? Generally true labour contractions will get longer in length, closer in frequency and stronger in intensity. A Braxton Hicks contraction might get closer together but not consistently, or they may feel stronger but go away when you move around. Some moms say that they only experience Braxton Hicks contractions when moving around and they cease when mom sits down.



Calling your doctor or midwife should happen if you have contractions closer than 12 minutes apart prior to 37 weeks, as this might indicate preterm labour and not Braxton Hicks contractions.



While these many seem like an annoyance, yet another thing to deal with in pregnancy, they are believed to be helpful in preparing your body for labour, even though no noticeable progress can be seen.



True Labour vs. Braxton Hicks



Braxton Hicks V True Labour



Contractions don't get closer together. Contractions do get closer together.



Contractions don't get stronger. Contractions do get stronger.



Contractions tend to be felt only in the front. Contractions tend to be felt all over.



Contractions don't last longer. Contractions do last longer.



Walking has no effect on the contractions. Walking makes the contractions stronger.



Cervix doesn't change with contractions. Cervix opens and thins with contractions.

Try combining the ovulation kit with charting.



Taking your temperature every morning and checking your cervical mucus will let you know when ovulation may be approaching so you won't waste your kits.



The best thing for you to do would be to take a trip to the doctors and they can explain all this to you properly so you're not stabbing in the dark.

i already take my temperature...but its all over the place because i have a cold i think, and also if i take my temp that doesnt really help me to know when i ovulate, i would only know one day after it already happened because the temp goes up a day after you ovulate, so that doesnt help me at all.

Well most of the time the pill takes a full cycle to start working properly! So yes I would say you could have got pregnant from that but you may also not have. Be more careful and do things the way they are supposed to be done so you wont have to worry.Good luck.

If you are pregnant, you are going to have to get used to needles.
I'm terrified of them, but still had to get blood taken for the blood pregnancy test, and then for testing after they knew I was pregnant.



You're going to have to suck it up eventually.

I am also scared of needles and blood. But I went for a blood test to see how far pregnant I am. And it really wasn't that bad, it just burnt a bit when the nurse took the needle out (the alcohol they use to clean the skin). It really wasn't as bad as I imagined, it is over very quickly. Just do it, it will be over before you know. Good luck!!

well it does sound like you are pregnant as its very rare to get a false positive, the 2 negatives could be because it was a cheaper brand that does not detect high amounts of the hcg hormone like the 1st response does, but as it seems you are pregnant you will have to have lots of blood test so i would just go for it and get the 1st blood test out the way, good luck

Your Dr can confirm it with another urine test, and if it's positive they will schedule your first dating ultrasound.  But, just like everyone else said, you will have to get used to being poked.  They take what seems like a ton of blood from you at one of the first few visits, then of course the lovely IV while giving birth, plus epidural, plus whatever else, etc. lol.  The blood test at the Dr will be the most accurate because it will tell you your HCG level.  So, if I were you, I would just get the blood test done if your Dr is offering it!  Good luck and congrats if you are!!

Generally, if you are pregnant, you will have to get a blood test to confirm it anyway.



When I was pregnant with my son, I had 3 positive tests and I still had to have blood drawn. I was so freaked out I threw up, then fainted. But we got it done!



I would trust the first response over the other two. I know it can read pretty low levels. Dollar store? Eh.



Call your doctor, tell them about the 3 tests, and ask if you need to come in for a blood test.

Sore hips in pregnancy?



I'm 22 weeks preg and for the last  6 days my hips have hurt ALOT when I walk when I am sitting or laying down they are fine I'm sure this is probably pretty normal with all the stretching and rearranging my body has to do to fit a growing baby but does anyone have any advice on relieving the pain coz I work on my feet all day and I cant afford to take another week off . I've tried walking it out that makes it worse, laying down all day today didnt help, baths and panadol do nothing any suggestions appreciated

You could always try some antenatal yoga or some simple stretches in the evening after having a bath- it will help you to become more supple and therefore your body should be able to cope with the stretching and rearranging a bit more easily- you can also try rubbing a small amount of deep heat lotion on your joints to help soothe the pain- although not too much!!! lying down will only make you feel more stiff so you do need to keep moving even if it is only small stretches!

Hi, I had this same problem, sadly, unless you can lay down there isn't much you can do. Its from the baby pushing on your spine in a funny way. Maybe a nice back rub when you get home would work? I used to rub icy hot on it all the time, it takes the real bad pain away but doesn't take all of it away. Also maybe going in for a better pair of shoes, I know its sounds funny but my doctor told me if you work on your feet all day, you should get a pair of "nurses" shoes, they are made for standing and it would help with taking the stress off your body. That did work for me. Good luck, I feel for you.



Omg I almost forgot two very important ones, I have a yoga ball, one of the bigger ones and I used to sit on it with my legs spread and to the side and I would roll my hips around in a circular motion, oh did that ever so  help me. Also I would get in the position of if you where doing it doggie style (With your butt up) and  roll your hips again in a circular motion like on the ball. This helps move the baby off the spine and it is supposed to help with a better delivery.  I could go on..

Maybe your doctor can give you a note for restricted work, of to sit while working. Try sleeping differently. Put  a pillow between your knees... Good luck..

apparently you're not supposed to but i'm unsure of the reasons why- i know i read the guidance leaflet on a cream and it said no- it might just depend on your skin type aswell- i have very sensitive skin so i can't use it now im pregnant- i have to find other ways to keep tidy lol...shaving is a pain but it shouldnt leave a rash if you use a ladies sensitive shaving cream!

I know you cant use hair dye usually during the first trimester (this is what salons say but i think it is recommended not to be used for the entire pregnancy) but am not sure about hair removal cream.



I dont know if there are any damaging chemicals in it but i used it throughout pregnancy (without even considering the safety aspect) and actually dyed my hair too at the time and my son came out absolutely fine!



I expect it will say on the packet not to use of you are pregnant if that is the case as i think that anything like that is a legal requirement these days.



Best thing is to look at the packet or ask at a pharmacy... some brands may be better to use than others.

You know I'm not sure on this one! However I would think not because of the strong chemicals that can be breathed in and absorbed in the skin! Honestly you won't be able to reach those legs easily after about 20 weeks anyways! If that guy has a problem with it have him shave your legs! Otherwise tell him to get over it! Baby is more important then some hair on your legs and its not forever! Ask your doctor about this and let us know wheat he said? Good luck!

The doctor always said it was something the body was lacking. Usually cause that nutrient had been spent on the baby and its needs. He said the body knew what it needed and related the need to the brain hence the craving. So eat up and enjoy it with relish knowing your fullfilling your bodys needs =)

I read that the body isn't actually craving that particular food it's something else about that food (ingredient wise) that the body may want.



My first pregnancy I craved Cheese (blocks of it).
My second one I craved a mixture of banana and chocolate shakes and pickles and chili.
My third one it was a quart of hamburger dill pickles each day I would eat.
This one I crave Tomatoes, cucumbers and mountain dew.



Who knows what all that means.

It's nothing to do with the lads on Saturday nights - it's that damned prostate bloke. If you see him getting a single fingered rubber glove out again, tell him it's not the right one, but if he insists (there's still time if you're only 8 weeks gone) then you might as well enjoy it - after all, you've enjoyed it enough times already - and if, while he's doing an "exam" next time, he says that mess in the washing water is a miscarriage, he's not telling you the truth....

Different pain. The actual pushing and crowning stings like crazy. Imagine all that stretching!! In my opinion, the contractions were much worse. They last 4 hours. Pushing lasted 20 mins, so that might make a difference too.

i ended up having my first and only baby by emaergency c section as i was only 6 months pregnant and once my waters broke they stopped, so i had to be rushed in.



But i went through all of labour and would of done i guess if he hadn't have been so tiny and small.



I went through ALL of the contractions and only had gas and air for 5 mins before i was rushed through to theatre (it was a close call i got to the hosp in time!)



The contractions were excrutiating---i remember thinking "thank god there's no knife in this car else i'll be ending my own life so i dont have to go throught his anymore" lol!!



One minute i was screaming with the pain the next whimpering as i couldnt take it anymore. (My labour went VERY VERY quickly though)



But, looking back, i am glad of the pain as it really helped me to push him out (or try)



Now i didnt GIVE birth (poor fellow only got his little arm and the cord just out of my cervix) but i gave birth to my waters....lol very strange! That did kind of sting down there, but compared to the contractions...... and asking my mum....id say the contractions are the most painful.



However, i personally get more scared thinking about it ocming out and ripping rather than the mind-blowingly painful contractions! lol

Contractions are certainly more painful. Most ppl do not feel much during pushing due to several reasons like they already had contractions so the pain of pushing seems less, The idea of just getting it out gives power , and its quick. For me contractions were 4 hours and pushing was for 10 mins. so later was quite easy...

For me yes.
I never even felt my son's coming out, the contractions were killing me. I had 2 drug-free vaginal births, and with my first, I was trying to get off the bed, and my first born son's head was half out. I had no idea.
I didn't know they were out, till they were getting my Husband to cut the cord. But I felt every single contraction.

I was in labor with no painkillers for 19 hours total. The first 10 hours were uncomfortable but not terribly painful. Sort of like wearing jeans that are too tight, then popping the button open and going aaahh, then they button themselves back up and you're going ow ow but not dying in pain.



The last 9 hours were really bad BUT they are manageable. Definitely the most painful part of childbirth by far.



When it got time to push, it was painful but at that point you really don't care, and you push & push and it's over. I was sore from head to toe but not in pain once he was born. And you really forget the worst of it with time, it's all worth it.

Most pains are unique but I would have to say yes the contractions hurt much more worse than the actual pushing and without a pain killer, the pushing will be burning and hurting quite a bit but you'll want to do it to get it over with.

Nope.  With all 4 of my kids, my water was broken by my midwife.  Even with my last, she broke my water as he was crowning.  Those moments are relatively uncommon and don't generally happen like they show in the movies.

Where were you when your water broke?



With my daughter, my water broke at home when I was asleep. I guess it was the contractions that woke me up, although they weren't painful at first. It wasn't a gush, but a slow trickle.



However, I am 36 weeks pregnant with our 2nd baby, and I'm dilating fast. I'm already at 4cm. (Up from 2cm just 2 weeks ago.) With my daughter, I didn't start to dilate until my water broke.



Now I'm afraid my water will break at work...and in a big gush since I'm already dilated. Lord, that will be embarrassing...I work with hundreds of people. LOL

I had been sent to the hospital to be induced and I was there for a whole night before they found out that my daughter was breech and stopped the induction. They sent me home and to my doctor to get a sonogram and when i was waiting to get weighed I stood up and my water broke. It was a big gush for me and unfortunately it was in front of a man walking by and on their brand new chair. The good part was that it was at my doctors so they were pretty much in the know... My friend had to take me to the hospital with a towel wrapped around me. Good thing her car was waterproof! hehe. Good Luck with your pregnancy and your new baby! I cant wait to have my second.

<question>



Need opinions on a woman issue...PLEASE...?



Hello,



Okay, I know a little while ago I posted pretty much the same question, but I was getting it all wrong and what not. I do apologize, because I am tired. Sorry about this.



Anyways, my question is:



I have always had somewhat normal periods and what not. Just in the past two years they have changed a bit, all in all with their times when they come and the flow and that.



Well, I never really worried about that because my doctor told me that is was normal for a woman to have changes like that as they get older.



However, most recently I am experiencing a clear sticky discharge after I am done bleeding from my cycle. What exactly is this, and why does this happen after I am done bleeding?



I have gone to my doctor, and she told me it was due to hormones, but I am not so sure it is. What are your opinions?



Here's some more info to help. My periods usually last for about 5 days and the first two days are the worst with pain/cramps and flow. The other days are not so bad with pain/cramps and flow. Th flow is lighter. When I am fully done bleeding, that's when the discharge begins and it lasts about 4-days thereafter.



Why is this? I can just be standing or sitting and all of a sudden, I will feel like I peed my pants. It's bad, and I always have to change my pants.



Sometimes it's a lot, and sometimes it's not. It can also be thick and sticky, and then runny and very slick. There's no odor or anything. Some people have told me that this means I am fertile, and this is the time to get pregnant, Is that true? I also didn't think that you could get pregnant after your bleeding had stopped.



I am confused, please help. Thanks in advance.

Well unless you have a vaginal infection which consists of discharge, itching, burning, odor, then it shouldn't be anything to worry about. Some women give off discharge automatically without a problem, so your doctor is probably right.

Well, if your doctor says it is nothing to worry about, than don't.  I do not think you will find anyone on yahoo answrers that will know more about this than your doctor.  Just continue to act as though you are on your period for an extra 3-4 days.  Wear a pad or something.  I bet after w while this will go away and change also, but may take years.

Well, after your period you become more fertile that is why the discharge changes every day or other day!  This is the time where you can become pregnant.  "You thought that you can't get pregnant after a period" - you're wrong, that is when the cervical fluid becomes more fertile and allows sperm to last longer, the more fertile the fluid the longer the sperm will last until you ovulate.  Your mos fertile cervical would be the one you describe and runny and very slick.



I agree with your doctor that there is nothing to worry about, it is your body going through changes.

I can take all my holidays for the fiscal year before I go on Mat Leave, but I won't get paid for all of them...the company will work out how much I owe once I come back from mat leave.
So kind of (in my company) I'm entitled to the time off, but not necessarily all the pay.



You'll need to check with your own HR dept, every company will be different.

with FMLA you get 12 weeks off. Most companies will try to tell you to take any vacation time, or personal days you have because they don't want you to take anymore time off. But they cannot make you do that. My company tries to tell the employees who go on it, that they have to use any vacation time they have but they are not allowed to tell them that. So in other words yes if you do not use any of your time off during your leave then you will have your vacation time there waiting for you when you get back. I'm guessing you are in the UK since you said Holiday, I'm in the states, so I'm not sure if it works the same but I'm guessing it does.

All company policy is different so if I were you, I'd as my manager or better yet H.R. I'm on maternity leave now and won't be back til middle of January 2009. I don't think holidays count like Thanksgiving or Christmas because my work will pay me a certain percentage only and EDD will pay the rest. I work for a well known company and they're pretty cool when it comes to any type of leave, but my H.R. hasn't told me about holidays. Good luck

I don't know where you are, but in Australia they "stop the clock" while you are on maternity leave, so you don't accrue any leave benefits while you are on maternity leave.

i was told as long as you buy them from a repritable place it should be fine. my sister craved prawns when she was pregnant, i think you should limit yourself to haw many you eat. alot of people avoid prawns completely during pregnancy. i think the reason not to eat them is in case of food poisining so if you buy it from tesco or somewhere it should be ok.



i dont know if this is correct everybody seems to have different oppinions (like all pregnancy matters)

It kind of sounds like he wants to play house for a little while, but with no actual commitment that way if things get to much for him he can walk away and not feel bad. I wouldn't take him too seriously, and maybe you two should sit down and talk about this. Ask him why he does all these things but doesn't want to be with you, Good luck and just try to concentrate on your son more then him!

im sorry to hear that, the best advice i can give you is to forget about having a relationship with this man although he sounds nice and caring he sounds as though he is not ready for commitment and having to raise a baby that isn't yours is hard work im 20 years old and 23 weeks pregnant my partner has a 5 year old daughter who lives with us and it is very very difficult for me to have that motherly bond with her as im not her natural mother, im not saying i don't love her, because i do love her very much but i had no idea how difficult it would be raising a child so young that wasn't mine. I suggest you stay friends with this man and that's all, he can be as involved as he likes but make it quite clear that nothing is to go further as he is definitely not ready for commitment, you need to have all you time for your new baby without the stress of a man, and it wont be fair on the baby to not get as much attention from you as you will be putting most of your attention on the new man, i don't want that to sound nasty so please don't take it in the wrong way good luck hope everything works out

I think you're lucky to have a friend like him around. I think if you don't put any pressure on him..he'll stick around. He needs to feel he has the freedom to walk away if he wants..and if he feels "free" he's more likely to stick around.  Try not to compare him with the baby's father...and don't expect him to be a father to the baby even though he might be acting as if he is.  He may be one of those guys that loves you unconditionally. I think a lot of times we don't realize how much a guy truly likes us. : )

It sounds like he just wants all the perks of a relationship with a baby but not the commitment it actually takes (the responsibility).  I would talk to him and tell him how you feel completely and ask him to either be there as a friend or not be there at all because he is confusing you and you definitely don't need that right now.



Good luck!

just go with the flow, its great thats he is supporting you.
if it happens it happens, but id be afraid if you went to kiss him and he didnt want that your relationship might suffer.
so take things slow,

so you never know.
congrats on your baby boy, hope all is goin well

You answered your own question! Put your focus on your baby, and not on a guy.



He seems to like the attention he may be getting, by claiming he's the father, but, when it comes down to it, he's getting cold feet... Which is fine, since he's not the father, but it will ultimately leave you feeling worse, and could damage your son, emotionally... Focus on the friendship; not a romance... Also, if it were me, I wouldn't like him telling people he's the father. That will confuse your baby, unless you never plan on telling him, but, if he thinks this guy is his dad, and then this guy takes off cause he's scared, then... not good.

Yes your uterus is probably just above your belly button now. It might seem like she's kicking higher than she actually is.  I'm 24 weeks and 2 days and my belly button felt like it was wiggling.. it feels so weird. LOL



Your doctor will take note and measure where your uterus is at every doctor's appointment..so I wouldn't worry unless they tell you there's something to worry about.

Yes, before the baby engages it can move in all positions. I used to find my sons leg in the most oddest places.



When they are feet down they are in breach position and when they are head down they are engaged.



I think the baby becomes fully engaged in the mid 30 weeks in preparation for the birth.



So dont worry, sounds like you have a right live one there... but as long as she is in the right place at the right time, and you feel her moving everything is fine

Hello, at 23 weeks your baby still has a lot of room to move about in.  She can go anywhere she likes really, and she will.  So it is common for you to feel kicks in queer odd places, and the shifting of the baby.  Sometimes, the baby can feel as if it's under your ribs, when she's bigger, she will start the natural "climb" down.



As long as you are feeling kicks or movement, she is obviously happy and well in her temporary home.



Congratulations on your pregnancy.

Your baby may have just flipped over to the head down position.  OR the feelings you were feeling down low weren't kicks, but punches.



Your uterus reaches your belly button right around 20 weeks, so your feeling her movemnet higher up because your uterus is now higher than your belly button.  Not by much, but it is.

Oh yes totally normal! I'm lucky cos my little girl's kicks haven't quite reached my ribs yet, although she sometimes kicks very low down like your daughter yet sometimes it is up past my belly button.. but she prefers my right hand side lol :) When she kicks have you tried 'poking' where she kicked? The past two days whenever she's kicked, i've 'poked' her back and she responds! It's so freaking amazing! Good luck with everything xx

At this stage it cannot be a clogged milk duct. If you are worried about breast cancer, thats probably also not it -usually there is no pain involved , so the fact that it is red and bruised shows its something else.



I am no doctor, so whatever I say, can be wrong. My opinion, you should definitaly see a doctor asap, he will send you for a mamogram if he feels it neccesary!

This happened to me, around the same time, when I was pregnant with my third child. I felt it, had it checked by my doc, she sent me to get an ultrasound, and they said it was 'suspicious' and 'doesn't look good.' So, I was supposed to get a biopsy, and when I got there, a doc came in, looked at it on ultrasound, again, and told me it doesn't look like cancer; it's fibrous tissue, which can be common during pregnancy, as the breasts change... He said I could still have the biopsy, if I insisted, but I decided to wait for 6 months, and get it re-checked... Well, I never went back, because it disappeared! For me, it must have been fibrous tissue, but it was scary, because my birth mom died of breast cancer, at age 55. And, because for a whole month, I thought I may have cancer, being pregnant, and with two other kids! Definitely get it checked, but, don't panic. It could very well be normal changes... Good luck!

I will be 36 weeks tomorrow and I only look pregnant in certain clothes (more so in no clothes).  Everything I wear hides it without trying. I have only gained 10-12 pounds ( I go to the doctor today) so I am all baby, but my body shape hides it.  My doctor said I am packed to themax the baby has no where else tohide it has to start showing soon.  In the last 3 weeks it has started to show more.  But only maternity clothes show my baggy at home flannels & t-shirts just make me look fat.  Strangers have no clue I am pregnant or that I am in my last month.  I kind of miss the attention I would get if I were bigger but at the same time I know I can wear my own clothes home from the hospital too!  Don't worry it will show when its ready and you clothes will help show it off or hide it until the end!

If your water broke on its own. . .?



did the actual water breaking hurt?
(Not the contractions that follow, but the breaking of the water itself.)



I was asleep when my water broke with my daughter...and that was 2 years ago.



Now, I'm 36 weeks pregnant and dilated to 4cm.  It used to be occasional, but almost constantly now when I walk, I feel a VERY sharp pain in my lower abdomen (I guess near where my cervix is) ...almost like a large, sharp knife is being shoved up my vagina and into my uterus. [[for lack of a better description]] Sometimes, I have to stop walking as I cannot tolerate to walk through the pain.



So my question, could that be the weight of the baby in my uterus causing such pain? I feel like my water will break at any moment.

my waters broke first with my first two labours and it just felt like a 'pop' followed by a gush of water. even when i had mine broken by the midwife during baby number 3s delivery it didn't hurt so Im guessing it shouldn't hurt at all. it does sound like the pain you are having is more to do with your pubic bone (symphasis Pubis Dysfuntion) than anything else. Im getting it badly now at almost 29 weeks. look it up and you may find some help. best of luck

The shot made me spot a lot and it made my periods quite irregular.  I would say it's definitely the contraceptive.  I changed mine to something more stable.

I've not been pregnant before, but i'd say it's the shot. The hormones mess ur natural cycle up. it could come good after a couple of months when ur body gets used to it. You can still take a preg test if ur still worried. Good Luck

The shot makes your body think that you are pregnant which can affect your mind as well and cause a lot of paranoia but it is very common to have spotting when you are on the shot. My mum, on the other hand, had a heavy period the whole time she was on the shot. Conclusion: the shot messes up your body!

I wouldn't think ur pregnant because bleeding during pregnancy is not normal. and if u are pregnant and bleeding that would be a miscarraige. its probably the shot, esp. if ur knew at taking it. its just ur bodies way of trying to regulate it.

If you had an epidural, that could be the cause, sometimes there is a delayed reaction.



If not then maybe hormones or your body returning to normal. Lack of sleep is a killer, even if you are getting sleep it wont be as good quality or in a big enough block.



I think that if it continues on over the weekend you should go and see a Doctor just in case.

Yes I had exactly the same



Did you have an epidural? If so you need to let midwife, doctor or health visitor know as soon as possible.



You will be refer-ed back to the hospital. It is caused by air getting in at the epidural site



Nothing to worry about, they just put a needle in the same place as the epidural and you have to lay still for an hour and you can go home same day.



Hope you get it sorted soon so you can enjoy your new baby

Oh i feel for you i really do, i was exactly the same after having an epidural (which didn't work for me i might add) you need to call your midwife or doctor, i was advised to lie flat on my back as much as possible for a few days it was suggested i went back to hospital but i'd had such a rough time that i really couldn't face it, so i laid down on cushions on the living room floor and it did help, about 14 days after giving birth i started to feel better... keep taking pain killers and lie down! hope that helps.. good luck xx xx

Further to musika's question about eating prawns.....?



i feel for you! i want prawns so badly too, and prawn toast! my midwife just said 'don't eat shellfish'. no discussion on what's safe, just don't eat runny eggs, or shellfish, or this or that. basically run a list of things out of a leaflet.



so given that prawn toast is oven heated for about 20 mins would that be ok? i'm not sure how it's made. and what about ready cooked then frozen prawns? the little ones you can put in a salad once defrosted? my midwife scares me a little.....don't really want to see her if i don't have to..ha ha!

i swear midwives make it up as they go along! When my mum was pregnant with me the midwife told her she could eat whatever she liked and I came out fine but with her last pregnancy (last year) she had 5 different midwives saying completely different things. If the prawns are cooked properly i.e. prawn toast or ready cooked frozen prawns eat them! It won't harm you unless you get prawns from a seafood stall.
Good luck!

Prawns won't harm you unless you get food poisoning from them. So taking them OUT of something they have been cooked with is completely pointless - if they are carrying listeria they will have contaminated the rest of the food! At that point you might as well at least enjoy them...



You have to decide whether you want to take the very small risk of getting food poisoning from them. You're not any more likely to get it just because you're pregnant, but if you did do then it could harm your baby or make you miscarry.

Was it my water breaking?



i am 39 weeks and 2 days pregnant. last night, my husband and i had sex. it caused me to have killer contractions for hours, and i really thought it was going to lead to the delivery of my baby! but.... i eventually fell asleep. so they must have subsided a bit. anyway, i awoke this morning to feel a "trickle" of fluid coming out of me. i reached down to feel it, and it was really watery. i thought it might be semen... because it wasn't a whole lot. but it didn't feel that way. is it possible that i am actually leaking a bit of amniotic fluid?

could be possible, only way to tell is to smell it, if it doesnt smell like semen or pee then its most likely your waters breaking, mind you if its just trickeling out, i know with me i had some trickle everytime i had a contraction.



if your really worried either call your doc tomorrow or go to the hospital.

You should be at your doctor right now!  Any time that you even THINK that your water may have broken, you need to go get checked out.  If your water did break, you're letting infection get to your baby by waiting.



If your contractions were regular  (about 5 min from beg to beg) for an hourish.. you hsould have been at the hospital last night.

Hi there,



It could be your waters breaking some women just experience a little trickle of the amnicotic fluid and other can expereince a whole lot. It just depends on were the baby is lying. I would suggest that you contact your midwife and make arrangements to go to the hospital to have it checked out. it could have even been your mucus plug.



Good Luck hunni xx



just read that someone has said about infection god dont panic about that you can only get an infection if your water have been broke for 24hours. So go do not panic about that.



Again good luck xx

You should call your midwife and see if you can make an appt earlier.  The way you can tell if you're leaking is if it happens again, you can't stop it like you can with urine.

I'm due Jan. 16. Sometimes I do feel as if time is slowly dragging on. But when I think of all the things I need to get done, then it seems like, "OMG, I've only got a few months left!" I'm also worried about trying to get everything ready with the holidays coming up. My last daughter was a December baby, and I remember all too well having to go Christmas shopping while nine months pregnant, lol. So right now, I think I need all the time I can get.

Omg you took the words right outta my mouth!! I'm due January 18th with my little girl, and it feels like time is dragging soooo much! I'm now 24 weeks and 3 days, and although it seems like it was aages ago I found out I was pregnant, it also has dragged so much. I'm so excited i'm over the half way mark, and to get to this stage as well is amazing as well. I'm so impatient to finally meet the little fidget who wakes up just as I go to sleep.. :) but having said that I think i'll really miss being pregnant! I talk to her all the time.. she comforts me when i'm feeling low.. I love feeling her shuffling about and stretching.. stuff like that I will miss but omg I can't wait to meet her either! I know exactly how you feel though; everyone's been telling me to relish the time I have left before she's due.. I am but that doesn't stop me from being impatient haha. I feel like a small child excited about christmas.. the more I think about it, the longer it seems there is left before she's due! All the best to you hun :D

YES!!! I am due Jan 12 with number one! I agree, time seems to be dragging now. I just want to hold my little man and see what he looks like! I just keep telling myself-"I have made it over 25 weeks, surely I can make it another 15". But waiting is sooooo hard!



Good luck and I hope you have a healthy rest of your pregnancy!

hehe I was the same way with everyone of my pregnancys wait till your 32 weeks you'll be wanting to go induce (BUT don't lol)
Take this time to prepare for the new baby relax pamper yourself because when he/she does come you;ll be beging for time out.
where you are in your pregnancy now is the best time it's fun and it fills you with so much anticipation. take it slow and let these next few weeks be memorable not stressfilled. I'm a mother of 5 girls and pregnancy is something you will actually miss when your baby's here
(sounds crazy i know but sooo true).

I'm due January 7th, 2009 with girl #3 here. I went into premature labor with both of our little ones and after those scares and doing some research on what kind of problems a baby can have if born too early, I'm hoping and praying that I will make it to the 7th or even longer. But I am a tad anxious. I just got my husband back a week ago from a 12 month deployment overseas and we're FINALLY going to do this together. But congratulations. Once he is here, and you look back on it, it won't seem like it lasted so long. That's how my hubby's deployment went. :)

If your mom already knows you are having sex then just let her know.  She is already mad so it can't get worse.  If your boyfriend is not speaking to you then you are going to need your mom's support.



Remember she is your mom and although she might be angry I am sure she is going to be there for you.



Be honest and be upfront.  A baby is not something you can hide.



Good luck I hope it all turns out for the best.

first try to talk to her when she is in a good mood.  ask her if you can talk to her, then tell her.  at first she will be extremely mad.  hopefully by the time you have the baby she will have come around and will be excited enough to help you out.  as for the father, don't take him back.  he isn't ready  for the responsibility.  do get him for support though.  raising a baby isn't cheap.

theres no special way that you can tell your Mom to make her feel any different. You just gotta do it. She'll be mad, and it might get worse before it gets better. But you just gotta do it. Just tell her! Maybe try doing it over the phone, it might make it easier, go to a friends house and call her, wait till she calms down before you go home again.

Wait for a calm moment and then tell her.  She'll be in shock at first and will be angry or upset or both, but she'll come around. You'll need to be strong and let her have her say and say everything she needs to say.  But, you'll still be her little girl and she'll want to look after you and protect you and her grandchild.  It won't be easy and you'll need to be brave, but the sooner you do it, and get the shouting and tears over with, the sooner she can calm down and start supporting and looking after you.



All the best.

Anyone else worried about the effects of the ultrasound?



I read an article that a study at Yale shows that doing a half hour ultra sound at a fairly high intensity but one that is not unheard of, caused neurological damage in the babies of pregnant mice. My first thought was that I have a baby inside me, not a mouse, but the article went on to explain how it does pertain to human fetuses and explained why.
I was very excited to get my ultrasound in two weeks and find out the sex of baby #3 (third and final) but my oldest has high functioning autism which I am sure is due to environmental toxins being too much for her system. So I don't want to stress this new little one's system by having an ultra sound if it really does affect the fetus.



I was never and "alarmist" before but after seeing that my own child has been affected by the toxins of "progress" I can't help but think I am being irresponsible if I just ignore the article and study that was done by Yale.
What do you mom's think?
Here is the link if you want to see:
http://www.pnas.org/content/103/34/12903...



Finally though, I did get a 10 week ultrasound (before I read the article) am worried to not get the 20 week ultrasound becuase what if there is something wrong that they need to deal with right at birth? Everything looked good at the first one but I haven't had any testing done since we would have the baby even if there were problems.



OK, thanks for reading this whole thing and please let me know how you feel as a mom, and about getting the 20 week ultrasound or not (and how this affects you, if at all.)

Well with my first child I has many ultrasounds because at 26 weeks I had a DVT.  So it seemed like at almost every appointment they were doing one after my blood clot to check on my baby.  None of my ultrasounds were any where close to 30 minutes long, generally in my experience they were no more than 10 minutes at the very most.  My baby was born very healthy.  Now she is 2 years old and her doctor always talks about how healthy she is.

it used to be thought that they can be harmful but there has been studies to show them they are completely harmless.. My last pregnancy I was pregnant with twins and was very high risk. I seen my reg dr and a MFM dr and i had ultrasounds preformed every 2 weeks for the first trimester and after that weekly and in the end i had then done a few times a week. They did several external and internal ultrasounds and my daughters are very healthy and smart.. i had more ultrasounds that i could count.. They are done by sound waves.. and have changed much over the years due to their demand and knowledge they provide.. if there were by chance a risk, which i really believe to not be there, the benefits far out weigh any possible risk there could be. Many babies are saved from life threatening conditions because they have been detected in the uterus.

As a mom of 4 and a nurse, I think that the US that you have at 20wks is the most important one that you could have.  That's when they do a complete look at your uterus, placenta, and most important the size of the baby, and measurements (arms, head, torso, legs, etc).  They also have the ability to measure the Fluid on the baby's neck, called the nuchal translucency-also known as the nuchal fold.  Fetal nasal bone evaluation is another type of US exam that increases Downs Syndrome detection to 95%, making the combined screening more effective than any other screening tests.
I have to have an US every month because I have a uterine abnormality, and after 4 kids and lots and lots of US, I feel that the benefits outweigh any risks with US.  Hope this helps you, Congratulations on your baby!

With a vaginal birth, no complications, you must be in the hospital for 24 hours after delivery. For a C-section, no other complications, you have a minimum of 48 hours after delivery. They can keep you longer depending on the healing of your incision. For example, if it is still seeping they may want to keep you an extra day. If you had to have a c-section because of fetal distress they may keep your baby and release you. It is all determined on a case to case basis if extra time is needed, but the above times are the normal minimum.

It's at least 2 days for a c-section.  They need to make sure your uterus is contracting back to normal and make sure your incision is healing properly.  It can be up to 5 days though.  It really depends on the hospital and of course if there are complications you will definitely be in longer.

I had a csection and was in the hospital for 5 days. they want to make sure, since its a major surgery that your healing the right way. Youcant walk for 24 hours after you have a csection. You cant even feel your legs and your hooked up to a catheter. Honestly, I prefered it over a vaginal because you feel nothing. THe scar heals but i think its safer then vaginal. they pamper you more too when your a csection patient.

Usually it's 3 or 4 days, unless there are complications. A vaginal delivery usually ranges from 24 hours to 3 days, depending on your doctor and insurance.

I did a routine checkup/pregnancy check last week on friday.  Today the doctor called to make an appointment for me to come in to find out the results.  Is this the norm? Has anyone else been pregnant and your doctor didnt tell you over the phone? Please help thank you!

I already knew I was pregnant when I went, but they did give me blood test results over the phone to confirm the pregnancy. There may be more they want to say, or it's not related to pregnancy at all. Just go to the appointment. Good luck!

The reason we never provide answers over the phone to our patients stems from there usually being bad news that needs to be discussed in person as opposed to over the phone. When nothing is wrong, we will provide the results (ex. Positive or Negative.) on pregnancies.

This might sound selfish but i have a question?



Ok so my son is 2. My husband and i have been thinking about getting pregnant again. But sometimes i freak when i think about gaining more weight. I havent lost all the baby weight from my son. I still have 20 pounds that just arent moving. My question is, what would you do? Would you wait and lose the 20 pounds, then get pregnant or would you just get pregnant, gain 20 more, then just lose it all and be back in shape and have your two angels? I hope this doesnt sounds too concieted, i just dont like being this chubby and im afraid of becoming overweight like my dads side of the family.

All the books say to reach your goal weight b4 you get preggo. Any extra weight you have b4 the pregnancy will be even harder to lose after you have the baby. The baby weight is hard enough to lose! I would wait if it were me. But if you reallllly want a second child, don't worry about the weight! Just go for it :o) Good luck!

If it were me, I'd lose as much weight as I could, before getting pregnant, again... I know someone who had her second baby, before losing all the weight, and she gained a lot more, didn't lose that, got pregnant again, and now is still overweight, more than 30 years later. It's hard on her, and she wishes she had lost it, each time, first.



However, it's your choice! Good luck. :)

It depends on how much you want another baby. I'm about to be honestly blunt, so I apologize in advance. After 2 years you should have dropped the unwanted weight, if it's been hard for you to lose the weight from the first baby, it may be nearly impossible to lose weight after a second one.

You are not selfish.  You want to look good and you care about your overall health.  That is not selfish at all. If I were you I would give yourself a time goal that you discuss with your husband.  You both need to agree how much time that you both don't mind waiting.  And in the mean time you might want to reconsider your weight loss goal.  Perhaps you decide to lose 15 or 10 pounds instead of the whole 20.



Good luck with whatever you decide.

Check with your GP.  Unless he can see any health reason not to, like high blood pressure etc, then I'd just go for it and think about the weight loss afterwards.  Might be better than struggling to lose all that weight only to put it on again through another pregnancy.  You'll probably lose weight naturally after the second anyway, with running around after two toddlers.



Good luck x

LP's mommy,



bottomline is what do you really want for your family? meaning, u and ur hubby really wish to have another kid to love and care about or just  want another kid to accompany your son...



if is to have more laughter with love and share, then i will raise both my hands to support you to go for your number 2 now..



i have been putting up about 28kg for my 1st child, before i could shed off those fats...i was pregnant with my 2nd child. both are 20months apart and basically is 1 year apart.



during my 2 pregnancy, i enjoyed eating merrily and of course watch the health's condition. i put on alot and now though my kids already 3 and 4, i still have excess of 8kg before i can back to my shape..



nevertheless, no regrets to me when i see 2 angels and also monsters running around, laughing, fighting, sharing, loving...etc...and i was breastfeeding them that time .....my shape no longer bothers me..but now as they grow bit older, i do remember i still need to shape back.. and start to do some workouts...not too late..and never too late to do so.



dont worry too much in this matter, important is you must have the right focus one at a time, then move on with another once u achieve..life will be much easier and contented. remember to stay healthy and happy, you will know what u want eventually.

I started feeling nauseas around 8 weeks, but it different for everyone!!! Probably the only way for you to really tell would be to just get an ultrasound done, or if you can think of a specific time you had sex, where you might have gotten pregnant, but theres probably not really a way to tell since your breast feeding

I agree with the ultrasound answer, but maybe a blood test will help and I'm not sure but they may be able to tell you the level of HCG in your blood. Not sure if that would be affected by the breastfeeding though.

Well... assume that you are 4-8 weeks, which is when the symptoms would normally start showing up, and wait another 4 weeks before you schedule an ultrasound, this will make sure that you will actually see something.



ALSO, it is not uncommon for women who are breastfeeding to produce positive pregnancy readings, because you are breastfeeding, your body still thinks it's pregnant, which is why most people don't get a period while breastfeeding.

I'm 14 weeks Pregnant.  I'm afraid i'm not eating enough for baby! ?



HI, I'm usually a very big eater (when not pregnant haha).  I have noticed a decrease in my appetite since I became pregnant.  I read all over the web that this is typical and if I lose a few pounds in the first trimester, there's nothing to worry about.  I went to my Doctor last week for a bad cold and I lost 3 lbs since my pre-natal check up 3 weeks prior! I love food and although I haven't had a huge appetite I try to eat a lot of whole grains, fruits, and veggies.  I always feel like I'm still hungry though.  I'm 5'6 and a size 13, so you know I'm eating!  Did anyone else have this problem during Pregnancy?  This is my first.  Thanks

most people dont have a big appitite the first trimester, but dont worry about it, just eat when your hungry. the baby only needs 300 extra calories a day, thats like nothing.



Dont let people tell you that you need to gorge yourself  because your "eating for two now" thats the biggest lie ever. your baby is the size of a pea right now, it doesnt need that much food.

I didn't experience this, but like you say it is normal and plus it sounds like you're doing everything right, so don't stress.  Just keep taking your prenatal vitamins and don't overwork yourself.  The other posts are right, your baby takes the nutrients first.  I always have that feeling too of still being hungry (pre and post baby), but I've been told that it's good metabolism.  Just carry snackies with you or keep them at your desk at work.

You will no doubt get lots of helpful answers with suggestions as to what this might be, but please, please call your doctor's office for the "best answer" rather than relying on Yahoo!Answers for this one.



From my own four pregnancies I can remember many different pains and sensations in the last weeks such as the one you're describing, none of which was ever a problem.  But it's always best to rely on your doctor's advice at this point.



Best of luck to you!

It could be a fibroid. A fibroid is a growth that lots of women have, but aren't even aware of until they are pregnant.  If the fibroid gets pinched, it can cause pain.  this happened to me.

Did you use protection? (condoms) it only takes once for you to get pregnant hun....Your period maybe trying to come on and sounds spotty, but you should see a doctor . You can call any Family Planning Center and you can get and visit with out your parent consent over the age 14. Please use protection next time and speak with your GYN about some PCB.

It is extremely possible. However, your period could still be irregular. My advice is get an at-home test, then go to the doctors (if you don't want your parents to know, you can go to a planned parenthood) And have them do a blood test to make sure AND check for and STD's. No matter if the guy says he's clean or not, protect yourself and check anyways! Good luck!

Spotting, Stomach Problems,& CONFUSION! ?



Sorry for the long story but here I go!



For the past week or so I have been having a really horrible burning sensation in my lower stomach. It doesn't go any higher then my belly button so I'm not sure if it's heart burn ( like I've experienced before). I am also having pretty painful cramping and soreness in my lower abdomen. I avoided spicy foods or anything that might cause my stomach issues and this has not helped at all. Today I woke up and was spotting. I took my last pill for the month last night, so I don't know why I'd be spotting.



I don't know if any of this is related or not.. I take my birth control for 2 months consecutively. I had forgotten to get the next pack filled at the doctor, so I took the last pill.. skipped a day and then took two the next night. My partner and I got caught up in the moment and forgot that I hadn't taken a pill that day. Through the course of the next week I forgot my pill once or twice from being exhausted from work and didn't realize it.



My question is whether these things related at all.. and what it could be. I took a pregnancy test yesterday. It was negative. But I'm assuming if I haven't missed my period ( because I am still on my pills and don't start my fake one's until tonight)  that it would come up negative regarless?



Sorry for the novel! Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Pregnant GF more woes!?



In the latest instalment of misery at home, it seems the cat is becoming something of a risk to the baby ( even though she ain't born yet 35weeks)
Our house is open plan (WE HAVE NO DOORS except the bathroom) and there are no doors, and recently i found that the cat had began bedding down in the baby's "ready to go" crib, it stank of 5hitty cat litter in there, i proceeded to throw the cat out!



the cat is only young 1 year and scratches everything and messes the place up something chronic, from the day we got it, i pleaded with my GF that it doesnt sleep on the bed ( or in the bed as has happened) as i diddnt want to share my bed with a pet, the dog was banned from the bedroom after much discussion!! My GF just went ahead without considering my feelings about it all!



We have tried to put up a barrier to stop the cat getting in but she has still managed to get in to the baby's room area.



My GF wont put the cat outside for long as she is a pedigree breed and there's a busy main road around, and also she loves her pets so much she wouldn't dream of parting with the cat, if anything the cat is simply "lovely" to my GF and its like nothing needs to happen?
The problem is, i have mentioned that we need to consider the health and safety of the baby but she doesn't listen to a word i say!



If i said about re-homing the cat she would resent me forever for suggesting it, but she doesn't seem to acknowledge that as its her cat and our baby that she is the one who needs to decide what happens!



i cant encourage her because she bites my head off all the time and to be honest an argument over a cat isnt on my agenda, however the safety of my daughter is?



And no, just talking about it doesnt work, because she just gets seriously angry or floods of tears about EVERYTHING and no "closing the doors" ( for those who dont read the questions properly) wont work as our house is open plan. so its all a bit miserable really!



any ideas, thanks guys!

i had the same problem and in fact when i found the cat had actually used my babys cot for a toilet, then that was the final straw and she had to go.
i did make sure that i found a safe and loving home for her.  but i had rescued her so she was a bit wild anyway.

I understand that you have no doors but maybe you could consider adding one to the baby's room? I mean, that'll also help the baby sleep through the night when it's older because it'll keep it quieter and darker. Tell your girlfriend that that's the reason you want to put a door on the baby's room. Maybe it'll work better if you don't mention the cat. Good luck!

what you need to do is take a spray bottle and sspray the cats butt when you see him/her go near the baby's things while you spray him make anoise that will make him stop.. eventually you will not need the bottle just whatever noise you you do to distract him or her.

Well, I guess when the baby comes she can decide who is more important. Cats are very jealous and I have read about them smothering the baby by laying on the babys head.They like the warmth of another body and if the cat is already familiar with the crib and is using it as a bed, it is marking its territory.



We had a wonderful cat that loved my youngest when he was a baby. Whenever my baby would cry, she would come and get right up by him and want to see what was going on.



So, like I said I guess you can see what it is like when the baby comes and if it isn't ideal, then you can talk about rehoming again.

When the baby arrives, your GF will become more maternal (I assure you) and she isn't going to allow the cat to do anything to her child. I seriously wouldn't worry about it. Placing aluminum foil in the crib until the baby arrives would be one way to keep the cat out ---- they HATE landing on the stuff!



As others have mentioned - I hope she is staying away from the litter box herself. It would be very dangerous if she came in contact. My husband always dealt with ours when I was pregnant.

Try buying a spray that will deture the cat from going into the bedroom. They have a spray you can smell for a little while and then it goes away but the cat won't like it. It's called Boundry and works great! Spray the doorway floor and the base of the crib. The cat won't want to go anywhere near it. Also, you can sprayyour bed too. Just get out of the house for a few hours with the wondows open (as it can be strong) My husband hates it, but it works! GL! PS - they also have sticky paws that cats hate. You can try that IN the crib if you don't want the chemicals right now. GL!

ask your gf if she'd want the baby playing in kitty litter because that's basically what's happening when the cat gets in the crib, the baby will be laying in litter and feces that may have been on the cat's paws.



If she wasn't allowed to do the kitty litter when pregnant for the baby's well-being why would she want her baby to lay in it. and all the cat hair what would happen if say the baby has an allergy to cats.....



I also like the spray bottle version of punishing the cat. i have a spray  bottle of water and i can shoot a jet of water at the cat and they get away or out of whatever i dont' want them in...very quickly i might add. All i have to do it pick the bottle up and they get away from baby items.

Seriously, get rid of the cat. Your girlfriend will be upset but she will get over it eventually, its just a cat, and the baby should take full priority!

First, I would try getting some kind of cat repellent and putting it in or near the doorway of the room. It won't hurt the kitty or people, just give her a nasty whiff of air every time she tries to go close.  I know, however, that this does not deter a lot of persistent darlings, so the next step might be getting a hanging rod and some kind of curtains that could hang over the door to the baby's room, and find some way to attach it to the frame, via hooks or some nice-looking method.



When it comes down to it, you're going to have to find some way to keep that cat out of the baby's room, either now or when it has arrived.



I have a cat and love her, and would not get rid of her in this case.  However, I would have no reservations about doing whatever it took to keep her out of the nursery room.



Last resort in my book, because it could be expensive and hard to install, would be a shock collar.  They make them for settings like yours, where they just extend for the doorway you don't want your animal near.  When they get too close, it shocks them.  You may want to look into that, because I guarantee you, it may sound cruel, but if that cat gets shocked once, it's not going to chance it again.



Best of luck!!

Wow that is a difficult one. Remember she is hormonal and stressed and uncomfortable, it's all part of being pregnant, I spent the whole time completely irrational and on the verge of tears so tread carefully.



There are a few things you can try, tin foil in the cot, cats hate it so they jump straight back out and learn not to do it, slightly more extreme is sticky fly paper, not nice but if its the safety of your baby.



Try writing what you asked us down in a letter to her, she may scrunch it up, but she'll go back and read it when she's calmed down again. Just make it about the babies safety, remember it's a mother's instinct to protect her baby, it's just that she may be mothering the pets untill the baby's born, again its the hormones, they do funny things.



And good luck, it's refreshing to hear a father to be that's doing his bit so thank you for giving me some hope for the men on here.

Just because you are breastfeeding doesn't mean you can't get pregnant. I was breastfeeding and using birth control and I still got pregnant when my son was two and a half months old. Needless to say our sons are less than a year apart. If you don' t want two babies in diapers then wait to have sex or use birth control next time.

My mother lost custody of me and my two sisters, do you think it is wrong for her to have another baby?



Im 16. My name is Katey. When I was 3 my mother married a man named Pat. He had a nice house and a nice car. That's when everything went downhill. When I was 4 my mom gave birth to my little sister Audrey. Shortly after that My mom and Pat became addicted to Meth and soon after he became abusive. Me and my sister lived in a filthy, abusive, neglectful house until my mother got pregnant and gave birth shortly after i turned nine. When she had my Baby Sister Emily, they detected meth in both my moms and the baby's systems. We were taken and put in my grandmothers custody and a year later pat died and my mom got pregnant with a different mans child and got clean. She had my brother David and he is now 4. Then Davids father went back to prison. When David turned two my mother started dating a guy named Eric. He doesn't let her drink or do any drugs. 5 months ago she announced that she was pregnant again and a week ago she gave birth to my newest Babys sister Kasey (which made me angry that she named her one letter away from my name, Katey, because she doesn't try to be apart of my life). I may be wrong, but i do not think it is right for her to have any other children after she got three of her kids taken away. All she will do is send me 30$ in the mail. About two months ago i had my wisdom teeth removed, and it was a slightly major surgery because I have TMJ (my joints in my jaw don't fit right because of my over bite) and all four teeth were EXTREMELY impacted. My dad (whom i now live with) took me up there, everyone in his family called at some point during that day to check on my. My mom knew exactly when I was having the surgery, and my dads and my cell phone number, but didn't call either of us. Finally a week later she goes, oh how did your thingy go? I was so upset that she didn't care that I cried. I think that she shouldn't have had any more children, when she still fails to support me and my two sisters.

Pregnancy tests are not reliable until it is within 4 or 5 days of when your girlfriend would normally begin her period. If it is within 5 days of having sex and your girlfriend does not want to get pregnant, I would suggest she try to get the morning-after pill. It is now available without a prescription over the counter at certain pharmacies (you have to ask the pharmacist to get it for you).Anyone 18 or over can get morning after pills (they are called Plan B) this way. If she is under 18, then you need a doctor's prescription for it. Fortunately, you should be able to get it without much bother if you and/or her go to Planned Parenthood, which is a very helpful and supportive place. You can also get other birth control, free condoms and plenty of useful advice on how to avoid these sorts of situations in the future.

it depends on her period. the soonest you'll be able to tell would be around 3 days before she's supposed to get her period. if her period is late, the test will be really accurate. just remember that it is possible to have a false negative (a test that says she's not pregnant, but she really is). a false positive is possible but not likely. also, she could get her period and still be pregnant, which is why its best to wait until after her period is late

I felt a pop, come from near my cervix?



Im 38 weeks with my first. And I was 3 cm dilated last week and 90% effaced.



Not sure if you will know the answer but... Yesterday when I went to the bathroom to pee, I felt this pop come from inside near my cervix, if it wasn't my cervix. It didn't hurt it just was a weird feeling. I didn't hear it, I could just feel it. I doubt it was my water, because Nothing cam gushing out.
Does that mean anything?

The only thing I can think of is that it might have been your pelvic bone widening to make room for the baby's head. When my water broke, it was a popping sensation, but I had a gush.

Question about planned parenthood?



Well i had sex with my gf 2 weeks ago, we used a condom, but she missed her period for a week. We're not in the state of having a baby now cause we're still young but we want to be safe and SURE that nothing is wrong with her. Yes, i know stress and everything else can lead to a missed period but i rather be safe than sorry. Im going to have her take a pregnancy test later today but i want to know some information just in case she is so i can calm her down.



For planned parenthood, i know abortions cost up to 400$, i want to know that if it's confidental, who do you need to bring with them, how old, does parents need to know? will it show on any records of my gf having a abortion?

First, you are worrying way before it is necessary.  If you only had sex one time and you used protection...chances are not high for her to be pregnant.



You two sound rather young.  It is very common for girls to have irregular periods off and on for years until their bodies really adjust.  Even after 15 years of having a cycle, I will still occassionaly get a strange period, or even miss one.



You will have to call planned parenthood in your area to find those questions out.  It differs from state to state, so it is just best to call the source.  If she is a minor, she *may* need a parent or legal guardian to approve of an abortion.  And from that point on, she would need to inform every new doctor she sees that she has had an abortion (new client forms request that information...particularly with GYNs.)



But until you get a positive on a test, just calm down!

You're right that I'm going to "flame" you.  You put this in a section where women laud being pregnant and are trying desperately to get pregnant.  Put this crap somewhere else.  Also, do us all a favor and use adequate protection next time.. and no, pull-out method doesn't count.  If you're not "in the state of having a baby", you shouldn't be having sex either, because common sense dictates that that's how babies are made.

Possibly pregnant? Please help!!?



The condom broke, so I took Plan B on Sept. 15. It gave me my period four days after taking it, which was 21 days after the period before that.
(period on Aug. 29, period after plan b on Sept. 19)
Four days after that period ended, I had unprotected sex (if it wasn't for drinking, I wouldn't have made this mistake.) It has been two days since then. Is it safe to take Plan B again?



I plan on starting on a regular birth control as soon as possible, so no need to advise me on that. I understand that condoms and birth control should always be used, Plan B is just for emergencies, but this is an emergency. I unfortunately made a mistake two days ago that I very much regret.



Should I take Plan B again? Should I get a pregnancy test? How soon would I be able to tell if I am pregnant? I really need some help and to know what my options are. Please help!!

You could take another plan b - but just so you know they can mess up your system making your very irregular for awhile.  So, if you are irregular after that, don't assume you are pregnant.  You probably weren't ovulating so the chances aren't that high, BUT anytime you have unprotected sex you could get pregnant.  Also, maybe if drinking is the reason you are making bad choices, you shouldn't be drinking.  You can't blame alcohol for a bad choice, because you made the choice to drink . . .



Please get some birth control and calm down on the drinking until you are responsible enough to handle things.

You can't get pregnant unless you are ovulating. You don't Ovlulate until 2 weeks after your last period. I think it was too early to get pregnant. Plan B also really messes up your cycle for a while so it would make it even less of a chance. Granted there is always that chance. Your best option is to go to your Dr.s and get advice from them. It might be really really bad for your body to take Plan B twice so close together.
Good luck. And definitely get on some birth control! :-)

<question>



Why does every teen mom say this?



Every teen mom on here goes on some kind of crusade about how she is such a great mother and can emotionally and financially support her child.



I don't buy it.



Statistics don't lie: 2 out of every 3 teen moms drop out of school. They are more likely to get divorced. More likely to go on welfare. Their babies have slower coginitve development and more behavior problems... other serious health problems are more prevelent as well, like pre-mature birth, mental retardation, and undeveloped organs.



7 out of 10 teen moms do not even go to a clinic until they are over 3 mo. pregnant. They cost our nation $6.9 billion dollars a year in taxes.



Yet, every teen mom on here is "the exception"... yeah right. These are FACTS that have listed, I'm not just making this up to kill time or something. Why would you risk your babies health, your education, your marriage (if you are in one) and America's tax dollars just to have a baby at 17??



</question>



<additional details>



haha yeah, can't forget the 12 year olds... thats so disturbing.



And no, I don't suggest abortion: I suggest not getting pregnant. 12 year olds dont need to be having sex anyway, but that's a whole other topic.



hotmoma, 21 is much different than than say like, 15. But I am not here to "judge" you or anyone else. It's probably clear from my question that I'm not a big fan of teen pregnancy, but i didnt post this to be a jerk: I am just honestly curious WHY people can't just admit if they are a crappy mom and made a mistake

But I did drop out of school. Not one of my finest moments. But There is a story behind it. NOT MAKING EXCUSES... lol



But I think 17 isnt that young.. but the 12, 13, 14, 15 year old need to really think. Having sex will cause a baby.
I had a job at 15.. I know most of them dont.

I know - trouble is you can't tell a teenager anything without them getting defensive.  They're just at an age where they think they know it all and that the norms don't apply to them.  I just feel sorry for them - although I'm sure they try to do a good job, the odds are well and truly stacked against them.  Being a parent is a hard enough job even when everything else in your life is running smoothly, so I can only imagine how difficult it is if you have no money, no education and no partner to help.

Teens (and younger) mothers say this sort of thing because:



a.  They are in denial



b.  They are babies having babies



The cause of all that:  we, as a society have accepted sexual activity among teens and illegitimate pregnancy.  We also have accepted parents who set examples by same behaviors, including "social" drug use.

Wow. What a teen mom does is none of your Business. Get over your self and quit bitching. You are stereotyping. I am 18 and have a 2 year old son. I am in college, me and my boyfriend are still together after 5 years and plan on getting married, I am NOT on welfare, and I DONT get any government help. My son has developed fine and is smarter than most 2 year olds. He wasn't a preemie, and is not mentally retarded, and all his organs are fine. I went to the clinic at 6 weeks. Not 3 months. So I am the exception. You don't know any of us. A child is the greatest thing in the world, and it doesn't matter your age.



And I find it funny, you going on about the teen mothers that kept their baby and make a effort. What about the ones that have abortions, or don't give a ****???

I agree.  For every able teenage mother there's a dozen who are doomed to rely on the government (or their parents) for their food and housing.  I didn't even like boys when I was 14 but people in my junior high had kids at that age.  How did they miss the protection/abstinence train??



So many people go to China to adopt, why not just offer the babies for adoption and know that you put them in a better chance to succeed?  Rather than trying to keep them or aborting them.  It's honorable that they try, but look at the statistics- it doesn't work.

You are entitled to your opinion, but maybe you should try to not be so judgmental. Isn't mental retardation more common in babies whose mothers are over 40? If a teen gets pregnant and decides to keep her baby I'm sure she is trying to do her best. Maybe you should be more critical of the government. Kids need access to sex education and birth control, but religious fanatics keep it out of schools.

Dude, it's easy.  9 out of 10 teen moms don't have a CLUE WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  That's how they got pregnant in the first place, they're too irresponsible or nearsighted or just plain dumb to not get on the pill or have the guy wear a condom, so, clearly, they have no idea what it takes to raise a child.



And if you don't believe me, just have a look at the freakin' pregnancy section on here.  Damn near every question on there is "am I pregnant?"  Then you read it and they're like "I had unprotected sex and I'm ovulating and my boyfriend came inside me 35 times, COULD I BE PREGNANT, I'M SCARED?!"  It's why kids today are so screwed up, parents are becoming more and more incompetent.  And you'll *NEVER* convince me otherwise.



It's the very definition of Idiocracy.  They're ruining the world one child at a time, and they have no idea.  It's ******* terrifying.

Some pregnancy tests aren't as sensitive and suggest waiting one week after your missed period. Good luck, and baby dust.

If AF is late and an HPT gave a BFN, then you apparently ovulated late this month.  That doesn't change the odds of if you are pregnant or not this month, ovulation was just late (and therefore AF will be late, assuming you're not pregnant).  So it might be that you're pregnant and it might be that you are simply late.  The normal advice is to wait a week.  If AF still has not shown up, take another test.  Repeat the process until you get either AF or a BFP.

If you are that freaked out about being pregnant maybe you should not be having sex or should be on birth control at the very least.

17 weeks with twins and not showing?



I'm almost 17 weeks pregnant with twins and still not showing. The doctor said they're measuring to be the right size and everything but it just seems weird to me. I'm not the skinniest person (175; 5'5") but I still figured I'd be showing by now... Is this normal?

Nope. Dont' use more than one condom at a time.



If you want to 'double up', then add a different method -- vaginal spermicide, diaphragm, or hormonal birth control.

That will actually make things worse. Doubling up on them with cause you and him to hurt after as well as less protection because the two condoms will stick together and then will likely fall off. One condom or birth control. Trust whatever you are doing.

That is a ridiculous misconception! I remember hearing it all over the place when I was younger. Two condoms do not work better than one. If one is used properly, it is 99.7% effective. Adding another condom just encourages them to fall off. If you want to be triple sure: use a condom, make sure it is spermicidal, and get birth control.

Perhaps if you can accomplish it, but it might make things too cumbersome or cause too much friction between the two and thus will break both.  Honestly, if you don't want to get pregnant then you aren't ready to have sex. What's the hurry?  There are plenty of other things you can do that won't get you pregnant.  Remember, boys at this age just want to get laid so if you aren't ready then you shouldn't give in to the pressure...and if he loves you then he shouldn't be pressuring you in the first place.

Any ladies out there who have ever experienced Implantation Bleeding?



I am having IB. Ever since yesterday morning I've been having very light brown discharge. This morning when I woke up there was more brown discharge. I also put a tampon in to see if there was any blood, which there was just a little bit on the tampon. I'm still having brown discharge but its light. My question is, if you've experienced IB how long did it last for? And did you have period-like cramps with it too?
The cramps are very light and they come and go. Unlike my normal period where the cramps are unbearable without taking tylenol.



Thank you for your answers! :-)

Technically the first day of your missed period is the only time you are going to get a really accurate result.  You may be able to test a little earlier with a First Response Home Pregnancy Test or a blood test from planned parenthood/the doctor.  Good luck and Baby Dust (if that's what you want.) :-)

Everyone has there onw cure or none at all!  Here is what worked for me and for my friend that told me it worked for her!  Eat a litttle bit of anything off and on all day long! I ate atleast once an hour!  I even kept saltine crackers on my night stand for when I woke up in the middle of the night!  But drink lots of water with those crackers to wash it down! Water also helps ease cramps ( you may get them the whole pregnancy). Its like the cramps are telling you that you are starting to dehydrate! Saltine crackers are the best thing to eat or soda crackers as some people call them.  Like I said I ate every hour what ever I wanted ( alot of fruit, watermelon & strawberries were in season) and I never threw up the whole pregnancy!  I also ony gained 12 lbs so far and I will be 36 weeks tomorrow!  Good luck

As long as there isn't a fever, I would say there is nothing you can do, even if it isn't normal. I experience times when i was pregnant that I was colder then everyone else. Near the end, it changed but it happened. this is likely what is happening to you. Bundle up to a point, make sure your temperature doesn't rise above 100 F

To those who disagree with abortion... what would you propose is done to help women who are pregnant and do not want to keep their baby.



Say, a vote was cast and abortion was outlawed at any gestation - what would you suggest as a viable alternative?

I believe that any woman has a right to choose her options. But, in regards to the question, I think adoption is the best thing. Think of how many people out there cannot have children and would make wonderful parents! Just because you do not feel you can give your child the life they deserve is no reason to terminate, carry the child and pick out a caring family.

There are no other options I can think of in this presesnt day, apart from adoption.



If the mother is definitely against having her child or unfit to have her child, she should



A) Give the child up for adoption



or
B) Use effective contraception in the first place (this would save so many innocent children being born into this world where they are abandoned).



I'm not against abortions just for the record, everyone always has their own different circumstances.

Yes, I'm kidding. And a side note, adoption? Really? You all think that would honestly work? How many kids are stuck in the adoption system already? How many people really want to adopt? Not nearly enough. Instead of giving the child a way out you'd damn them to a life of floating from one house to the other never knowing a true family.

Sounds like pregnancy symptoms, but these could also be symptoms of many other things.



You need to take a pregancy test or see your GP. The sooner you know the better and can start looking after yourelf, taking folic acid, and doing what's best for the little one.

It can cause pre-term labor and premature rupture of membranes. For the baby it can cause asthma and other breathing problems that they will experience for life.

Question? Im thinking these are symptons? Is it just me?



I was trying to find a question that best suited my question so i would have to ask but i guess im a special case.=]



hehe.



Starters, I have posted a question about this b4 but only got one answer back so i am trying again a week later lol please lend your brain?



Okay, For the past 3 or 4 weeks i have been feeling sort of out of wack.
Pretty much my "symptoms" are.



- Feeling tired, or worn out and irritated for everything.



- i feel heavy, i dont know how to explain i just "feel" heavier ( Like my stomache, boobs arms, etc)



- I feel like i need to eat, not BIG meals, but just small meals throughout the day...?



- Ive had the worst back ache and sleepless nights for the past 3 days, i feel like i havent gotten a good nights rest in ages.



- Im also having something kind of like a period..?



The blood is mostly, ( if not all) brownish blood, some red blood but i think that was like a drop or two, its been about happening on and off since last tuesday, ( keep in mind its not BLEEDING, its more like an occasional drip )



- Ive been real moody and sad latley..?



Could this just be from stress?
Am i just imagining these things?
Or you know? whats going on? Does this sound about right to you?



I get paid tomorrow so tomorrow i will know for sure if my eggo is preggo,



But for now i just need some sort of answer..?



Thankkks!

all your symtoms could just be that your going to get your period,or that your pregnant.the only way to tell is by going to the doctors and getting a blood test or buying a home pregnancy test.everyones pregnancy symtoms differ so it's a bit hard to accuretly say if you sound pregnant or not. good luck,i hope you get the result your looking for.

2 days of spotting...high temps, but 13dpo and - HPTs...advice please!!!?

Well....what do you think?  Am I still in??  My spotting has been very light...started out as brown, now turning pink.  The spotting isn't getting any heavier (yet) and usually AF comes on with full force.  BUT...I have cramps and am bloated.



Just not sure what to think....is it still possible this month with the high temps?? (You can be honest too...I won't have any hurt feelings!)



Thank you so much!! :)

wow that has to be tough on you. just sit down with your partner and let him know that this is your child, and you want to raise him/her, and that you would love for him to be supportive of your decision. if he is a good man, he will back you up on whatever you decide to do. leaving you because you are pregnant would be silly of him, and if he did do this, you wouldnt want him in your life anyways. either way, you will get through it. there is alot of help out there for you. best of luck to you.

i say realistically who would you care for more your boyfriend or your child. men think abortion is easy because they dont see the reality in being pregnant until you look pregnant or they feel a kick. listen to your heart if u feel as though u can go through a pregnancy than go ahead but i say its too many people in the world that want kids and cant have them...give it up for adoption.

You keep the child.



He'll love you for it later.



Even if he doesn't there are lots of programs to aide single mothers.



If you really want this baby, and you choose not to have it, you'll regret it a lot more than choosing to keep the baby against the fathers wishes.



You should schedule a doctors appointment, and tell the doctor about your current situation, and daddy-to-be should be there. Doctors are well equipped to send you in the right direction, to talk to someone who can help you work through your doubts as a couple.

God knows the right time girl don't let someone else make that choice And don't say you can't raise two kids on your own i raised 4 on my own untill my 4th was 10 months old.

Don't get an abortion just to make him happy. You say you want the baby, so if you do have an abortion, you will regret it for the rest of your life. He chose to have sex with you, so he should be able to handle the consequences. Maybe after your baby is born he will come around. I mean, he already has one kid, so it's not like you're forcing him into fatherhood before he's ready. If he loves his kid from some other woman, he should love his kid with you just as much.

Join the club! Pregnancy is no where close to being fun, especially in the beginning and in the end. You can take regular srength tylenol for the pains you are having but nothing really helps the morning sickness and the feeling you get with that. Try as much as you can to relax. take your prenatal vitamins right before you lie down to go to bed for the night, this should help you keep them down. Good luck and enjoy it!

You are going through a hormone surge and I promise it will get easier....I experienced similar pain at 5 weeks all in my back and hips.  I spent a whole day in agony, but it did go away.  The smells were also unbearable and the intensity lasted until about 13 weeks.  As difficult as this time is and as insensitve as this sounds, please be grateful for all that you are experiencing as its an indication that everything is going as it should.  You should be worried if you did not have any symptoms at all.  Best wishes.

Don't complain so much, that is not a pregnancy going horrible. A pregnancy going horrible is when your water breaks at 24 weeks, you give birth at 24 weeks 4 days and your son dies 26 days later. Be happy you are being able to experience the "joys" of being pregnant.



To answer your question you can take Tylenol for the pain, only one tablet of regular strength, and as for the nausea and vomiting try eating some crackers with some mustard. If that doesn't work try some ginger, or some vitamin B6.

Welcome to the wonderful world of pregnancy. Eat crackers and try to avoid spicy and greasy foods. That will make your nausea worse. The only thing you can take is Tylenol. Or you can ask your doctor if it gets to bad.

ha ha sweetie, this is just the beginning next you'll have bloating, heartburn, cramps, everything in your body will ache, trouble sleeping and the list just goes on!!! Unfortunately until you're twelve weeks it's not a good idea to take any medications, the first twelve weeks are crucial for your babies development and any medication you take can harm him or her. For the nausea I suggest saltine crackers, keep them by your bed and eat them as soon as you wake up or when ever you feel tummy trouble. Also, do your best to always have food in your tummy, the longer you go without food the sicker you'll become. Another option, is ginger. I've never tried it but I heard it works great. You could also try sucking on hard candy, that helps me! As for the horrible pains in your tummy and back the only thing you can really do is take a warm bath (not over 110 degrees) or have your partner massage you. Stay away from heating pads, the heat could harm the baby unless your doctor says differently.  Good luck. Also, morning sickness usually goes away at about twelve weeks. So there is some hope! :)

I was the same way,  I know it's hard, but you have to try to keep some food in your stomache.  Leaving yourself hungry will just make it worse.



Especially if you take your prenatal vitamin on an empty stomache.



Talk to your doctor, there are medications out there made specifically for nausea in pregnancy.  I live in Canada and was prescribed Diclectin.  It would be worth it to ask about it.



IF your last period started on the 5th of August then you would be 8 weeks and one day pregnant today.  (being october 1st.)

yup all sounds well so far. when i was pregnant with my daughter i was sick all the way through, morning and night, right up until she was born. nothing i could do made me better. walking along the street, oops, throw up, cooking was a big no no, went right off coffee. it was awful i couldn't keep food down and actually lost weight. my doctor wouldn't give me anything and all the advice anyone would give was peppermint tea and ginger biscuits yuck! so apart from going to see your doctor, who may well be more understanding than mine, your pretty stuck with it hopefully your like the majority who stop feeling sick around 12 weeks. all i can advise is taking it as easy as is possible and it will all be over sooner than you think and it will all be worth it good luck .

With my first pregnancy I bled a total of three times. The first two was around the time that I would have had my regular period, the first two months of my pregnancy. It was light and lasted only a couple of days each. The third time was when I was 12 weeks and I had a lot of really dark blood. I went to the ER and was told I was having a miscarriage. I had an ultrasound, and she was still in there. I went full term with her with no other complications, she came out 8.8lbs, and very healthy. She is now almost 5 years old and doing great! :)

With both my second and third babies, I started bleeding at 8 weeks.  With the first one, it stopped after about a week.  With the last one, it went on until about 6 months.  My Son was born 8lbs. 5oz. and he just turned 9 last Sunday.  My daughter was born 6lbs. 14oz. and is now 15 months old.  Both are extremely healthy and happy.  Just follow what your Dr. tells you and you should be fine.  I was on bed rest for 3 months with my daughter in the beginning but things worked out great.

When do you think I should take a hpt?



I had my last period Aug 30, it was my first one since having a baby. I had unprotected sex with my hubby a few times last week. I'm feeling slightly nauseous...like I was when I was pregnant the first time...and haven't had my period again. I don't know what my cycle would be since I've only had the one period.I don't know what my regular cycle was even before baby. I went off BC, got pregnant, miscarried, got pregnant after the next normal period. Before that I was on BC for 7 years. I don't take any birth control now. It's only 6 months sooner than TT#2 so I'm not worried about being pregnant, just the financial part of it.I took a hpt this afternoon, but it came out negative. How long should I wait before taking another home pregnancy test to see if I'm pregnant again?

With a take home pregnancy test you won't be able to tell until about 5 weeks after you conceived, so I would wait a month to see if you have your period and then take the test if you don't flow. It could be that your body is still getting used to not having a baby in it eh? :)

I've had the exact same problem since I found out I was pregnant and I'm really hoping it goes away after I give birth. We switched toothpaste a few months ago and that alleviated the problem briefly-but not permanently. Sorry I'm pretty sure it's one of those not so fun things some women have ti deal with.

I have the same issue.  I haven't found a solution so far...willing to try whatever I need to do.  It seems like I can just turn on the water to wet my toothbrush and I'm already sick...so for me it doesn't have anything to do with brushing my tongue or the toothpaste.

No they do not prescribe them!!!!  They use to, but now there are so many OTC brands to choose from, I don't know of 1 OB/GYN in my office that has written a prescription for them in years.  Go to Target, you can get the Target brand (same nutritional value as name brand).  A big bottle of 200 is around $7.

There are many prescription prenatal vitamins out there, and they're often combinations of vitamins, dha supplements, and stool softeners (since preggo ladies are often constipated).  If you are trying to conceive, or are pregnant, your doctor will either automatically write an rx or ask if you want one.



There are also numerous prenatal vitamins available over the counter.



Personally, I chose to stick with an over the counter prenatal, as it was just as good and cheaper than the rx one, even with a copay.

They can if you want them to. I had them prescribed with my first baby. It got annoying though b/c almost every time I went to get them they were a different price. Then when I compared them to the ones that I had from OTC that I was taking before I got pregnant they were the same. So, with my last 2 pregnancies I took OTC and I & the both boys were fine.

My doctor did. In fact some docs might give you samples of several prenatal vitamins so that you can try them and determine which you prefer. You may want to your doctor or a person at the clinic you are going to for prenatal care to ask if they want to prescribe something or if there is an acceptable over the counter (OTC) alternative.

Doctors do prescribe prenatal vitamins, but there are also various over-the-counter prenatals available for anyone to purchase.  In order for you baby to benefit the most from your prenatals, the MD may prescribe you one high in a specific vitamin/mineral/ingredient.  Some prenatals can cause sickness (morning/all day-depends!) while others are less harsh on a woman's system.  I'd check with your MD before taking any additional vitamin, for the safety and maximum benefit of yourself and your unborn child,

Go buy a baby vapor bath soap. Its like 5.00 in Canada. Soak in a warm, not hot, bath for a while and try and relax. Go to the local healthy food store and get some eucalyptus oil, then go get some peppermint tea, lemon, and honey.  Rub the oil directly on your chest and throat, you can also diffuse it in water or in the air to help you breathe. Drink the peppermint tea ( to help you relax) mixed with the honey and lemon ( both  remedies of the throat).



Not only am I 39 weeks pregnant and experiencing the same things, I am in the middle of training to be a professional singer and thus use these remedies when I need these problems fixed fast. They work! Good luck!

Could I be expecting again?



I was due for my period on 5th September but only had a very slight bleed, i have spoken to someone who said it sounded very much like an implantation bleed as it only lasted one day and was very dark brown, It was not even enough to fill a panty liner.
I have taken several HPT's but all have come back negative.
I have still not received my normal period and am always very regular following my 28 day cycle.
Do you think there is a possibility I could be expecting baby number 2?
I already have a 10 month old daughter via c-section.
Do you think I could be pregnant again..?



I HAVE JUST TAKEN ANOTHER HPT AND IT'S STILL SAYING NEGATIVE!!

Sounds like chances are good. Some women will never test positive on a home pregnancy test, and it differs from pregnancy to pregnancy. I would see your doctor to get a blood test performed. Good luck, and congrats.

I would wait another week and test one more time. In the mean time, book an appointment with your doctor and get a blood test done because that does seem super frustrating and there is definitely a possibility that you are.

Could be anything...periods play up, as most women know. It may be that you come on later in the month. I had problems with spotting this month when my normal period was due, kept coming on/off then at the end of this month, i get my period as normal...These things happen !

You are almost a month late for your period, and most HPT can detect HCG in your urine by now.  If you have had unprotected sex around the time you were ovulating than yes you could be, but I would probably see your Dr. just to make sure nothing else is wrong.  If you are pregnant, don't freak, all 4 of my children are 15 months apart.  4 under 4!

If you think that you might be pregnant then you should either see a doctor a take a home pregnancy test, because a lot of the symptoms are the same for PMS and pregnancy. Never assume you are or aren't pregnant. Its best to find out so you can take the necessary precautions.

It depends on the position of the baby. My son was such that each time he kicked, it hit my rib cage and hurt a lot. But, in my case also I had by 28 weeks gained 40 lbs and was all belly. So I'm sure he was pretty crammed in there lol.

<answer>



It really depends.  I find my baby likes to kick me in the same spot(s) all the time and it can get really tender after a while (like a bruise).  I find it the most painful when my baby is just stretching and pushing as oppose to the kicks or punches - it makes my uterus feel like it's going to pop like a balloon.  I had an ultrasound yesterday and was told my baby is very cramped in my belly because I was so tiny before, she has nowhere to go!  So it's understandable that she gives me some good, strong pokes all the time.
It should not be THAT painful though, more or less it can just get uncomfortable.

Yes sometimes. LOL.  All women are different in what they experience.  I always seem to pass out (fall fast alseep)  when my little one is jabbing me.  LOL.  I'm almost 24 weeks and I'm sure they'll get stronger later on.  But also when I had menstrual cramps before I got pregnant, at night I'd always pass out sleeping, so they didn't bother me.

I hear/feel movements that could be mistake for bones cracking but I am pretty sure that's not the the case.  I am pretty sure its just the baby flicking against the inside of your uterus and swishing around the amniotic fluid.  The baby's bones are too flexible to be "cracking".  I wouldn't worry about it.  Ask your OB if you're concerned.

Not likely, but you should have taken as soon as you realized you had missed it. If you miss more than 2 pills in a pack then you should use a backup form of BC for the rest of that pack to be protected.

Only if God really wants you to have a baby! The chances of getting pregnant from that are slim. When on the pill you usually need to miss at least one pill to get pregnant. But all women are different.

It sounds like there is a good chance you are pregnant. When u get your "period" during pregnancy and its light like yours its usually called spotting. its very common! Good luck and congrats (if that is the case)

I think maybe what you're feeling is just you thinking you might be so your body is going along with it... it happens. Usually you won't feel sore breasts, pee a lot... etc... until at least 4 weeks pregnant. Also.. the male sperm is faster than the female, but it dies quicker... so I would say if you want a boy have a lot of sex.. and also, theres a medical study I just watched a show about on tv that said if you consume an extra 300 calories a day, mainly by eating breakfast cereal in the mornings... you are more likely to have a boy. Good Luck!

WELL I HOPE YOU ARENT EITHER BECAUSE THE WORST THING TO DO IS HAVE A BABY AND YOU CANT PROVIDE FOR IT. YOU SHOULD GO AND SEE A DOCTOR AND HAVE THEM TEST YOU IF THE TEST STILL COME OUT A NEGATIVE YOU SHOULD TRY TO RELAX BECAUSE IT APPEARS THAT YOU ARE STRESSING OUT. AND STRESS CAN LEAD TO TIRING, EATING AND OTHER THINGS. SO GO AND CHECK WITH A DOCTOR FIRST AND IF YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT YOU SHOULD GO AND HAVE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THEY ADVERTISE ON TV SAYING THAT IF YOU DONT WANT TO HAVE A BABY FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS THEY CAN PUT INSIDE OF YOU. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP. ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THAT.

Just keep your fingers crossed.  I understand how it is to worry like that.  I would wait until it is time for my period and take a test if I am late.  Stressing out won't do you any good.  It can actually cause you to be late.  So, try to remain calm until you have good reason to worry.  Good luck!

I think the earliest it can be heard is around 12 weeks, hand held dopplers are not that great though because they pick up any sound that is around you so you have to be in an extremely quiet place to get a good accurate sound. Good luck!

If it is the kind that you can just buy at Target... you might not ever hear it! They say they won't work until you are in your third trimester. But a lot of people can't even hear it then. But even if it does work, 10 weeks is WAAAYYY to early.

With the ones used in medical facilities - the earliest is about 12 weeks.



With the ones you buy online or in retail stores - sometimes you will never hear it, because they are cheaply made and most women don't know how to use them properly or know where to look for the heartbeat or know all the little tricks of the trade in picking up the heartbeat.



So don't be surprised if you can't find it.

The recommendation is about 20 weeks for the home ones - simply because they're not as good as the professional ones, nor are you as well trained in how to use them as the professionals! If you fail to hear a heartbeat at say, 17 weeks - you might panic unnecessarily, as a midwife would probably find it within seconds.



It's possible to hear the heartbeat as early as 10 weeks, but i urge you not to depend on it until 20 weeks. You'll get yourself worked up over nothing.
My sister in law had one and made a hospital trip at about 15 weeks when she couldn't hear it. Yesterday, she gave birth to a healthy 8lb 13 girl.

It depends on what kind you have.  If you have an actual doppler like they use at the dr, around 12-14 weeks is when you can start picking it up.  If it is one you got from walmart or target or somewhere like that, those don't generally work until after 25 weeks.

How early you can hear the baby's heartbeat is dependent on many variables. We expect to be able to hear the baby with an amplified doppler by about 12 weeks of gestation -- BUT there are many variables to be taken into consideration.



One of the reasons that we may not be able to hear the baby at that point is the position of the uterus or the position of the baby in the uterus. Another reason is that many mothers have an additional layer of fat just above the pubic bone. This is the area we listen through when we are looking for a very small baby at around 12 weeks. Sometimes it can be difficult to locate the baby or hear it when you are listening through a little extra padding.



If there is any question about the well-being of the baby, we usually do a quick ultrasound in our office to reassure us and the mother that the baby is okay. That way we can actually see the heart beating, and we don't worry about hearing it until the next visit.



Good luck :)

Well when I was 17 weeks pregnant my doctor couldn't pick up my baby's heartbeat on a doppler! I was terrified. But he told me not worry because the baby can be laying awkwardly and the position of the placenta plays a role too. Mine's 'anterior' which means it's at the front, which is why it's harder to pick up my baby's heartbeat. Also your uterus is still between your pelvis which obviously makes a difference. I think 12 weeks onwards it starts to 'come out' so I reckon around then would be good to start trying to hear it. It's well worth the wait though :)

From around 10 weeks, however, it very much depends on your anatomy and that size of the foetus.  Eg. If you have an anterior placenta (placenta is on the font wall of your uterus) it can be more difficult to locate.

The baby shower basically does the same thing, remember if you throw two parties and invite a lot of the same women, you'll only get one gift.  Times are hard right now, and people don't have the money to spend.  Just go to dinner with her!

why don't you throw a spa party. it will be great for the women to get together and be pampered. you can by some facial stuff and some manicure and pedicure items and throw your own spa party or you could find a consultant who does this.

Make it a baby related shower, but all mommy gifts. Like for instance they have jewelry thats for a mommy, with the babies birth stone on it and mommys birth stone on it. Buy her things that will comfort her. Like a pregnancy body pillow, one of those foot spa massagers, a lotion and skin care set, maybe some cocoa butter cream for stretchmarks, maybe some gift cards to victorias secret or bath and body works so she can still feel glamorous and sexy. Maybe you all should just go out to a spa together and get hair and nails done. These are all good things to do for a pregnant woman.... I wish someone would do it for me!!

Do something similar to a wedding shower or a birthday party.  Do gifts of bath items or gift certificates for massages or a beauty salon or to get her nails done.  Maybe get her gift certificates for a nice dinner out.  Make it like a girls night get together but without alcohol.  My sister and I LOVE karaoke and she took me out to our favorite karaoke spot a couple times while I was pregnant.  I was the hit of the entire place.  People thought I was so cute up there singing "like a Virgin" while I was pregnant.

You could do an "at homespa" day with finger sandwiches, non-alcholic spritzers, facials and mani/pedis and just girliness everywhere - pink (or whatever her fav. color is) decorations, colored frosted cupcakes, tiaras and sparkles.



I know it sounds juvenile, but it sounds like its girliness you want to celebrate, not the baby, so focus on her.  Maybe select a theme of something she really loves...like movies or another activity she is fond of and use it as inspiration to go all out.  You sound like a really nice friend.  Good luck!

A spa day and lunch would be lovely.  I am 34 wks pregnant and would love for my friends to have donet that.  Maybe all of the girls can meet at a spa and get massages, pedicures and facials.  She will get to the point in her pregnancy where she won't be able to care for her feet the way she should and where her back hurts in places she didn't even know could hurt.  The mommy shower  will be a nice treat that will focus just on her.

YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP WORKING. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT YOUR UNBORN CHILD IS THE MAJOR CONCERN. TO BE SURE OF THESE PAINS YOU SHOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR AND SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. IF HE TELLS YOU ITS OK TO GO BACK TO WORK DONT LISTEN UNLESS YOU KNOW FOR SURE THAT YOU ARE READY TO GO. JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT YOUR BABY FIRST. GOOD LUCK

You are probably fine but call your doctor whenever you have a concern and they will tell you what you should do.  The tired, sleepy and lightheaded feeling is normal for pregnancy.  the pains may not be.  Best to be safe and call.

Talk to your doctor. It's normal to have many aches and pains as pregnancy progresses, it's also normal to be tired and not feel well. But usually by 4-6 months you start feeling more normal, have more energy, etc.



You can certainly take days off if you need them, but there's no need to go off work completely and on bedrest unless your doctor orders it. One early miscarriage does not pose a risk to this pregnancy, especially since you have now made it out of the first trimester.

If you are having issues you should without a doubt go see a doctor. Having had a miscarriage before you should proceed with extra caution. The doctor will let you know if this is a real issue and if it is he might be able to do something to prevent further issues.

This is part of a normal pregnancy. The pains you are feeling are most likely growing pains from the stretching of your muscles & tendons to accommodate your growing uterus. If you having menstrual-like cramping or bleeding, then see oyur Dr or go to the ER

I've had 2 children, 1 miscarriage & now pregnant again. Know that feeling light headed can be anemia or just part of your body trying to keep the blood flow up since you are pregnant.  The sharp pains, if not constant, I would think is just like what I have and what I always had with each pregnancy and my doctors told me it is "growing pains" as your muscles are stretching to make room for baby.  Mine always seem to be on the lower stomach to the sides a little bit and going down to the pubic area.  It is always a good idea to call your dr if you are concerned.  Best of luck to you!

Did I have false labor contractions?



Firstly I am 36 wks, last night I woke up with some intense cramping which felt like menstrual cramping and it lasted about a couple minutes. However, I didn't feel any actual contractions, just cramping. And I'm having the same feeling right now, it just feels like menstrual cramping!  This is my first baby so I'm not sure exactly what to expect, but I was just wondering if these were false labor contractions.

Are they coming and going and regular intervals, or is it a constant cramp? Does your uterus feel like it's getting firm when you feel it?



It could just be normal pregnancy cramping and not actually contractions at all.

it's not that it's false labor, it's just everything starting up slowly.  Your body is getting ready.  Yes that's how contractions feel at first when they're small--like cramping.  If they become more intense or regular then you should go to the hospital.

It could just be Braxton Hicks contractions. But on the other hand, it could be actual contractions. If you feel them in a consistent pattern for 3 or more hours, you should go to L&D. Its not cramping, its actual contractions. I would say since you are close to having the baby it was just BH though.

DO Braxton Hicks contractions feel like the baby is bawling up and does ur stomachs shape change?



I am 32 wks pregnant with twins and I just started getting this tightening feeling where it looks like my stomach is even changing shape.  Has anyone had this or had twins to know whether its just them or if its BH contractions?  Also I feel like it takes my breath slightly and then I get a huge relief of air all of a sudden.  It isn't painful at all though.

That is very possibly braxton hicks. They can even be crampy feeling. I would definetely mention this to the Dr though. Also, put a piece of paper somewhere conveinant and mark the times it happens. You will be able to tell if you are having a pattern starting.

Is this a true pregnancy fact?



my wife said there are only a few days after a period where a woman can get pregnant, so if she doesn't get pregnant during those few days we have to wait until her next period is over to have a shot.

Yes. WOmen ovulate about 14 days after their period. So you really have about 4-5 days that you can get pregnant. Because sperm can live inside a women for up to 72 hrs you can have sex a few days before you ovulate. But yes if you don't get pregnant, you have to wait till next month to try.

Your wife is absolutely right.  There's a 3-day long (ish) window in the middle of the month when she can conceive.  The first poster is slightly off--she will actually ovulate 14 days BEFORE her next period, not 14 days after her previous one.  There's only a difference if she doesn't have 28-day cycles.



Also-and you probably don't want to hear this-having sex too much can actually decrease your chances of conceiving.  Every other day is usually sufficient, and any more than that can lower your sperm count too much to be effective.  Not saying daily sex won't do the job, but it actually doesn't make it more likely like lots of people think.

NOT AT ALL! You don't have to be ovulating to get pregnant. There is even a small chance of getting pregnant while on your period. You can get pregnant ANY DAY OF THE WEEK. She doesn't know what she's talking about. You should do some research.

Once again my period has returned. How can i increase my chances of conceiving this month. Lots of answers!?



Once again my period has returned. I miscarriage a few months ago i was about 5 weeks pregnant. I did not need a d&c because i expelled everything naturally and my cycle went right back to it 28 day cycle. I have continued taking my prenatal vitamins. I started taking 400 mg of folic acid a day. I eliminated caffeine from my diet. My period started September 29. and once my period is done i'm thinking about charting. Can someone please explain to me how it works. I am also thinking about buying a ovulation predictor. Is it better to get the digital ovulation predictor or the two line test? Should i have sex every day or every other day with my husband to increase chances of conception. Should i have my husband start taking vitamins to increase his fertility . I really want to get pregnant this month after my miscarriage becoming pregnant has been really important to me.



Please help Lots of tips please! Thanks in advance.

Are you talking to your doctor and getting medical help?  I also had a miscarriage this spring, and because we had been trying my doctor suggested a fertility specialist for help.  He didnt want me to waste any time.  I am now taking Clomid, and Gonal shots to help me produce more eggs. This past month I had  5 eggs, 2 were viable.  I am still waiting to test.  Everything you are doing is great.  I was told to have sex every other day, enough time to help his sperm replenish.  Has he had his sperm tested?  I would definitley ask a doctor...

Even if you did everything naturally with your miscarriage, you still need to see a gynocologist. They can help see why you may of miscarried and how to help you prevent that in the future.



Also, I have often heard that having sex everyday is the best way to get pregnant. If you wait awhile the sperm won't be as active.



I'd also suggest a digital ovulation predictor.I tryed the line ones and they never seem to work for me.



Try getting a basal thermometer- it has a chart in there where you can chart your temperature, if you have a normal 28 day cycle, you should be most fertile around the 14th day from the day your period starts. When you are ovulating your basal temperature will rise. You ahve to make sure you take if every morning before you do anything- get out of bed, brush your teeth, even pee- then write it down.



Good luck to you :)

honestly... try to predict when your ovulating ... i tried to do that for months.. eventually i gave up trying and then it just came... i think getting pregnant is suppose to be for a reason..



for instance we tried for over a year then before me and my boyfriend split up we both knew i was a week late, but a couple days befor ei found out i was pregnant we got into this HUGE fight i gave him a black eye, it was basicly a fight over nothing at all, he was trying to wrestle me and just get on my nerves on purpose, and i really didnt feel like it and during tha whole play fight it escalated way to fast and became a real fist fight, that night i thought we were done for good .. but a few days after i took 3 tests and they were all positive, thursday i called him and said we need to seriously talk, he picked me up on friday n was being such a jerk to me "if your pregnant blah blah blah" " your lying your not pregnant" he made me take a test in front of him, 2 minutes after i took tha test n proved it to him i walked out acting to ignore him and he held me and said he was so sorry... this pregnancy in my opinion was to bring us together n prove to us that we shouldnt let something so stupid bring us apart... im 14 weeks now and were doing good now...but good luck eventually it will come!

I use the Saliva Ovulation Scope (I purchased at Wal-Mart for $20), ovulation predictor strips (Bought LH Strips off ebay-100 for $20), Ovulation Chart (www.yourdays.com) and cough syrup ($2 per bottle). Yes, cough syrup. I swear it helped me get pregnant with my second child. Some cough syrups contain an agent, guaifenesin, that helps thin cervical mucous., which helps sperm travel through the cervix and get to the egg so it can fertilize it! I took 2 tsp three times daily around the time of the month that I ovulated, it worked the first month! These are all the things I suggest to conceive. Hope they help! Best of luck TTC!

Can BH contractions hurt?



Last night I was having BH contractions about every 3 minutes lasting for around 30 seconds.  After about 45 minutes I started to get a menstrual like cramp with them that intensified for awhile.  After about an hour of this I think they settled down a bit because I fell asleep.  Would those last contractions also be BH contractions?



I am going to the doctor today so I am going to talk to her about it as well, but it is nice to hear from other!  I hope I was not supposed to go to L&D when that happened!

Your baby is still the size of a plum, you aren't hurting it but try really hard to stay off your stomach for the mear fact that in a few months, you won't be able to sleep there anymore. Put a pillow in front of you too ( your partner might have to hit the couch until you get a belly big enough to stop you from rolling.)

Pending on what kind and how many subsidies they have you could move in completely based on your income, or you might have to pay market rent until you qualify for a subsidy.

I've heard of this happening back in the 60's but I agree with the response above...today's technology is far better.  I do know someone who did not find out about her twins until she was 5 months along, but I think that would be rare (and that was 9 years ago).

With the amount of technology used in pregnancy now, the chances are almost none. Doppler at every appointment, ultrasounds, nonstress tests and fetal monitoring would definitely pick the two babies up at some point.

You can have an abortion free in certain clinics and you cannot abort a baby after 24 weeks of the pregnancy. Her doctor is the only one that can supply the morning after pill or you can pay for one from a pharmacy (not sure how much pill costs in dollars but they are 25 pounds in england) and how about using condoms? It doesn't matter whether you like the feel or not it is better to be safe then sorry!

Well, being dead from cancer isn't exactly good for the baby...



Radiotherapy is probably better than chemo, because it can be targeted extremely accurately on just the breast. It wouldn't affect the baby at all, except that if it made mum feel ill she probably wouldn't cope as well with being pregnant.

Sounds like she is head down. You can measure 2 or 3cm bigger and everything is fine, different practitioners measure differently. And, if you are overweight you will measure a little big to get over that fluff. If you are small, then she might just be a big baby

I was measuring a week ahead at all of my appointments, except this last one - I measured right at 32 weeks. My baby, by ultrasound, measures 34 weeks. It just depends on how your doctor measures you, based on how well s/he can feel where your uterus begins and ends. It does sound like she is head down though, by the heartbeat. I'm surprised your doctor didn't tell you that. Anywho, best of luck.

That's standard in the USA.  C-sections are scheduled at 39 weeks, no earlier.  With my second son, I went into labor and then went to the hospital.  They just prepped me for my c-section anyway the way they would have if I'd been scheduled ahead of time.  It wasn't an emergency c-section at all.  It'll be okay.  If you go early, they'll just do the c-section early.  That's all.  Good luck!

Some doctors just prefer to wait that long. I think he's being a little overly cautious by stating that earlier might require NICU. I have never seen a 37 week baby with immature lungs who needed NICU care unless there were other severe medical issues with the child.



Labor is a lengthy process, and if you go into labor you'll be just fine as long as you go to the hospital immediately.



Good luck.

I had my first one emergency c-section, and my 2nd was scheduled for a c-section at 39 weeks and she broke my water and came 3 weeks early!  Good thing, she was almost 10 lbs!  Anyhow, with this pregnancy, my dr said they will schedule it at 39 unless this baby seems really large too, they might do 38 weeks.  Honestly, I didn't know I had an emergency c-section cut with my son until I was having my daughter by c-section.  I only knew the outside cut was horizontal.  So, I was in labor with my girl for over 8 hours before they finally got me into surgery to deliver.  We didn't have any complications at all, and you should be ok there.

I'm a little confused by your timetables...  Where are you getting 3 weeks if you feel it might have been 5 weeks since you conceived?  If it has been 5 weeks since you had unprotected sex, you should be due or overdue for your period, right?



If you're due or overdue for your period, you've got a good chance of getting an accurate result.  Try a brand of test that specializes in picking up low levels of pregnancy hormone, such as First Response.



Good luck with whatever result you desire!

Yeah, I did. I tested and got a negative, it was hard but I waited like 4 or 5 days then tested again and got a faint positive. Good luck!



P.S. Don't know if this will help or not, but when I finally got my positive I used First Response early results and when I got a faint positive I went to the store and got a Clear Blue digital and it said pregnant. So just out of curiosity I tried one of the internet cheapies that I used 4 days prior and got a negative...the internet cheapies didn't show positive until I was few more weeks along.

Yes, it's possible.  Depending on the test you're using and when you conceived, there may not have been enough HCG to trigger a positive.  Wait and test again if you think you're pregnant.  I found out at about 2 weeks after conception with my pregnancies.

Has anyone had a 1-250 chance of having a baby with downs or inhibin-a result a bit abnormal?



I have a 1-250 chance of having a baby with downs. I had my u/s and baby looks great. So I decided not to get the amnio. Two weeks later which was yesterday I had my doc app and she told me the doctor who gave me the ultrasound said she wants me to come back at 28 and 36 weeks for more u/s because my inhibin-a was a bit high. Now my doc said it really wasnt that high and the other two docs would have disreguarded it. It was only up .3  She said the good thing about this is more u/s ANYONE OUT THERE WHO CAN GIVE ME ADVICE I REALLY NEED IT

1.  I have a 1 in 100 chance just being at my age.
2.  You don't have to do this.  It's too late anyway and you're keeping the baby.  The only reason to know really for sure is if you aren't going to keep the baby if it had down's syndrom.  You can opt out.

A 1 in 250 chance is still pretty low, and many women get elevated screening risks who go on to have totally normal babies. So don't stress out about it, odds are still in your favor that baby is fine.



But personally, if it were me, I would have all the other diagnostic tests I could to either confirm or rule out any diagnosis - in the off chance baby did have a genetic condition I would want to know ahead of time, to be prepared and educate myself on what I am getting into as a parent of a special needs child, and so the medical staff is prepared for taking care of the baby immediately from the time of birth. People always assume that finding out is only going to affect your choices if you're thinking about abortion. That's not the case. It's about being empowered by knowledge and being prepared for what comes next instead of being surprised in the delivery room.

Just ask yourself...would you love your child any less if he/she were born with downs or any other sort of abnormalty?  If not, I would say to go forward with the u/s, but not to worry too much until anything is determined by the doctors as a greater risk.  Mentally prepare yourself for the fact that your child may not be exactly as you planned, but also he/she may be just fine.  The worst thing you can do is worry and stress when there truly is nothing certain at this point.

Nobody can tell with exact precision when you conceived. You likely conceived approximately two weeks after your last monthly period.

When I got pregnant for my son I suffered nausea everyday until about a half hour after he was born. (Ultimately resulting in the loss of 24 pounds) If you feel like you can eat something, try some crackers or toast.
The caffeine in tea and coffee can actually work as an appetite supressant, so i would opt for a small snack before drinking it.  Don't be too concerned about your weight right now. It's tempting, I know, but you got a little guy (gal) in there who might want that snack.



Who says you can't relax on the computer??  Silly rabbit! Is there anything more relaxing than checking out some of these Q&A's? &lt;g&gt;



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Excellent advice, thanks. (Now he'll be even more jealous. Ten points!) I opt for decaf green tea and when I do crave coffee I make it all decaf or very little regular added.



Thanks for the advice. I'm going to keep some crackers near the bed.

I would say consult a doctor about this. Alcohol is bad for an adult's body think of your little baby. I understand you didn't know you were pregnant, but fetal alcohol syndrome happens that exact way, by drinking when pregnant. It's definitely a risk, but talk to your doctor for sure

Well, in the first four weeks of pregnancy your baby isn't even connected to your bloodstream. (For the first two weeks, technically you aren't even pregnant.)  So long as you have stopped, and don't drink ANY more, your risks are minimal. A lot of moms drink before they know they are pregnant, and while it's certainly not recommended or wise, everything is probably fine.



I think you're going to be okay. :)

unfortunately, it's hard to know if you are prego those first 4 weeks. while every week is important, those are probably some of the most crucial. i drank and found out the next day i was prego. it didn't have any effect that i can tell, so i was probably lucky. it is possible that it could cause problems, but you won't know until later. i wouldn't worry yourself over it, because it's not like you did it when you knew you were pregnant. more than likely, everything will be fine, but i would def watch my actions from here on out.

I was worried about the same thing, i was four weeks along and drank heavily before I found out I was pregnant. My doc said there are never any guarantees, but before six weeks, the fetus doesn't take food etc directly from what the mother eats and drinks...if I remember correctly. Today I have a healthy 11 month old, so try not to worry too much!

Yes this is normal, during your second trimester many woman don't feel pregnant because there are very few symptoms for many women at this time. It's normal to have a weird appetite. I always got full really quickly but at 12:00am I woke up starving and had to get a snack. It was crazy! Also, the reason your stomach is getting hard is probably braxton hicks contractions, it's just your bodies way of preparing for childbirth. this early you don't feel pain from them though. Your stomache will just get hard and then release. With my first pregnancy this started for me at about fifteen weeks.

I have two kids, 5 years and 5 months.  What you are experiencing also happened to me.  I had no appetite in the am but was ravenous in the evening.  I ate ice cream EVERY night with my second pregnancy.  I gained 16 lbs with my second, 10 with my first.  Both babies were healthy and happy!  The hardening can be early braxton hicks contractions.  Nothing to be concerned about, but check with your Dr. anyway.  It happened to me with my second pregnancy.  There's so much going on with your body right now.  You will notice all sorts of things.  Try to enjoy it.  It really does go quickly.  I miss being pregnant.  Congratulations and good luck!

This is normal. I just went through this a few weeks ago and I was thinking Something must be wrong I am suppose to be starving!! Your body lets you know what you need. As you get closer to your 3rd trimester your appetite will increase. My stomach has been getting hard off and on for almost my whole pregnancy. I believe this is braxton hicks contractions and these are not harmful.

Yeeeeees, lol. I'm 31 weeks and still have morning sickness, so I am afraid to eat in the morning. I usually don't eat until a little later, around lunch time. then I snack until dinner and then snack a lot more after dinner. I don't know why, lol. I never really ate breakfast much before I got pregnant.

Hey, to those who are being rude... Being a pregnant teen, is not necessarily a bad, irresponsible thing. I'm 30, now, but married one day after I turned 19, got pregnant a month later, had the baby while still barely 19, and---11 years later---am still married to the same man, have two other kids, and am expecting our last... We own our own home, have two cars, take care of our own, and have plenty of love and laughs to go around... Don't be so quick to judge the younger parents. :)

i got pregnant when i was 16 and am now 17 and am engaged to the dad who is 21. I'm due October 18th. My pregnancy has been great. i didn't have a lot of morning sickness. I was and still am however very exhausted since I'm still in school. I do know there are many teens getting pregnant but age doesn't always matter. My mom was pregnant at 17 and is a great mom and has a good job. Its not right for others to judge if they don't know your situation.

Yes , to many. All these kids having babies before they are even out of mom's house. Its total crap! When grown MARRIED women are trying to get pregnant, and are able to support their babies and not have to rely on the state or their MOMMY. It just doesn't seem fair that all you kids can get pregnant when you shouldn't even be having sex.

I know that these questions are probably old...?



But when I have asked some people they say is there a chance you are pregnant.  So I am just wondering what chance it would be, really I could take a test but I see no reason at the moment.  So here is it my period came Friday evening and is non existence by today. It has been extremely light, I have never experienced this before, I never filled up a whole tampon at all all weekend.  Was a very light period for me, and I have had my period for about 10 years now. What do you think, and please don't tell me to take a pregnancy test unless you really think so. Thanks.



</question>



<additional details>



My boyfriend and I rely on the pull out method, I know not the smartest but we do it.  Anyway before this past weekend, my last period was  August 30th, and I know we had sex on Sept. 3rd.



Its really not that I am worried, it is just I have causally mentioned to some friends when they were talking about their periods, and I said my was pretty light this month, they all have just been saying oh are you pregnant.  I don't really even know if this is pregnancy thing, I guess it is.

sure you can ask us, but when ur that worried and there is something you can actually do then why not do it? &lt;3

nipple stimulation worked for me...you have to basicly pull on them as if a baby would be sucking on them...this tricks your body into thinking that you have already had the baby and helps you to contract...do it for about 10 minutes at a time and no more because there is a possibility that it will make you go into intense labor if you do it longer...you can try every hour or so hope it helped

well unfortunately there is not much that hasn't been suggested or done. You need to trust your doctors and although they claim that baby is large, its a GUESS. there is not any real accurate way to tell how big they are until they are out in the world.



My best advice is walk, go bowling or talk to your doctor about an early due date.



best of luck

i believe the date of conception is usually considered to be 2 weeks after the start of your LMP. this is because ovulation usually occurs about 2 weeks into your cycle, so that is the best time to conceive. if you are trying to get pregnant you can use fertilityfriend.com, its a big help. ive always found that it is easier to get pregnant when you arent thinking about it though.

I had a normal period (28 day cycle) and tracked for 3 months to make sure...I knew my LMP and conceived on day 14.  I was lucky, I know, but I was also pretty familiar with my cycle by then.  Also, I was not trying to get pregnant, but not preventing it either.  It was a "see what happens" scenario...I'm due Dec 3rd so I guess that's what happened in my case!

here are some ideas.. not sure how good they are lol.. They have these books called "The darling book for Girls" it is filled with things you can teach girls.. camping.. sewing.. what every girl needs in a tool box.. they are GREAT books..  They have a mini of the book also.. and they have one for boys also.. i got one as a family gift from my daughter uncle.. and i got my brother the one for boys at their baby shower (hes a first time dad and was having a boy) They have them at book stores and Costco you could get him that (link http://www.harpercollins.com/books/97800... ) and tell him he better catch up.. or go to the book store and they have a lot of other books about being a dad or a girl.. or a boy..



You could just frame the u/s picture and let him figure it out.



At wal-mart (here anyways) they have a bag of Hershey chocolate kisses that say its a boy or its a girl (wrapped in pink or blue kiss wrappers.. cute)



if its a boy you could go get a football or some type of manly thing and tell him he better start to practice for when his son is born..



You could get him a small cake made decorated in pink or blue saying congratulations daddy your going to have a.. or some phrase on it..



good luck and congrats

Is my pregnancy going ok?



Basically I found out about 2 weeks ago that I was pregnant. I've been to the doctors with the intentions of getting rid of it as the financial position I'm in isn't good and my boyfriend wasn't very supportive. My doctor then told me I was probably around 10/11 weeks pregnant, since then I've cancelled two abortion appointments & I've decided on keeping it as my boyfriend is a lot happier with the idea now & we're both feeling quite excited! I keep getting sharp pains in my lower stomach & was just wondering if any other women have experienced this & everything's gone okay? I'm yet to book the doctors to have it all sorted out properly, just wanted the heads up really!



Thanks alot.

It sounds like what you are experiencing is round ligament pains. They are perfectly normal as your body and your uterus stretches for accommodating the growing baby.

first of all i applaud you on not going through the abortion cause not many ppl who get pregnant unexpectedly are financially stable enough to support a baby but some how thing will work out. ok now to answer your question your uterus is growing and will continue to grow throughout your pregnancy to almost 100 times its size. which will definitely cause cramps it wont last much longer though and another thing my doctor told me i was not drinking enough water i know you urinate alot right now but you have to drink at least three liters of water a day the more the better that causes cramps when you move around if you are not drinking enough.
congrats and good luck!!!

Is an abortion painful?



Yesterday I found out that I was pregnant, I am 19 years old and not mature/stable enough to have a child, I am in a stable relationship but do not want children at such a young age theres far too much I want to do before I have kids. I know 100% that I want an abortion & wondered if anyone could advise me on what the procedure is does it hurt? I think I am about 4 weeks gone. I know I shouldve been more careful I AM on the pill but forgot to take it last month a couple of times, as I wasnt very well, I am absolutley distraught! Ive always been so careful.

At 4 weeks you can get the pill, Basically its inserted inside you and makes you have a miscarriage, Im a guy so i can't tell you of the pain but its the most 'natural' way, i use that word lightly.

I'm not gonna preach at you, but yes you should have been more careful. Because of this I think you should at least think about giving birth to the baby and letting somebody adopt the baby? There are loads of couples looking for surregate mothers and this would be your best option. In some cases the adoptive parents will let you have contact with the child too if you want it, if you still want to be in their life but just know you can't support it.

I have never had one but i hear the procedure for you is not but depending how far along you are it is for the fetus.
from 6 weeks the heart beats ,
you are either sedated or have a general anesthetic \
hun there is always adoption ,
abortion can leave you infertile unable to have children in the future just get some counseling before you decide

As you are only for weeks it will be less traumatic than someone further down the line.

if ur in the uk it goes like htis huni,



u see a dr, he will refer you 2 a family planning clinic, they will give u the once over and refer you to an abortion clinic, now considering your very early on you probs wont require surgery.



but if you do, you are put to sleep and it takes about 10 mins afterwards you will feel groggy from the anesthesia. you will bleed after also(like a period) and suffer cramps. however, this is usually for later abortions (after 9 weeks)

Yes it is painful and can be painful years after if you later on feel regret. I know someone who regretted hers because the dr performing hers was having a hard time, the nurse asked what was wrong and he said "it wont stay still" and then "oh I got it" at 8 weeks.



She hadnt realized the little thing could actually move so it was devastating for her.



Unless you are determined, you could always use adoption. RICH Americans pay BIG bucks for a new baby, that is how desperately they want a child. That might give you something to feel good about later, knowing that you helped a childless couple find love with the child that would have burdened you. Your child will be loved and appreciated by someone suffering with infertility.



Do what you feel you need to, no one can judge you, only yourself.



I had my first at 19, things worked themselves out beautifully. No regrets and I had that abortion scheduled too, I backed out when I heard the heartbeat at 7 weeks.

Tylenol and massage and lots of water to drink.



A massage therapist suggested a cold pack on your neck while you soak your feet in warm/hot water.  This apparently pulls the blood from your head, the extra blood may be causing the headaches.



I had horrible headaches for weeks, all I could do was take the tylenol and lay down for as long as possible.

Sounds like tension headaches to me not migraines. I have had migraines before and it is a whole lot worse than you describe so something is causing you to much stress and tension. so find what is causing the problem and eliminate it. Get away from anyone who may be causing you such anxiety and stress and they will go away. If you can't seem to find the source then I found that going outside and taking an hour walk will get rid of the head ache and you won't have to take anything for it. It is hard to get up and go for a walk but when you try it and it does work you won't mind doing it. Believe me it helps circulate your blood and will ease the pain.

It sucks but the only med you can take is Tylenol! I got some severe migraines during the first part of my pregnancy and went to the ER. They could do nothing and just made sure baby and my vitals were ok. They gave me a med for nausea and sent me home both times! The one time I thought for sure I would die or explode the pain was so bad! The only thing i found to help was hot rag on my head then alternating with a cold rag on my head! I also secluded myself away from noise and and light! Eat small meals so you don't upset your stomach! Also make sure to get plenty of water! Sometimes headache and migraines are made worse if you are dehydrated! I've heard that Head On stuff is safe but ask your doctor to know for sure! Good luck and I can understand how painful it is!

Question about conception and ultrasound dates...Please help!?



My LMP was March 27th.I had sex on APril 7-8th (day 12 and 13 of cycle)using withdrawal and 22nd using a condom.I've had about 4 ultrasounds.1st showed on I conceived April 17th(given at 9weeks pregnancy),19th (given at 19 weeks) and 22nd(given at 26 weeks).



My cyles are 28-33 days long.So if I conceived on the 22nd,that would have been day 27th of cycle.Which means my luteal phase would be only 6-7 days.On which date do you think I conceived?The Doctor thinks my baby will be bit small.It's a girl and she's currently almost 1.76 lbs at 27 weeks.My Due date according to LMP was never changed.

Your not going to feel ALL movements until your around 24 weeks...chances are so long as your still feeling some movement all is well.



Also you don't mention any cramps or bleeding which leads me to believe that your just a bit early still for ALL movements to be felt.

You need to go to the doctor and tell you parents.  You had unprotected sex and it happens.  You need to think about those abortion medicines.  I couldn't kill my baby, but others don't think twice.  You need to think about it for awhile.  As long as it's in the first 3 months, you can terminate the pregnancy.  If you don't want it, give it to an adoption agency.  Many people out there would love to have a baby.  You need to consider your actions.

you need to see a doctor for 2 reasons.
First you need to confirm that you are pregnant, before you can do anything.
second then you can discuss the SAFE option for what you decide to do.  there are medications that a specialist can give you but it depends on circumstances.



Please see a doctor

Baby shower! need advice fast! please answer?



my baby shower is on sunday the 5th.. 4 days away.. the lady supposed to be doing my cake canceled last night due to surgery and the picture i gave her she couldn't blow up without it looking too blurry soo we have to hurry up and go to a giant eagle or something n hope they'll make a cake for sunday. HERES THE BIG ISSUE: we were trying to involve my 4 yr old in this baby shower so.. we bought favors with stickers that say "Brandon has a brother on the way!" and the cake was going to be a picture of a little boy holding his moms pregnant belly.. saying the same.. so that the theme here was about my son Brandon since its a second shower.... NOW im stuck bc only the favors let guests know this is the theme.. im thinking of quickly changing things and the baby's room is going to be winnie the pooh so maybe this.. but we'll have to do new favors and buy a few things to show its winnie the pooh theme... someone tell me what i should do.. keep the theme i was using and how to bring it out more if i cant  put it on the cake or really anywhere? or switch to the winnie the pooh theme and change things up asap ? and what to do for the cake... and favors if changing the theme need to be cheap! help!!

You could probably get a cake at any grocery store bakery by Sunday. They may be able to do the the picture if you have another one. Or if not they could just write on the cake Brandon has a brother on the way. I don't think i would go to the trouble to change the theme at this late day. Any way it doesn't really matter, it about having fun and celebrating your son and your new baby. Good luck and have a great shower!!!

Relax, you're thinking way too much about this!  How about getting a huge sheet cake at BJs or Sam's and ask them to write "Brandon is the Number One Big Brother!" on it.  Just because it's not the exact picture you wanted, don't stress.



Or you could go get one of those figurines from Hallmark (Precious Moments) with a big brother and a little brother, and use that on or near the cake.

Mix it up and go for all of it.  People are there to see you, not for the cake or decorations.  I wouldn't worry about the theme.  Just have fun and stay within your budget.  Save that extra money and give you and your son a treat before the new baby arrives.



I'm sure your party will be great.  Have fun.

They are completely normal as your baby is most likely getting into position ready for labour. If your cramps or contractions are happening at regular intervals start timing them. You may be going into an early labour.
Not all pregnancies start with the water breaking spontaneously but keep your eye out for "the show" which is the brown/ reddish mucous in your underwear which indicates the begiinning of labour.



Remember to stay calm and try to rest as much as possible ( yes I know its hard when your in pain), if you are at all concerned all you need to do is ring your midwife or hospital representative.

Tylenol and massage and lots of water to drink.



A massage therapist suggested a cold pack on your neck while you soak your feet in warm/hot water.  This apparently pulls the blood from your head, the extra blood may be causing the headaches.



I had horrible headaches for weeks, all I could do was take the tylenol and lay down for as long as possible.

Sounds like tension headaches to me not migraines. I have had migraines before and it is a whole lot worse than you describe so something is causing you to much stress and tension. so find what is causing the problem and eliminate it. Get away from anyone who may be causing you such anxiety and stress and they will go away. If you can't seem to find the source then I found that going outside and taking an hour walk will get rid of the head ache and you won't have to take anything for it. It is hard to get up and go for a walk but when you try it and it does work you won't mind doing it. Believe me it helps circulate your blood and will ease the pain.

It sucks but the only med you can take is Tylenol! I got some severe migraines during the first part of my pregnancy and went to the ER. They could do nothing and just made sure baby and my vitals were ok. They gave me a med for nausea and sent me home both times! The one time I thought for sure I would die or explode the pain was so bad! The only thing i found to help was hot rag on my head then alternating with a cold rag on my head! I also secluded myself away from noise and and light! Eat small meals so you don't upset your stomach! Also make sure to get plenty of water! Sometimes headache and migraines are made worse if you are dehydrated! I've heard that Head On stuff is safe but ask your doctor to know for sure! Good luck and I can understand how painful it is!

Ice is great for you! Water is the best thing you can have plenty off! Try popcicles for a change of flavor! OR the frozen fruit bars. As for eating alot the farther you get the more your appetitie is supposed to increase!  Its just controlling how much junk you eat!  Eat lots of the good stuff fruits, & veggies and all that ice and your baby will grow like it should and you will gain baby weight not fat!

No The ice melts in your mouth and turns to water ... water is good. Now if it's gallons well you should know that anything taken in moderation is ok and enough is enough. But water is good and the ice won't make down there anyway it goes into you stomache not directly to the baby and by the time it goes to the stomache its already water, not ice... DUH!!

It is okay for your baby as long as you're not craving it because you're anemic. Craving ice can be a symptom of anemia, or an iron deficiency. I used to be anemic but haven't been since I've been pregnant and I always craved ice, which was one way I knew my iron was down. I've been craving ice lately so I mentioned it to my doctor, she checked my iron, and everything was fine. It can very well be a normal craving, but I would mention it to your doctor so s/he can make sure its not anemia. Best of luck to you!

Question about pregnancy?



My wife and I have been tryin to conceive for about 6 years now. We have just received positive blood work about 2 weeks ago. For about the past day or two she feels a twinging (pinching) in her uterus. This made her worried I tried to assure her that it was fine and the embryo is probably making itself comfortable. Obviously we are concerned but should this worry us?

Not at all unless it becomes really intense or she starts bleeding. She is probably experiencing the baby implanting itself or it may be the start of growing pains.Congrats to you guys and the best of luck for the next 9 months.

Weight Gain at 32 weeks pregnant.?



G'day. I am 32 weeks and 2 days pregnant today. I went to the midwife tonight only to find out I have only put on a total of 17lbs or 8 kilos. I am wondering if it's normal? This is my second baby. When I was pregnant with my first child, I went into labour at 35 weeks which is only 3 weeks difference and put on a total 48lbs or 22 kilos. My BMI was "average" before I was pregnant.



My mum is totally shitting herself saying I need to eat more and I am starving my baby. I know I am not, I just avoid greasy food as it makes me really sick the next day. I could live off blocks of chocolate and eat a decent meal every night of meat and vegies.

I've learned that gaining between 25-35 lbs is the optimal during pregnancy- but I know many who gained only 20lbs.  But since you still have 8 weeks to go- with the baby growing fast- I bet you will make it to at least 25!  Enjoy that your weight has not gotten to high- it's fine!  You sound healthy and so is the baby!!

You're fine.  As long as you are eating and truly taking care of yourself, your baby is getting everything he/she needs.  I have heard that some women put on significantly less with their second babies.  I know she's your mom, but don't listen to her...a lot of times they are still thinking about the doctor's orders when they were pregnant so many years ago and a lot of those theories have changed as we've progressed medically.  Congrats!

okay first you are not starving your baby the baby will pull all the nutrition they need from what you are eating and it is normal to not gain as much in second pregnancies my first I gained 40 lbs and this one I have only gained 12 lbs so far and I am at 28.3 weeks. don't worry as long as you are eating healthy and the midwife does not say anything your fine !

You sound right on target to me.  Even if you gain a pound a week now, you'll be at 25 lbs. at 40 weeks--they say 25-35 is just right if you're average weight before getting pregnant.

They are most accurate when you are late or have missed your period.  Anything before that could give a false negative because there isn't enough hcg in your system yet.

No food until after delivery?



Why do many hospitals have the rule that once you are checked in, you are not supposed to eat anything until after you deliver?  When I had my son, I was in the hospital by 7:00 on Monday morning, and I didn't have my son until 11:15 Tuesday.  If I hadn't been able to bully my husband into going to the Subway in the hospital to sneak me a 6" turkey with cheese & something to drink, the hospital would have let me starve to death.  The nurse kept trying to convince me that the IV in my arm was supplying my body with all of the nutrients it needed, but my stomach wasn't buying it.  They wouldn't even let me have anything to drink, just ice chips to keep my throat from being dry.  For a while I thought they were just sadist, but most of my friends' have told me that their hospitals had the same policy.  Does anyone know the reason for this?  My delivery whent just fine, despite the sandwich and many snacks I ate when the nurse wasn't looking.

Most hospitals have this policy for just in case situations. Unfortunately things can go wrong during labor and delivery. Not letting you eat is safer if they end up needing to do an emergency c-section.

Possibly to avoid pooping on the table?  I know that you usually can't avoid that, but supposedly your body tries to expel everything it can in preparation for labor before you go in (which is why so many women get diarrhea as a labor symptom)....maybe its so that you don't mess with nature's expulsion.



That sounds horrible though...I hate when I'm starving.  I can't imagine I would be very pleasant in all that pain AND hungry.

I was in labor 22 hours from when I woke up, so add another few hours of sleep to that and I wasn't allowed to eat for a whole day!  I was STARVING, but they wouldn't let me eat.  I know this is going to sound gross, but I think they want your system cleared because if you have food in your system it is more likely that you will poop on the table while pushing.  As soon as I popped my son out I asked for food and they brought me mac and cheese.  This time, I plan on eating before I go in - no matter how bad the contractions hurt!

its so if they need to take you in to surgery they can with out fear of you throwing up while in there. they do have very good reasons why, like the throwing up part can happen while your in labor or in surgery, plus i think it might also have something to do with bowel movement while in labor. im not totally sure i just know that they told me it could make me throwup.

If they have to do an emergency C-section, they need your stomach to be empty..



Another reason is basically because during pushing some women push their bowels and basically, they defecate, and having an empty stomach keeps this from continuing all through the labor.

when you are giving birth sometimes things don't go according to plan, meaning that even if you were intending on delivering vaginally, something could go wrong and you might end up needing a c-section.  this is why hospitals do not want you to eat...having something in your stomach increases your risk of vomitting during the c-section, which is very common.  vomitting could cause you to choke and could be dangerous, especially when you are flat on your back with a spinal and can't even move.  in rare cases you may have to be put under general anesthesia and the risk is even higher for vomitting to cause problems...therefore, hospitals do not want you to eat so they can have the best chance at keeping you healthy should you need a section.  hope this helps!

It's an old rule, based on the days when most women got general anesthesia during delivery.



Today, the logic goes something like this:  "You MIGHT need an emergency c-section (very unlikely) and you MIGHT need a general anesthestic (very rare -- most sections are done with an epidural) and you MIGHT vomit from the anesthesia (possible) and you MIGHT aspirate (virtually impossible with modern methods of aneshesia where you are intubated during surgery) and you MIGHT get pneumonia and die.



Many more enlightened hospitals are recognizing the absurdity of the rule (starving women during labor just makes it MORE likely that they will need that emergency c-section) .. and are permitting food/drink as desired.  If you DO need a c-section and a general, the staff will cope with it -- just as they do with the millions of people every year who need emergency surgery, having eaten in the past few hours.



(Some people think the rule is because many women vomit in labor anyway -- but eating doesn't make vomiting more likely -- you can vomit even if you've eaten nothing. And dry heaves are usually more unpleasant than vomiting up food. And neither does it have anything to do with having a bowel movement.  THe waste products passed during pushing are from food eaten long before labor even began.)

If you would have to have an emergency C-section, they might have to give you general anesthesia.  When you go under, you need to have an empty stomach because some people get sick and can actually aspirate the vomit.



When I was in the hospital being induced, things were moving very slowly, so they did let me have a lunch tray.  I threw it up later - yuck.



Wondering... why were you in the hospital so long?  I thought for normal deliveries they wouldn't admit you until you were at least 4 cm, or your water broke?

I think this is a silly rule too! With my first baby 11 years ago they told you not to eat when your labour started and I was totally knackered by the time it came to actually delivering my daughter.......Now with my third ,where I live they encourage you to eat in early labour to keep your strenght up.....Obviously when you are in the throes of hard labour you are not going to feel like having a three course meal so I say if you are hungry then you should be allowed to snack! After all it gives you the energy to keep going! I know that they have this rule just in case you end up needing a general aneasthetic but most people don't need this.x

Technically, you can do whatever you feel like doing while you're in labor.  Even if the hospital strongly suggests that you do not eat, you are hiring THEM to assist you in the delivery of your child and you are allowed to do what makes you comfortable.



The only time you really have to avoid eating during labor is if you get an epidural.



Also, if you do eat while you are in labor, you should eat things that can be easily digested.  Avoid proteins and fatty foods.  The best things to eat are toast (with jelly, not butter),  cereal, fruit, etc.



Until the 1940's, women were actually told to eat and drink as they desired during labor. All of that changed in 1949 just because 1 study showed that women who ate during labor had a higher chance of food entering the lungs during anesthesia. Since then, women have often been told that as soon as they feel contractions or think they are in labor, they should stop eating.



There are several reasons why this study, done nearly 60 years ago, should no longer apply to women in labor today:
The original study was based on very high amounts of anesthesia, which are no longer used on women during cesarean births.



Fasting during labor does not guarantee an empty stomach.



The risk of aspiration only occurs with general anesthesia, which is used very rarely for cesareans.



Prolonged fasting increases the amount of hydrochloric acid in your stomach which can increase the complications with aspiration.



It is not good to base recommendations for practice on one study, especially given that this particular study is extremely outdated.



Arguments made for eating during labor include:
Eating small amounts of easily-digested foods during labor can give you the energy you need to keep going.



A 1989 National Birth Center study showed that 11,814 women who ate and drank at will during labor did not have a single case of aspiration, even among the 22% of women in the total group who required a cesarean.



Sometimes the knowledge that you can't eat during your labor can affect your sense of control. That alone might make you feel like giving up sooner.
Often midwives and doulas report that if a mother's labor is not progressing, often eating and drinking during labor helps to get things moving.

I think you should definitely go with a light orange(tangerine dream and aurua orange both looked nice) something soft and not bold.  I think pink on the walls would be way too much pink.  Orange would compliment the boarder and bedding set very nice.  I want to see pictures when you are all done. Congratulations on your little one!!!

I would avoid anymore pink. That bedspread is already very pink. I would paint the walls a light yellow. I think orange would get to be blinding. I love white furniture, but only paint the built in dresser white if you are painting the crib white. All wood furniture or all white furniture, you can't do a mixture of both.

I would say a pale yellow.  There is already too much pink on the bedding to paint the walls that color too.  You could always leave the dresser the darker color because it will probably compliment the crib.  If you do decide to paint the dresser, I would paint it white.  Good luck and congratulations on your baby girl.

So cute! I think you should go with something other than pink since the bedding is so pink already. I wouldn't go with orange on the walls at all, since it won't really go with the pink. Maybe pale yellow or pale green on the walls? Pale yellow would go with a pale pink border I think.



For the dark wood dresser I think it would be nice white, the same as the trim. If you go with too many colours it will be too much I think.



Congratulations on your soon-to-be baby girl! Good luck :)

How painful is the labor?



Ok...before I got pregnant. During my period, I've experienced really painful cramps...sometime beyond painful...that the doctor gave me morphine's. Nothing else helped. So each month I almost took morphine's for my period cramps.



If the labor is more painful then my unbearable "period" cramps...I am aiming for C-section..b/c during my period cramps I've fainted, thrown up, couldn't walk, wanting to die there...etc. I am very unfortunate to have these really painful cramps.



comparing to my period cramps...will my labor be like that? or even worse? if worse...I'm going for C-section...I'll talk to my doctor about it.



any info?? experience??

Way worse unfortunately - but you can get an epidural and they will be fine.  I don't know about your case and your dr, but normally you cannot request a c-section.

No one is going to tell you labor feels good.  It hurts, but you can have an epidural to help with the pain of contractions.  Most doctors will not let you pick between a vaginal delivery and a C-section.  Plus, the recovery pain from a C-section is probably going to be much more than what you experience from your period cramps.

1st, they will not do a c-section for any reason except saftey of the baby and you.  Vomtiting and fainting due to the pain doesn't count sorry to say:(  There are pain meds. and epidural if you can't handle the pain that badly.  Yes, it will be worse than your cramping.  I have really bad period cramps too, pain so bad it also made me vomit, but labor was worse, again, sorry to say.
Best of luck.

Don't start making such decisions.  Labour is a fascinating step towards your new child and is not as shown on TV films etc with screeching females.  The midwives are there to comfort and support you and epidural injections are available , but it is a wonderful experience and the moment your child is born is indescribable and a never forgotten time.  Millions upon millions have done it so go ahead and enjoy your pregnancy and in due course the delivery of your precious child.

If you can avoid a C-section you should! You have many options during labor...spinal block or Epidural! They WORK wonderfully and could not feel anything!



If you have either one of those you will not feel pain! Talk to your doctor

My labor lasted 21 hours and let me first say that I am such a baby when it comes to pain!....however, I did the whole labor thing without any painkillers or medication...and if I can do it, anyone can! Early labor, when the contractions were just starting were like menstrual cramps, manageable.  Eventually the contractions get so bad you can't talk through them.  Although once I started pushing (30 min), I thought I'd rather live with the contractions forever the pain was so bad. Just think about how far you have to stretch to get a baby out, and that's how much it hurts.



Every labor is different though, I know some women who were in labor 6 hours and never felt anything more than a twinge! You could get lucky! I was up and walking right after I delivered my daughter though, and with the epidural it will take a little longer before they will let you move around.

Honestly, it will be worse than your cramps lol. It is the most excruciating thing in the world. It's enough to make you scream in a voice you never even knew you had. It was enough to make me want to kill myself at the time. But I got through it and so do thousands of other women. Afterwards I thought I'd never want to do it again, but now I'd love to, and knowing what it felt like and knowing what a very low pain threshold I have, I would still choose to deliver vaginally. It was the best experience of my life and I have such fond memories of it. Towards the end of my labour I was told I was going to need an emercency C-Section due to a complication if he hadn't arrived in an hour, but fortunately he made a last minute appearance. I can't explain how upset I was at the thought of having to miss the natural delivery of my son. I had the epidural by the way at the end of it, I'd had a very long labour and experienced a great deal of pain so after 85 hours I had the epidural and it killed the pain almost completely, I still felt everything but it was very good for the pain. You have that on offer to you, plus your other milder drugs. I fail to see why someone would want to miss the miracle of delivering their own baby for reasons other than medical reasons. It will also put you at risk of having an uncomfortable and painful recovery - honestly I had stitches and that was bad enough to deal with at the beginning of parenthood when you want to be up and mobile, so a caesarian scar would be ten times worse. Yes it is excruciatingly painful but honestly, it is the best experience you'll ever have. Nothing makes you any different to any other women - believe me I have the lowest pain threshold in the world, I'm virtually in tears over a papercut lol, and as I say if there's a next time for me I'll be making every effort to have another vaginal delivery. Billions of women have survived the pain, so nothing singles you out as being a special case. The fact that you've gone through pain makes the birth even more special as you have really earnt and deserved it, and you know that you've gone through it for your child and that's the most special feeling ever. To book a c-section because you're simply not willing to go through the same pain that billions of women have before you just seems like a bit of a cheat to me. Good luck.

Nobody can say how painful labor will be, and nobody knows what YOUR pain tolerance is.



I would NOT plan a c-section for fear of labor pain.  The post-op pain  after major surgery will be longer than any labor pain.  If the pain of labor is more than you can cope with, there are meds that can help.

Well constipation is one of the many common issues with pregnancy, so don't be embarrassed.. we all go through it. Over a week sounds a little excessive, so I would maybe go get a stool softener from your local drug store. Also eat foods that will go smoothly through like fruits and veggies (preferably salads). I would definitely buy some medicine to assist you seeing as its been over a week. And remember, dont strain yourself or push too hard because then you'll possibly get hemmerhoids. Good luck!

I do not want to recommend anything because I am unsure what would be safe.I would check with your Obgyn, they would be able to recommend something that will help get things moving AND be safe for you and your precious little baby. My Obgyn prescribed (prescription not OTC)  a prenantal vitamin that had a stool softener in it...it was called Prima Care. Try not to be too embarraassed about it...trust me throughout the next 9 months...things will probably get more embarrassing...BUT it is all worth it.

I've had this off and on in my pregnancy.  I have found that lots of ice cold water, hot water with lemon, and a raisin/walnut "snack mix" have helped.  I might try the stool softner as well, although I haven't.



It is SO painful, especially toward the end when eveything is cramped in there, so you definitely want to nip this in the bud if you can.  It is really common, so don't be embarrassed to discuss with your doctor!

I get the same way on prenatal vitamins. There's soo much iron in them they can bind you pretty good. I use store brand stool softeners once a day with the vitamins and that helps

Hey,



Eat lots of fibre like weetibix or fruit.
Apples and oranges and bananas are also good.



Go see a doctor and they might be able to give you something.

I had the same problem when I was pregnant.
-Some stool softeners you can take during pregnancy. Just make sure to ask your doctors which ones.



-Prune Juice.... it works trust me.
-Enema.... They're somewhat uncomfortable, but it's worth it.

I always THOUGHT I was constipated. I wasn't. I simply wasn't eating enough to have to go daily. I was lucky to go every 3 days. I was so nauseous and so sick that I barely ate 500 calories a day. Not by my choice though..ugh. It was brutal. Once I started feeling better and was able to eat, I used Metamucil and ate a high fiber diet. With this pregnancy I barely had any constipation. It was a totally different experience. YAY!



Make sure you eat well and stay hydrated. It should taper off in the next few weeks and you should be able to "go" more often. If it makes you really uncomfortable talk to your doctor/midwife. You may need stool softeners to get you going again.



Good Luck! =)

How long do you have to be working to get maternity leave?



I was just wondering how long you have to be working with an employer to apply for maternity leave in Canada.
As well as if you are working for an employer at home does that count or does that make you self employed and then you would not be able to apply
Thanks in advance

Its funny you should ask. I work with a traveler nurse from Montreal and he said that you are paid from the start of your pregnancy. Check into it because he says that canadians consider pregnancy to be a "disorder", if you would, where a mother should not be straining herself with work. Call your HR reps and ask them. Hope  this helps.

To qualify for maternity benefits you need to have worked 600 hours, doesnt matter how long you work as long as you have that number of hours. At 40 hours a week its only like 15 weeks.



As long as your paying into EI Insurance on your paycheck, you qualify for it, wheter you work in an office or at home for your employer... If you're EI exempt (no premiums coming off your paycheck for EI) then you won't be able to apply.

If you tested 40 days after and the test was negative then you are probably not pregnant.  Unless you ovulated late, and then you would just have to wait another week and test again.

If you normally have longer cycles, or you ovulate later towards the end of your cycle you may have just conceived and there is not enough hcg in your system yet.  Wait a couple days and test with first morning urine.  If you get a negative and still no period, call your dr.

Can an antibiotic lower the effective rate of birth control pills?



I have been taking YAZ since May of this year and the antibiotic Terbafine since June of this year. I read recently that antibiotics can cause birth control pills not to work properly. I recently had unprotected sex and am now worried that I may be pregnant. The birth control in my opinion is working great...I have lighter periods less cramps, little to no nausea, and my periods are shorter.I have had sore nipples for the best few days and headaches, however, I often suffer from headaches. Any help would be greatly appreciated THANKS!!

Yes I think it does. It should say in the booklet something about that. Ask your GP to be sure, and use extra protection whilst you're on the antibiotics. But if you truly believe you are pregnant, STOP taking the pill and the terbafine, (I think i've been prescribed that before, vaguely remember being told if I was worried I was pregnant to stop using it.. I was 15 at the time lol!) and consult your doctor for a test to prove or disprove this. Good luck!

For anyone who has had a scheduled induction?



I will be induced at 37 weeks (due to being high risk), and I have a couple of questions. First, they want to give me an amnio to make sure that my baby's lungs will be fully developed. I think during week 37. How long will it take me to get those results back? Don't they have to bring the fluid to a lab? Or can they give me the results then and there?  And when they say being induced at 37 weeks, do they mean once you hit 37 weeks or at the end of 37 weeks (37 weeks and 7 days)? I am currently 31 weeks with a baby girl on the way! Thanks to all!

With the third i was SUPER excited we waited 3 years after our second, and i milked and loved every minute of it.

This is my fourth pregnancy. I am almost 15 weeks myself. I feel this way sometimes too. The other day, my 13 yr old son and his friend were kicking the football to see who could kick it farther. I grabbed the football, told them both they were a couple of girls..lol..and got ready to kick it. Then I was like "oh crap, I'm pregnant, I better not do that" LOL!  You can't feel the baby moving, you're morning sickness is probably almost gone completely. You aren't really showing yet. It is hard to seem pregnant this early. It will seem more real when you can start feeling the baby moving. Best wishes!!

At 34 1/2 weeks, it is harder to forget that I'm pregnant, but I agree that the level of excitement isn't quite the same as it was for the first one when every experience was something new.  I'm very excited about having another baby, and seeing how my son (now 2) reacts to the new one in the house, but pregnancy itself is definitely less exciting this time around.

Did you get a period in between the miscarriage and the positive pregnancy test?  If so you count from the first day of your last period.  If not, I guess I would count from the day you got a positive - maybe go back three weeks from that for a rough estimate?  So maybe about 7 weeks?



Your dr will probably do an early ultrasound for you to determine how far you are since you really have no way of knowing.  I would call and make an appointment right away due to your circumstances.  Sorry to hear about last time, I hope everything works out for you!  Good luck!

I had the same problem with all three pregnancies, its just the extra weight gain on your hips now, your hips arnt used to the extra pressure. Try sleeping with one pillow slightly tucked under your belly, and one pillow in between your legs, so your body is level but slightly tilted back, and you may need a pillow behind your back. Welcome to pregnancy!! Sleeping sucks!! And it only gets worse. Pillows will be your best friend for the next 16 weeks.

Your body releases a hormone called relaxin wich is known to relax your joints. When I was pregnant my hips hurt badly for three weeks and then became very lose. They would slip/dislocate during everyday activities.
Each women is different but it is normal to have this hip pain before your joints become lose!



Good luck

I had this problem very bad!  Your hips are widening...it should subside a little down the road!!  I would put a warm (but not hot) hot pad just on my hip area while laying on my side.  The heat isn't making it's way to the baby...and it really helped the pain!!

I have this too, mostly on my left side because I am sure that I am favoring it more.  I think it is a combination of the pressure from laying on them so much as well as your ligaments stretching.



I have found that stretching before bed helped a bit and my neighbor swears that taking a bath at night before bed helps her.  Also, I have been pulling my legs up higher around my body pillows (more of a fetal position) which helps balance out the pressure a little.



I am 31 weeks today and my belly is definitely expanding and noticeably weighing a lot more, so that is a new pain I'm dealing with and trying to figure out.  The body pillow seems to be my only saving grace for such things.  Good luck!

They hurt for a few reasons. They have to take alot of pressure not only from sleeping on your side throughout the night but also because of the growing uterus. The hips have a hormone called relaxin released into them once you become pregnant. This makes them more flexible and able to support the growing baby and uterus. Also everytime you walk your hips have to support even more. Thats alot of pressure for your hips and that is why they hurt. Don't worry though, they will feel better once you have the baby. It is a good reason for sore hips. I remember waking up one morning and feeling like my hips were going to dislocate from my spine. It was a weird and painful feeling. lol =P Good luck hun!

This might be a shot in the dark, but are you having urinary trouble?  I'm aware that you're pregnant and other posters have very good points as well, but if you have some form of a UTI, it might be your ureters acting up.  Mine are currently doing it.  Try drinking some cranberry juice and see if the pain alleviates at all.  Can't hurt to try.  Good Luck :)

Your pelvis may be softening already. I know mine is. I sleep with a ton of pillows. A Snoogle pillow on the front of me and a regular pillow behind my back. I also do yoga to keep things in alignment. Ask your doc is that is something you can do. I have found it makes a HUGE difference and that the effects of yoga last for a few days. I am 25 weeks and have been feeling that pain for a few weeks now. I have to walk slowly and not step over things. I sit to put my clothes and I don't push my older kids stuff with my feet anymore..LOL



The pillows help a ton! I hope you get some relief soon. =)

Your baby is safe, period, unless you're being too rough. Just stop using positions that become uncomfortable and you'll be fine.

I don't think that any position will hurt the baby.  The missionary position is usually the first position to become uncomfortable for you.  I always found the spoon position (on your side with your husband behind you) to be the most comfortable position in late pregnancy.

There is nothing that you have to worry about. You can pretty much have sex anyway you want without worrying about hurting the baby. The only thing that you will have problems with, is you being comfortable. As you progress in your pregnancy, some positions will be very uncomfortable. I know for me, waay into my pregnancy, if my husband and I did it missionary...I felt like I was being strangled! I couldn't get air because of all the pressure of the baby on my stomach. So we comprimised. You just have to work with what is comfortable for you. Have fun!!

I recommend on your back and behind. Those are the easiest. Only when you do the back postion, prop yourself up some with two of three pillows. Don't get rough either. Baby actually thinks you are rocking him to sleep because your uterus contracts during sex and this relaxes the baby. =)

36 weeks pregnant and feeling down what should I do?



I know that after awhile things are supposed to go away but, I am 36 weeks pregnant and completely annoyed with my husband and not only am I annoyed I am afraid that the feelings that I am feeling will not go away. I am mad at him for not giving me any of his time when I need him to. He don't want me to talk to him about anything that's bothering me and I am mad even more at the fact that he still can't seem to tell  me the truth about going to the movies with his ex-girlfriends little brother and sister and didn't wait for me when I told him I was coming to the house and that I had something to say to him. How do you speak to someone who makes assumptions about everything you are going to say when you not. How do a person stay in a relationship where the person only thinks of themselves to be important and don't include their spouses feelings? Now I am thinking of all the things he has done to me that I truly don't deserve and I don't think its fair he doesn't apologize for anything that he say or do and it bothers the hell out of me that he went to the movies and took other people when it was supposed to be me and him going together and then has the nerves to lie when I was already told by their parents that they went and only let them go cause he told them he was meeting me at my grandma's house when it was not true. I don't want to talk to him about my feelings but he don't want to hear anything that I have to say how can a man not want to be there for his wife and not want to listen to the things that I have to say and work together I have done so many things for him including about to give birth to his child and everything I ask him to do for me all I seem to get is excuses to why he can't do it? Do I stay in this marriage or should I think about moving on without him because I really believe in my heart that he wants his old life back and don't know how to tell me?

well it seems you might be in a bit of a bother.. I wouldnt accept my husband lying to me.. Maybe you are a little more sensetive and emotional right now than you would be if you werent pregnant.  Maybe he didnty want to upset you and theres no more to it but if you think he wants his old life back, just try to communicate with him.  Could you try having a two week break so you can see if you can cope without each other- maybe that might answer your question.. Whatever you decide dont stay together just for the baby, if staying there is only gonna make you bitter and twisted then it would be best for your baby if you moved on at least that way you might remain friendly.. Remember you may be looking more into it and hormones are really strong things.. Take care and good luck.

Sounds like you are as bad as him!  Maybe he doesn't want to talk about it any of it so he doesn't stress you out.  Men see things differently try seeing htings from his point of view.  Maybe he is jealous of the attention you and the baby get and feels left out. Maybe he went to the movies with the others to relax because they won't judge him and doesn't want to stress out more.  He maybe nervous about the baby and the change coming into his life and being around the other kids make him more comfortable and he is practicing being a dad!  Mabye your just emotional and feel stuck at home because of the pregnancy and jealous because he goes out.  Maybe he is just a jerk! But don't ruin your marriage until you are thinking more clearly.  Give him a little break its hard on him too.  Compromise with him, ask him to spend this day with you and in exchange he can have a free day from his stress too!  Try anything before assuming the worse, that is just going to stress you out more and that can effect your baby and your too close to be stressing out now.  Enjoy the last of your pregnancy the baby will be coming soon and you will be a family!!!

25 weeks pregnant.....steriod shots for baby's lungs?



My friend is in the hospital right now. She is 25 weeks pregnant with a little girl. She had  stillbirth last year at 22 weeks. We are really worried about her and the baby. Her face has been swelling and she has high blood pressure problems. They admitted her into the hospital with high blood pressure. They just now got her blood pressure down with three different types medicines including IV fluids. Now her perinatologist has order steroid shots and her nurse informed her that he expects her to deliver in the next few weeks. THEN, her OB asked her nurse what her urine levels were and she said there was 2+ protein so they are making her do  24 hour urine to see if her protein is getting higher because if they are were then the nurse said that would mean her blood was getting toxic and they would have to deliver her baby as soon as possible. She has a history of toxemia with previous pregnancies with her sons. Please if you have any medical experience or have had any similar problems,I need advice. Also any premature stories that you have experienced would be great. Thanks so much for your time.

I haven't experienced it, but I've read that babies born at 25 weeks can survive if the hospital has the right Neonatal Unit. The steroid shots will build the babies lungs, so they'll be more developed when baby is born, which will give the baby a better chance at survival.

Hopefully they gave you antibiotics right after your D + C to take.  I had to have one and I got sent home with some.  Fever, swelling in the abdomen...pain.  Seems like the cramping should be at least subsided by now.  If you already took antibiotics, haven't had intercourse and haven't had any signs of infection for a whole four weeks, you should be OK...things should be fairly healed.  Not having a period yet is not strange.  I got mine at 6 weeks.  And it's not even regualr still!!

37 weeks, extreme back pain = NO sleep?



My back has been hurting my entire pregnancy, but last night it was so bad that I thought I wouldn't be able to get up.  I was up all night and didn't get any sleep because I was flipping back and forth the whole time.  It was also sort of like a throbbing pain to where I thought it might be back labor, but it eventually went away.  And now this morning my stomach is incredibly sore all over and I am not sure if that is just from flipping so much or if it is something else.  Not sure what to think, what about you?

its definitely something you need to speak to your doctor about. if the back pain is as severe as you say-it could be something more serious than back pain alone. and now you have stomach cramping-it might be dangerour for your baby. and even if its nothing serious-youll have the clarity to know its not life threatening to you unborn child. besides, you should be getting your sleep!! maybe there is something they can do to help you. good luck :-)

Back pain could be due to the weight gain and extra pressure on the spine, i would have it one day then not the next etc.. If your not in labor then you might of also just ate something bad, so your stomach hurts, and what you thought was back pain could of been gas pains. You have to remember all your organs are moved around in there now. But you very well could be in early labor, which can last between a few hours to a few weeks or so. I was in early labor for 38 days! contracting all the time,everyday, in pain, etc.. on my third baby, but she is now a healthy two month old baby girl :) but CONGRATS! also call your doc. they can have you come in and just monitor you and make sure you are not contracting.

Its preparing for labor, a hard cervix can only dilate so far, your cervix has to be soft or "ripe" for progress to be made!  Still could be another 2 weeks though before the big day!

I had a hard time with this one too!  I told only close family until I was around 11 or 12 weeks.  If you do lose the baby at least you have some people to comfort you.  Good Luck!

I always told everyone immediately with my first three and never understood how anyone could hold in such a great secret.  And then I had a miscarriage in July of this year and I got it.  When we're pregnant again, we won't tell until after the first appointment and we see a little heartbeat on our baby at the ultrasound.  At least that way I don't have to go back and "untell" everyone.  So many people don't know what to say after a miscarriage.  It makes them uncomfortable.  It makes you uncomfortable when they say the wrong thing.  I'd rather just wait and be sure.



You should do what feels right to you though.  Good luck with your decision and congrats on the newest baby!

I told my parents and sisters at about 5 weeks - right when we found out.  I did not want to tell anyone else until I had reached 12 weeks.  My family was just too excited, and had told everyone by about seven weeks.  I started having a lot of problems early on, and was put on bed rest for two months beginning at seven weeks - which came as a surprise to me because I am so healthy.  I really regretted telling my family so early, because they did not respect the fact that this was our secret to share.  They thought that they had every right to tell everyone, despite the fact that we were so clear that it was very important to us to keep it a secret.  My mom had even told my hair dresser - I was lying in bed thinking, if I do miscarry, is the whole world going to know about it?  I love my family dearly, and know that it was not their intention to make us feel this way.  However, my husband and I have decided that NO ONE will be finding out until 12 weeks with our next one.  It is just too big of a secret to keep.  The last thing you want after a miscarriage is everyone and their dog asking how the pregnancy is going...

I will be 2 years from getting my LPN degree. I took all theprecautionss to prevent this from happening (I was on birth control and my boyfriend used condoms) But my doctor didn't inform me that antibiotics nullify the offects of birthcontroll. I am 16 and my boyfriend of a year and a half will be 18 in october.

I don't think anyone should judge you...I commend you for taking on this incredible responsibility!  I would go to Target.com or Babiesrus.com and they have checklists for items to either register for or buy.  Take them with a grain of salt though because there is alot of stuff you do not need, like a bassinet!  Make sure you have enough of the essentials like onesies, blankets, diapers, and don't forget you need an infant car seat.  They won't let you leave the hospital without one.  Good Luck to you!

I don't think you are dumb for keeping your baby.  I think you made the right decision to step up and take responsibility!



There are a lot of things you can do without, especially if you are short on cash.



Things that you must have:



*Crib
*Car seat
*Clothing
*Bottles
*Diapers (and lots of them)
*Changing supplies such as wipes and ointment
*Blankets



Things you can do without
*Changing Table
-you can just as easily change the baby on your bed or the floor.  Just put a blanket or towel down and make sure you always keep a hand on the baby so prevent him or her from falling.
*Stroller
-unless you plan on taking the baby out, you could do without this.  You don't need a super fancy one either.  I think you can find a simple one for under $50.
*Tons of elaborate outfits.
-most of them will end up ruined anyways.



That is all I can think of for now.



Good luck and Congrats!

Go to www.babiesrus.com and go to their baby registry link. It is in the upper right hand corner. If you register, then they will give you a list of everything you need and you can print it out. You will need things like a carseat, crib, blankets, bottles, pacifiers, clothes, bibs, burpclothes, receiving blankets, crib sheets, diapers, etc. There is alot more but those are a few of the basics. Good luck2

You need everything.  but tell me something, what does you being young have to do with wanting to know what to buy?  I hate when people throw that in to the conversation when it makes no valid point as part of the question.  Any first time mother wants to know what they need!  I did!  I still do not know what I am missing!  Sorry for the rampage, I am about to give birth any second and I am hormonal, but asking people not to comment about your age is ridiculous.  You do not have to tell anyone that you are young.  It doesnt change the question.  Good luck!

First of all NOBODY is dumb to keep their baby....killing your own child before it is born isn't a good choice for anybody.  Adoption may be an option, but it's not good to abort innocent children.



Kids require a lot of gear...not as much as they want to sell you, but a lot.



1st you will need someone to sit with baby while you are out working...this is most important.



Brest feeding is better for the kids, and cheaper, but a bit harder on you...it pays huge benefits in the end though for the kids in terms of brain development and keeping their immune system up...which means they get sick less and have fewer doctor visits.



You will need clothes for the youngin, go with disposable diapers, a good diaper pail or a diaper genie is a wonder..it keeps the poopy diaper smell from stinking up the whole house. You will need a crib for baby to sleep in, and a high chair to feed baby in, and some toys. Couple of stuffed animals...some teething rings, and you need special laundry detergant to wash baby clothes in (all the crud they put in the regular detergants can give baby rashes).  You need diaper ointment, teething medicine, and a plastic bulb thingy to suck the snot out of their nose...(babies can't blow their nose on their own at first). I'm sure there are other things you will need too, but I cant think of them now

7 weeks 3 days pregnant with horrible morning sickness...?



So, I've had "morning sickness" all day every day since last Sunday (9/21).  My doctor prescribed Zofran but it's not helping at all.  I haven't been able to keep anything down except crackers and pretzels... and water.  I feel horrible like I'm not feeding my baby... but I literally can't keep anything down.  I've tried everything- mints, lemon, zofran, crackers, ginger ale... Pepsi is kind of relieving the nausea but only for a short time and I'm only drinking a little bit of it since I heard I'm supposed to avoid caffeine.  My question is:  How harmful is this to my baby and do you have any other suggestions of what I can try?  Any advice would be appreciated!

I was sick daily for the first 6 months with my first child, and nauseous the whole time with my second.  I survived on a diet of lucozade and mini mars bars.  Only eat what you fancy.  My doc prescribed me anti sickness which helped sometimes.  You can get anti sickness wrist bands too.  On the plus side, it means the pregnancy is well sustained.  Good luck, I don't envy you.. just don't look at your toothbrush, it'll have you gagging for the rest of the day! x

A little pepsi won't hurt you or your baby, but drink lots of water. Your baby will take everything he/she needs from you and will be fine. All you can really do is put up with this miserable state until it stops. It generally lasts about 3 months, I'm sorry to say. Most of us just live on crackers, pretzels and water!

(even though i hate it) i actually was losing weight and thought that something was going to be wrong with my baby. the doctor occasionally would admit to hospital and put me on a drip just to get the extra iron and nutrients i needed. if your really concerned speak to your doctor again. my little one was only 4 pound but she is one now and you would never have known she was that tiny.

I know of people who have. I am a doula.
And it was a good thing for two of them. They had scar tissue and it was removed. They later had better periods and less pain wearing jeans. (Scar tissue can cause a few issues.)



You may have less time healing. Because the fourth child comes a little earlier. ( not always) And the baby is smaller and makes for a easier and faster time in the Surgery.



Thinking about it is ok. But please if it is keeping you up at night talk to your doctor. Anxiety is normal but do not let it wear your body down.
Congrats on the 4th little one.

I have two boys, and did find out the gender via ultrasound for both -- it would drive me crazy not knowing!



I was lucky with regards to symptoms - I had morning sickness briefly with my second pregnancy, but none at all with my first. I craved salty foods with both pregnancies, and carried both babies high and in front. All of my weight gain went to my tummy, so everyone "knew" I was having a boy each time. :)

I had a gut instinct that I was having a boy pretty early on in the pregnancy.  I craved what I would call man foods (hot dogs, red meat, and beer).  When I went for my ultrasound I wasn't the least bit shocked when the technician told me it was a boy.  He is now two months old and the most precious little boy I have ever seen.  Also, I didn't have any morning sickness.  I was just really tired all the time.  I carried him all around.  It looked like I had a watermelon turned long ways across my stomach.

With my son I had horrible morning sickness, tired all the time, couldn't stand certain things... all along I had a feeling it was going to be a boy. With this pregnancy I had no morning sickness, no fatigue, I can eat everything lol, I didn't even know I was preggo til like 7 weeks. I guess I knew this would be a girl too, and I was right!

Well when I was pregnant w/ my 3 yr. old I really didn't have any symptoms. No morning sickness no feeling dizzy no cravings. Nothing! I had a lot of like energy though. I would get up like @ 6am which was early for me I would get up @ 9 before! I would like helping a lot around the house! So if you would call energized a symptom, the that's the only one I got like around the third month. Hope it helped at least a little bit!lol



As of telling the gender... well I just had the feeling it was gonna be a little boy. Then one time at a store when I was like 5 mths and still hadn't had my ultrasound this man who was like a "card reader"  (which I really don't believe in) touched my stomach and said it was gonna be a boy. But like I said I really don't believe in that stuff but thought I'd let you know!

With my first.  I thought for sure I was having a boy.  I had an acute sense of smell and horrible violent vomiting.  It didn't go away after the first trimester either like it was supposed to.  I had to go on medication for it because I couldn't keep food down.  At the twenty week ultrasound I found out we were having a girl.



My second pregnancy I had no symptoms whatsoever.  I miscarried at 13 weeks.



My third pregnancy started out just the same as the first.  Horrible nausea.  But the difference was that I actually felt better once I ate something.  And it went away after the first trimester.  We didn't find out the gender until the birth this time.  I had another girl.

This pregnancy I had some nausea (not throwing up though), lots of cramps, waaaaaay moody, and not very hungry at all. Very very tired. Although I have heard when you are expecting a girl, you are more likely to have throwing up morning sickness, I was stoked to hear Im having a girl.

Cramping accompanied with spotting is a sign of a miscarriage.  With my last pregnancy I had cramping in the beginning, probably up until my 13 or 14th week, and my doctor told me that it was my uterus stretching.  YOu might want to call your doctor or midwife just to make sure everything is okay.

Probably just your muscles starting to stretch to allow room for the growing baby, so long as there is no bleeding and severe pain I would think it's okay.  But maybe just to be on the safe side you should call your midwife to make an appointment and they can listen for the heartbeat etc - that's what they are there for.

if the pains are period like pains you should get checked out. (although at this early stage docs cant do anything.) it is still possible that it is just your body adjusting to pregnancy as its early days. Hope all goes well. Good luck.....

Even at 4 weeks pregnant the ultrasound would show that your uterus is "thicker", and obviously pregnant.



Maybe you just have the flu...but def. by 6 weeks there would be a fetal pole and heartbeat noticed via u/s.

I would of thought the ultrasound would of shown something up if you was pregnant.  You say your last pregnancy didn't show up until 5 months - was that also on ultrasound or just with the pregnancy test? - the pregnancy test I can understand but not the ultrasound!

The doctor always said it was something the body was lacking. Usually cause that nutrient had been spent on the baby and its needs. He said the body knew what it needed and related the need to the brain hence the craving. So eat up and enjoy it with relish knowing your fullfilling your bodys needs =)

Coed Baby Shower at Sports Bar?



We are having a coed baby shower in about 2 months. We are having the shower at a tasteful sports bar on the day of the Sabres (Home)/ New York Hockey Game. Anyone have any ideas on what favors to give, what to make the occasion more special or unique?? I just want this to be as special for everyone else as it will be for us. We have about 50 people coming to the event. Any great ideas will help. Also we want to still be able to give away prizes without having to play traditional games that require alot of setup. We do have two games lined up "Feed your spouse baby food the fastest and Daddy Baby Bottle Chug, where dads chug the preeemie bottles the fastest! Thank you to all you guys!

Also for the games maybe you could play something with mini goals and trying to get the puck into them. If you are wanting to do something different. You could also have pucks in a bucket of water with a number on the bottom of one and have them do puck diving....lol. Just a thought!! Conrats again.

Do the dirty diaper game :) It's where you take different kind of candy bars and put them in a diaper and microwave til they are melted. Once they cool again you let the guests guess what kind of candy is in each diaper. They can smell, touch, and if you let them, taste. I always though that was a funny game.
I love your idea for a shower, that's definately unique.

UTI and Pregnant (sorry tmi!)...?



I have just noticed that I went to the bathroom ten minutes ago. I used the restroom and there was no pain. When I came back to my desk, I felt the urge to go again. So I went and very little came out. It was still clear and there was no pain. I had a UTI before in May and I was in constant pain and there was blood in my urine. I had the symptoms for one day and saw my doctor immediately. I am in my third month of pregnancy now and normally I don't have to pee a lot. I was just wondering what are some things I can do to help slow the process down until tomorrow when I have my doctor's appointment. I already overloaded on water. Its there anything else I can take?

Unfortunatly not much will help with the UTI except for the medication the doc gives you. You can drink cranberry juice to limit the bacteria in your bladder though. UTIs are more likely to pop up again in pregnancy again after youve already had one. If you keep getting them, your doc might reccomend you keep taking the medication until delivery. Until then, its just a pain in the butt!!

Opinions needed ...??? Am I pregnant? ?



I have not had my period for 2 months which has happened to me before in fact it used to be normal. Today should be the start of my 3rd Period.However I have had no PMS. I think I had what was spotting last week well about ten days ago... I did a pregnancy test it had two dots on the 2nd line.I did a 2nd test it was negative as was the 3rd but today I did it again this am and there was a very faint 2nd line. I thought i was seeing things then i showed my husband and he saw it straight away.I have been feeling a little tired, bloated and have had a little cramping. Do you think I'm pregnant? If so do you think it happened this last month??

If you had a faint line... congrats... your pregnant.  I couldn't tell you when you conceived though.  The doctors go by the first day of your last period to determine your due date... but when you go for your ultrasound they can give you a better estimate as to when the baby is due by measuring the baby.

on my last pregnancy with my daughter the line was very very faint almost not there. so there is a good possiblity you are but to know for sure go to your OB/GYN and get him/her to test you to be sure. That's the only way you will know for sure but I have a good feeling you are pregnant. and if you are congrats!

Yes - if the 2nd line is there you are pregnant - no doubt.  Your doctor will be able to do an internal examination to determine approx how far along you are until you have a scan which will give a more accurate date.  Congratulations

Yes it can cause complications in being able to conceive.



The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) by itself should not affect your ability to get pregnant. But in some cases, having HPV can increase your risk of developing precancerous or cancerous cells in your cervix, which could affect both your fertility and your ability to carry a baby to term

I have HPV and honestly I think it is a little tougher however it is not impossible. Just make sure you go to the doctor regularly for your check ups and get anything fixed that needs it. I am happy to say so far I am 16 weeks pregnant and no complications that I know of. Good luck and keep trying.  --Note: I had to go into surgery about two years ago for benign cells on my cervix and have them removed. It took me a year and a half. I believe my difficulty had something to do with my cervix healing but otherwise once it did, it was healthy. I have not had ANY complications so far with my cervix being incompetent however if I had not had the surgery I think I would have had some problems. Make sure your cervix is checked and cleaned of any precancerous cells because I strongly believe these will affect you getting pregnant and holding to term. Try not to get pregnant before you have this checked out. You don't want to risk the damages.=/

Well personally speaking I found out that walking alot helps during pregnancy and labor My first born I was somewhat lazy and thought ahh I'll be fine I gained 70 lbs and was in labor for 22 hrs.(she was 7 lbs even)
So I did some research and found walking helps both. So I started walking with my second I gained 22 lbs the whole pregnancy and the labor was not hard it was more comfortable somehow (she was born 6lbs 5oz) I've had 2 more pregnancy's since and they were healthy too with minimal weight gain and the labor and delivery was soooo much easier.hope it helps you.

What is considered "pre-mature"? My doc doesn't want me to go to my due date...?



I am 36 weeks today and last week my doc told me she definitely didn't want me to go till my due date. This is my second baby, my first was 9lbs at 39 weeks. Currently she estimates this baby to be about 6.5-7lbs. She said if I go till Oct 31st he could be about 10 possible 11lbs! She talked about "scraping the membranes"...I DEFINITELY don't want a c-section. I had my first completely natural and in an hour! Couldn't I just have this one the same way? Why the scrapping? Is it "just in case" b/c problems could arrise-such as an emergency csection if I go till the due date?



Would the baby be considered "premature"?



Thanks to all!

Usually, they will do an amniocentisis to check the lungs.  But, I have heard lots of women getting induced early due to large babies.  The baby's shoulders can get stuck causing severe problems in the baby.  I guess your doctor doesn't want to risk that.  This is a relatively new thing.  Women used to give birth to huge babies all the time and go to term, but I guess there were too many complications and doctors decided to go ahead and induce.

she wants the scrape to try and induce labor sooner...
I have an issue with doctors guessing the weight since my first doctor said my first would be about 7/8 pounds and she was almost 9 pounds. the second doctor with second baby said she would be a good 8 pounds and was 6lbs6oz.. People vaginally deliver 10 pound babys all the time, i dont know why you would be any different unless there is something medically wrong with you...i would tell her you want to go to term and at least try and do it naturally.



Oh and even if she scrapes you at 37 weeks, it could be a week or more before labor happens.

Yeah after 37 weeks the baby is considered full term. It sounds like your doctor is just wanting to get the baby out before he/she gets too big and then they would have to do an emergency c-section. Scraping the membranes will be ok, they do that to try and make your uterus start contracting. Good luck!

I don't know what the scraping is, but at 37 weeks your baby will not be premature.  Also if your first child was 9lbs at 39 weeks you do not want to take the chance of having to big of a baby.  It could hurt the baby and you.  Be thankful that you had your last in one hour my first was 22 hours of labor.  My last was by emergency c-section and while I agree that I wouldn't want it, if it is better from you and the baby then by all means agree to do it.  Now days a c-section is not as bad as it use to be.

37 weeks is term.  Ask your doctor about your bishop score before she does any sweeping of the membranes.  Your bishop score is how well you would take to the induction.  (sweeping membranes is inducing)  If you have a low bishop score you will not likely have a successful induction and end up with a cesarean for your trouble.  If you had your first baby at 39 weeks naturally then it is probably likely that your second will come right around the same time.  You do have the right to refuse any medical procedure that you don't feel comfortable with.

WHAT!!??? scrapping?? to tell ya the truth go with your instinct. I'm a mother of a 2 y/o and i had to wait a week after my due date to get induce( she broke my water) my daughter was 9 lbs. 10oz. not once did they ever say what your doctor is saying. if it was up to me i would just go with the delivery the way YOU want it to go. especially if you have concerns about it. get a second opinion from another doctor. If it's going to be a health issue for you then really look into the scrapping thing. look online. good luck and i hope you make the right decision

Anything before 37 weeks is considered premature. Let me just tell you this just b/c she "scrapes" you doesn't mean it will work either. I still had to be induced b/c the membrane scraping did nothing for me. It wasn't a pleasant experience either! I went into labor by myself with my first one but had to be induced w/ #2 b/c he was 8 days late! My last guy (March) came super fast & he was my biggest (9.2) the other 2 were 8.4 & 8.5. If you really want to wait & see then your Dr should respect your plan on waiting. If they are afraid of you not being able to push the baby out then you need to take that into consideration but waiting at least 2 more weeks isn't going to make that much of a difference in the baby's weight. I say wait but just b/c that's what I did doesn't mean it will work for everyone. Congratulations & Good Luck!!

Yes we did find out the gender. I kept telling everyone we were having a girl but I knew it was a boy in the back of my mind. I only said a girld because everyone was saying a boy...lol. I was curious to find out what we were having and to also get the nursery ready and to start buying clothes as well.

With my first pregnancy, we didn't find out what we were having but I had a feeling that it was going to be a boy.  Well, I have a 19-month old little boy.  Now, I am pregnant with twins and we found out (the 23rd) that we are having two girls.  I still have a feeling that I am having a boy and a girl.  Guess we will have to wait and see.

I found out with my first three.  The first time I was so sure I was having a girl. It was a boy.  With the second, I was positive it would be a girl this time.  The pregnancy was so different from the first.  It was another boy.  The third pregnancy was just like the first so I thought for sure it was yet another boy.  I was wrong again!  It was a girl.  It seems I'm bad at guessing the gender of my babies.  lol.

No one knows what gender baby they are having... you can find out the sex though. Gender is a socially constructed view of what behaviors and apperences are associated with a particular sex. You won't know which "gender" your child chooses to be until they are older.

With all 3 of my previous pregnancies I just felt they were boys all along and infact they were. The Ultra Sound tech said that 90% of the time the mother's instincts are correct. This time we plan to not find out until the baby is born..hopefully I won't cave at the 20 wk Ultra Sound..LOL! I think it will be fun to be suprised. This time I really feel it is a girl..so we will see :) Good Luck!!

I didn't know for sure on any of mine, and I liked it that way.  I felt the first was a boy, and he was, the second I could only come up with girl names, and she was a girl, the third I didn't have a clue about, and it was another boy.  I think it is nice not knowing for sure.  Some people know for sure, have told everyone the name, and then when the baby comes, it seems like no big deal, no real news to tell everyone. I enjoyed the surprise and everyone be excited to hear the news at such a special time!

<question>



Am i pregnant?  constant low back ache!  slight fullness feeling.?



Im day 28 in my cycle & usually have a 30 day cycle.  But last month my cycle was a one-off 21 days!!!  Most unusual.



I had sex during ovulation this month (not before) - sperm left inside me as condom broke.



I dont recall getting low back aches before periods - just bad headaches or extra hungry for 1-day before period & moody.  Or bad cramps or bloated feeling & sometimes back aches DURING my periods NOT before.



But yesterday afternoon & again this afternoon through to this evening - Ive had constant low back ache - its dull feeling & not comfortable.  (Im fit & have good core muscles due to yoga so dont usually get back aches unless ive been standing all day in which case I havent been standing lots)



I took a home pregnancy test today - negative.  Still waiting for my periods.



Is it common to experience low back aches before a missed period or very early stages of pregnancy?  My breasts feel a bit fuller but no different to usual before a period - nipples normal.  No implantation bleeding etc ... but constant back ache!



Hard to wait it out ... so your thoughts would be appreciated.

When you have few flow of blood in menstrual cycle?



Last march I stopped taking the pill  because i'm planning for a baby, and since then i had some trouble with my menstrual cycle. The first 2 months i had to take other pills to make my cycle come. But now my cycle is coming the right time, but i have very few blood flow. This month I just had very few browns spots. I also noticed this month that i don't produce enough mucus to identify if i'm having ovulation or not.
Please help Thanks alot

after taking the pill, it can take some woman 6 -12 months to become pregnant or regulate a normal cycle... be patient with it but still have sex often since you dont know exactly when ovulation is happening...even though your cycle isnt normal, dosnt mean you cant get pregnant.

Despite what they tell you.  An ultrasound is only a weight estimate.  There is no scale that can weigh your fetus.  You won't really know how much he weighs until after he is born.

well if she is pregnant, the results are good for another 8 months lol.
If she read the test in the time frame, usually 3 minutes, then she would be pregnant,... hcg doubles every other day, and the test she took last night maybe just couldnt pick it up... she can test again if she wants too, or just go into the doctors.

i think this means shes NOT pregnant .. my mother took those urine tests at home - but theyre not 100% accurate , hers showed pink line , the same thing as your friends did. and she turned out to be pregnant later on when she went to the hospital to check. tell ur friend to go to the hospital. but if u do it at home , then u have to check after 10 minutes , or else its giving u the wrong information.

is it the same test from last night? if so, its possible that it is an evaporation line, or maybe she just didnt see the line last night. tell her to get a test that reads pregnant or not pregnant, there is no confusion with those, and to use first morning urine because that is when hcg levels are at their highest. good luck to her!

Please go to http://www.peeonastick.com/ and read about evaporation lines.  You can only read an HPT for the first ten minutes.  Anything that appears after that is an invalid result.  If she's still thinking she's pregnant, she needs to get another test and do it again.  Good luck.

No that would not be positive, you are supposed to discard the test after 10 minutes because it is not accurate anymore, apparently that happens sometimes. What she needs to do though is test in the morning, the first time she goes to the bathroom, because that is when your body has the highest levels of HGC.

Those test are supposed to be for the first 20 minutes or so. after that then it doesn't mean anything (its invalid) so if she's not sure tell you to take another one or go to her gyno for blood work. you can't go wrong with blood work. and AS ALWAYS use safe sex... good luck

Reading the test the next day is not accurate.  With the majority of the tests, you can only read them in the first 10 minutes up to maybe an hour.  After that time, an evaporation line can appear and make it look like it is positive when it is actually negative.  She should wait a few days and if her period still hasn't show up, she should take another test.

The sex of the baby is determined as soon as the sperm lands in the egg. Your male or female baby then will start to grow according to their gender map. This theory you are speaking of is totally false.

I don't believe that theory.  I really don't believe any of them, but my best friend tried to tell them that she and her husband had A LOT of sex and that is how she knew she was having a boy.  Than I got pregnant, and I had no sex drive at all, and I was also having a boy.  So that theory went down the drain.  I think every pregnancy is different regardless of what you are having. :)

Less.  Female sperm live longer, male sperm die quick but swim fast.  Since you are only fertile 2 days a month, for a female you want to have intercourse prior to ovulation by 48-72 hours giving the male sperm time to die off.



To increase the chances of having a male have intercourse every other day for the entire week of ovulation.



Look at those who do fertility treatments, the vast majority have sons, because the RE is making sure the egg and sperm get together by knowing precisely when ovulation occurs.

The idea is that girls take longer to swim, so you should have sex 3 days before you ovulate and then your chances are greater for having a girl rather than a boy. This of course is not proven and is just a theory.

It is the sperm that decides if it will be a boy or a girl. If the "male" sperm get to the egg and fertilize it quicker then it will be a boy. If a "female" sperm get there first..then it will be a girl. Scientists say that the male sperm are faster but die quicker and the females are slower but live longer. So if you want a girl, you should have sex 2-3 days before your ovulation day. That way the male sperm will die off before you ovulate and the females will still be alive fertilize the egg. If you want a boy, then have sex the day of ovulation.

I'm not sure how true the theory is, but I guess it is based in some fact in that female sperm live longer than male sperm but male sperm are stronger, so according to that then there could possibly be some truth but it's by no means a dead cert!

Neither, but there is something medically that shows that if you consume an extra 300 calories, especially by eating breakfast cereal when you're trying to get pregnant, you will be more likely to have a boy. Really... the guy decides the sex, but my family was blessed with a ton of girls, and my boyfriends family is all boys, and we have 2 girls so far.

I have read in a article on about. com that having sex in a spooning position you are more likely to have a girl, if you have sex on a full moon, if you have sex on even days then odd days you will have a girl, but i haven't found one on if you have sex less frequently or more frequently. I am now expecting and its a girl but we have more sex frequently. However, my friend didn't have sex frequently and had a girl.

First of all, its good to hear that you are wanting to be there.  If the two of you want to make it work, than you will figure something out.  Let her finish school, and than maybe the two of you can meet somewhere in the middle and get an apartment together.  Even if you don't live together right away though, the most important part is that you are there with her as much as you can be, and I'm sure things will work out.  Good luck.

She does look a lot like her 3d scan which is quite incredible! I'd love to get one done but I highly doubt I will :( But warmest congratulations to you mummy and daddy! She is absolutely GORGEOUS!

Not really.  Being pregnant, can be a roller coaster ride on your emotions.  I spose one day, you can feel fulfilled, but the next day you're scared as hell, then the next day you feel like a big cow, then the next you may feel beautiful and glowing.

I don't think you can answer that for all women, but I am sure that pregnancy does emotionally fulfill some.  Being pregnant has not given me any emotional fulfillment.  I don't enjoy being pregnant at all.  Now being a mother has, but I probably could have adopted a child and been just as fulfilled emotional, if not more.

It's not a baby's job to provide "emotional fullfilment" to a woman.  If she's looking or that, she needs to figure out the root cause of it and not drag some poor kid into the frey.



If anything, pregnancy (and being a mother) can make you second-guess your every move -- let alone provide any fulfillment.



As for how many kids to have, that depends on finances, time, realistic ability to provide attention to the kids, etc.  It should definately NOT be based on some fulfillment need.

Is it possible that you have a connective tissue disorder such as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome or Marfan Syndrome? If so, you should be evaluated for it, and if you're diagnosed then your doctor will know how to proceed.

You should always get checked out but one of the things I founf great was getting some medium support pants (bon marche sell them) a couple of sizes bigger than I'd normally wear. These took the weight of the baby and made things a lot easier

Can implantation after deprovera be like this?



I got my period on June 16, 2008 and was due to get second depo show but refused...had sex....period didn't come till July 29, 2008 and lasted 11 days. Hubby and I had sex at least once a week during this time. Also had sex on 8 day of period (it was a light flow) and sex on the last day of period.



Hubby and I had sex Thursday and blood flowed immediately after we finished. Period had just went off 3 day previous to that day. Now I have a light flow. Could I have gotten pregnant? One day period will be light pink. Then it will stop. Then it will return again brown with a lot of mucus. Then it will turn medium/dark red. I have had some small blood clots. So could I still be pregnant?

I don't know if this is what depo does to you when you implant.

I was on Depo for several months, and I suspect that rather than being pregnant, you are experiencing similar side effects to what I experienced.  For the first six months, Depo worked perfectly for me; but after that, I began having a period every single week.  One week would be like a normal period, starting heavy and lightening as the week wore on; but the other three weeks I would only bleed for two or three days, lighter than a normal period but heavy enough to be a concern.  I also had the brownish mucousy discharge at times.  My suggestion would be to call your doctor and talk to them about your symptoms.  You might also try a home pregnancy test, just to be sure.

Your ovulation depends on your cycle.  If you have a 28 day cycle you should ovulate sometime around day 14.  It really isn't as hard as it sounds since the sperm can live for several days in your body.  The best chance would probably be having sex between days 10-14 but could even be a little later than that.

oh yes- i am 32 weeks too and know what you're going through. try having a warm bath to help with the pain. are you wearing underwired bras or are you wearing maternity bras? i found that using a bra extender attached to the back of my maternity bras relieved some of the pressure on my ribs although they still hurt a little :-( just think- not long now till baby's here and this pain will be in the past :-)

Believe it or not, it sounds normal to me. Every pregnancy is different. My doctor tells me that all the time. I just tell myself, "Wow, it would figure I'd be one of the unfortunate ones". I was sick 24/7 the first 4 months of my pregnancy. I'm now 26 weeks and I'm dealing with constant aches and pains. My back hurts all the time. I can't stand for long periods. I get constant headaches. My hips hurt every morning when I wake up. I still get nauseated very easily. There's a ton of foods I can't even eat anymore. And I keep thinking to myself that if I'm feeling like this now, then I can't imagine how I'm going to be feeling in a month or two. It's definitely more than what I expected. But hey! Look at the bright side...you're almost there.

<question>



Can I really be seeing the baby kick at 18 weeks pregnant?



I was in the bath earlier and I'm sure I felt the baby kick 'for the first time'.  It was like a tapping and stretching from within, always in the same spot and would happen every now and again, sometime a few in quick succession and then nothing for a couple of minutes.  Once I'd got used to this sensation I realised that I've been feeling a similar but lighter and less obvious sensation for a week or so just before I go to sleep.



I was watching my stomach while in the bath and whenever the baby 'kicked' I saw my stomach move up in the very spot where I felt the kick.



I'm really surprised that I would be able to see anything this early, so do you think I really am feeling the baby kicking and is it really possible at 18 weeks to see your stomach move from the kick?

This is my first pregnancy, and I guess I'm fairly average weight with a definite bump.

Yea its possible...



I first felt my baby at 14 weeks ... its soooo wonderful when you realize you have a life inside of you!!



The movements will get harder and you will be able to see it more as the weeks go by ... by the 20th week you will see it like popcorn in your belly ...



My son kicks and punches at any sign of pressure like when I get a sonogram or someone puts their hand over my belly ... he hates that!!



Good luck and enjoy it :)



by the way i gained 50 to 60 lbs and I am so in tune with my body even though I am HUGE I feel everything!! so its not true you have to be a stick to feel things!!

TMI i know but need to ask



i am 15weeks or so pregnant and i have been bleeding though out the pregnancy (bright red blood) due to an ECH that all settled down and then out of the blue today i started i started loosing blood again without any pain watsoever but its different this time it is a thick creamy red/pink blood i loosing,
has anyone else suffered this before and could it be anything serious i am with midwife on wednesday as she couldnt get me in any ealier



</question>



<additional details>



i have bled throughout the pregnancy as i said, have rung NHS direct and they have said that if it not bright red fresh blood then its not dangerous, still dont know what to do. am stuck at home with no transport and 3 children all in bed so unable to get out



i dont have anyone around who could have watched the kids due to child with issues. have been to A&E anyhow with the kids and would just like to say to anybody that feels the need to tell anybody they have miscarried it is wrong to assume the worst for someone as my baby is fine, and the bleeding is NOTHING to worry about so the dr says.,

Yes there is a Possibility, but taking your bc should not affect your if you are. When I thought I was because I was taking it and missed my period my health dpt. told me since the pregnancy test was neg. to keep taking my bc and if I was that the bc would not harm the baby.To be positive your not I would recommend taking a test in a couple wks and use a condom if you do have sex. Well I hope this helps and remember use protection because even with it you could get pregnant and think are you ready to raise a kid? :)

Short of not having sex AT ALL there is ALWAYS a chance of getting pregnant!
If you are still within 72 hours of having unprotected sex you can take the morning after pill. Other than that you'll just have to go to your GP and see what's happened.
You should never rely on merely one form of birth control, IMHO it's just asking for trouble. You should always have a back up (not to mention you need to keep yourself safe from STI/STDs as well as getting pregnant!).

I have it too moreso recently than before.  I have no clue what it is so I'm glad you asked.  I'll be reading up on answers.
I thought it was just because we naturally are more wet at the end of the pregnacy and that maybe it leaks.  It's not my water leaking so I don't know what to do.

Are you sure it's discharge?  Your water might have broken way up high on the amniotic sac, causing a very slow leak?  You can have the fluid tested to see if it is amniotic fluid.

The baby tends to sit on your bladder, and there is a good chance you are just leaking out a little pee... Not to worry lots of ladies go through it... Good Luck :)

Go to the doctor!!  This same thing happened to me, and it was my water bag leaking!  It leaked slowly for a week and I had no idea.  The NICU had to examine her before I could touch her because of this.  I had to be induced immediately after being checked because I didn't pay attention to my own body.  Go get an amnio fuid check.  If it's nothing--fine, a wasted trip...but I'm betting it's your water.  Go go go!

The size of the baby and the room all your other organs are taking up (which are enlarged to sustain two lives) is putting pressure on your bladder.  You might want to get some slim tena lady towels just in the last week or so of your pregnancy.

You might be leaking your amniotic fluid.  Give your midwife a call.  Sometimes your waters "breaking" can just be a little trickle over a few hours.  Best just to have a check over to make sure your waters are still in tact.  If they have broken you need to go into labour within 24 hours or they will induce you to stop the risk of infection.  The waters around your baby are like a barrier to the outside world, once they have gone, you need to be kept an eye on.



Good luck hun, it sound like your baby might be on its way xxx

First of all, wear a pad to absorb the moisture.  You'll be more comfortable.  The weight of the baby could be making your bladder leak, or you may be leaking amniotic fluid, which simply means you are about to go into labor.  I'd call your doctor.  There is a test they can do on the moisture to see if it is amniotic fluid.

It's possible you are leaking amniotic fluid, you may want to go the the dr and have hem swab, it's instant results, if the swab turns blue-then prepare to welcome your new baby very soon. If thats not it then it may just be a change as your body prepares for the arival of your little one.

I am a mother of 2 and I had the same thing in my last few weeks. It could be from a couple of things. First of all, hormones will cause you to produce more vaginal discharge and it can be really watery. A few times I thought my water had broken with my first baby, but it was only discharge. I actually had wet spots, like water, on my undies a few times. The second reason you can be experiencing it is because of all the pressure on your bladder. No one wants to hear they might be peeing themselves, but it's true. It's one of those unpleasant little things your mother fails to mention about pregnancy. =) You may not even notice it leaking either. 
The third reason would be a slow leak in the amniotic fluid. If you have an appointment coming up soon (they should be seeing you weekly at this point), it would be a good idea to tell your doctor about it. They can do a test where they take a strip of paper and dip it in the fluid. If it turns a certain color they can tell if it's amniotic fluid or something else. 
If you're not contracting or bleeding, I would go with the first two reasons. Just wear a panty liner. It's not long now!!!

I had the same thing with all three of my pregnancies.  It is just related to your hormones and changes your body is going through because of the pregnancy.  However, if it is thick or a bad smell, get it checked out.  It could be a simple yeast infection, or something else.  They have inserts that will take it away, and it won't harm the baby. I went through that too.

Hmm...it sounds like you may be leaking amniotic fluid. What does the discharge look like? Is it clear and watery? If it is, you need to call your doctor sometime today, they will want to induce you if you are leaking amniotic fluid for a long period of time without going into labor.



The only other possibility I can think of is that you're leaking urine, but (sorry, this is gross) urine has a pretty distintive smell so I think you would have noticed.

Bearcat, women are pregnant for 10 months, not nine. So she's right on time.

First of all, congrats and best of luck to you and your baby!
1) The baby sits smack dab on top of your bladder, so the pressure may be weighing down on your bladder.
2) There could be a slight tear in the amniotic sac, leaking amniotic fluid. In this case (unless extremely near the due date) you should call your doctor and discuss the possibilities. Leaking amniotic fluid could be potentially very bad for the baby. 
3) The viscous squiggy stuff that women leak out before their water breaks often slowly leaks for a few days as the baby nears birth.. It's somewhat of a grey color, but I guess that all depends on you.

Ahh. I'm so excited for you!

It could be a combination of pee, vaginal discharge or a slight chance could be your water breaking. Discharge really increases in the later weeks of pregnancy and the baby is right on your bladder so it could just be an annoying combo of that. As long as it's not pinkish or have a foul odor I wouldn't worry about it too much. Also as long as there is no cramping associated with it then you should be fine. Mention it to your doctor at your next appointment and they might be able to give you more specifics. I was like that the last 2 weeks of my pregnancy. It was definitely no fun but nothing to be concerned about. Good luck

My doctor's reaction to spotting?



I went in Monday for my doctor's appointment, and told him about the spotting that's been going on the last couple of weeks.  His reaction?  Nothing.  Basically, it's the same situation as last time when I miscarried.  Wait it out and see, because there's nothing they can do to stop it.  I'm not having a blood test until October 23, to measure my HCG levels, and my ultrasound is scheduled for December 20th!  So now I'm almost 8 weeks pregnant, and just waiting for whatever happens next.



I live in Canada, (New Brunswick), where we have a doctor shortage, so it's almost impossible to get another doctor, so I'm stuck.  Oh, and also, knowing I was spotting he gave me a pap test!



Just wanted to know what you guys think about this.

Pap test won't affect the pregnancy either way, they are 100% safe to get.



Basically for the rest hes right, there isnt a thing that can be done if you are having a miscarriage, BUT, it's also common for spotting to occur in early pregnancy.  I wouldnt panic just yet, unless the spotting turns bright red bleeding, period like with cramps chances are you having a normal pregnancy with some spotting.

Sorry to hear. I know the wait and the not knowing is terrible. But the doctor is correct, there is nothing you can do. Even if you were able to get a scan right away, you cannot prevent an imminent miscarriage. I also live in Canada, and if you really can't wait you could try an after hours clinic or the hospital emergency room. I'm sorry this probably doesn't help. Try to stay positive.

Book an ultrasound at a private clinic if you don't want to wait until Dec20, I had one at 9 weeks just to make sure there was a baby in there.  I was able to see the heartbeat and know that everything was okay so far.  :)

I believe I'd still be doing whatever I could for a second opinion. I've never had a miscarriage, but the same thing happened to me at about 8 weeks. I began spotting one weekend, so I immediately contacted the doctor's answering service. He called me back in a matter of minutes and had me go to the hospital that day for labs. I'm 32 weeks now, and everything is going just fine. It's just scary and you want that reassurance! October 23 is a long time to have to wait for that. I hope everything turns out alright for you and your little one!

You probably do walk differently, and just haven't noticed it.

It's a sort of waddle, or side-to-side walk... and it's caused by your center of gravity shifting. It starts the minute your stomach starts to pop out a bit, and gets more exaggerated over time. If you're carrying very small, it's possible you don't do this yet.

The pregnancy walk is not so much of a walk as a waddle.  I do it now at 20 weeks a bit as i have a small bump but am compensating from some lower back pain.  Your centre of gravity shifts which makes it difficult to walk upright without doing the side to side wobble thing.  Its quite funny but I'm trying not to do it at the moment, its just too early lol

If you cannot bend over forwards then you probably are doing the walk!

It is usually more noticeable one the baby moves down a little. You will feel like you are carrying a football between your knees, also you will wake up one morning and see an inch gap between the base of your boobs and the top of the bump.

Good luck! Happy waddling!!

im 38 weeks pregnant n im not massive but ive added a good 2st to my pre pregnancy weight n i dont do it.

is a question of balance, i notice i walk slighlty different when the baby pushes down n i feel like ive got a ball between my legs or if she shifts from one side to the other it puts ur balance out, but dont worry if u dont do it....its not a requirement ha ha.

well done to you going to college with 3 boys already.  good on you.

if your heart is telling you that you would regret an abortion then it could be a very upsetting and long term distressing decision for you.  something that you would have to live with for the rest of your life.  if you feel that you cannot live with that decision then it is a mistake (my opinion)

your ex is obviously a complete waste of space and probably best left out of the equation and forgotten about, hard but for the best.  Let him change his name, move away etc.. he sounds likes he hasn't grown up and has never learnt to take responsibility for himself.  you don't need someone like that!

does the college you go to have a nursery?  many do so this could be a solution for when you go back.

The baby would be due around Easter?  if this is the case you would only miss one term of college and then have the summer holiday and many colleges really try hard to accommodate pregnant women.  find out where you would stand and how it would affect things.



I hope that you have a good family and support network of family and friends to help you.
take care and look after yourself and give the baby your name, it is the most important one!

Go and see someone like a counselor or a friend that should help. I would not do anything drastic just yet, just because you have split up with your partner does not automatically mean an abortion unless you seriously don't want the child.

If you are that upset I would have it and keep it or put it up for adoption.  I would never have an abortion.  Who cares if the dad doesn't want to see his child.  My mom raised 4 kids all by herself.  You don't need a man to make it through life you just might have to put your life on hold a little longer.

You can do this without him. Whether you abort or not you shouldn't be with him I couldn't imagine telling my husband and him telling me to abort it!! Don't mess up your emotions because he told you to. I know it's going to be hard but sounds like the best to do is not talk to him and move on with your boys and baby.

Oh god winky,  firstly, you will be better off without that ***.  Secondly you have to decide in your own mind which you would rather cope with
a) termination



b) another baby/child
Wishing you all the best, but do give it serious thought.  Personally I would go for a).

There are thousands of infertile couples out there who want babies.  Find one.  Make their day, make their whole life.  Give your kid 2 stable parents who want it.  Even if you could take care of it and want it, it wouldn't have a father to love it.  Many times people are willing to help you out with dr. expenses too.  With 3 boys and college to pay for, I am sure you could use some help with added expense.

I don't mean to sound harsh, but since you did not take precautions to avoid pregnancy, I feel that you have to deal with the consequences whether the father will be in the picture or not, especially since you already have 3 kids, could you really live with yourself if they found out that you terminated their baby brother or sister?



There are plenty of resources out there to help you seek monetary child support, just google "Child Support Enforcement" and select your state. It doesn't matter if he wants to pay or not, the judge will set your payments up to be garnished from his wages.

Oh dear, please be strong! I know how difficult it must be, because I've been there.

Can you afford it emotionally or mentally if your new baby's born? There's always adoptions as an option. But I wouldnt do that either because I'm sure mother and a child have emotional bond to each other.

So if you feel your new born baby will be happy (if you still give it happiness) so go for it. Otherwise, if you feel like it wont be live happily so you'd be better do termination or give it for adoption.

I'm sorry XX

You may not be able to cope emotionally, but how are you going to cope financially with a fourth child as a single parent? Your ex has already made it abundantly clear how he stands on the issue. Do you have any outside financial support?

Abortion is a very emotional subject and it must be doubly hard to consider when you already have children and know what you'd be losing, but then again raising four children on government handouts isn't the way to go. If you can afford to have another child, both financially and in terms of the emotional cost to your other children, then by all means go for it. If you can't then consider how irresponsible it is for you to bring another child into this world.

Sorry if this sounds harsh, but you did ask.

My boyfriend disappeared when I was about 6 weeks pregnant.  He wanted me to abort too.  I didn't have any other kids, but at the same time, I didn't want to get rid of this one.  I'm now 27 weeks pregnant, with a boy!  And I am so glad I decided to keep it.  I'm in college too, and it's so hard to juggle it all, but to me, it's worth it in the end.  If you want a friend to talk to you can email me through here, or add me to myspace, I've found talking about it, is the best solution.

And an update on the guy, he's a loser, he didn't talk to me from 6 weeks til 26 weeks, we've talked twice, he's in a different state, he's still not worth my time or this baby's.

hi there!
i no it sounds mean but i think you should go ahead and have an abortion cause at the end of the day the child's going to suffer not knowing who its father is.to tell you the truth i knew my dad for a couple of years but i still suffer knowing him because he did everything in his power to hurt me. i no its mean to take a babies like away but i think in your situation now it would help if you went along and had an abortion. Good luck :)

I don't think you should have an abortion if you believe deep down in your heart that you'll feel bad about it later.  Since abortion is seemingly not an option, you must contact someone with legal authority, like a social worker or an attorney to explain your situation.  Try dialing 211 for any available assistance.  Although your baby's father is refusing to accept responsibility for the child to the degree of changing his identity, the law can force him to attend DNA paternity testing and/or pay child support.  Try to get his full name, address(es), SSN, phone numbers and the names and locations of his close relatives if possible.  Do a background check on him.  You may have to raise the child alone, but the father can't hide from his obligations to support him/her.

He had no right telling you to get rid of "it". Be strong and go through this without him. You may have to make a few adjustments but im sure if youve already managed with 3 then you certainly know what to do. When the baby is born, let the so called father run as far away as possible from YOU, but he wont be able to run from CSA

Scan in late pregnancy measuring 1 cm smaller then last week is it normal to scan?



can you see a lot of the baby in there what possible reason is there for this scan i will be 37+2 weeks when i have the scan (tues)

they have told me its to check the babys growth, as i measured 1 cm smaller then the week before i thought 2 cm either way was ok

are they telling me the truth or could something be wrong with the baby they are not telling me
i did ask the midwife/doc 3 times and they said because of the measurements

It sounds pretty legit.  It would be ok if you were off on measurements a bit but not ok if you are smaller than you were before.  They have to determine if the baby is at a point where being outside would be more beneficial to him or her.

They could not know that something was wrong with the baby without doing a scan so it is unlikely that is the reason.  It sounds like they are telling you the truth, they will just be checking on the baby's growth if your measurements have gone down.  At this stage it is better to be safe than sorry which will be why they are checking how your baby is growing.  If your baby is smaller than it should be it could be because the placenta is not functioning as well as it should be and in this case your baby will need to be delivered a bit early (not a problem at all at this stage).  In any case you have nothing to worry about.  Good luck!

It depends on a lot of things, mainly when it was during your cycle. The only way to make sure is to wait and see if you get your period, and to take a test.

Even if he didn't ejaculate, there's the pre-ejaculate that can get you pregnant. I'm not sure if this was with someone that you knew, but if not you may want to get tested for STD's as well, pregnancy shouldn't be your only worry.

The chance is defiently there. But without more facts regarding your cycle it is hard to tell how big the chances are. I would first go to the doctor withing the next few days and getting testing for STD's to protect yourself from the start, depending on when this occured you could be eligible for the morning after which is still effective 72 hours after unprotected sex but the effectivness is reduced by waiting that long. Try to get into your OBYN as soon as you can if not go to a planned pregnany center and they can generally get you in sooner.

statistically, a healthy couple who have intercourse (with ejaculation) at the women's peak fertile time, have a 25% chance of conceiving.

if you've had sex in within the last 72 hours then you can take the morning after pill.

I would suggest you go see your GP get an Std test done and go on the pill.
Its better than worrying each time you slip up.
good luck

Well it depends on where you are in your cycle. If you are ovulating at the time of sex then the risk is very high. Ovulation usually occurs 14 days after the first day of your period.  Also, just a little FYI, you can get pregnant from precum.

 If you go to this website they have an ovulation calculator. If you want to use it.

Hope this helps! Good luck

Hi,



Well if you drunk you may not be aware that he ejaculated.



Unprotected sex means there risk of pregnancy if he did ejaculate - even pre-*** can make a baby!

Even if he didn't you risk getting sexually transmitted diseases.

Maybe it best to get yourself on the pill or have the contraceptive injection to cover yourself in future.



Also carry condoms in your bag - women say it a man job but I think women should carry them too for those moments when men make it out they got none and still want a leg over!



Nothing wrong in having sex respect and taking care of yourself!

sounds like symptoms, but that doesn't mean for sure you are. sometimes the blood tests are neg. too if you take them too soon, there may not have been enough hcg in it yet for it to detect anything. Take a hpt asap and by now it should be able to tell you, go back to the doctor as well even if it comes back neg. so u can find out whats reallly going on and maybe take another blood test?

The morning-after pill — a form of emergency birth control — is used to prevent a woman from becoming pregnant after she has had unprotected vaginal intercourse. Morning-after pills are generally considered safe, but many women are unaware that they exist.



Here's how the morning-after pill works. Human conception rarely occurs immediately after intercourse. Instead, it occurs as long as several days later, after ovulation. During the time between intercourse and conception, sperm continue to travel through the fallopian tube until the egg appears. So taking emergency birth control the "morning after" isn't too late to prevent pregnancy.



The active ingredients in morning-after pills are similar to those in birth control pills, except in higher doses. Some morning-after pills contain only one hormone, levonorgestrel (Plan B), and others contain two, progestin and estrogen. Progestin prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and keeps a fertilized egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus (implantation). Estrogen stops the ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation) that can be fertilized by sperm.



The morning-after pill is designed to be taken within 72 hours of intercourse with a second dose taken 12 hours later. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness, menstrual changes and headache. According to the manufacturer, the morning-after pill is more than 80 percent effective in preventing pregnancy after a single act of unprotected sex.



Morning-after pills aren't the same as mifepristone (Mifeprex), the so-called abortion pill. Emergency contraceptive pills such as Plan B prevent pregnancy. The abortion pill terminates an established pregnancy — one in which the fertilized egg has attached to the uterine wall and has already begun to develop.



Plan B is available to women 18 years and older without a prescription at most pharmacies. Women must show proof of age to purchase Plan B. For women 17 years old and younger, Plan B is available only with a doctor's prescription.

Firstly you did the right thing by getting the emergency contraception!

The "morning after pill", emergency contraception, works up until 72 hours (3 days) after the unprotected sex. However the sooner the pill is taken the faster it will work and the more efficient it would be.

The emergency contraception pill is very sucessful and only has a failure rate of about 2% (the failure usually occurs when the pill is taken after the 72 hour period).

I hope this has helped.

How far along are you?  If it is earlier (before 22 weeks) you might not just be able to feel it yet.  If it is after that and you haven't felt movement in a long time, check with your dr.



I am 20 weeks and I only feel random kicks too.  Try sitting really still - I think sometimes it is still so light that I don't notice it unless I am really concentrating.

Eat some icecream and then lie down or sit back with your feet up in an armchair - I think it used to give my son a sugar rush when he was "on the inside" because he would go off nearly every time I had icecream.

perhaps he's just tired or hiding right now.
try having a cold glass of water and then laying down with your legs elevated. rest your hands on your belly and breathe deeply.
the more you relax, the more baby will "come alive with energy".

If you are not very far along it might just be too early. If not then I would push on him and he will push back. My son was the same way he never did his kicks like he was supposed too. I was in the hospital about 20 times in the 9 months. I would push and keep pushing or even get some head phones and blast some music right on too your belly. Good luck and if no results go to the ER soon. God bless and I am sure all is well.

@ 24 wks you can feel him move but only the hard kicks/punches he probably is moving you just cant feel him all the time....try laying on your left side after drinking a glass of juice or eating that should help if not just be patient soon enough you will wish he would stop kicking as much because it will make you uncomfortable at times but enjoy it when he does move for you ... a little less than halfway to go good luck

It can take up to 12 weeks for your body to get back into some sort of pattern - I wouldn't be concerned yet.



See your Dr if still nothing in 4 weeks.

If you are having unprotected intercourse - which the withdrawl method is...you might also want to take a pregnancy test now - you don't have to have had a period bleed to get pregnant again.

Try condoms or something safer in the meantime.

It usually takes about 3 months or so and you can get pregnant during this time. All it takes is one little swimmer that escaped before withdrawal. You better take a pregnancy test.

Chances are that you are pregnant again and should take a pregnancy test.  Withdrawal method is not an effective form of birth control and you are not wise to use it, you might as well have used nothing.
Take the test and then call your doctor.  Congratulations?

At first, for me, not much. Then had to pee alot. And burped alot. Morning sickness came at night but only had it for two weeks. As you get bigger, you feel tired, hot, uncomfortable, you get heartburn, you need to pee again, you get constipated and you want ti to be all over soon. But as soon as soon as it is, you want it all over again. It's the best feeling in the world : )

and i now feel all of the above other than the sickness as thats wore off over the past month, plus now i feel like i'm smuggling a sand filled beach ball everywhere and my feet and ankles are huge and i walk like a duck
and i feel like i have drank too much water constantly as a  bathroom has to be within distance at all times haha.



i'm not really selling the idea of pregnancy too well am i ?



sorry ha.



but it's lovely to feel the baby starting to wiggle and then giving you its first HARD kick and watching your belly go mad.
and when you feel sad they react, well mine does when i'm angry or sad, he strokes my hand from the inside and it calms me down.
emotional i'm a different person, cause this will be a complete life changing experience and i will have this little boy to protect for the rest of my life ha, trust me, if anyone hurt him i would kill for him!

Every woman is different, but initially, a large amount of women get swollen or sore breasts, and some get morning sickness.  They exhibit no other major symptoms, except for lack of periods (not all women get this, but hoorah for small mercies). You may start to crave certain foods, or smells and some things will turn you off that didn't necessarily before.  You will want to drink more fluids, feeliing dehydrated if you don't.
As your stomach starts to swell, you will notice that it is not like being fat, it is firm and hard, however, you will still not initially feel movement, some women don't feel their first until they are well over 20 weeks, breasts will grow and some lucky women report better hair, skin and nails.



After 12 weeks, a lot of women loose the morning sickness and breast pain, and report they feel better or start glowing.  You may experience a heightened sense of smell which apparently harks back to the day when we needed to be wary of foods that would poison or upset us so strong smelling foods like onions and fish may linger with you far longer than they did before.
In your last 3 months, you may experience heartburn, as the womb is pressing upon the stomach, you may actually loose weight, but may not think it because your bump is still growing.  The breasts also grow more.  You may develop a waddle, which is tragically not sexy.  You may want to go to the toilet a lot.  In the last couple of weeks, your heartburn may go as the baby moves down.  You will be tired by then end, and feel anxious about your due date and labour.



It's all worth it, and just to prove it, I'm doing it again, got six days to go.
Good luck.

It would appear i have developed hayfever for the 1st time ever and to make matters worse i'm pregnant.

I have taken a benadryl to see if it eased my symptoms and it actually did, thus confirming it actually was hayfever (cos i was in denial).

Now i want to use them more but am concerned if taking regularly will cause any problems with the baby. The packet only said consult ur doctor before taking. It did not say "do not take when pregnant".

I wanted t know if anyone else had taken this sort of thing whilst pregnant and what are the potential implications of regular usege.

Note: this is my 4th prgancy and all have been completely normal with no health issues whatsoever!

Yes, Benadryl is completely normal to take.  You can take one 2-3 times a day if you have to.  Just be mindful it can cause drowsiness.

Yes, you can take benadryl because it is not powerful enough to make it to or effect the baby in anyway. I took it for problems sleeping during my last two weeks with my daughter cause i was soo uncomfortable.

I've got really bad hayfever and am pregnant and was really confused by the advice.  Some people say it's fine to take things like Benadryl but others don't.  In the end I asked my midwife who sent me to the doc for his advice and he gave me a prescription for eye drops and a nose spray (this actually works out better because prescriptions are free when pregnant)!  I just thought it's better to be safe than sorry.

I have really bad hayfever, my Doctor wont let me take anything for it though, she said that nothing has been tested on people whilst pregnant so she wouldn't advice it. she gave me a nose spray instead.

get ur doc to prescribe u Gaviscon, it wont take it away altogether and its murder I had to lie in bed upright with a towel as the heartburn was that bad that I got acid reflux that kept flying into my mouth and the pain is unbelievable! I was drinking the gaviscon straight from the bottle lol and taking packet upon packet of rennies ontop but it still didnt stop it altogether, I hope it gets better for u as my only solution was it stopped when I gave birth and that wasnt a moment too soon for me lol Gilly x

as gilly said but also you could try to sleep with the head of your bed raised as this prevents the acid from leaking back into the throat.

mints are usually good and milk this calm the acid in the stomach and help ease the discomfort ...



if you get the pain try a heat pad they work a treat for me i get constant pain from heartburn even after my kids and the heat pad thing works for me .

Oh man!!! I suffered at the ahnds of heartburn right through both pregnancies. It is horrid. I ate rennies like they were sweets! You cant take anything like zantac  unfortunately. You just have to ride it out Im afraid. It ahould go after the birth. Meanwhile avoid spicy food, pastry, anything too fatty or greasy....this should calm it a bit. Also prop yourself up in bed on a couple more pillows as this stops the acid refluxing a bit. I feel for ya petal ;-) will be worth it when you have your ickle baba tho.

good luck xxx

you should definitely talk to a doctor as soon as you can, although it is most likely not a serious problem (i don't think so, at least). tums will help a lot, just don't take over 7 a day. feel better! =) also if you need more help you can refer to this question:

I am going through this exact thing..and I am only 8 weeks along. These helped me a lot. I raised the head of my bed onto blocks of wood 4-6 inches and I sleep on my left side. Maalox is safe when you are pregnant. Stay away from spicy foods, chocolate, soda, fried or fatty foods and spearmint and peppermint.  Don't eat 3 hours before laying down for a nap or going to bed. Eat slowly and chew thoroughly. Try eating six smaller meals a day instead of 3 big ones. Don't wear tight clothing around the waist or chest (it helps me to go without a bra) And try to avoid gaining too much weight it puts pressure on your stomach. I got all these from the What to expect when you're expecting and I have almost eliminated my heartburn and acid reflux.
If none of those work talk to the Dr about giving you some more ideas or some medicine. You CAN take Zantac or prilosec OTC. My Dr told me to take zantac all through my last pregnancy and everything was fine. This time they told me to take either that or the Prilosec..but ask your Dr. what they think is best. Good Luck..you are over half way there..hang in there :)

if you are bad tonight and have nothing in the house, try drinking mlk.  sometimes this helps to settle it.

also, if you try and eat little and often it can help keep it at bay.

Sometimes it gets worse when you are hungry so graze rather than scoff :)

good luck

I understand why you would wonder. A teen pregnancy is a pregnancy from ages 13 to 19. At 19 you are still a teenager but once you hit 18 you are also considered a young adult so Im not 100% sure. I would still go with the ages 13-19.

I don't know if there's really a "correct" answer to this. I always just assumed that teen pregnancy referred to anyone between thirTEEN and nineTEEN... although I admit when I thought of a 19 year old being pregnant it wasn't the same as thinking of a 16 year old (I'm only 22 myself, and was 21 when I got pregnant).

Should I go to the ER or wait?



I think I have experience a miscarriage.... I am about 5 weeks into pregnancy.  Today I started bleeding... I called my doctors office but they were closed... the emergency line sent me to another office... that was closed... I eventually got a hold of someone who claimed to call the on call doctor.  She said he didnt answer, so she paged him and said to call back if he didnt call me.... He didnt call and when I tried back there was no answers... 4 times...

I have been feeling ok... other then cramping and slight nausea... But I am still bleeding...

Do I go to the ER? or wait to see a OBGYN tomorrow?

This is a little late -- hopefully you've already gone to the ER as the others suggested! I just wanted to add that you should also change doctors to one who will be available for consult after hours, make sure and complain to your current doc before finding a new one. That's unacceptable for you to not be able to reach ANYONE through your doctor's office in an emergency like this. I hope you and your little bub are okay!

How heavily are you bleeding? Is it light bleeding or heavy like a heavy period. How many pads/hour are you going through. If it is light bleeding, then I would say wait until tomorrow. There is nothing the ER can do for a miscarriage. They only do supportitive care for the mother (making sure she does not loose too much blood). If you are only 5 weeks along, then chances are you will not loose too much blood. However, if the bleeding is heavy, then you need to be checked out. Good luck and hopefully this is a false alarm.

Do you ever get the feeling of your baby punching through jelly, down below?  It's like a really squidgy feeling. I'm 32 weeks pregnant, and she's supposedly head down, so it must be punches not kicks.

Yeah its kind of irritating when you are trying to sleep as well. However I wouldn't be so sure about your baby being head down. My daughter was a week late and still bottom down. You can only be sure if you've had an ultra sound to prove it. It was horrible for me because they induced me thinking that she was head down, had pitocin and my water broke for 6 hours before they realized she was breech. So I had those 6 hours of hell for nothing, had to do a c-section! If we would have known I could have saved some time!

She probably is head down though. My daughter has always been the difficult one!

yes its common when the baby is in the head down position it may feel like ur baby is grinding down its just moving further in to ur pelvis for the big day.

it can feel like gristle its a weird sensation isnt it? at least u know ur baby is getting ready for the big day, some lazy buggers are just to comfy n stay in th breech position untill the last minute.

hey gurlie
you dont sound very old.
im 16 my self with a baby on the way
umm the spoting could of been your peroid
a week early is not that bad
you could have a changed scedual
or you could be pregant.
the chance though depends on if u used protection,
wait a little while and you or one of your friends go out and get a pregancy test... i recoment the one that comes with two in a pack just to make sure. if you take the first one and its negative and you still dont get your peroid for a week after that test again with the other one . if still the same talk to your mom or a doctor you could have a horramone imbalance or you could be pregnant, good luck

lil sharp pains sound like round ligament pains, esp. cuz u say they are in your chest as well. round ligament pain is nothing to be worried about, this is ur first pregnancy and you are at a point where you are stretching much further than your body has ever stretched before! they shouldnt ever get really bad though, so if they do, call your doctor immediately and have him/her check everything out!

What you are describing does not sound like braxton hicks.  A braxton hick contraction is not sharp and you should only be able to feel it in your abdomen.  Your stomach will get tight and you will feel uterine pressure, like your baby is pushing against your stomach really hard.  You will be able to feel your abdomen tighten and relax with your hand as well.  Being a first pregnancy, 27 weeks seems pretty early for braxton hicks.  It could be nerve related.  Be sure to mention this to your doctor at your next visit.

They could be. Just watch them and make sure they dont get a pattern to them. Like if they start coming every 8 minutes... or every 20 mins... like clockwork. I f they do, you might want to go get checked to make sure your not in labor.

Braxton Hicks don't normally hurt.  Cause discomfort, yes, but hurt, no.  Sounds more like round ligament pain from all the stretching happening in your midsection.  If the pain continues without any relief and is accompanied by anything suspicious at all - an increase in discharge, fever, vomiting, spotting, etc, call the doctor and take yourself to the ER.  Also, give your doctor a call tomorrow morning no matter what, just to put your mind at ease.

Congrats and good luck!

Braxton Hicks can start after the 16 week of pregnancy, they are not supposed to be painful but sometimes they can, i found in my first pregnancy if they were uncomfortable it was helpful to have a warm bath, true contractions remain in the water, braxton hicks disappear.
Its also useful to change what you were doing, if you were walking, then relax and vice versa.
Dehydration, tiredness or straining yourself can trigger these contractions. 
If your still worried and are finding the pain unbearable go see your doctor, thats what they are there for.

Goodluck

2 part question, abortion questions?



Ok, this is an abortion question,
what is the maximum weeks that an abortion can be performed?
and if a woman saw her baby and felt her baby, would that change her mind?
i mean at 17weeks i felt my baby kick, at 20 weeks 5days, i saw my baby and he was fully developed.  i just read an answer, and someone said 26weeks, that's like a real baby, its not a cluster of cells or a tadpole, its a baby.  i am having a hard time wrapping my mind around that, is it just me or is that wrong?
I am pro-choice, but for me i am pro-life all the way, i am just wondering is all.

In the UK doctors can legally abort up to week 24 (In May 2008, MPs voted to retain the current legal limit of 24 weeks)  - although ONLY far along if there is like a major birth defect found or something at the 20 wk scan - they can refuse to do it after 12wks if its jsut for a selfish reason-many doctors wont perform late abortions unless due to a medical reason!



i know i cant blieve it - knowing at 16wks because there muscles are developing they can make some faces - able to squint, frown and open its mouth and kick you - i dont know how any normal person with a healthy baby could end its life :(

The maximum is 24 weeks and most people probably do change their minds but others do not feel maternal in any way and often do not care for their baby and see it as a way of ruining their life. Most people cannot ever have babies so it does seem unfair that there are people out there who are extremely fertile and don't want a baby

Its selfish. Because if a woman cant keep her legs closed she has an abortion. Pill, no pill, injection, no injection, condom, no condom - no frikken difference! It happen for a damn reason!

It sickens me that the people that accept their responsibility get judged and treated bad when the people that think life is a game and they can delete a life get defended. This world is messed up. I live in South Africa and i can handle the stuff here but not abortions. Abortion is legal at 13yrs old! Disgusting and stupid if u ask me because the legal sex age is 16.



I have seen questions over and over again for abortion. It takes ALOT to make me angry but this sends me over the top. I cant handle the fact that people actually have abortions

It depends where you live, laws are different in different places.



Thing is, you're talking about a healthy baby - and I feel exactly the same way you do about abortion in that case. But if at 24 weeks I discovered my baby was desperately ill, was already in agony, and was 100% sure to die in agony...I'd have to give very serious thought as to whether it was kinder to have an abortion than to go on with the pregnancy.



I'm pro-life. But not all unborn babies have life as an option.

It all depends on the clinic. Yes, you can have an abortion that it up to 23 1/2 to 26 weeks pregnant. As horrible as this sounds, it is usually only performed on a emergency and "need to" basis. Such as if something is wrong with the fetus as in a birth defect. And some insurance companies will contribute to the cost if this is the case.

Im so nervous about ultrasound?



Im having an ultrasound done tomorrow morning and Im so afraid. My last period was July 1st, Aug 2nd my HCG levels were 97 my dr said that I was very early in my pregnancy, Aug 4th they were 283, then Aug 11th they were 3301. My dr hasnt measured them this week. The reason Im so nervous Is I have had 2 previous ectopic pregnancies and Im so afraid to find out tomorrow that this one is also an ectopic. Im not having any pains, no spotting. Just normal pregnancy symptoms. What are my chances of having another ectopic and will I see anything on the ultrasound, they are doing a vaginal one. Thanks!!

Your levels look great. It's natural to worry and given your past you have every reason to. Just because it happened before does not mean it will happen this time. I had 3 miscarriages and my pregnancy with my son was very scary. I am 16 weeks along now and it's still hard even after having a healthy baby. I have to remind myself that good things will happen for me and this baby is for keeps. This baby needs you now everything you've wanted for so long is inside you at this very moment. Breath free girl it will work for you soo many women have loss and go on to have a healthy pregnancy about 80 present. You have a higher chance of things working out than you do of having another loss and that is a fact! It will be okay like I said I know it's hard but try as hard a you can tell yourself it will be okay. Hope does not disappoint us having hope is never a bad thing. I can't wait for you to see your baby's little beating heart tomorrow.

Well I'm no doctor so I might not be right but my guesses are that your chances of having another ectopic pregnancy is 50%. From what you are describing, I would say you are having a normal pregnancy.

Smoking while pregnant?



My sister has told me that she and her husband are trying for a baby, and i am thrilled.
Now she smokes and has done for over 10 years but said that she definatly wont smoke while pregnant, but when i suggested that she give up now, while trying to conceive she was kinda mad at me.

I just wondered if people on here smoked while pregnant, or gave up while ttc and what your views are.

I realise that it is my sisters choice whether or not to give up smoking its just i think why wait until your pregnant why not stop now while your ttc-
Her argument, is that i dont know what its like as i have never smoked (which she is probably right)



</question>



<additional details>



Please dont leave nasty comments about my sister regarding this question, i am looking for peoples views and smokers who gave up while ttc or while pregnant.



Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has answered so far, its nice to get positive comments and advice from people.

Sometimes people say really hurtfull things on here, when theres no need.

So thank you everyone!

Once I found out I was pregnant, I quit smoking. I didn't even have the desire to smoke, and I'm able to have enough control to not smoke when I have cravings. Just because I don't want it to hurt my baby. 
My pregnancy wasn't planned, but if she's trying to conceive, she really should stop smoking. It could interfere with her getting pregnant too. Along with drinking, etc. But I'm sure she knows that. You're right. She needs to start quitting now.

It is your sisters choice to smoke or not but she might find conceiving more difficult if she continues to smoke. 
As long as she gives up when she becomes pregnant things should be okay but if she doesnt her child could be born underweight and with other health issues. 
Try to convince her to give up now for her own long term health.

I got pregnant and have smoked for a little over 10 years.  I wasnt really trying to get pregnant, and my husband smokes too.  When I found out I was pregnant, I slowed down to between 2-4 cigarettes a day from almost 1/2 a pack.  Needless to say, I miscarried at 10 weeks.  So now when I try to conceive in the upcoming months, my plan is to stop before trying... Hope this helps...

I completely agree with you that she needs to quit now. The effects of nicotine anyways will be present when she gets a baby. It may harm the baby even in the early stages. Smoking even reduces the chance of getting pregnant. Sorry i am not of much help coz i myself dont smoke... but tell her to quit for the baby's sake.. :) take care

My friend went to the doctor and got help to stop smoking before conceiving.  Smoke can cut off oxygen to the baby and is very dangerous.  Alot of woman can just give it up for the baby when they find out they are pregnant.  But damage can already be done, because you can be 5-6 weeks along before you find out your pregnant.  Maybe doing some research and maybe passing it on to your sister.  Because even second hand smoke affects the baby, and if her husband smokes also, he can harm the baby.  But they should really stop before trying.  It's hard to quit, but it needs to be done before a baby.

My mother and several aunts smoked while pregnant.  We all turned out OK.  It's not a death blow to the baby.



But it IS a risk factor for several problems, including low birth weight.  And this carries a whole raft of problems with it.

I suspect that your sister knows that she should quit, but she's afraid of how hard it will be, and she's afraid that she won't be able to do it while she's pregnant.  Your comments brought that fear out in the open.  Instead of harping on her about it, try supporting her.  Tell her that you're willing to help her quit now, by exercising with her, encouraging her to cut back until she can quit, and cheering for her when she makes progress.

i smoked with my first 2 kids, but was able to drastically cut down.  Quitting is very hard, and i was kicking myself the whole time.  Both were born healthy.  I am 8 weeks along with #3 and have almost been able to quit (down to 6 a day).  It is sooo hard to quit after smoking for so long. (12 years for me).  I give your sister credit for commiting to quit when she gets pregnant, although it may be easier for her now, because if she needs a prescription she cannot take them, or use the patch while pregnant.

Giving up does increase the chances of getting pregnant - ask anybody who has been through IVF. Ideally both she and her partner should give up while ttc as it has an impact on both the sperm and the egg.
I agree giving up isn't easy but if your sister thinks it will be easier once her hormones start changing she is fooling herself. I would say try to give up along with the tiredness, sickness and hormone changes of early pregnancy isn't going to make giving up any easier.

Research on this issue is pretty clear - smoking puts you at higher risk for miscarriage, preterm delivery, small birthweight, etc.

The sooner she stops, the healthier her pregnancy will be.



I think all smokers aren't stupid and ignorant to this fact, they just don't like other people getting preachy with them because they already know they shouldn't be doing it. Smoking is just a tough addiction to battle, quitting is not as easy as people (non-smokers who have never dealt with addiction) seem to think it is.

HOWEVER, despite the risks that research has detailed, in the grand scheme of things, there have been many women who have smoked throughout their pregnancy who have had healthy pregnancies and healthy babies. If she smokes it's not a given that bad things will happen. Some doctors even frown upon quitting cold turkey as the stress on the body can actually be just as bad for a pregnant woman and her child.

It's your sister's business, and you already said something to her about it once, so leave it at that. The ball is in her court, and she will do what she wants, whether anyone approves or not. Fighting with her over this issues is not what you want to do.



Good luck to you and her.

This is a touchy subject now days.  I had my kids over 15 years ago and I hate to admit now , but I did smoke then. ( my kids are all normal, I have on child in Gifted and Talented classes and the others are in Honor Roll )



Up until the 90's, there were still pregnant people smoking and it wasn't looking down upon as much because we didn't know the dangers.  I am not saying its OK to smoke.  If I had to do it over, I wouldn't do it.

it is her decision but being her sister you have a right of confronting her, the baby may become an asthmatic, it's not right, maybe you should have a meeting with your sister and some family members and tell her you all care for her and the baby and that she seriously needs to quit earlier than planned it will be easier or she should try taking nicotine patches and slowly start decreasing the amount of patches she uses. hope i helped good luck

Smoking isn't good for anybody. It isn't good for the smoker, it isn't good for those around the smoker and it most certainly isn't good for the unborn baby. In the end it is just selfish on their part. If you are going to smoke that is fine but it should be somebody's choice. The unborn baby didn't ask for a cigarette.



As for your sister it would be much easier if she was to gradually quit now before getting pregnant. It only makes sense that stopping now would be better than finding out she is pregnant and then trying to quit when she could have withdrawals which isn't good for the baby.

I quit smoking 3 months before I got pregnant.  I had a little scare and decided it was time to quit.  Its a ***** but over time its worth it.

I'll say this though, I honestly believe that quitting smoking was the reason I ended up pregnant to begin with.  A lot of women who gave up while TTC will say the same thing.  Plus her body will be healthier when she does become pregnant and she won't run the risk of smoking before she realizes she's pregnant.

I didn't have a problem concieving while I smoked. HOWEVER... I did smoke for the first four weeks of my pregnancy, not knowing that I was pregnant. I found out the fifth week that I was pregnant and quit immediately. It was hard but it will be worth it. I also went to the doctor and found out my baby's placenta had a tiny tear in it. I read that smoking can cause these tears and they have dangerous consequences, even miscarriage. The doctor told me I had nothing to do with the placental tear but I think I did and feel so bad about smoking but I didn't know. Soo..my OBGYN told me that since I have stopped smoking, the placental tear will heal itself as it continues to develope. My suggestion to your sister is to stop smoking now because she won't know right away when she is pregnant and the same thing may happen to her. I do not suggest smoking while pregnant because that is REALLY dangerous for her future baby. The sooner she stops smoking the better! Good luck! =)......and just fyi the smell of smoke makes me sick now! lol go figure

To Ghosthuntergirl: Yeah, they're fine...for now. That's the problem with ignorant people.

Anyway...

To answer your question: I am a smoker, BUT I did indeed quit smoking as soon as I found out that I was pregnant with both of my babies. This is your child. They don't ask to come into this world. They have a choice whether to smoke or not to. It's not fair to inhale all the chemicals that you so choose and send it directly to your unborn child via umbilical cord. My sister smoked during both of her entire pregnancies. I hated it. I couldn't believe that she would do that. Knowing how much I loved to smoke, but yet had the common sense and willpower to stop smoking. THEN she had these babies and breastfed them. Yeah, it was absolutely a disgrace. On one hand you're trying to give them the best head start in life with the most incredible nourishments that formula can't duplicate, yet she's smoking. Completely defeats the purpose.

I stopped as soon as I knew I was pregnant. Our son was unplanned, I would have stopped whilst trying to concieve too - however its up to the individual who is pregnant. I think its really important to be healthy during and after your pregnancy - theres a little life that depends on mummy and mummy needs to make good choices. Smoking was the best thing I have ever given up - for my sons sake too. Your sister will do what she feels is right........

I smoked until I found out that I was pregnant.  It is very difficult to quit.  I tried many times before I was pregnant, but I couldn't get it to happen.  The worst part for me was people bringing it up all the time.  I quit almost a year ago and people still bring it up all the time.  It doesn't help for people to constantly talk about it.  Your sister will quit when she is ready and that will probably be when she is pregnant.  It is something that she really has to want to do for herself and for her baby.  The biggest hurdle is the mental and emotional connection to smoking.  It is a powerful addiction.  Just let your sister know that when she decides to quit that you will be there for her and try not to push her. It is something that you can't force someone else to do.  I know if she is a responsible person she will make it work for 9 months.  Hopefully once she has that much time behind her, she will quit forever.  Tell her good luck!

I had seven children, I smoked with six of them, and went off them with one while I was pregnant because it made me sick.  And out of all my children the one I didnt smoke with was put on inhalers from one years of age, which now that she is ten dosent need any more. I stayed off them for near enough three years, but now have got hooked on them again.  And am still trying to give them up.

But I have been a smoker for many years and did try to go off them, even before I was pregnant, but it is hard.  Especially when you really want to.....

I do regret not being able to quit while I was pregnant, I didnt even think of quitting before I was pregnant because they were all surprises if you know what I mean, but it would be better if she could quit, but if she is finding it hard, she will need all the support she can get, from everyone, and it will of course be her decision.

But stick by her, whatever her decision will be.

I didn't quit smoking until my pregnancy was confirmed by a doctor. My husband and I conceived at the end of December, we weren't trying to though. I began feeling syptoms around the second week of January. I had taken like 5 different over the counter pregnancy tests which all came out positive. All this time, I had been smoking. I was smoking about 3-4 cigarettes a day, no more than 6 in one day. The first week of February, I went to my doctor and my pregnancy was confirmed. At the time, I was a bit overwhelmed and smoked a cigarette when I got home.



I have not smoked a cigarette since then. I'm about 33wks pregnant right now. I chose to stop smoking cigarettes because I felt that all the chemicals in cigarettes would be dangerous for my baby. In addition to what my doctor told me the possible result could be, I found numerous articles on the internet that confirmed all he told me.



On the one hand, I can understand your sister's reluctance to quit right now. She's probably very aware of the fact that conception may not happen right away, possibly for years, and she doesn't want to stop if there's no immediate reason. If your sister is at all a responsible person, I'm sure she'll stop smoking while pregnant. It won't be easy and she'll need a lot of encouragement- not bashing. Even though she doesn't feel an immediate need to quit, I'm sure that she'll do what's best for her baby. Most moms do. Even if she continues smoking after she has the baby, while she's pregnant, she'll probably quit. I did and it wasn't at all difficult.

As you will know, it isn't good to smoke cigarettes so smoking whilst pregnant is almost stupid in my opinion, no offense.



If you want the best for your sister, tell her to keep fit and healthy, either by exercising or eating healthly, and of course to quit smoking.



Also just think about how much she will be saving, she could use that money to buy things for the baby when it arrives.

I smoked for 10 years and quit cold turkey the day I found out I was pregnant with my first child and never picked up another cigarette again (it's been 7 years).  It was easy for me and it can be done.  Also, chances are just the smell of smoke will be enough to nauseate her when she finally does become pregnant.  If you're gonna quit, the easiest time in the world will be in your first trimester because of smells and morning sickness.  All the best to her!!

I smoked during all 3 of my pregnancies, and I have 3 big and healthy babies. The Dr. suggested I cutback from my pack and a half a day habit, to something smaller. So I cutback to 5-7 cigarettes a day. Cold turkey could stress you out, and that's not good for the baby. You can ween yourself off, but don't go cold turkey.

Hip pain at 32 weeks??



Last night I had a sharp pain to the inside of my left hip bone - as though I'd pulled a muscle.  It came in waves of pain, but I didn't take painkillers for it. It only went if I laid on my left. If I laid on my back or right it hurt.

Any ideas?



</question>



<additional details>



I'm not sat in a position where it bothers me. But I know that if I were to shift position or lie down, then it would.



Baby's been shifting around a lot yesterday - I've had various part of her body in my ribs, and what I can only describe as what feels like Baby punching through jelly down below.

at that far along the baby starts to lay on you in ways that can pinch nerves. its usually nothing to be worried about. ask your doctor about what you can do to relieve the pain or to avoid it. they may prescribe some safe drugs, or exercises or other things to relieve the pain.

if its more toward the front, probably round ligament pain.  harmless but uncomfortable.  if more toward your back on the inside, could be your kidney.  could be just how the baby was positioned at the time.  is it still hurting?  getting worse?  are you running a fever? was your belly getting tight while this was happening? (might be contractions) best to monitor it and if still bothering you today, see or call your doc.

It is the ligaments in your hips stretching to accommodate the upcoming arrival of your baby. Do not take pain medication, sitting on an exercise ball and walking will help relieve the pain.

JNS just about says it all.



There are so many different pressure points baby is laying on.  You also have ligaments that are stretching and getting tired.  When you lay on your right side or back, it is stretching them farther than they want to go...so they tell you so by the pain.  If you don't have a workout ball, try squatting a little, or try some pelvic tilts.



Good luck!

tell her you love her, give her kisses and hugs "just because"
pay attention to her, and everything she says.
also, tell her shes beautiful whenever you see her looking in the mirror, or at night before falling asleep :)
just let her know through little signs that you have not lost interest in her since she had the baby.
I think all women get insecure while pregnant and after birth. Im pregnant and always ask my boyfriend if he still thinks im attractive, its a huge change for us 
just let her know your there, and love her no matter what

aww!  You are a sweet husband!  why don't you send her out on a day of pampering?  Nails, hair and new clothes.  Maybe a day at the spa too.



Keep telling her she is beautiful and help her out too with stuff around the house and the baby.

Congratulations on your new baby

Make her dinner and do chores around the house.
Tell her you love her every single day and how beautiful she is.

Be supportive of her. When she tells you she is fat and isn't feeling attractive, reassure her that you still love her. When/if she wants to diet or try crazy things to get thin and inshape again remeber that she isn't just doing it for herself, she thinks she's doing it for you too. It's really hard to feel good once you've had a baby. If this is the 1st and she was in pretty good shape before she got pregnant, in my opoion, it's easier to get a lot closer to that point. After my 1st I was back into pre baby clothes with in 2 months, after the 2nd one however, and it's been almost a year, I'm still sitting at the weight I was when I came home from the hospital. I go through bouts of depression where I feel fat and unattractive. It's not easy on us and we make it that much harder on you. The fact that you are on here asking for advices shows alot. Tell her you love her, do things that you did before she got pregnant, remember the the little things-like just because flowers and cards, tell her you find her attractive. Most of all show her that she is still number one and always will be. She will thank you and even though she'll probably bursh it off, she won't forget what you said or did, even though she probably won't agree with you.

Bring her flowers and make her feel special. After having a baby your confidence in your body is lower, it definately doesn't look the way you want it to. You need to remind her that you love her and that she carried your baby which makes her more beautiful than any other woman in your eyes. Keep telling her she is beautiful and it will sink it.
Just be patient. It is hard to have your body taken over by a baby and look so different.

hi
you are sweet and i'll bet this will pass for your wife as you seem so keen to support and encourage her. 
if she has recently given birth i would think it is mostly down to the hormones - speak to the midwife, she will be more than happy to talk to you about it, it may be the "babyblues" a sweet name, not such a sweet experience.



remember though, the only person who can convince your wife to be happy with herself, is her.. i would suggest you be as normal as possible with her, maybe see if she'd like a day at the spa - or a session at least, massage or hairdressers, whilst you care for junior ...... you could go with her and simply take baby for a walk whilst she's being done!



also, just because you think she looks great does not mean that she feels it!.. try having a laugh & joke to lift her spirits rather than focusing on how lovely she looks, especially if she feels horrible!
hth a bit & good luck

If you have family, have the family take the baby, just for a few hours. Take her to get her hair done, pedicure, manicure, message, etc. Make her feel beautiful. And even more important, "go with her". By go with her, i mean, get it done with her. I think she would be amused to see you getting your feet done and painted!!! :)  Or to see you get your hair done!  Anything that would make her laugh and put a smile on her face. I think she would see that you're willing to do whatever you can and she'll appreciate it.

Nope, sorry hun, but you can't take a thing to ease the discomfort.  You can spend some time with your head over a basin of hot water and take in the steam and then get yourself off to your bed and REST.  If however this cold poses a risk to your health (besides all that comes with a head cold), then speak to your Dr/Midwife.

paracetamol is ok to take. i think there are a lot of different opinions on medicins to relieve the sinus pressure. i'd ask your doctor about that one. in the meantime, you can use saline solution. either just mix salt and water and spray up your nose or you can buy it from a pharmacy.

Becareful before you take anything don't take more then directed on the package either.  I hope you feel better

All I kept doing was steaming my head with vick vapour rub and oldbas oil this helped with the sinus pressure you can take losenges I was taking ricolas herbal ones which help loads. And lots of honey and lemon drinks helped my chest.

Why are the midwife/doc sending me for a scan @36 weeks, am i worrying for nothing?



I am under the doc and midwife at the hospital instead of my local midwife as my iron level has been dropping (was 9.1 then 8.7 on iron tabs)

i went to see them yesterday and she said i mesured 36 weeks correctly last week but this week i only measured 35 weeks (i am 36+4days)

why are they sending me for a scan? they said it was to check the babys size and there is nothing to worry about as different people would measure me different

if thats the case why not let the doc who was in the room at the time measure me too why send me for a scan

i have spoken to friends and family and they said its normal to sometimes be 1 cm out so why are they scanning me im very worried there is something they are not telling me 
please help me cause i cant stop thinking theres something wrong

heard the heartbeat etc all was ok but they have also given me a form to fill in everyday to count babys movements this seems very strange to me

It is common and no worry for you to measure plus or minus 2 weeks from how far along you are, because every baby will develop differently. Plus like you said they mentioned, different people will measure differently. Measuring is not at all perfectly accurate anyways. There are a lot of reasons why you should not even worry about this. They do scans now and then just to double check that everything is okay, but not necessarily because things aren't okay. They just want to confirm that all is as it should be. I had an extra ultrasound at 31 weeks because they thought I was measuring 3 weeks ahead (so 34 instead of 31). They wanted to make sure the baby didn't have any abnormalities and they wanted to make sure I didn't have too much amniotic fluid, as that can signal a problem. Turned out everything was just fine, and the ultrasound showed the baby only actually being about 1.5 weeks ahead - still bigger, but within that 2 week range. And since all was well, even if she had been measuring 3 weeks bigger, it would just have meant I was having a bigger baby and they probably would have moved my due date back a little bit.

My point is, you should try not to worry because the overwhelming chance is that things are just fine! I know it is hard not to worry, but do your best. The scan is just a precaution :-)

Congrats and good luck!

firstly, everyone does measure differently and one person can measure  you 35cm and another 38cm. They likely just want ot make sure of the growth as a safety precaution rather than anything else. 
Also, you should be feeling around 10 movements from the baby in a 24hour period. If you had mentioned reduced movements or they were seriosly worried about the baby you would have been sent for a ctg trace of the baby straight away. 
Try not to panic and talk to your midwife about your fears. That is what she is there for. use her

To check that the baby is not sitting breach (feet down and head at the top), and possibly to check if the baby's head has "engaged" (moved down into the pelvis) yet.  Don't worry it's perfectly normal.

They can also send you for a scan to check the amount of amniotic fluid as towards the end of pregnancy the amount reduces.

Try not to worry!!!

DONT STRESS... its not doing you or your baby any good.



I had a scan at 36 wks too and that was because he was breach. but then he also wouldnt' engage anything.. he was classed as an 'unstable lie' he would swim around to his hearts content.. prob with that is if my water broke the chord would slip through .. contract.. and cut circulation off to him prematurely.. SO that was my dilemas with that.. it all worked out in the end.. i had my birthing story to carry on for yrs.. 
Now with your iron levels dropping thats ok.. your body will go up and down on that scale depending on the day you have had and the meals you had prior to each test. I was at 4 at one point and had a healthy baby boy.. 9lbs.. and early!! i was a little relieved that i had a c section as his head was quite large too lol.. (hated the idea at the time and was really angry at the docs for making me have one.. but i got over it as soon as i saw his sweet face)
Measurements are always going to be out a little.. dont panic your family is right. think about when your not pregnant your belly changes size all the time.. from bloated feeling to skinny when you haven't had enough water or you had too much water and you puff up.. you cant help that its a natural thing your body does when it wants to.. same happens when you have a baby.  You may find next week you go back and your belly is 3 times as big as its suppose to be for 37wks because the baby took on more because he/she was a little more hungrier this week.  same thing happens after child birth.. some weeks they pack on the weight some times they wake longer than normal and work it off.. 
Heart beat was fine - thats the main thing..
it has been a bit more of a 'cover their ***' thing to get mothers to monitor baby's movements. its good for you to be aware of them too but is not something to scare you in particular. a lot of women i know since i had my son 9yrs ago have been told to monitor movements. that also sends them scared too but if you arent aware of this and you baby does stop moving and you carry on then you could end up worse for wear.  A lady i knew who was due 2 wks before had a still born at 39 wks as she wasn't aware to monitor movements.. she nearly died herself. 
The dr did NOT intend to scare you in particular. its something they do now.. so please calm down and just enjoy the last few wks before your life is turned upside down!! (in a good way)

Oh.. i just remembered.. did they do a pelvic exam on you? they may be monitoring how big you baby is to see if you will be able to have a vaginal birth.. if bub is big for your size they may be calling in back up! Don't panic on this one.. its good for them to know if they need an extra nurse or two to help with your delivery. 
Remember every birth is different and no mater how it happens it is YOUR story to tell and it will be unique and memorable and one of the most talked about things you will ever do.. 
Take care.

i got sent for a scan at 38 weeks because i was measuring 34 weeks as if i was shrinking because i was measuring fine until then i was induced on the same day just to be on the safe side.

i was a house with my first, often people asked how many 2 or 3 and i always replied only 1,

my gosh if the 2 survived i wouldnt be able to get through the door,

i went from a 10/ 12 to a 18 / 20 my bump was massive

i slept alot or tried to anyway, bathed most of day as i got bad pains due to the size of me



i could barely walk but just got on with it, as i had to often move from bnb 2 bnb nearly each day until i was over due and on the night i moved in i dropped



oh the relief it felt great to have the bump gone.

i dropped down to 14/16 after birth and pretty much stayed around that going as low as 12/14 at times.

but those days i was tired always and wished the days by as i was in pain and had housing issues it was crazy and i was only 17, i had him just a few days after my 18th b day and funny enough the second just days before my 20th

second was easier and smaller but the bump still fairly large,



they probably call you in for another scan and see what the dates are or see how well the baby  is developed or if baby needs more time or is baby stressed.

good luck anyway relax when you can as it is not easy to when they are here, rest as much as possible as the early mornings and late night calls will start.

congrats too sweetie xxx

My belly has just started to poke out today where everyone has noticed and said something. I have to go look for maternity pants and shirts today, and I'm not coping with that too well. But I am glad that I look more pregnant then chubby. But I don't know how I am going to handle getting bigger then what I am now, I've never had a big stomache before. Good luck to you, and I hope you get your baby soon.

Due to my severe adema which is excess swelling of the body and fluid retention I was massive - I put on 6 stone, 3 of which was fluid, 1 stone was baby, amniotic fluid and placenta and 2 as a general gain. I spent the last days doing as much housework as I could to help have less to do when you get home. I also cooked meals and froze them so we had home made ready meals ready for when I got home to - they were a god send! my spare time was spent on the net and reading a few books. You really dont have long to go and your classed as full term anyway which is anything over 37 weeks so if your fed up - here's some labour vibes for ya ;-)

Well, the decision is really up to you. You don't sound like your ready. Just be prepared, when you get an abortion you will feel guilty for a while and it is very painful to have an abortion. It is really up to you though. Good luck! And play it safe next time you have sex!

So, if we feel that you should give the baby up for adoption or if we feel that abortion is wrong (a sin) then we shouldn't answer you question? So, that leaves only the people that think you should get an abortion. I thought that you were DESPERATE for help? Sounds like to me that you just want people to tell you to kill your kid. Sorry, can't do that. Good luck with this one.

Hun, only you and your partner can decide on this. I had my first at 23, and my partner was not working, but he found a job and made it work.
Its good to see though that you are wanting a good life for your baby.
Accidents do happen, so unfortunately we have to be extra careful when having sex.
I do wish you the best of luck with your decision and hope all works out.

This kind of thing is important, to be honest you should be talking this over with family and close friends, but from the looks of things you should terminate, you will always regret wanting to do something with your life and having a baby will hinder them and will be too costly.  I'm not being totally pro-abortion, but it's only a small foetus at the moment and I don't think attachments can be made.  The only logical option would be to abort unless you deeply want a child.

Honey, just because you have a baby doesn't mean you won't get a chance at the future you want. I'm 19. I turned 19 when I was 5 months pregnant. I had to put down school, to resume after. I know that I'll do it willingly because I loved my daughter since i conceived her. Life is what you make of it, if you don't want to end up in a crummy apartment making ends meet, don't. You don't have to. All you need is a little will power, and I think you've got it. Good luck.

Honestly, you may not think you're ready, but once a baby is born, you mature very quickly. I was 18 when I first got pregnant, 19 when he was born. I was living with my fiance at the time, but, we were hardly making ends meet, bills were always late, etc. Shortly before he was born, the parenting instinct kicked in and we not only got back on our feet, but, we're doing pretty well for ourselves. Schooling isn't that big of a deal, parents go for schooling all the time, even with young children. I'm currently a "stay at home mom" (ie, unemployed by choice) and pregnant with our second (planned). I'm hoping to go for nursing school after the second baby is born, and my husband (yeah, we married three weeks after our son was born) is working a "factory job" making a nice pay.
I've heard of people who've had abortions who regret it so much later down the line. Some have even had accidents where they weren't able to have children later. In the end, it's your decision, but, as a young mother myself, I can tell you that our son made our miserable lives blossom into something worth living.

Hi. I'm also 19 and I have a 3 year old. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and know what you want to do with your life. I understand your fear of the poorer lifestyle, working dead end jobs to just barely pay the bills. It's understandable. I am not an expert in anything like this, but when I was 14 I got pregnant, and I had an abortion at 12 weeks. I knew for a fact that I was NOT ready to be a mother, I couldn't even take care of myself. You sound like if need be, you could take care of a child, despite your financial situation. I think you and your boyfriend should sit down and really talk about this, it'll change both of your lives, no matter what decision you make. If you feel that it would be best for the abortion, than you should do it. If you honestly feel that it would be better off without continuing the pregnancy, then go make your appointment, before it's too late. Making the decision will no doubt be very hard, to this day I still think about what i'v'e done, and how my life is for the better now. I know it's a sin against god to get an abortion, but I am not saying that and I am not judging you. Just do what is in YOUR best interest and remember that you will have to deal with this decision for the rest of your life.

I hope I helped a little bit.

That's a brave ? to ask on here! But the decision is yours and yours alone. But remember there is a lot of help and support out there in terms of careers advice and childcare support. and I'm sure your parents won't disown you once they get over the shock, I expect you will be pleasantly surprised at their reaction especially if you have a plan.
 I had a baby at nineteen and I felt exactly the same way, but things have a way of working out for the best. Good luck xxx

At the end of the day it's up to you.  There's no reason at all why you'd end up in a 'dumpy little apartment' if your boyfriend works and you claim correct benefits.  If your partner works full time you should be able to afford a private rented house, even on minimum wage.



If it's just the finances you're worried about, then it'll be fine. Poor people have babies all the time, and you'll be financially better off than most if the father works, as you'll be sharing the rent, bills etc.

sounds to me you know what you want to do.  its one of the hardest decisions you will ever have to make.  if you decide to terminate the pregnancy, you are doing what you feel is best for your situation.  do not be too hard on yourself, or concern yourself with 'what people would think'.  only you and your bf have to live with your decision.  termination of pregnancy is pretty common, very safe, and an acceptable option in your case.



on the other hand, your parents may surprise you.  most are shocked at first, but quickly rally to support their pregnant daughter.



whichever you choose, stay true to yourself.

I suggest you start checking into the actual act of abortion...make sure you fully understand what you are thinking of doing!  Are you aware of what procedures there are and what it does to the baby? Are you aware of what it can do to you, physically and mentally?



The reason I say this is not because I believe in abortion...I don't.



HOWEVER, this is your decision.  I just don't want you to be like a friend of mine, do it, and regret it forever.  Once done, it's done, no going back!
I know that you say that your boyfriend loves you and supports you, but how does he really feel about if you abort it?  He may say it, but be aware how he, and your family, may feel about it later!

Good luck...and think more than twice about what you want to do!

Abortion is not as bad as some people make it out to be. If you are not in a position to give your child a good life, don't have it. Wait until you can provide for a child. If you keep it, you may be resent your boyfriend and your child. That is no way to bring up a baby. I had an abortion when I was 21. I don't regret it for a minute. There was no way that I could have been a good mother at that point in my life. It was the best decision I ever made. I got my partying and traveling out of the way, I found a great man and now I'm 29 and a happy mom of a beautiful baby girl.

I've been in the same situation you're in right now. It's really hard trying to think things through cause everyone is giving you their point of view and you dont really have the time to sit down and actually sort out your thoughts on what you want to do,
I stopped listening to everyone around me including my family and made my owne decisison, since this would inpact me more then anyone else. And I had the abortion done. I'm glad that I did because after the procedure up until years later me and my boyfriend at the time, our relationship was never the same, and I mean in a bad way. 
He hever wanted to talk about it when I did thinking maybe I made a miskake about it... and so on. Now, after bring together for 4 years  We're broken up, I think there was a lot of difffrence's wish us and now I can only think god I made the decisison to go through with the Abortion and break it off with me. 
7 years later, I've found the man of my dreams, we're engaged and a beautiful baby who's about to turn 8 months old in just a few days,



I hope this helps. Email me someone and let me know. 
Take care!

I find this a very hard question to answer.  I had an abortion when I was 19... it doesn't hurt, as others have said, but it is a very upsetting experience, obviously.  At ten weeks you need to make your decision fast, because the further on you are, the more unpaletable the decision gets (in my opinion).

You do sound like you want people to tell you it's ok to get an abortion - only you can decide that.  On a personal view I can say that I've never doubted that I made the right decision - I would have ended up another single Mum statistic in a grotty flat in some city.  The child wouold have no future and neither would I.  On the flip side I look at my two beautiful boys now and constantly wonder what my first child would have been like.  I know I couldn't do it again, now I'm married and in a lovely house and village we would just have to cope if I fell pregnant again, but at 19... I think making the decision to terminate for both your sakes is actually a very brave and sensible decision to make.

I  am very pro choice, and that why i not going to tell you what to do! I will not judge you. However; I think you need to go to plan parenthood.. I am not telling you to have an abortion I just giving you the facts! The choice is yours. i got this off their website. I hope this helps! 
Abortion



Abortion is a safe and legal way for women to choose to end pregnancy. There are two kinds of abortion in the U.S. — abortion procedures and the abortion pill. 
Abortions are very common. In fact, more than 1 in 3 women in the U.S. have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old.



If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption.



Only you can decide what is best for you. But we are here to help. A staff member at your local Planned Parenthood health center can discuss abortion and all of your options with you and help you find the services you need.

Having a baby will not put a stop to your future...you just have to work twice as hard to get where you are going. Look...I had my first baby when I was 16...I dropped out of school and realized later it was a mistake...I WENT BACK...and finished. Right now I have three kids and one on the way...I am on my way to school for nursing...right now I am a C.N.A. at a hospital and I'm taking it all the way. I have lived in little crummy apartments and lived paycheck to paycheck...sure it's not fun but I believe it builds character and makes you stronger. There is no reason to have an abortion for your mistake...you need to be a woman and carry thru with it...especiallly if you want to keep your bf...he want the baby do you think he will forgive you if you kill it? Look...I've gotten where I am going and I am proof it can be done...you just have to prove you want it and fight for it...you will get there but killing your baby is the wrong answer. Good luck....

Your b/f loves you and wants you to keep the baby......so keep it.
You are both young but thats an advantage.  After being together so long you would probably end up marrying and having kids anyway so whats your problem?
You will manage, everyone does, as for your future with a bit of organisation and hard work you can be anything you want.
Your parents may have a hissy fit to start with but they will come round and love the baby too and be wonderful babysitters while your off to college or whatever.
keep it, its not like your REALLY young - like 14/15yrs

i was 19 when i got pregnant.  got married the day after i turned 20  cuz we "loved eachother"  long story short, he cheated and we arent together now.  I am 24 now..turning 25  in a couple weeks  and I have a 4 yr old son.  My sons father provides no financial help....thats a whole other story.  I work a good job, i drive my own car ( a 2007 to boot) and live on my own.  And by the way I never went to college, theres no reason that you would end up in a dumpy apartment working a suck *** job.  if you want something, go out and get it.  The best advice I can give you though is that if you are going to keep this baby, plan as if you are going to take care of it yourself because there are NO GUARANTEES!!  especially when it comes to men.  your parents wont disown you, its their grandchild..they will love you and that baby if you decide to keep it.,  My mom freaked when i told her i was pregnant  and told me i should have an abortion.  I didnt  and my son has brought more joy to my family than all of us put together  and he is the reason my grandmother survived almost dying a few years ago..he brightens all of our lives on a daily basis!  Adoption..no way. I agree with you, there is no way i could bring a baby to term and then hand it over to someone else, kudos to anyone who does.  You need to decide whats right for YOU..not your family, not your childs father.  they can support you but ultimately it is YOUR decision.  My friend just had her third abortion about a month ago  and seriously regrets it now, wishing she kept the baby. If you decide thats right for you, thats what YOU decide..none of us can decide for you

You cannot support this child.  Don't bring it into this world, I'm sure you feel bad but you are not killing anything.  Abortion is the answer.  In the adoption home, it might be even worse than here, and if you aren't adopted by 18, you're kicked out onto the streets. Abortion.  It's okay, hun.

Hi, Oh dear what a dilemma, you have to think (which you have all day every day)  having an abortion could affect you in later life, also it could affect your relationship with your boyfriend, as he wants to keep the baby.  You say your family will disown you, it's always a shock when an unexpected pregnancy occurs, i was very shocked when my daughter told me she was pregnant, she had just started teaching and had her whole future in front of her, my grandaughter was born last December she is the joy of our lives, my daughter still has her future in front of her and has continued teaching. You can continue your life even after having a child, just dont make the mistake of thinking oh i will do it next year. I really hope that your family support you, and guide you to make the right choice.

Pregnant and feel so bad



Hi. I'm 13 weeks pregnant and feel like the ugliest person on earth. I am so tired and don't know how much longer I can go on like this. The nausea gets me in the afternoon and is worse in the evening. Having a blood test for iron tomorrow. I really want to do some exercise but just feel so sick. I feel fat and ugly and just so alone. My man tries to understand but he obviously can't sympathise with what I am going through. I am happy that I am pregnant and can't wait for my little fella to come into the world. I am blessed truly. People keep saying "that's great" and "congrats" but I don't feel worth of it because I feel so yuck. Anyone understand this? Anyone got any tips?

I felt the same way during my pregnancy. Take a day off and do stuff for yourself. Maybe go out with a girlfriend and get manicures and pedicures (just make sure they have all their windows and doors open so your not breathing in all that bad smell) Go get a cute pg outfit. Just do something fun. Do a project for the little one.

Dont complain too much though.... people get annoyed. This is what pg is and what is expected when getting pg. Hopefully you will have a healthy living baby at the end of this and it will all be worth it.

Pregnancy can be really hard. I hated being pregnant because I felt terrible the whole time (I still did it 4 times anyway lol) Dont beat yourself up some of us are more sensitive to the hormones than others. You will probably start feeling better soon now that you are through the first trimester. Get plenty of rest and dont push yourself to exercise if you dont feel up to it.  Also, a pregnant woman is beautiful please dont feel ugly. Your body is growing another human being that is an awesome thing.

Your thoughts are all out of whack because you are pregnant.  Don't worry about it too much.  Once you give birth to your little you, you will be so grateful to the Lord that the both of you are alive and healthy, you won't even consider your own feelings.  Trust me!  Just eat healthy things and drink lots of water.  Your baby is more important than your own doubts and worries.  And remember, your baby is depending on you!  Good luck.

I understand how you feel. I was sick through the first half of my pregnancy. I found that avoiding bad smells and eating small amounts of bland food about every 2 hours helped. At first, I felt like I could not eat anything at all then I discovered cheese is my friend. I also had to stay indoors all the time because I could not stand the smell of exhaust fumes. Try not to get down on yourself about your appearance. Soon you will be showing and you get to buy cute maternity clothes. I felt fat in the beginning too. Then when my belly stuck out, I felt so cute.
You can get a big exercise ball to bounce and stretch on. That might help with the exercise part.
Good luck!

2. PAMPER yourself and remember your body is going through some amazing changes at the moment! If this is your first baby this is probably why you feel so rubbish....

Your body is adjusting to accommodate another human being! I know it sounds crazy but TRY to enjoy the time becuase it will go so fast. And it will be so worth it. Good luck! :)

I get exactly what youre saying.. I didn't feel like you do until about 15 weeks or so. I am 19 wks now and I feel disgusting. Isn't it "weird" how guys do not understand at all?! My fiance all of a sudden wants me to wear skimpy lingerie once in a while and Im like "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE IN THE MIRROR?!" Dont worry sweetie, I think almost all pregnant women feel this way at one point.. its just a combination of our hormones, emotions, and the way our body is constantly changing (and its not getting any smaller, lol).. Its normal...  As of late I have been getting down about this a lot - as I have gotten much more pregnant looking in the past couple weeks and I feel as if I am puting on weight in places I dont want to..I just look at my tummy and think that it is all for him/her and it will all be worth it.. but to be honest - nothing makes those feelings go away... Just time..

Good luck

one thing my doctor has told me is not every woman enjoys being pregnant and not to feel guilty if you dont like it! for me, i am 31 weeks and seriously counting down the days until its over! and yes i am very greatful and blessed i am having a baby, but to some people being pregnant is just not fun!

I have had severe vomiting from 7 weeks and still have it! and believe me you will feel more uncomfortable as time goes on.

But when times get tough for me, i go into my baby girls nursery and sit in there and look at her things and remind myself what i am doing this for! it works well!



Plus i have a wonderful husband who everyday tells me everyday i look beautiful  even though i think i look like crap! haha

My wife wants to answer this one for you (she is 19 weeks pregnant). Here's what she says:
I have felt this way with each of my pregnancies. Its not just physical - its hormonal, so it's really hard to just "get up out of the slump". But for most women, including myself, the second trimester is easier. In the next few weeks, you should get your energy and vitality back (just don't forget to rest!) and the nausea *should* subside. Try ginger for nausea, although not very tasty, they work pretty good for temporary relief. (Ginger Altoids are good.) Also peppermint tea, iced or hot.

I hope some of this helps. Getting pregnancy or parenting magazines might help give encouragement on the hard days also.



Wishing you well on your journey to motherhood...

Question about first ultrasound?



I'm not pregnant myself, but I'm writing a story about a 19 year old girl who is. I originally thought that the first ultrasound was at 12 weeks, so I wrote it into the story that way.



Now I've heard that the first should be at 8 weeks. Is it completely unrealistic if I keep the 12 weeks ultrasound as her first?

Btw, any other things that I should add into that part of the story, feel free to give me input :)

In my first pregnancy, i had bleeding, so i needed an ultrasound. It turned out to be a miscarriage.

In my second pregnancy, they tried timing it for 12 weeks, but i turned out to be 11 weeks, and i needed to go back.

My third pregnancy, i had cramping and pains, so i needed an ultrasound to make sure it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy. That was at 9 weeks, 6 days.



It depends on your history, and what doctor you have. You're the one paying for the ultrasound, so you get to say if you want one at 8 weeks or not.

The only reason they have one at 8 weeks, is so they can be sure when you're 12 weeks, because there's only a small window that you can have the down syndrome test done. If you miss that, you don't get it back, and it's between 11-13 weeks.

It's not unrealistic to keep writing your story that way. I know of people that haven't had one until 19 weeks.



You could write the first ultrasound as an accident that it was so late. Maybe she thought she wasn't as far along. 
Not many women have morning sickness, and a few have regular bleeding for no apparent reason. You could try writing that into your story too.

Good luck.

It really depends on your doctor. Some drs will only do one ultra sound the whole pregnancy, to determine a more accurate due date and make sure the baby is growing accordingly. That ultra sound is done at the 12 week mark, so you are correct. Some drs however, will do an ultra sound once a month to check on baby or if you are high risk they do that...but not all do that because ultra sounds are expensive.

My wife and I have two girls that are 17 months apart, which is very close to what your children would be if you are pregnant.  We were not expecting our second, but have been extremely happy with the experience.  Our kids are great companions and we found that taking care of two that were close to the same age seemed easier than we think it would have been if they were further apart and needing very different types of care.  Either way, you sound like the kind of person that will do a terrific job whether raising one or two at a time.  Good luck!

Yes there is in fact a pill you can take if it has been less than 8 weeks from your last period, it is called a medical abortion. It is taken by 2 pills within 3 days of each other. Here is some information that might be useful.



Best of luck!

Medical Abortion with Mifepristone and Misoprostol
What is the Medical Abortion?

Medical Abortion (brand name Mifeprex) is a form of early abortion caused by the combination of two medications, mifepristone and misoprostol that is an option for women who are 8 weeks pregnant or less. Also known as RU486 or medication abortion.



During the first appointment at the clinic you receive the mifepristone pill to take orally. Then 24 to 72 hours later, in the privacy of your own home, you take the the second medication, misoprostol. Misoprostol causes contractions resulting in a miscarriage. When used in combination, mifepristone and misoprostol are 95-97% effective within two weeks. Mifepristone and misoprostol are FDA approved.

How Does It Work?

Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone needed to maintain the pregnancy. Because this hormone is blocked, the uterine lining begins to shed, the cervix begins to soften and bleeding may occur. With the later addition of the second medication, misoprostol, the uterus contracts and the pregnancy is usually expelled within 6 to 8 hours.



Because the woman chooses when she takes the second medication within the time frame of 24 to 72 hours after the first medication, she has some control over the timing of when she expels the pregnancy and experiences the side effects of bleeding and cramping. Some women choose the Medical Abortion because of the privacy it offers. Some women feel empowered by taking an active role in the process.

Use

At your first appointment at the clinic, an ultrasound is performed to confirm you are less than 8 weeks pregnant. You then speak with an experienced counselor who explains how mifepristone and misoprostol work and makes sure you get answers to all of your questions. Your health history is carefully reviewed and if you meet the criteria, the doctor will give you the mifepristone to take orally. You are also given one bottle containing four tablets of misoprostol to be used 24 to 72 hours after taking mifepristone. If this first dosage fails to induce a miscarriage, please call the clinic to receive instructions on using your back-up misoprostol tablets.

What To Expect

Upon taking mifepristone at the clinic you may begin to bleed. As each woman's body is different, bleeding varies from woman to woman. Some may experience light bleeding much like spotting towards the end of a menstrual period. Others have heavier bleeding like their regular menstrual period, or like a heavy period. Some women do not experience any bleeding until taking the misoprostol.

Upon taking the second medication misoprostol tablet, cramping, bleeding, and clotting may begin as soon as 20 minutes. Within the next 6 to 8 hours, most women will miscarry. Cramping may come in waves with increasing and decreasing intensity. You can expect bleeding heavier than a menstrual period with large clots. During this time, you will pass the embryo although you may not see it since it is very small. The amount of bleeding when using the Medical Abortion is greater than with aspiration abortion.



Aftercare

A follow-up exam is scheduled for two weeks later to make sure the process is complete. If you have not yet miscarried, we will perform a aspiration abortion. A very small percentage (5%) of women do not pass the pregnancy tissue and need a suction procedure to complete the process.

Side Effects

Most of the side effects when using this early abortion option are caused by the second medication, misoprostol. Side-effects may include heavy bleeding, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and heavy cramping.



Risks

Vaginal bleeding with medical abortion could be extremely heavy. In rare situations it could require a aspiration abortion and very rarely, a blood transfusion. You will be given our 24-hour hotline number to call if you have any problems. Medical staff are on call at all times to answer your medical questions and concerns.

If pregnancy is continued after taking these medications, there is a high risk of fetal deformities.

Criteria

Abortion Medication may be an option if you:

Are less than 8 weeks since your last menstrual period. 
Are willing and able to give informed consent. 
Have the support you need such as access to reliable transportation and ability to communicate with the clinic by telephone. 
Live no more than 2 hours away from emergency medical care (a hospital). 
Are able to come back to the clinic for 1 to 3 follow-up appointments. 
Agree to have a surgical abortion if the misoprostol does not induce termination. 
Your Health

Due to the risk of serious health problems, mifepristone and misoprostol may not be recommended if you:

Have had a blood clotting problem or are taking anticoagulant medicine. 
Have severe anemia. 
Have adrenal failure. 
Are taking long-term systemic corticosteroids. 
May have an ectopic pregnancy. 
Have a mass in the tubes or ovaries. 
Have inherited porphyria. 
Have an allergy to mifepristone, misoprostol or other prostaglandin medicine. 
Have severe diarrhea. 
Future Fertility

According to studies of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the National Abortion Federation, there are no known long term risks associated with using mifepristone and misoprostol. Therefore, women may pursue another pregnancy whenever they feel the time is right after having a Medical Abortion.

Other Options For Early Abortion

If you are at least 6 weeks by ultrasound, you can choose to have a surgical abortion, in which the cervix is dilated and suction aspiration is used to remove the tiny pregnancy.

Another option may be a chemical or medical abortion using Methotrexate. Ask at the clinic about your particular circumstances.

No Confusion

Do not confuse Medical Abortion with the "Morning After" Emergency Contraception Pills (brand name Plan B). They are completely different medications taken for different purposes.

yes a medical abortion  is done with 2 sets of pills early on in pregnancy.  It will induce miscarriage and will feel like a really painful period.



I just had a medical abortion 2 weeks ago and it was painful and I bled really heavily but after a few days I felt much  better.  I was 8 weeks along  which is kind of late, so the earlier you do it the better.



Good luck!

Yes, if you have a termination at a very early stage, you can have a pill which will cause an abortion.  You will be supervised by a nurse.  If you are pregnant you should go to your family planning clinic or doctor to discuss your options and birth control

Aaaaakkkk My friend had that pill and she had BAD cramps and BAD diarrhea ...



I think the process it they give you a pill and or a shot and you have to walk alot and then you will start spotting but then you will discharge the 'embryo' and i recall she was really sick ... she had to go to the hospital for loosing so much blood ...



i dont know if this is what you are having but be careful ...



also remember when you go to have an abortion with someone who doesnt know what they are doing they can fu*k you up down there and you wont be able to have children when you are ready ....

also try not to use abortion as BC ... be more cautious once this is over ... its not healthy for your body to go through abortion again and again!

Yes, there is an abortion pill, I believe it's actually 2 pills taken within a short time of each other. If you are pregnant and if you decide for an abortion, you will be informed about all your options and they'll tell you which one is the best for you. Hope everything goes well for you and don't worry about all these comments. Anybody can get pregnant by accident and abortions have been done for years and years, you're not the only one.

Hi there, well first of all ignore the negative comments as that wont get u anywhere! first of all before u stress yourself out, take a preg test to make sure ur pregnant, u have got to do this, terminations or abortions get treated for different stages of the pregnancy, go to the gp and tell them ur preg they do a test. if its positive then you ask the doctor to refer u for a termination, he then writes a letter to the local hospital nearest you and they send you an appointment for a consultation where a nurse then a doctor examine u and give u an ultrasound scan to see what stage ur pregnancy is at and how many weeks it shows on the scan, thats the first part, at this stage ur better NOT looking at the screen as a baby has taken shape at around 6 weeks and is visible, I know Im a mother of 6! then u get taken back in to talk to the doc who will then make sure that in ur own mind u are 100% positively sure that u want a termination, if u decide that is what u want they will give u an appointment righth there to come into a day ward, when u arrive a nurse will hand u a small yellow tablet for u2 take, once taken u can go home, u then return to the hospital to take a 2nd yellow tablet and they will insert pessaries inside ur vagina to loosen the cervix and u stay in the hospital until they have seen that the foetus has passed away, if u find it painful they give u strong painkillers to take but they will try and make u as comfortable as possible whilst ur there,what I will say is do not look into the bedpan thats on the toilet when u feel anything is about to pass as its not and never will be a pleasant sight! after the foetus has passed a family plannung nurse will visit u to ask u if u would like them to give u a method of contraception whilst ur in there and they will go thru all methods available to u, what they do, and how effective it is. To get the tablets you must be between 6-12 weeks pregnant if you go over that then you will have to get a medical termination but again this is only from the period from 12 weeks to 6 months pregnant after that they tend to give u the yellow pills again and u basically have to give birth to the baby to pass it which is definitely a horrendous thing to see and I would imagine quite traumatising for the person. what I will say is this though if u do decide to take the pill that the hospital give you and decide after you have swallowed it that you wish you hadnt gone through with it, it maybe too late to change your mind as these pills are designed to simply soften everything in the hope that the foetus will pass itself before u go back to take the 2nd tab, I had decided with my 6th child that I couldnt cope with another one when I found out I was pregnant with him, I took the first yellow tab at the hospital and went home....I had bad pains all that night but nothing happened no bleeding nothing, 2 days later I went into hospital to take the second one and I didnt feel right so I asked for a scan, I asked to see the scan and asked them if my baby was dead they told me NO his little heartbeat was visible and I could see him moving about I felt so guilty that I jumped off the scanning bed and ran out! I went on to have a beautiful baby boy totally healthy in every way, the pills dont kill the foetus or harm it in anyway its only designed to soften ur womb etc, so bear in mind that when u take the 2nd ones and get the pessaries inserted there is absolutely no way back!once ur cervix opens and everything contracts the foetus will be expelled out into the bedpan hopefully and when it does bear in mind that it would still have been alive , sorry for being so blunt but thats the reality of it! I hope ur test is negative and please be more careful next time u have sex as this is not a pleasant experience for anyone, good luck and I hope this helped you Gilly x

An abortion pill. This is for pregnancies up to nine weeks old and involves taking two drugs – called mifepristone and prostaglandin – 48 hours apart. These have the effect of causing the womb to contract and shed its lining so that the embryo is lost through the vagina. This can be painful and some women feel sick or have vomiting and diarrhoea with these drugs.

Unfortunately its not as simple as taking a pill then having a heavy period, i read a magazine article about this form of abortion, the women discovered once the foetus had expelled from her uterus, that she was actually 16 weeks pregnant. women who take this pill have to miscarry the baby into a metal tray, once it's out the baby is examined by the doctor, to check that everything is out.

There is no easy way out of pregnancy, i had a surgical abortion (put to sleep, then the baby is sucked and scraped out)  when i was 15 at 13 weeks pregnant, it was horrific and truly awful, its not something i would recommend.

The easiest thing to do is to abstain from sex all together until you are mature enough to cope with the consequences. If you don't have the willpower then use protection, because abortion is not contraception.



good luck and I'm hoping your not pregnant, being a parent is hard work and you have the rest of your life to look forward to.

Hi.
Agree with Barb and Midnight.
It is something I've been through (I can feel some thumbs down coming on). I did experience severe bleeding and an infection afterwards, but it was controlled with antibiotics. I won't lie to you, it was painful, but without justifying myself on here, it was nessesary, and not a regret that I beat myself up over.
Good luck to you. Stay strong x

stop worrying so much because stress wont help the situation at all, and i know thats easier said than done, but plz try to stay calm. ive heard over and over again, that some woman spot, or bleed lightly thruought their WHOLE pregnancy, some just for a short time, and some not at all. it can be just a normal thing. i havent bled, im only 9 wks, but u also said u didnt bleed in ur first pregnancy, sometimes u do, sometimes u dont. as far as the store situation, u might have been on ur feet for too long, u need to take it easy. or it could have been from not eating or drinking enough fluids or not getting enough rest because i got lightheaded last weak and felt faint, then i drank something with sugar, and 5 minutes later, i felt 100% better. i hope this helps, and good luck hun

I am 6 weeks along with my second and had bleeding as well. My doctor also told me to stay off my feet for 2-4 day and wrote me off work. They did a pelvic exam and said my cervix was closed which was a good sign of not having a miscarriage. He also told me that it is perfectly normal for you to bleed sometimes. It can be caused by sex, stress, and a number of other things. Some women have a period the first few months of pregnancy.



As far as the dizziness and fainting goes, I had that with my first and again with this one. It's just one of the joys of pregnancy. With my first I could barely make it through work, school, or even grocery shopping without having to grab something cold to drink and sit down on the floor (yes even in the grocery store....my baby was more important that the weird looks other people gave me lol). Try carrying a candy bar and cold ice water with you everytime you go somewhere. I found this helped out a lot.



Good luck!

I got back from A+E about an hour and a half ago. We'd been there since 6.30. I have been bleeding since Thursday afternoon, a dark brownish colour. There's not a lot - but more than spotting. I also had a missed m/c in April - so I'm kind of "searching" for symptoms this time.

The dr has booked me in for a scan on Tuesday (2nd early scan already) and will check then - but he also reassured me by saying that 30% of women who have full term babies had bleeding in the first trimester. he also mentioned that his friend's wife had bleeding for THREE weeks - but was ok.

Bed rest for now is good, but no: it doesn't mean that you will m/c. 
Good luk with your scan. I hope when you choose a best answer you give us an update so we know you're ok.

My friend is pregnant in 7th month ,and she is a care assistant, she was asked to do night shift, and she got it in her contract that sporadically she can be asked for it, but it was before she was pregnant.Can she refuse doingnight shifts because of pregnancy issue?
There is any legal basis for that?

Legally i don't think there are any implications of why she can refuse to work. Is there an employment contract or staff policy your friend can ask to see?

Your friend shouldn't be doing it either.  She should ask immediately to swop to day shifts until she leaves, if they refuse seek legal help



straight away.  They should not refuse her.

She cant refuse to do the night shift just on the basis that she is pregnant. At the nursing home i used to work in, one pregnant woman always did night shifts. If she has a reason why she feels she cant do the night shift, then she would have to take the up with her boss, but in the case of just refusing do it just because she is pregnant, its not a valid reason.

if you are pregnant with twins the cramping you are feeling could be your uterus stretching form the babies. It gets uncomfortable at times.



Also at one point if you do not excersize regularly the elasticity of your abs deminishes so they can't hold shape as long as they use to. this can account for the early showing.

as for the mild cramps that's normal in early pregnancy and as for you showing i am also on pregnancy no3 and have showed straight away its due to bloating and because your are on your 3rd pregnancy your uterus as already been stretched and will expand quicker, but having said that it could also be due to twins as you do show quicker if you are carrying more than one, good luck with the outcome tomorrow x

Getting bigger sooner could be twins or you might be further along, or you could have a bigger baby this time around or it could just be because you already have kids.  I would definitely discuss the cramps with your doctor, because cramping can be an indication of miscarrying but not necessarily mean you are.  You could be constipated.  You know it is funny, doctors can examine you or do an ultrasound and tell you that you are constipated, even if you don't feel it.

I showed real soon with my second one, and we hoped for twins, but they said it could be twins, or I could be further along, or I could be having a big baby.  FYI:  I didn't have twins, I wasn't further along, and whereas they said he would be about 8 pounds, as soon as he was born I laughed because just by looking he was smaller than my other one who was 7 lbs. 7 oz. he was only 6 lbs. 10 oz.

Sorry I can't really give you much advice I'm afraid.

You might be pregnant with twins - but then again you might not be.  The only way to tell for sure is to see two babies on an ultrasound, or deliver two babies at the end.  Other "signs" like your size or, hCG levels are not definitive.

As for the miscarriage issue, again, nobody can really say.

Just try and relax - what will be, will be.

Quite a few. There will be your support person if you have one, your OB/GYN/Surgeon (usually 2 of them are there) a respiratory therapist, an NICU nurse, sometimes your delivery nurse, and sometimes a pediatrician depending on the baby's needs then there is the OR staff which usually has an anesthetist, a scrub nurse/circulating nurse.

My twins were born at 34 weeks.... I'm sure we had more in there because there were 2 babies but lets see.... 2 ob/gyns, 4 pediatric nurses, 2 nurses.....  So for one baby I would think that you'd have the 2 ob/gyns, 2 pediatric nurses, 2 regular nurses, and the anesteisiologist (sp?)

You're only allowed one support person for yourself.

With a premature baby, depending on how bad the health is, you may not even get to hold the baby.  They just give you a quick peek over the curtain and whisk the baby to NICU.



My husband got to hold one of the twins but not the other :(  I didnt even get to hold S till he was 2 days old and W till he was a week old :((

Not sure of exact amount of people as there will be at least the doctors and nurses performing the op plus the prem bub specialists but they usually only allow 1 support person in with you however you can always ask if you would like more people and it might be worth asking if your support person is allowed to be with you in recovery or if they are allowed to stay with bub while you are in recovery.

It depends on the circumstances or on the possible unforeseen complications. Anesthesiologist, surgeon, pediatrician, nurse/s, possible your husband.
I had an emergency c-section, as far as I can remember I counted at least 5 people not including my husband. 3 people covered me with warm blankets, one was doing spinal anesthesia, another one was at my head asking questions about what I feel or what I don't feel.

There will be a medical, anaesthetic and nursing team for your sister, and a paediatric nurse and paediatrician for the baby at the very least.

At 32 weeks gestation the birth will likely be treated as an emergency, just in case, so she may not be able to have a birthing partner present.  If she is having a general anaesthetic and not a spinal anaesthetic, then she definately wont be able to have a birthing partner with her.

I had an emergency C-section 26 years ago at 27 weeks gestation when my pre-eclampsia turned into eclampsia and my blood pressure shot up to 250/190 and I started to seizure.  My son is now married, fit and healthy, and in the Air Force.  Try to stay positive, and best luck to you, your sister and her baby.

Surely someone can do something?



My sister is 40wks + 5 days.
At 38 weeks she was 1cm dialated & had ripe cervix.
She was supposed to have a membrane sweep today but the midwife cancelled with no explaination.....
What should she do? She doesn't want to "push" the midwives but we don't want her baby to be put at risk. Her midwife is very unhelpful & has been all the way through her pregnancy.....



She is suffering with very bad heartburn, excrusiating back pain, wetting herself in public & lack of sleep........ surely an induction isn't too much to ask. She doesn't have any midwives appointments booked now due to totally rubbish midwife!!

I don't know anythin about pregnancy and giving birth but I'm guessin this is totally wrong, the midwife should make sure your sister is ok and her and her baby aren't in any danger? Couldn't you contact your GP or hospital? Someone should really check on her as soon as possible. Good luck

Tell her to not wait and go to the hospital.  If the midwife has been that unhelpful through out her pregnancy, it would be time to look elsewhere for that help.  Its too late in her pregnancy to wait.

omg thats horrible! Ditch the midwife, no use in having someone around whos not willing to give it 100%. Call your hospital and tell them your situation and they will most likley be able to get you an appointment with a doctor asap. Im sure a induction can be done, but the doctor will need to make sure the baby is ready to come out first.

She should "push" the midwives.  They won't know she's upset unless she tells them!  Simply call and ask when they are rescheduling the sweep for.
(Honestly, If she found her midwife unhelpful, she should have changed doctors earlier in the pregnancy.)

Midwives know (and most modern doctors know) that 40 wks is an estimate, and it's healthiest to wait for the mother to go into labor.



Last of all, I know it's tough, but induction is really not a good way to go.  If she can just hold out until her body/the baby is ready she'll be a lot better off.  The best you can do is sympathize with her and tell her she's tough and can do it.

<answer>



The midwife may be wanting to avoid the potential side effects of induction, especially if your sister wants to have a home birth. Stripping the membranes may or may not start labour. If it does, great. Contractions are usually more intense after the water breaks, as the head makes direct contact with the cervix. If it doesn't start  contractions, then she will have to be induced with pitocin within 24- 48 hours.



Induction, and early water breaking, are not the most pleasant. Both situations make labour more painful earlier in the process, increasing the chances of debilitating exhaustion, fetal distress, needing medication, delivery intervention, and c-section.



Pregnancy can safely be continued into 2 weeks post-due date. Remember, the due date is a guideline. Some women go longer, some go short, and very few deliver on the date.

Wow I'm so sorry for your sis. Apparently at 39 weeks dr's are willing and able to induce. Maybe not the case with midwives. I just changed dr's at 38 weeks due to my dr being a butt!!!  I think if it were me at this point i'd call the hospital myself and tell them what's going on and see if they have any suggestions.

I feel for her, I really do because I've been there.
But does she realise that being induced is THE most painful way to give birth?
Her baby is not at risk. It will come when it's ready.

She should have a midwife appointment in a few days where they will book her in for an induction at around 42 weeks.

the sex of the baby is decided by the sex of the sperm that meets the egg, the womens bnoddy has no say in the matter.



do you know about chromosomes?



a girl has xx chromosomes and a boy has xy
as both the egg and the sperm only contain half of what is needed the chromosomes are divided and as there is only x's in a egg only an x can be passed on
as a man is xy half the sperm contain an x and half a y, if a sperm with a y meets the egg then it will be a boy, if a sperm with an x meets the egg then it will be a girl

That's not quite how it works.  The womans body carries the X chromosom, and the male sperm has both some X sperm and some Y sperm.



When an X sperm comes together with the X egg you get a girl :  XX chromosome.



When a Y sperm comes together with the X egg you get a boy: XY chromosome.



The womans body does nothing to chose the sex of the baby, it is all dependant of which sperm fertalizes her egg.

The fetus has either XX or XY.



Until about week 6, we are gender neutral. The fetus puts out different chemicals depending on whether it has XX or XY, and those send back more hormones.



Read more on chromosonal abnormalities if you want to understand how it works.

Both should be designed to do it so you can take it in turns!! 
Not fair that we have to make all the healthy choices to have babes while the men still get to have a beer or two!!! And without the physical elements we experience. 
We have the periods the nine months the labour and then the breastfeeding and lack of sleep - They get the sex
wow what a contribution our men make!! HA HA

Carrying a baby around in your womb is a blessing and should be embraced not whinged about! Yes giving birth is extremely painful, but it is something men will NEVER experience. They will never know the feeling of nurturing the unborn, and giving birth to something so beautiful. I loved being pregnant even during the bad times, and as painful as childbirth was, it is a feeling i never want to forget.

But on the otherhand, guys should have their own form of period hehe. They are so annoying! And they will give us girls a chance to say eeew gross whenever they talk about something completely natural!

It doesn't bother me much, they may not have anyone to talk about it with so they come on here. Hoping not to get judged and to get answers from real people. I think if I was lonely and didn't have anyone to talk about that to then I would come on here because nobody really knows who you are..

ok, i have very mixed feelings about your question.
first of all, this is a site where people are free to ask questions, whether you find them idiotic or not.
secondly, there are ligitimate times when people are concerned.

my last cycle started july 20. i'm 2 weeks late. negative hpt's. yes, i'm smart enough to get a blood test, the results are not in and won't be until tomorrow. however, i have asked on here if anyone experienced negative hpt's and positive blood tests.

the people on this site have been wonderful. i have not talked to any friends or family about my possibility, because i don't feel it is necessary to cry wolf when it may just be a late period. however, the fact that it's a possibility is on my mind a good bit. 
it was nice that i was able to hear other people's experiences and opinions. whether they will be correct in th end or not.



what makes me sad is that there are people out there, such as yourself, who feel that it's necessary to be condescending when you are not aware of everyone's situation. i understand being aggravated at questions asking if one is pregnant but haven't had sex. i can even annoyance with questions where people claim they've had a period but want to know if they could still be pregnant. i've read many questions (hoping to gain insight for my own situation) and there is no background. someone will say they are late but won't say how late and give no background information. you are right in some aspects; there are some ridiculous questions.

try to take a few minutes and realize that there are still those out there, like myself, who are thinking, maybe i am, maybe i'm not. if there are people like me, there is absolutely no point in mentioning anything to friends or family if it is a false alarm.

if there is a small amount of advice that is gained in the "question asker's" eyes, then i think it's an accomplishment, no matter how stupid other users may see the question.

Well I have been reading up on this as well because I am TTC my first.  Anyway, from what I can tell. . .when you are in fact pregnant your cervix should be high and "ripe" or soft.  People on the internet describe it as ripe like a plum.  But if you are not pregnant it will be lower and more firm. . .like the tip of your nose.  But this is not an accurate sign of pregnancy because everyones cervix changes at different times.



Hope this helps!!

My last period was on August 11th 2008 and my cycle is around 32-33days long. My period was supposed to start September 11th but nothing came and then on September 13th I starting bleeding for two days then it stop. I took a pregnancy and it came out positive.

Actually go by the start of last period and count 12 to 14 days in! This is an estimate and not a for sure date. Since your cycle is so long it is likely that you don't ovulate when most women do! if your wanting to know how far along  you are and your due date its better to go by the start of your last period. In fact I don't know of any doctors that go with a conception date because for one thing conception can happen anytime from 24 to 48 hours after sex! Check out these sites!

That was one of my first signs of pregnancy. I would dream that someone was always standing at the end of my bed or in the hallway. I ended having to sleep with the hall bathroom light on and just pull the door to.

first of all congrats .. when my mother was pregnant with my sister and myself as were twins she also said that she had weird dreams.. all it means is that your hormones are around the place and also your body is trying to sort itself out.. Also your afraid your twins will be ugly.. dont worry its only when babies are first born that theyre covered in placenta and gunk.. once theyve been bathed dressed they will be fine..

Hi there
I hate to tell you but there is no ideal "easy" way to give birth (after 5 in the past 8 years, I'm an expert LOL!)  As my nan used to say, "it's 6 of one and a half dozen of the other"  cos, if you have the natural birth, you're doing all the hard work during labour but have a far quicker recovery rate; by going the C section route, you have a relatively work-free labour but a hell of a job to recover afterwards.  Your baby will be prepared to be born with the vaginal way too because the labour lets them be born in their own time rather than be "taken" all of a sudden.  Good luck with whatever you choose - you'll have your gorgeous bundle of joy no matter which way you decide!! xxx

My mother did both and didn't remember the c-section being harder, but she also had her tubes tied right after the vaginal delivery, so that might have contributed to it. Over all I hear that c-section has a lot more recovery time which you don't want when you are having to get up at all hours and take care of your new baby.

Normal delivery is way easier to recover from.  That is the reason that (at least in the USA) you are in the hospital for 4 days after a c-section and only two after a vaginal delivery, and why you get 6 weeks off from work for a vaginal and 8 for a c-section.  A Cesarean is major surgery.  A vaginal deliver is a perfectly normal process.  If a c-section becomes medically necessary because of an emergency situation, then definitely do it for the well-being of you and your baby, but if it is not necessary, then try to avoid it.

Cesarean may seem the easy way out - but the recovery is a lot harder than recovery after a normal delivery. Also, if you plan on having more children - you should know that if you have a C-section now, there is a good chance you will need to get it again with your next child.

id opt for a natural delivery, a section is classed as a major op. with a natural birth you have all the pain during labour, then that's it its gone, with a section you have to stay in hospital for  2 - 4 days depending on how well you  are recovering also it takes a minimum of 6 weeks for you to heal, that's no driving etc, can you cope with that? i know i couldn't. but the choice is yours, good luck

Well it really depends, I know that some smaller women have trouble delivering naturally just due to size. While others are just fine. I can't imagine that either one is "easier". Naturally you deal with the pain first. C-section you deal with the pain and recovery later.

I wouldnt get a cesarien if its not needed..they do keep you longer with it unlike the next day with normal delivery. Plus it takes weeks and even a month or two to fully recover and be able to stand right and lift things normaly again after getting a cesarian. I would go natural, you heal faster and no scars.

I am not sure about London, but in the US they keep you 24-48 hours for a vaginal delivery and 48-72 hours for a Cesarean. I am not sure yet as my first baby is still cooking, but from what I have heard, the recovery is much easier from a vaginal delivery. Having a C section, although quite common, is still major abdominal surgery. Best of luck to you and your baby!

Yes everyone is different, I had a normal delivery with my son but it was a really horrible experience.
He was not breathing when he was born and had to be recusitated and I was cut and also split from giving birth.
I was induced and it took me over an hour to push him out, he was 10lb born over 2 foot long and his head was 15inches around.
I was not the same for about 6 months as I had so many stiches (half hours worth)/
I had a c section with my daughter at 37 weeks, and although the scar is quite long it only takes 4 days before you can take the pressure bandage off. It hurt far, far less than my sons birth and I resumed sex within 6 weeks quite happily and with no pain.
Lots of girls are doubled over with a c section and complain that they cant walk, I walked the next day and had very little pain.
If I had a choice I would have a c section again as my daughter never suffered in anyway and my son was virtually stillborn ( he was recusitated and is healthy now).

My wife has had multiple of both.  She'd FAR rather deliver naturally, just from the standpoint of pain (and she takes NO pain medication for labor!), and of course, she wants to do what's best for the baby, not herself.  That's natural delivery of course, and her attitude is called being a good mother.

I had a hard labor, but I am SOOOO happy to be getting another c section! 3 days and everyone I know that had a normal c section were sitting indian style comfortable as can be on the floor. There is barely any bleeding, and while I got an infection due to the nurse not knowing how to accurately do her job, as soon as my infection was gone I was able to do anything I did before. I was working out with a personal trainer 4 weeks after my c section, Doing sit ups, running, hard workouts for 2 hours a day, I felt fine. After having a c section I wouldn't try to deliver vaginally. After seeing my sister and my aunt and my other aunt able to do anything and everything after 3 days I am ready for the c section this time! I would vote for c section! Oh and my baby girl is now 6 months old and perfectly happy and healthy she had no health problems, nor did my sisters son who is now 2 months. I don't see why people say it takes so long to recover, I had a massive infection and it only took me a week to recover and feel like I could do anything. I guess everyone is different, so I am giving you a different point of view, I think c sections are great. I was in the hospital for 3 days and I went home the 3rd day. It takes a very short amount of time, You can pick the day, you know when it will happen, and if your anything like anyone I know you'll feel fine in a few days. I literally know about 10 people that have had c sections in the last year and they were all the same, feeling fine after a few days. Good luck whatever you choose!

Edit. and they make pain medicine balls now that they put in after a c section, which make it so you don't feel the pain at all, I know 2 people that have had them, so you really only have to feel like 1 day of pain. and my incision scar is way below where a bikini would go and is teeny tiny, You would never see it no matter what I was wearing.

I'm not sure how long for London, but a friend was home 3 days after her c section in Cornwall.  She's had 4 children, 3 natural deliveries, and she says the natural one's are easier to recover from, even with stitches.

Nah, a caesarian takes much longer to recover from and it could cause problems with you and the baby, they also keep you in for a few days. So i would say a normal delivery was better.

Vaginal birth is easier.  No brainer there.



(Really, think about it for a minute.  You can go through 12-18 hour or so of labor [and most of the pain can be relieved by medication, if you need it.]. Nothing is expected of you; you can ***** and complain all you want, and you just have to focus on giving birth.  After baby is born, you are a bit sore and tired for a few days, but pretty much back to normal, as you take on the job of caring for your newborn.

OR ... you can have major surgery.  No pain during the surgery, and it's over with in an hour or so -- but then you have weeks of post-op pain and  a long healing process -- all made that much more difficult by the need to care for a newborn, breastfeed every couple of hours,  entertain guests and visitors, get up for night feedings.  Why would ANYONE think this was the easier choice?

i would go for a normal delivery. Ceasserrean takes longer to heal and is more painful in the long run. I know someone who couldnt even climb up the stairs becos it was too painful. You stay in hospital for about 3 days and you will miss ur babies first few moments in life because you will be under sedation Youll also be left scarred for a long time it probably takes years for the scar to heal completely and fade away. A normal birth is probably painful for that time being but after you forget about the pain and you heal quickly and get back to normal. and theres also drugs the doctors can give you to make it more easier for you.

A vaginal delivery is going to be much easier for you. Sure it may hurt during the process but the healing time is so much quicker. I don't know about London but I'm in the US and had to stay 3 nights for my C-section and then it also took me a good 2 weeks to feel "better".

You're not able to hold your baby right away with a C-section. I didn't get to see my little guy until an hour or so afterwards. Plus, after you go home, you aren't able to fully care for them as you should. I felt totally helpless. Unless you absolutely NEED a C-section then try for a vaginal delivery first.

I had 3 cesarians in 3 years, not because I was too posh to push but because I had no choice.
It is not the easy option it is major surgery.  Both me and my baby were very ill after the first one, I made it my son wasn't so fortunate.
5 days in hospital may seem like a good idea but look at the bigger picture.



Your baby needs vital immune building organisms in his/her gut that only natural birth can stimulate.
For the sake of your baby if not yourself if the natural option is possible then take it.

I have had both and I believe a normal delivery is better for both you and the baby, the recovery time is shorter and you have the satisfaction of doing most of the work to bring your baby into this world.  The c-section was easier during the surgery, but was more difficult to recover from, allthough I had more energy after the c-section (didn't push and use that energy.)  Although if you choose a c-section, you can't change your mind afterward and do it naturally, it is very dangerous to do a VBAC (Vaginal Birth after Caeserian) to both you and the baby.  I would suggest trying it natural first and then if you have another one, you can do a c-section if you choose.  (I would rather have had both naturally, but both my life and the baby's life were in danger after 3 days of labor.)

The caesarean is easier at the time, but takes much longer to recover.  It also isn't as helpful for the baby.  I personally wouldn't do it by choice.  It's not fun picking up a baby who cries all night when you've been cut from hip to hip!
I spent five days in hospital after the birth of my daughter - it was exhausting.  I never slept at all - too many babies, too many exhausted mothers.
I've done both, and unless you've got major help at home, go for the natural birth.  Not only is it better for your baby, but you recover much quicker.

Only for mothers......?



I am almost 18 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child and I  don't feel it move but maybe a couple times a week! Both my girls were very active and I carried them in the front. I actually had to have an ultra sound last week because the doctor couldn't find a heart beat. The baby is fine but apparently I am caring it low and towards to back. I have a lot of pressure on my cervix and lower back pain.  It is making me really nervous not feeling it move around or kick. I know its early but I felt my girls move by 14 weeks. Anyone else had this kind of pregnancy?

18 weeks is still early to feel tons of movement and every pregnancy is different.  I understand how you feel though, try not to worry.  My ob always has a hard time finding a heartbeat because my son is always moving around but I didnt feel him moving at first.  Also, while you are walking and busy during the day, your baby gets rocked to sleep.  Try resting your hands on your belly when you lie down to sleep and you may feel more movement.  They usually wake up while we are trying to sleep!

Go buy prenatal pills, take those on a daily basis, call your insurance to see what doctors are on your insurance list, once that is done, call an obgyn and get in for a pre-natal visit. Once there they will ask you lots of questions and get you started on your pregnancy journey. You probably won't have an ultrasound for awhile but they will check your levels and take lots of blood.

He will not change, period. And as Joanna S has said he will always use the child against you. Get out now, and have nothing more to do with him; leave the state if necessary, or he will try to hurt you in what ever way he can, every time the opportunity arises. He is an abusive controlling person. He thinks he can control you through your child. Leave him and never look back. It will be the best thing you can do for your child and you.

If you feel threatened in any way what do you think is going to happen when your baby is born?  He will use that child in any situation.  I would for sure get out of there and get a restraining order. there is never knowing anyway if he will get full custody of your child.  But I doubt it just because he is working doesn't mean that he will get suctody of your child.

First off, you are in an abusive relationship and need to get away immediately for your health and your baby's health. Here are a few things you can do:
1. call a domestic abuse hotline, they can walk you through getting out of this situation step-by-step by providing you with shelter and contacts to support you finding, medical and emotional help, and help with employment.
2. look up a legal aid in your area. they can give you free advice about custody of your child, but so will the domestic abuse hotline.

Yes, he can. I was told to get a police record on him. It will hold up in court and give you favor. The next time things get heated to the point of physical violence Call the police and put a restraining order on him.

With a violent record it will be easier for you to get custody. Now you need to prove that you are capable of providing for your child. You need a new place to stay, and a job asap. There are womens shelter's to help you. The phone book and planned parenthood have the information on shelters.

EDIT- I know exactly where your comming form. My bf was a plumber and paid all the bills, he was a active in the chuch with no record whatsoever. He was a good guy except on his "bad days." When he slammed my head into the bathroom mirror and forced me to pay for a new one, i knew i had to get out. He WILL get custody, unless you are proactive. It will be your word against his in court without police reports. He will look better than you because he has a job and a place to stay. Please take action w/o cluing him in on your plans. xx

He can't take your baby away from you. It's just a threat. Don't stay with this man if you don't love him. It's the worst start you can give to your child. Don't worry, your baby is yours completely. It's your boyfriend who'll be working hard for visitation rights! I'm worried myself that your boyfriend could be harming your confidence already. Never ever stay with a man who could hurt you or your child. Confide in your friends and your family. Also a confidentual phone call to the police is a good idea. They will give you a crime number, and you will be put on a 'high risk' database, which means that should anything happen to you, they'll be there extra fast. Good luck xXx

No way, regardless whether your working or not, its only extreme circumstances that the father gets full custody, if he applies to the court, he'll, unless unsuitable will get visitation rights he would only get full custody if you were unsuitable in some way like being violent towards the baby or suicidal etc but even then he has to prove it & they will investigate etc first, but just being young & out of work isn't a reason to give him your baby. 
Get in touch with Citizens Advice & also apply to your local council & they will help you find your own accommodation & benefits, you'll get help with rent, council tax & water rates, but do it now so you have somewhere to bring your baby home too & ditch your boyfriend or at least get him to go for help, coz if he really loves you he will, however if he loved you he wouldn't be threatening you, let alone when your 32 weeks pregnant. Heres a thought, every time he screams at you your baby can hear it.
Good luck love & take care & remember your carrying very precious cargo :o)

You need to separate yourself from him as it isn't just your life that is in danger but your child's. You also need to file a police report about the abuse you have suffered and keep up constantly to report new abuse so that when your child is born hopefully you will not have to send your child to this abusive monster. Not only is he physically abusive but he is also verbally/emotionally/psychologically abusive.



You also have to go to counseling and figure out what it is in your life that is making you attracted to people that will harm you. You owe it to yourself and if you can't muster the energy for that, you need to do it for your soon to be child.



You don't need to be worried about him taking the baby from you, as legally he will not be able to do so. You do have to be very frightened of your child growing up in this environment or the next one you will choose if you don't get help for your own problems. You and your child really deserve better so please contact a counselor. The state will pay for all of it.

your baby isn't even born yet so i'm inclined to say a court wouldn't give him custody. it's up to the father or social services or similar people to prove you are an unfit mother. otherwise, if they don't,  the court can't be presented with any evidence or good reason that you shouldn't keep your child. a government will always recommend a child stays with it's birth mother unless there is an extremely valid reason why not.



and please don't take this the wrong way, but if you live in the uk, bringing up a child in an abusive relationship would be seen as a reason to question your parenthood skills since there a laws that say you have to protect your child from harm.

so please get out of that sitution soon as poss'.

Your information is incomplete but as a rule of thumb courts still tend to give custody to the mother unless there is some reason that the mother is unfit.  His working simply means he will be able to provide child support.

calm down hun it wont do u or the baby any good to stress about it, at the end of the day unless he can prove you are an unfit mother he wont get full custody, i am a mother of 3 with one on the way, i was with my partner for 7 years and had 3 kids with him he left me 2 years ago now when our youngest was 2 he owns his own company and is very well off i do not and have not worked and i have full custody of our children, the baby i have on the way is with my current partner of 19 months so nothing to do with my ex, but even if this baby were his he still wouldnt get custody just because we split up, dont stress about it, if you are mot happy in the relationship or you feel unsafe there whether he has hit you or not yet, there obviously is thr risk of him doing so, you should leave, dont stay because of a threat he made, just be the best mum u can be and u'll be fine, take care hun and be safe xx

Chances are very slim that he would get the baby, especially if he is being abusive.  You should really document or report that abuse.  And then get the hell away from him.  Giving him "one more chance" is giving him another chance to hurt you.  Is that how you want your bay raised?  To think that it's ok to abuse, or be abused?  There is plenty of help out there for you until the baby is born and you are ready to work or go to school.

Most likely not, there has to be a really good reason for the judge to award him full custody, and the job situation wouldn't be a good enough reason...i don't know what state you live in but you should def try to get out of that situation, go to social services dept in your area, and try to get some assistance...he is just trying to scare you into leaving him...

i know what you are going through i kind of went through the same thing. i was told by my SW that the best thing to do was get a restraining order and then that way when he tries to get custody then you can show the order and prove that he is a violent person. don't worry about getting a job. at this point you need to find out where to live. you can go to your local SW office and speak with someone about housing and getting money to support you and the baby while you go to school. they will also pay for a short term study in a community college which will mean you can get a better paying job then a job with minimum wage. the housing process my take a long time like 1-2 years but they will give you a transitional home which helps you get housing even faster. sorry for writing so long. but the first thing you should do is find a social worker

he's abusing you,so he will not get full custody. He most likely will have to pay you child support if you're not working but you should look for a part time job after you have the baby and also daycare. You need to get a lawyer, look for some on line that might take your case for free.The link has information for pro bono lawyers.

First off you have more of a chance of loosing the baby to the state if you stay with an abusive person. Don't let him scare you! Move in with family if you can or go to a woman's shelter. The state will be on your side and will give you a chance to get on your feet. The best option is with family if you can! He wont be able to take baby from you because most states are very rights to mother. You'd have to be a drug addict, prostitute, or living on the street! Trust me leave him and go live in a shelter or with family. It will all be OK. If you need to start making police reports to use against him. When you have three incidences of him attacking you, you can get a restraining order. That will help in keeping him from your child! Good luck and trust in god. You will be OK.

No. It is highly unlikely that you are pregnant. First of all, when on your period, you're not ovulating. Second, you would have no symptoms right now. Your period would not be affected.

It’s not really an “opinion” kind of situation. It’s more of a factual deal. If you think you’re pregnant, go get a test and take it.

I would go into the pregnancy assessment unit to get this checked out.  They can check for the baby's heart beat with a Doppler scan (sorry if i got them name wrong) , and also check for movements.  As for being late, there is nothing to worry about, i w as 8 days late with bubba and she was fine.  You can up to 2 weeks late before they get concerned, but they may offer to induce you a little earlier if you are worried.
Good luck hun, and please  get it checked.

Yes it could be the start.  When I went into labour it was lower back pain and cramping almost as if I had to go the bathroom. A few days before I did go to the bathroom very frequently, I guess my body was preparing.

Not all your labour is going to be extremely painful and intense, it works its way up to that.  So, you've probably started ... mind you it could take hours or weeks before baby decides to make an appearance.

wow, you are experiencing exactly what I experienced a couple of days before my waters broke! I was aching really bad around my whole middle region, I could barely walk, and I was having cramps. I also did not have a show, I didn't have a nesting instinct, and I never got diarrhoea (all books/website will tell you these are the most common signs of impending labor).



This stage is called pre labor so you aren't really in active labor yet, so it's probably too soon to go into hospital. If you're worried call the hospital and describe what you're feeling and they will be able to help.

Good luck!

Probably best to speak to your doctor as this might not be labour and it's probably best if get to worked up at the moment. My sister is 5 and a half months pregnant and she has been having what feels like contractions, with back pain for 3 weeks. She saw the doc and went to hospital and they said it wasn't labour and that she should just take it easy.

<question>



Post eating disorder/eating habits?



Before I got pregnant, I had an eating disorder for about 18 months. After getting help for it my eating habits changed dramatically, I'm not sure if it was because of the eating disorder or maybe just because I had grown out of the soda and junk food phase.



At any rate, to give you an idea of where I started to where I ended up here are what my Body Masses were:

Before eating disorder - 21.9 (normal is 18.5-24.9)
During eating disorder - 17.7
After eating disorder - 18.8

So as you can see after the ED, my eating habits changed to the point that I didn't gain that much weight afterwards.

I probably ate about 1400 calories per day after the ED. Not on purpose, but just because when I ate, I ate salad with no dressing and cut up grilled chicken, carrot sticks for a snack, all I drank was water, had cheese occasionally, only ate whole grain bread once in a while, etc. So when I did eat, there was really nothing to it, and obviously I was eating too little. But the doctor was happy that I was eating, had gained 7lbs, and was taking vitamins. Overall, I was healthy to her again.



Even though I have had cravings for foods with more substance while pregnant, I'm afraid that afterwards I'll go right back to those eating habits, like I just won't crave Taco Bell and Chocolate milk anymore!



So my question is, how badly (if that happens) is it going to affect breastfeeding my son? I know you're supposed to add on an additional 300 calories (?) for breastfeeding, but I'm afraid I'm just not going to be eating enough for the baby, and I'd really love to breastfeed.

Ok I know that was probably the most off the wall story/question, but I was just wondering if I could get advice OUTSIDE of my doctor, because sometimes even doctors don't have the right answer...

you do need a little more  when breastfeeding ,but if you eat healthy ,make sure you get enough of everything your body will take care of the rest ,you can get milk type supplements that might help things like malted milk power added to your cereal or something to make sure you get enough calciam.

You haven't given us any idea of your age, actual weight or height - a BMI measurement only gives very limited info.

But lets assume you are avergae - only eating 1400 calories a day is  under the average woman's basal calorie requirement - that is, the very least amount of calories needed to maintain your normal bodyweight.

An average woman of 130lbs (about 60kg) with an average lifestyle needs at least 1800 a day.



If you consistantly eat below this you will lose weight, unless you are already very underweight.

A pregnant woman should ideally aim for about 2300.

A breastfeeding mother does need additional calories, but the advice of eating a specific number of extra calories every day assumes that she is already eating at least the normal amount of calories, not below the requirement.

Please note that your body will actually use about 750 calories just breastfeeding.



So a breastfeeding mother should be reaslistic looking at consuming about 2500 calories a day.

Note that eating WAY below these calorie levels WILL NOT help you lose weight.



For a start you should not actively try and lose weight whilst pregnant.

Secondly if you eat way below the required calorie levels when you are breastfeeding all it will do is lower your milk supply.

A human body is designed to offer itself protection from starvation.  When you don't eat enough at times when the body is placed under demand (like breastfeeding) your body will assume it is starving and your metabolism will slow way down and this will PREVENT you from losing weight, because your body will try and hang on to it's fat reserves and will burn off all the new nutrients it is taking in for energy instead of burning fat reserves.

You are right on the borderline of being underweight as it is now.

I know you've said you aren't craving junk food and chocolate, however only eating undressed salad and vegetables, a little chicken, and cheese and bread only every now and then and drinking only water is very extreme.  What do you eat for breakfast?



You MUST try and eat properly.  EVERY DAY you need a mix of fruit and vegetables, protein, calcium, and carbohydrates.  You won't fiind these in junk food but you will find them in yoghurt, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, chicken, lean red meat, pasta, bananas, apples, grapes, oranges, tomatoes, carrots, peas, spinach, mushrooms, wholegrain bread and cereals.



Bottom line - if you don't eat enough it will have a very negative effect on breastfeeding your son.

You need to be using more than a condom alone....a condom alone isn't always very effective. Get yourself on the pill. 
A light period doesn't necessarily mean you are pregnant. But if you're concerned, take a test.

Maybe. It depends.
If it is close to the time of your period then if could just be the start of an early period, which could be normal since your not on the pill.

If not near the time of your period then maybe. Some women have implantation bleeding when they get pregnant, but not all. I have actually heard that it is rare.



Don't worry to much though just wait a couple weeks and take a home pregnancy test. Or go to a doctor and get a blood test, that is the best way to detect early pregnancies.



Hope this helps!

i really don't think you are pregnant because if you got your period (even if it was lighter than usual) then that means your body is shedding the egg and lining of your uterus that was NOT fertilized.



Although if you want to be 100% sure, take a pregnancy test

If you are this worried about getting pregnant maybe you should consider going on the pill in addition to condoms. Sex is a big responsibility, and there is always some chance you could get pregnant but you can lower that chance the more precautions you take.

Well, just cause you and him used a condom does not mean that it totally keeps you from getting pregnant! 
I dont think having a lighter period is a sign. I think you are worrying to much. If you still think you are then go to the store and get a HPT

if you are having a regular period, your period should fall with the same week during your last period. It means you are not pregnant. To be sure, visit a doctor to have a pregancy test.

yup!  its possible.  the egg can be implanted in one of your tubes and still have your period, sometimes two before you stop (though this is rare)  the only way to tell for sure is a lab test, and those at home test work good too.  Good luck!

did you have sex again? because sperm can only live in the tubes for 3 days if you got your period more than a week after, than you cannot get pregnant because the sperm has nothing to penetrate into. menstration gets rid of the old eggs

You can be pregnant even if you get your period.  It is unlikely if you had a full on period but it is still likely.  Try taking another pregnancy test.  I got 3 negative results before I got a positive, and I was late for all of the tests.  Also, the longer you wait the more hormones are in your urine for the test to pick up on.  Try taking another test and try not to stress.  It will only make you more late.  Good luck!

Yes the bleeding could have been implantation, a week after intercourse is usually to early to test. i would take another test now as it will show by now. If it is still negative you can safely say you are not pregnant, but i would go to your GP to see why you are skipping periods.

It is still very possibe for you to be pregnant. The spotting you see can be what they call implantation spotting. At home pregnancy tests are not always correct. The 2 best brand I have found that work the soonest #1 is family dollar brand #2 walmart equate brand... try taking a test with first mornings urine if still comes out a no you can wait 48 hours and take another one hcg doubles every 48 hrs and if that's still a no I would contact your dr either for a blood test if you still think you are pregnant or to check into what is really going on... hope this helps

Wow, you might just get that lucky again because they do say your 2nd is usually easier than your first.  My first pregnancy (girl) was easy and my 2nd pregnancy (boy) was more difficult and I felt sick and tired all the time.  First birth was 18 hours of labor with 2 hours of pushing and 4th degree tears.  Second birth I had to be induced because my son kept turning breech and before he moved around again I was induced so I could have a vaginal birth and that was only 6 hours of labor and 3 big pushes and he was out.  Good luck!

Had no stretch marks both times, bit more nauseous with my daughter (2nd child) than I was with my son, but nothing too bad.  With my son I had an extremely fast first stage - I didn't realise I was actually in labour until I had had a show and was pushing, but then ended up pushing for 7 hours before he was born by ventouse with a very large episiotomy - ouch!  (My pelvic floor muscles were too tight from going to the gym till I was 30 weeks pregnant!) I ended up back in hospital at 5 days with cellulitis of the episiotomy wound and then at 9 weeks had to have a d&c for retained products.  With my daughter I was a bit worried about an unplanned homebirth because of the really fast first stage last time but she ended up turning breech at 35 weeks and couldn't be turned back as her bottom was engaged - so I ended up with a caesarian at 39 weeks.  But yet again even though I had had a caesarian I ended up having retained products at about 8 weeks again!  I would say as you had had an extremely fast birth last time I would be prepared for another this time!!

I have heard it is normal to feel the baby earlier if you have already had kids. Go with your intuition. If you know that's what you felt then you did. I wouldn't count on feeling them too much. The baby is only like 3 inches big and about 1 oz. But it is possible.

They say that the movements aren't really reliable enough to chart until the 24th (? 20-somethingith anyway!) week, so I wouldn't worry. I'm 25 weeks and the other day I didn't feel him all morning so I was worried of course, but I guess he was just extra sleepy cuz after lunch he started lazing about and I could feel him roll over. =)



If you are more active then you are less likely to notice, especially as you get used to feeling them off and on. But either way the docs would say it's just too early to chart, and at this stage he could be moving "deeper" in your uterus where you wouldn't feel him by the surface of your skin or anything.

You may actually be feeling the baby.  So congratulations!  Enjoy the feeling.  The baby begins moving between weeks 11 and 12.  And on a side not, those little fingers are separated and the baby is wiggling them around.  Keep in mind however, that most women are not sensitive enough to notice sensations of movement at such an early stage of the pregnancy.  Consider yourself lucky.  I'm 11 weeks myself and keep telling him (because I am wishing for a boy) to entertain me.

Most women do not feel movements until they are 17 - 20 weeks.  If you're feeling them this early that's wonderful, but you probably can't expect to feel them everyday.  Midwives don't recommend tracking movements until at least week 24 because it can be so inconsistent.  Enjoy your flutters when you get them.  I started getting mine 2 weeks ago at 19 weeks!  So fun!!!

it is doubtful that what you are feeling is your baby.  that baby is still just the size of a pea.  however, if it is the baby and what you are worried about is that you didn't feel it today. don't be.  normal fetal movement shouldn't be calculated or relied on until 18-25 weeks.  your baby is so so tiny in their and they have to be right up near the skin to be felt.  so i would wait awhile before having any concern.  a baby does start moving around 9 weeks...but like i said...they are too tiny and not yet strong enough to be felt.

well i am on my 3rd pregnancy too and am now 15 weeks...i first felt movement around 12 weeks but not regularly and even now it is still not regular.  I think because the baby is so small, it is all in where abouts the baby is and perhaps just a chance that it got the right spot...

Would there be any pain having a miscarrage ?



OK this is Not about me i have suffered a loss but a missed miscarriage this is about a family member with a know talent for being a liar!



If someone hasn't had a period for 8 weeks which isn't unusual for them and then bleed very heavy again is normal for them, but they have no pain BUT they are saying they think they have had a miscarriage would that person be in pain and how much if at all ??



and she says a Dr came out and said pop to me in the morning maybe scan you surely if your having a miscarriage they would wisk you in there and then ?

yes generally you would be sent to the er. if she had a missed miscarriage, there wouldnt be any bleeding or very delayed weeks after the baby stopped growing. she would need a d&c to remove the embyo otherwise she could end up with infection. if a woman is miscarrying and bleeding, yes there is always pain. it is severe (way worse than a period!) there are clots (tissue) in the blood and the contractions come like labour (ie regular intervals)
hope that helps!

From personal experience, yes, there is a lot of pain with miscarriage at 8 weeks. When I suspected something was wrong, I went to see an OB (was in another state when this happened so not my regular doctor) and he did a vaginal ultrasound that day to verify that it was a pregnancy and that I was indeed losing it. He also did a blood test to confirm that I had been pregnant.



I can't say whether or not your family member would experience pain. It felt like the worst menstrual cramps of my life.

well it all really depends...early on in the pregnancy my doctor told me to go home after the ultrasound and if it got heavy (filling a pad every 5-10 min) then come back, because there is nothing that they can really do but monitor it and I don't like the thought of a D&C unless absolutely nescessary...it really depends on how far along they are as to how much pain there would be....When I had a very early miscarriage there was no pain, but a friend of mine had a miscarriage at 6 weeks and was in ALOT of pain and felt like she did when she gave birth to her two previous children

Caffeine free sugar free sodas?



Alright. I'm 36 weeks prego and I cut out caffeine a long time ago and started drinking more milk and water, but I still drink caffeine free soda. When I went to my doctors appointment on Monday, my doctor still got pissed and said I had to only have soda once a week. But I hate milk and I didn't drink a lot of water before pregnancy so its hard for me to cut out soda completely. So anyways, I went to the store and ran into a bottle of caffeine free sugar free sprite zero...Do you think that's ok as long as I'm still getting some milk and water in there? I'm assuming the sugar is why he's so anal about me not drinking soda, but if you think otherwise let me know.



</question>



<additional details>



He said the baby is measuring 2 weeks ahead. Like he is where he should be in 2 weeks. And I'm trying so hard with the milk. If its ice ice cold I can drink a 64 oz cup of it, but I have to guzzle it in about 2 seconds or I won't finish it and then it leaves that milk taste in my mouth and the only way to get rid of that is drink something else flavored. I can't win. lol

I have to say I NEVER drink diet (sugar-free) sodas (like Sprite Zero) because most artificial sweeteners are far worse for you than sugar (the debate is still out on Splenda - seems safe so far but aspartame and most others have been proven unsafe.) I don't know why your doc would freak out about drinking regular soda unless your glucose test results are giving you a reason to cut back - and in that case you would know, right?



And actually caffeine is considered safe during pregnancy, just don't overdose - no more than 200mg a day when I think a can of coke has like 55mg? My midwife actually recommended having a little something with caffeine if tylenol doesn't work for headaches - and it has helped me even though I was never a big caffeine drinker so it wasn't a withdrawal thing.



If you are seriously drinking a ton of soda every day then yeah it IS a good idea to cut back, especially in the long run when you're not even having to worry about a baby inside you, but just to generally be healthier... I don't usually have more than 1 can a day, usually less than that - but I'm a big water drinker. Just get used to drinking more water and it's as easy as a craving-filled adjustment period.



If you are having problems with the sugar tolerance thing which your doc's should have told you after your glucose tolerance test, some fancy soda brands like Hansen's and I think Blue Sky (both are in the natural/organic section of my supermarket) have regular cane sugar in them instead of high fructose corn syrup. While I don't think it's a whole lot better for you cuz they are still both processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup is one of the worst sugars out there for you in how your body processes it. And ask your doc why he's so anal about soda - if it's just sugar then he should have told you to cut back on juice and other flavored beverages as well.



By the way I don't drink milk! I get it in my cereal and I have other dairy like cheese and stuff but I don't like to drink milk unless it's in a nice chocolate milkshake or something - don't force yourself!

If you go into the alcohol area of a supermarket, look for the carbonated water. I used to drink alot of soda but figured out what it was that I actually liked was just the carbonation. You can add a little lime/lemon/crystal lite to any can of carbonated water and it tastes great, has bubbles, and is fat/calorie/sugar/caffeine free! Even try some crushed up mint in it with a squeeze of lime. Very good and HEALTHY!!!! The Albertsons brand carbonated 6 packs are about $1.50.

Did he not tell you why he didn't want you drinking caffeine free sodas?  I wouldn't drink sugar free because they put aspartame or artificial sweeteners in them and they are definitely not good for you when you are pregnant.

well, sugar free contains artificial sweeteners which you aren't supposed to have in excess, that could also be why he is bothered by it.  Just do what he says, you don't have much longer to go.  Trust me, I have gestational diabetes and I can't have anything sweet, it absolutely kills me, but I just keep telling myself that my baby is more important than my cravings, and I can wait just 6 more weeks until after he arrives.

To the person that said all root beer has no caffeine- wrong. Barq's root beer (regular, not diet) has caffeine. It's the caffeine they're talking about in the commercials when they say "Barq's has bite!". Also, Sunkist orange soda has caffeine, and diet Sunkist has MORE. I broke one of my pregnant friends heart when I told her her diet Sunkist was worse than Mt Dew.



Diet Barq's has 0 caffeine, but then you're ingesting artificial sweetners which aren't a great idea either.



In reference to the above answer- just make sure to not get tonic water containing quinine, it is NOT recommended for pregnant women by some doctors. Ask yours before you drink any.

Has anyone been on bedrest? how do you handle it?



I've only been on bedrest for about 2 days but I'm finding it so hard.  I was put on bedrest after going into preterm labor (12 weeks) with my triplets, im on a bunch of medication and IVs and injections galore.  How did you deal with this? I know I'm complaining but I really hate being away from my baby boy at night and my fiance is working alot.  I do have alot of company during the day and my mother in law is staying with me at night.  While my sister in law and fiance have our boy at night. they'll switch it up to where my fiance stays with me at night and our baby stays with gammy (MIL) and auntie some nights



I can't stop blaming myself for putting my family into this situation.  I feel like I'm not bonding with my son aymore he's only 4months (im 12 weeks pregnant, got pregnant really soon after he was born).  I had to stop breastfeeding him and get him on a bottle with the breast milk that i pumped.  So it feels like I've pushed him away and that he's not important.  I don't want him to grow up and feel like i did that to him.  He's my world, i just can't breastfeed him...



Ill stop rambling on but here are some questions



how did you get through this?
how did you pass the time?
did it get alittle bit easier to deal with as time went on?



if your going to answer, please only serious answers.  i really dont need a lecture about how i shouldnt have waited to get pregnant awhile after my son was born.  It happened, I'm dealing with it.  I know how young I am, I don't need people to point it out.  We have alot of support from my fiances side of the family and our church except for my parents.



anyways, thanks so much in advance

Feelings after abortion?



PLEASE REFRAIN FROM JUDGING



I know this is a controversial subject and everyone wants to have their say on it, but I ask that only women who have had an abortion respond to this question-  I thank you for your consideration.



What were your honest feelings after the abortion? Did you feel relieved? Guilty? Did you feel confident that you made the right decision?



And also, can you tell me about your religious background?  Were you raised in a religious family?

that person was mean! dont listen to them!  personally i feel that babbies deserve a great start in life and if it cant be given to them or if you fear menitlly you wouldnt be a good mother then sometimes abortion is what you have to do. yes you may fel guilty but its sometimes better off for the unborn one esp if you have no support.

So uhh, anyone who is going to complain about someone asking an abortion question in the pregnancy section..why does it matter? she has the right to ask, just as you have to right to ask your questions.  there is no abortion forum on here..so where else is she going to go? you have no right to be mean when people ask this kind of question, she just wants an honest answer and doesn't need any of you to b*tch at her.  if you don't like the question, don't answer it.

You know what I agree to her statement, Women who have gone through abortion are facing a lot...anyway here's an article that I hope could answer your questions



After Abortion



After an abortion, you may experience a wide range of emotions. For many, having an abortion causes feelings of intense loss and grief. These feelings may occur immediately after your abortion or may occur several years after your abortion. If left untreated, these negative feelings can progress into what is called Post-Abortion Syndrome. It is a good idea to seek counseling if you experience any of the following signs of Post-Abortion Syndrome:



* Refuse to talk with others about your abortion



* Unexplained anxiety or irritability



* Outbursts of anger or rage



* Anger or bitterness with people who where involved with your abortion



* Disturbed sleep



* Nightmares, flashbacks or hallucinations that remind you of babies



* Irrational fear of loved ones being hurt, injured or killed



* Withdrawal from relationships or family members



* Difficulty with relationships, particularly with the opposite sex



* Avoidance of children



* Disinterest in activities that you once enjoyed



* Lack of desire to care for yourself



* Sexual dysfunction



* Suicidal thoughts or tendencies



* Increase in drug or alcohol use



* Eating disorders



* Depression, anxiety or physical discomfort around the anniversary of your abortion or the due date of your aborted pregnancy



* Personality shift, you are not the same person you were before the abortion



STEPS TO HEALING



If you are experiencing grief after your abortion, even if it happened years ago, emotional healing is possible. Even though you may regret past actions, you can begin to make healthy choices now that will help you heal and cope. Emotional healing is a process that takes time and usually requires assistance from a counselor or support group, but you can get started on your healing by taking one or more of these steps:



* Find a support group or counselor



* Admit the truth about your abortion



* Admit any feelings of remorse or guilt



* Allow yourself to grieve the loss of your child



* Talk about your experience with others



* Honestly explore your feelings about your abortion



* Honestly explore your feelings about the people involved with your abortion



* Accept God’s forgiveness



* Forgive others who were involved with your abortion



* Forgive yourself



* Reconcile relationships that have been affected by the abortion



* Let go of your lost child



* Find creative outlets that allow you to express your feelings such as writing, music, drawing, etc.



* Spend time with others on the anniversary of your abortion, don’t stay alone



* Pray

I'm 57 and have 2 grown daughters. When I was 18, it was the 70's and abortions just became "legal". I was scared and alone..and that at the time seemed like an easy way out. Lots of girls was doing it. New York was the only State to do it at the time. I flew up there myself, with money I borrowed.



Since it was a new proceedure..when they did it I was surrounded by a crowd of doctors. Ya I was pregnant, but I was shy and this was horrible. Half way thru the proceedure, I awoke , was drossy, but could see what was going on ..and I'll spare you the gorey details.



Afterwards I was put in a room with other girls and was told I needed to leave. I walked to the front desk, cramping, and called a cab and went back to the hotel and sleep for days.



Its been 37 yrs. and I STILL cry on the anniversery of that day. I STILL think about it..alot. Me...I killed a baby..thats what I did..some people make it sound simple and uneffecting..but Im here to tell you,,itll always be with you..and someday I'll have to face God with what I did to one of his children.

Honestly til this day I am struggling majorly because I didnt think it was going to be that emotional for me so I kinda brushed it under the carpet and my whole life wound up becoming out of whack because of it. I do not regret my choice in any way shape or form but I do regret that I didnt prepare myself for how emotional I would have been. If I could go back in time I would have saw a therapist from the very day the procedure was done. Til this day (7 months later) I am still not the same. I am not religious.

My wife is 26 weeks pregnant and doesn't want to have sex?



We haven't had sex since she was 23 weeks. She says she's uncomfortable and it hurts and all this nonsense. I don't know how to tell her I want some without making her feel like crap. Do you think I could ask for oral sex or will that offend her? I feel like she's not living up to her sexual duties towards me but i don't want to be an a** about it yet.

Until that baby comes out, she has no duties. You are like her slave because she is the one that will have to go through the agonizing pain of childbirth, not you. Some people go years without having sex. I think you can manage a few weeks.

I think you should try to understand her pain. She has a growing child inside of her which is enough to ask of her! but you want sex as well? I understand its a part of what we all want, but try to relate. Take this period as a time of challenge. IT SHOULDN'T be that hard to not have sex. If she can squeeze out something the size of a watermelon out of a lemon, im sure you can go for a few months without sex!

When she's pregnant,, her "sexual duties towards you" take a breather..
she's pregnant.. and its uncomfortable for her to have sex.. it hurts her apparently.. so its not crap..
sex is supposed to make you both feel good..



but if it hurts her, whats the point?
just for you to feel good,,,?  thats selfish and wrong that you'd hurt her for your own pleasure.  Use the time honored tradition of masturbation to hold you over for a little while.  Its not like its the end of the world if you go 3 weeks without having sex with your PREGNANT wife.

It could be that she is insecure, perhaps it would help if you reassure her, i know as i women there is nothing better than a supportive partner, maybe sit down and have a talk with her, as her body changes she may not be feeling like her usual self, you need to let her know that you understand and obviously if you want to have sex with her that you are attracted her.
Good luck and congrats on the baby!

I can relate to your wife.  When I'm pregnant, I'm extremely sensitive and sex is extremely uncomfortable and sometimes painful.  However, I did talk to my husband to let him know that I did care about his feelings but he needed to understand mine.  Sometimes all he got was a hand job.  I also reminded him that he has two hands too and I was the one carrying OUR baby.  Also, I told him that when he did chores and helped out around the house without being asked, that helped me relax and want to do something "special" for him... hint, hint!  Good luck!  FYI:  I'm 30 years old and we now have two kids and I'm still waiting to hit my sexual peak so my husband doesn't have to beg for "special" time.  I feel bad for him sometimes.  Just be patient and remember that doing the dishes is like foreplay for some of us women.

look hun, babies are uncomfortable! they hurt, they make you feel miserable at times with hormones and sickness, they make you feel heavy and akward. unless you have gone through anything remotely similar, you cannot understand. obviously she has been living up to her "sexual duties" as she is pregnant!!!! give her some space and dont pressure her, she is making a little miracle happen and this is the mother of your baby! how would like someone speaking this way about your daughter when she is older? im sure you would think its wrong.
but talk to her about why she doesnt want to, and approach the subject gently and with a little more etiqutte than this question! things like spending time allowing her to be ready, different positions and taking things slowly and gently can help. failing that, she is your wife and there is a LOT more to marriage than sex. just be grateful she is giving you the wonderful gift of a child and back off her, you wont have to wait forever a few months wont kill you.

Hi...



Oral sex might be worse ( I felt like thrwing up for teh first 4 months and then some... )



I'd suggest you give her a massage, and tend to her... It will make her feel good... and the better she feels the more likely you will be to get some! A nice massage can make her feel sexy again too... as we tend to tart feeling fat as we progress through our pregnancy...



Focus on her, instead of yourself, and she'll be much more receptive I think... :) (I know I was *wink*)

With our 1st daughter, my wife was a complete nymph, but with our next child (also a girl), she was the same as your wife, come to find out that sometimes they are a little drier inside than usual, although you can't tell, and it causes them extreme pain and discomfort, so I would have to say that she's quite probably telling you the truth and you can talk to her gynecologist and see what they might prescribe, that may solve everything for you both.

Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping.



Other Explanations: Actual menstruation, altered menstruation, changes in birth control pill, infection, or abrasion from intercourse.

Delay/Difference in Menstruation:
A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.



Other Explanations: Excessive weight gain/loss, fatigue, hormonal problems, tension, stress, ceasing to take the birth control pill, or breast-feeding.



Swollen/Tender Breasts:
Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen.



Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance, birth control pills, impending menstruation (PMS) can also cause your breasts to be swollen or tender.



Fatigue/Tiredness:
Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception.



Other Explanations: Stress, exhaustion, depression, common cold or flu, or other illnesses can also leave you feeling tired or fatigued.



Nausea/Morning Sickness:
This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.



Other Explanations: Food poisoning, stress, or other stomach disorders can also cause you to feel queasy.



Backaches:
Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy.



Other Explanations: Impending menstruation, stress, other back problems, and physical or mental strains.



Headaches:
The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy.



Other Explanations: Dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, impending menstruation, eye strain, or other ailments can be the source of frequent or chronic headaches.



Frequent Urination:
Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom.



Other Explanations: Urinary tract infection, diabetes, increasing liquid intake, or taking excessive diuretics.



Darkening of Areolas:
If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker.



Other Explanations: Hormonal imbalance unrelated to pregnancy or may be a leftover effect from a previous pregnancy.



Food Cravings:
While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy



It's different for every woman and every pregnancy. Also consider the size of the baby and the way your body is carrying it. Some women start showing at 4-6 months

You won't see very much.  Basically the doc will check that the gestational sac is in the right place (i.e. in your uterus and not in one of your tubes) and you might see a tiny blob inside the gestational sac.  that is called the fetal pole.



It is probably too early to see a heartbeat, but you might get lucky - depending on the doctor's equipment.



Best of luck with your pregnancy.

I had my 6 weeks scan on the 8th of August and my baby looked like a bat,
it was hung upside down and the sonographer said did you see that and im like no she said there is the heart beat i said ok then.
its difficult to make the baby out its like a blob and i really could not see the heart beat,



some women go at 6 weeks and there is Just yolk sac which is still normal it just means the next time you go back bubs will be there,

I would say 18 months is a good time to try and conceive the 2nd as you never know it could take a while for it to happen



My partner and i started talking about trying to conceive our second when our first was 8 months, by the time she was 11 months we found out i was pregnant.



We wanted them close together so they could learn play and grow up together.



Everyone will have there own views on the kind of question but each to there own.

I think that is a really good gap. I left it for to long, i'v just had my 2nd child 10wks ago and i have got a four year old. That is a big gap and wish that i had done it earlier. Hopefully i won't leave it that long for my 3rd. It's up to you and your personal lifestyle. Mine was to late i was back into work and my career was coming before having anymore children. It's a hard decision when will it ever be the right time to have another one really.

Do you mean is it possible to get pregnant after 2 months giving birth??? YES it is and it actully happened to me. 3 months later after having my daughter I found out I was pregnant again and it was a complete shock. I always heard that after having a baby you are more fertile because everything is open or some other way I heard it and I payed no mind to it but look where i am now.lol. Im 33wks  6days pregnant with my second child and Im due in November.

Yes there is a chance.  Breast feeding is supposed to reduce fertility but the bounce back effect from the hormones of pregnancy being suddenly absent can make you super fertile.  Use contraception.

I know that a woman should get a Pap test every year, but I need to know what test I should get from the doctor in order to make sure that if I'm ready to have a baby, there won't be any complications. I think it has something to do with testing for cervical cancer or something like that.

To be perfectly safe, you should also use another form of contraception within the first cycle of the pill.  If you have just started taking the pill, use extra conctraception until you start the first day of your next pill packet.

You need to take 7 pills in a row for them to be affective. If you miss one pill at anytime you need to start back at taken 7 pills in a row for them to work. If you have unprotected sex in that time before taking 7 in a row you could fall pregnant.

You could request a blood test or an ultra sound.



However, you could also be experiencing a false pregnancy. Women who desperately want a baby can trick their bodies into thinking they are pregnant. This is known as Pseudocyesis. It goes as far as breast tenderness, morning sickness, periods stop, craving foods, the abdomen can grow larger, and your breasts can grow larger.  Often, the only way to reverse this is to prove to the women that she is not pregnant through an ultra sound. Counseling is also recommended in treatment of this.

It all depends on when you took the test&gt; is your period late? and if so, how late?  I went to the hospital when i was pregnant with my son and i was already 6 weeks.. they did a regular urine test..but no blood test and it said that i was NOT pregnant.  I didn't find out until I took a blood test. The same with the one I'm pregnant with now.. I would get a blood test taken if I were you.  Good Luck!

Throwing up and sleeping a lot can be a sign of MANY things.  It doesn't mean you are pregnant.  If you've taken a test and it's negative, you aren't pregnant.  It is very common for women to mistake symptoms of other things for pregnancy symptoms, especially if you want to be pregnant.  The mind is a powerful thing and plays tricks easily.

i think you're being a bit foolish to want to have a baby before graduating college or even getting married.  you clearly do not understand the responsibilities and difficulties in raising a child.  if you want to give your child a good future, finish your degree, get a good job and get married so the baby will not be an illegitimate offspring.

You should wait until you're married.  How come you are not married after all this time?  I hope this all works out for the best though.  Why would you refuse to have a baby after 30?  That doesn't make any sense.  It's very important to wait until marriage.

If he isn't ready yet there isn't anything you can do unfortunately. If you were to get pregnant when he isnt ready it will probably cause a great stress on your relationship and maybe even be the end of it. Also please take my word for it, we had our first by accident when my fiance was still at uni, it made it difficult for him, now I am doing uni and I really wish I had done it before I became a mother, it would have been so much easier.

Sounds like you're not ready at all, which is probably why he doesn't want to get you pregnant.  You don't make much money, and neither of you are done with college.  And you're not married yet.  If your intention is to get married, why not do that first?



Since you "refuse to have kids once you turn 30", then you are clearly not ready now, because that's a really silly statement.

Yes, I got pregnant on the Depo-Vera Shot.  It is the same medication that the birth control pill has.  So, I must tell you, I had my shot early November and conceived the end of December.  I'm not one of those that had the Depo shot and then it expired and I didn't get it right away and said well, it was supposed to really be good for up to 4-5 months.  No, that is BS and I don't think people should be saying they got pregnant while on the Depo if they didn't take it as directed by doctors.  I was a true case and the doctors said I am very rare.  The only birth control they could recommend for me that was long lasting was the IUD.  I had that taken out in June and conceived in August.  It does happen. I was happy with the IUD.  My doctors just said I am really fertile, but it does happen.

Coughing is not a pregnancy symptom.



You can't really do anything at this stage.  If your period is late, either do an HPT or see your doctor.

I've always learned it's safe about 5 days before and 5 days after your period.  Just make sure the guy withdraws and I guess you'll be fine.  Be sure you're not ovulating though.  Try thecyclepages.com to keep track of when you're fertile and when you're not :)

there are support groups that deal with helping people who abort then go through bad feelings. its quite common. the what if feeling or did i do the wrong thing. sometimes you actually have to grieve for the loss in order to get fully over it. many go to a counceller for a cupple of secions. sorry for my spelling here

Your hormonnes will be up and down for at least a year and you will have days or weeks like this.  It is also a special time which prompts you and you do need to grieve.



It maybe worth having a chat with your doctor - he maybe able to suggest some councilling or mild antidepressant.

I don't think your body could tell. Sometimes after abortion you don't think about it for ages, and then quite suddenly months down the line you can find yourself thinking about it a lot, and that's totally normal.



I think it might be something else making you feel emotional, but you're attributing it to what happened, as it takes a while to move on from abortion.

what is done is done, at the time i am sure you thought it was right and maybe was.  you will never forget, the pain you are feeling now is due to the baby would have been born around now, you are thinking what if.  this has probably been in your head all the time, subconsciously.



is this regret just recent? then give yourself time to mourn, if you still feel like this see your doctor, he will refer you to someone who can help you. sometimes talking to someone helps you analise things better.



i am sure you will get some harsh comments on here, just ignore them, each person has to deal with life differently.

Hi Hon.... do not pay any attention to the malicious posters on here, it's your body & your decision, they don't know your circumstances, they are not you and do not have the right to pass judgement



Sounds like you need to get some counselling & talk to somebody though.  Try your GP or use the link here:



http://www.careconfidential.com/



Previous poster is possibly right too, you will get some unthinking people on here who will give your their sanctimonious opinions, try not to let it upset you & in time you will feel better.



I really do feel for you, it's not an easy decison to make & you're very brave to admit you need some help.

I think all the people that are saying she shouldn't have got an abortion are being a little unfair.  Unless you have been there then you wouldn't understand.  People have lots of different reasons and have abortions at different stages.  I'm gonna keep my opinions on abortion to myself as I don't believe it is helpful to this question.  If you don't believe in it then keep your opinions to yourself as it's not gonna help this situation.



I would suggest that you go and see a doctor and maybe talk it through with somebody.  The sub-conscience mind is a very powerful thing and it could be that you have realised in the back of your mind that the baby would have been born yesterday.  Remind yourself of the reason that you did it in the first place - there's no point in having regrets because what you did at the time was the right thing for you at the time.  Talk to friends about it and just remember, it would have been worse to bring a child into the world that wasn't 100% wanted.  Good luck x

I really feel for you. Your body won't know any different, but your mind might, somewhere right at the back of things you have tried to bury.



You will always feel some regret and sadness for what has happened, but you have to remember that you had your reasons for doing what you did, and it cannot be changed now. All you can do is try to ensure you do not find yourself in that situation again until you are ready, to save yourself from any extra heart-ache.



There is no point in anybody judging you on here, because, you've already said you regret it and are sad, so probably nobody can make you feel any worse, or be a harsher judge of you, than you are yourself.



I think talking to somebody about the way you're feeling might help you come to terms with what happened. You will never get over it, but it will get easier with time.

Well I'm not going to judge you but I really frown on abortions unless something is seriously wrong with the baby and it wouldnt have a very good life then I would have an abortion but if I didnt want the baby I would have just gave it up for adouption it sounds as if you are regretting having an abortion and your body is just going along with your mind I know that when I get really stressed out my stomach starts to hurt very bad so maybe its just kinda like that I'm not really sure but maybe next time you should just really really think about other solutions like adouption next time I'm not trying to judge you or anything but just you know what I mean

condoms however are the best way to protect against any STD's :)

EDIT: and the person who said 'pull out!' that's a dumb idea too cos there's such a thing as pre-ejeculati0n which means your p3nis can seep semen before even entering a woman and if any comes into contact - even the smallest ammount can get a lady pregnant!

Condoms are not 100% effective. There is still a chance they might break or have some other sort of defect in them.



However, it does also depend on what you mean by 'safe.' If anything, you can be asking if it would be okay for you to be using a latex condom if you're allergic.Obviously not, but i'm just stating the obvious(:



Nonetheless both female and male condoms are generally safe. Just don't wear two at once, or use them together.

Well, hormones can trigger all sorts of things.



But it is common knowledge that you are "slightly" (depending on the person I guess?) more fertile when you've just quit the pill.



So, I'd just wait to see the testresults, and even when they are positive, go see a doctor afterwards.

1) did you have sex? 2) are you unusualy tired? If yes to the first - it is possible. If yes to both - it is getting more likely. Go to Planned Parenthood and find out. But don't let them talk you into an abortion if you really, truly want to keep the baby or would rather give it up for adoption.

its a easy to fix problemb and you both shouldnt have to go through it. like 2 in 10 men cant get it hard before they come. its just a doctors trip away and much recearch has been done to provide treatments. however if he comes outside the vigina then getting pregnant is verry hard indeed. it would take sooo long if it even did work. please if you love him get him help so he can enjoy sex and make it better for you. even a mens clinic as they deal with it so much.

i don't think the quality of the sperm would be affected but it is definitely more effective to have the sperm delivered fully into the vagina as it will then have less distance to travel



not to be too personal but i think your husband should see a doctor as it is abnormal and finding a solution could brings you closer and better your sex life.

Why don't people understand that if you've had sex, you could get pregnant?



Whether some form of protection has been used or not, you can still get pregnant and catch STDs. (Granted the chances are more limited but it's still perfectly possible.)



Why do so many people not understand this?

I'm assuming this question stems from reading all the "am I pregnant" questions here on yahoo...  I don't know if they just aren't educating the youth anymore.. or there's a big difference from state to state.. because I was aware of sex and it's consequences when I was younger.

So long as you're not nauseous, drink orange juice or find some vitamin C tablets.  You want to strengthen yours and the babies immune systems as much as possible and vitamin C is the best way to do it.  Try to get the right nutrition and drink LOTS of fluids.  I know it's hard to have to pee even more when you're already pregnant, but the more liquids go in, the more germs they take out.  Best of luck, get all the rest you can, take good care of yourself, and enlist someone to make you a great big pot of chicken soup, none of that canned stuff.  Hope you feel better soon!

I feel so bad for u honey.
I have been ill twice now with the flu and i am 25 weeks pregnant and both times i just wanted to die.
Its a pain in the bum that after all these years they still havnt come up with something for pregnant woman to take when it makes u feel worse that u cant do anything about it.



Just wait till the headaches start from blowing ur nose and coughing at the same time - thats when ur defo going to need them paracetamol tablets.



If i was u, i would go buy urself now a V Shaped pillow for sleeping with, i didnt have 1 the first time i was ill and i was ill for 3 weeks with it cause i couldnt sleep at night laying flat with blowing my nose all the time with it being blocked and coughing - but when i was ill 2 weeks ago with the flu i had my pillow and slept better cause i was sort of sat up in bed so made breathing alot easiser for me.



Thinkings to give a try to help u cope till the flu goes away:
1) V- Shaped pillow.
2) Keep warm at all times.
3) Try having a bath/shower first thing in the morning - the warm water will heat ur chest up to make ur day easier for blowing ur nose and getting everything up off ur lungs.
4) Drink hot water with a tea spoon full of suger in it.
5) Get urself some vapour rub for ur chest.
6) Get some olbas oil and put some on some tissue and carry it around with u.



If u have a sore throat aswell - get some Merocaine.
They are safe for pregnant woman to use - i couldnt of coped without them both times.



Hope u feel better soon honey.
Love Manda xXx

As I no that the bleeding isnt usually real when on the patch or pill. I had a few days when I did not have my patch on twice in a 3 week cycle and my breasts are sore but when I took the patch off I did come on but could I be pregnant.... What do you think the chances are seriously?

The likelihood she is pregnant is very slim if you did it during bleeding.  but there is always a chance if you are having unprotected ***.  If this is something you are going to worry about, maybe the 2 of you shouldn't have been doing it in the first place or should have at least used protection.  This business of "with my friend" is disappointing.  You really should save acts like this for the person you are with.  Then maybe a pregnancy wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if it happened by accident.  I don't blame you and I'm not criticizing I'm just hoping you think about it next time.



If she doesn't get her period on time the next time, have her take a home pregnancy test and/or see a doctor(free women's clinics can help with this too and they are in most areas).

Have you had a period since 13 weeks ago?  If the home test was neg. then you could have had a false neg.  If you aren't having your period you should go to your doc. There could be something else wrong and the last thing you need to worry about would be an unwanted pregnancy.  Birth Control pills are not going to be safe for you if you have something else going on that needs to be checked out.  But if you are on a high dosage it may have slowed your bleeding to where you don't really have your cycle and you aren't preg. or having a period.  You really need to see your doc. and have them explain all this to you and make sure everything is ok with you.

The only pill that I think you're thinking of, is the morning after pill.  This can only be taken up to 3 days after you've had sex.  The normal pill won't do anything if you suspect that you are pregnant.



Pregnancy tests can't tell you with total accuracy if you are expecting or not, it's harder for them to give a good reading if you take it soon after sex (there are many different brands as well).



Do what a couple of the others have suggested, go to your GP for a second opinion (go with a urine sample), also they can give you confidential advice.  If you're a bit worried about it all, take a close friend just to be there for you.

Once you are already pregnant, there are no birth control pills you can take to make you un-pregnant. The method in which you are talking about is only effective to stop implantation of the egg into the uterus. This usually happens within 72 hours. So at 13 weeks you are well over that threshold. Once the egg has implanted it has no effect. There is nothing you can do at home to control your pregnancy at this stage - only a doctor can help. Blood tests will be accurate at this stage, your doctor will take them



IF you are not pregnant, then make sure you take your birth control regularly and on time from now on so you do not get into this situation in pregnancy.

I had this cramping with both of my sons early on just like you, its one of those pregnancy niggles that no one seems to warn you about. i was constantly checking that my period had'nt started until someone else told me it was normal. its just the uterus stretching for the baby.

Hey there,



With both of my pregnancies i had what sounds to be the same thing you are suffering from. For me they felt like bad period cramps.



All should be just fine but I would call your doctor's office and ask to speak with the OB nurse on duty in the morning. The nurses are usually pretty awesome with answering questions over the phone!



Good luck!

When can I buy a cot?



I am 15+4, have found a cot I love - but thinking it is a bit early to buy cots yet? Im planning on having baby in cot straight away - so no crib e.t.c so i will need cot before baby is born. But I have MC in April so Im a bit warry about jinxing anything too soon.
When can I buy it??

Laura - Thanks for your advice but Im quite certain that wont happen to be. I dont have a problem with co slepping - but it didnt work for me (I have a 4 yr old and a 5yr old) so baby will definetly be going into a cot! Thanks anyway! :-)

it's never too early to start planning as the time flies in before you know it.  if you are concerned you can keep it at a relatives until you need it. I bought mine when I was around 6 months but felt it was awkward to carry and assemble with my big bump.

You buy whenever it is convinient for you. Its not too early now. But do you have the space to store it at your house? and also will it be torture for you having to wait so long to have your little baby in it?!



Also as you progress in your pregnancy you'll get reeeeeeally tired and may not want to trapse around the shops!

I haven't got mine yet but I'm putting my son in a moses basket first so don't need it till after he's here really so I'm in no rush.
I think you should get it when you want to. Trust me, its nice to have a few things ready because I sometimes used to wake up in a panic wondering if I had everything!! So do it when you want to :)

I dont think its ever to early to buy ur cot honey.
Me and my husband got our babies cot before i was even pregnant and had it set up in the room lol (i set the cot up on my own and it toke me 6 goes as it hard to do on my own).
We had started trying for a baby and i started thinking that i wanted to get 90% of everything we needed so i wasnt doing it when we were pregnant which turned out to be a blessing cause i was in bed ill till i was 20 weeks pregnant.



If u want to get anything now - get it.
I already have the babies room set up as i started before i was pregnant, we already have the pram in the living room set up cause my mum and dad got it last month for us and we have all the clothes the baby needs till hes is 1 lol.



Just enjoy buying all the baby stuff u need honey and get it all set up as fast as u can and enjoy looking at it - makes everything seem so real that u have a baby on the way :)

Well I can only give you my experiences- we bought a gorgeous and expensive cot when I was only about 8 weeks gone, it took pride of place in the nursery all ready to be slept in.....our daughter never once slept in it as once she was born the thought of putting her in it and leaving her on her own turned my stomach!



We ended up giving it away to a friend, and we still co-sleep (out of choice) to this day :)

even after just 1 depo shot it can take atleast 4 months to get a peroid. it takes most upto a year. you would know in your heavy swollen breasts by now if you were pregnant! that moving feeling is prob just a nerve you pulled however take a 60 secound test just to put your mind at ease so you can sleep easy.

Actually this may not be the pregnancy.  You might have pseudo pregnancy i.e. u might have a bulk muscle pain in stomach and hence u are feeling u r pregnant.
Another thing when u r pregnant u should get ur periods.  So it may not be Pragnancy.

I think it all depends on ur body honey - if ur not pregnant but ur body is playing up and trying to act like it is -  U could be having a fake pregnancy where ur body thinks its pregnant cause u have been thinking about it so much.



I had sort of the same thing happen to me when i was 17 - periods stopped, but pregnancy tests were saying i wasnt pregnant and it went on for agers and in the end the doctor sent me for a scan and there was nothing there, even tho i would of been 4 months gone and i was starting to show and my breasts started leaking milk they ended up putting me on a different pill to control my body.

You know what's pretty crazy is I had TWO friends who were pregnant and did not know it -- One found out when she WENT INTO LABOR!!! the other found out at 6 months. It's possible but you should have the doctor do a blood test to make sure. A home pregnancy test should be accurate though as you should have enough hcg in your system by now....I don't know -- definitely have bloodwork done! Good luck hunny!!! :)

Having a waterbirth is known to decrease the pain.  It helps ease contractions and because you float in water, it helps to make you feel "lighter".  The water can also make it easier for you to stretch, making it easier for your baby to come out.  Water is a wonderful thing for birth.  Not that it will take all the pain away, but it can be tremendously helpful.

Being pregnant and giving birth is not for the weak of heart. That's one reason I never did it. If you really hate pain, keep taking your birth control because there is some pain no matter what, from the onset of morning sickness through the birth, and afterward too.



Water births help take the edge off the pain and stress for the mother but mostly they make it easier on the baby being born. Midwives can offer this service but not sure if you can have a water birth in a regular hospital.



If you work with a midwife you pretty much agree to not having any painkillers but they focus largely on prenatal care so that you have a healthy pregnancy and labor. They also teach you all kinds of things to get relaxed and get through the pain, and so do Lamaze classes.



If you have an epidural, well...you get dulled from the waist down but you are still awake and feeling enough to push.



These are all pain management strategies for delivering the baby...you get full local anesthesia if you have a C-section because this is officially surgery.

I am planning a water birth. I had one on a bed 3 years ago and cannot do that again. I have heard the warm water does take the edge off the pain, helps you relax, helps your perineum stretch, and helps you stay in a good position for longer.

I'm about 37 weeks, and I woke up in horrible pain?? Could it be labor?



I woke up with menstrual like cramps - intense - my back aches, and my stomach is totally rock hard. I went to the bathroom, but it didn't make it any better. I tried to lay down and shift from one side to the other but it didn't make anything better, it almost made it worse? It's been pretty consistent - like ever since I woke up 20 minutes ago, and I just had a minute here where everything subsided, but it came back on again for a moment the same menstrual cramping and back aching and hard stomach. Is menstrual-like cramping labor? Or BH? Lol I need to know since it's a 40 minute drive to my hospital!! Any ideas?

I would call the emergency room and talk to one of them. personally I would think you're going into labor but to make sure you have to keep time of your contraction but since your 40 minutes away from a hospital i wouldnt wait till they get 5 minutes apart, i'd go earlier.

They wont be the same for sure but however the usual is that each labor get faster! Being that your body knows the drill! Also it depends on how long between, size of baby, and baby's position! Things like that mater! Good luck!

Well you can't get much quicker than an 'under an hour' labour and it's supposed to get easier with each delivery :)

My first two labors were also fast (under a hour) and my third was faster than both of them. I didn't even have time to get an epidural it was so fast. My water broke and I made it to the hospital within 10 mins and I had her 13 mins later. My first two are by my ex-husband and my third is with my current husband so that didn't make a difference. I am hoping for a fast labor with #4 but not that fast. Good luck and Congrats.

Every hour counts! If taken as directed within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sex, Plan B reduces the chance of pregnancy by up to 89%. About 7 out of every 8 women who would have gotten pregnant will not get pregnant. And it works even better if you take it within the first 24 hours after unprotected sex. The first pill should be taken as soon as possible, and the second pill 12 hours later.



So that added to the fact that he pulled out, you have a very slim chance of getting pregnant. You most likely won't because pulling out is 70% effective, and if he knows how to pull out, you have nothing to worry about because that makes it higher than just 70%.

Hello, you have 72 hours to take the Plan B pill. It is 75% effective if taken right away. The longer you wait, the less effective it will be. Take it right now :)

Depends on who you ask? Personally i don't think it is reliable because of the countless stories I have heard of pregnancy occurring!  What I can tell you is if you don't take all the meds and don't take it before 24 hours that the the chance of pregnancy is still high! Personally I wouldn't use it because of the risk of pregnancy still happening and the danger of having it hurt the baby! Your choice though!

I know a girl who is 17 weeks pregnant and she looks normal, and then there was a girl at my school who was only 11 weeks and she looked like she was already 20 weeks..

I am 25 weeks pregnant now and i only really popped around 20 weeks.
I wouldnt buy any new pants cause i didnt see the point as i am not made of money so i was just buying new tops as my breasts were getting better so i needed the room uptop so i was just pulling up the zips on my pants and hiding it with long stylish tops.

i was size 14/16 and i had to go around with my trousers undone, buy yourself some maternity clothes, you'll feel a lot better, don't wait until the time you feel it is normal to buy them i.e. after about 4-5 months,  you'll love the first pair of trousers you put on after you've been wearing tight ones for a while and you'll wonder why you didn't buy them earlier



maternity clothes are expensive though, but look out for sales, i was lucky cos they had a really good sale at mothercare when i decided i was ready, i think they have regular sales so keep checking them out

That all depends, but in the third trimester, I would say that since you're so close, the doctor and dentist would both want you to wait until the baby is born.



I do know that you can't get your wisdom teeth pulled while being pregnant since they have to give you anesthesia.

186/79 is too high, especially at 16 wks but 80/64 is too low so go and see your doctor NOW! Don't take any medication until you've seen him. If your doc is too busy to see you today go to the nearest hospital or clinic and see a doc there. good luck

Your blood pressure was very high at the start, but there is nothing wrong with having a low blood pressure, my blood pressure during my second pregnancy was 80/60 and perfectly normal, it was only when i was 30 weeks and it jumped up to 140, that it became dangerous. Don't worry yourself, a low blood pressure can cause headaches, so take things in your stride and only worry if it is high.
Look after yourself

My blood pressure was exactly the same (80/64) on Friday when i went in for a check up...I went to the clinic at work because I was feeling dizzy..nauseous and had a headache.



I naturally have low blood pressure and just have to make sure that I stay hydrated and eat something kind of often.

I had low blood pressure through all 3 of my pregnancies, occasionally resembling the 80/64 reading you gave, my midwife would always tell me to go careful but there wasn't much she could do about it, it would get so bad that i'd faint when out and about. However all 3 of my pregnancies went well, the labours were natural and quick and i have 3 healthy happy children to show for it including my youngest who's just 11 weeks. Despite all the problems with the blood pressure being too low there was never any problems with the baby, the risk was more to myself then to them. Just make sure you keep hydrated, don't overheat or stand for too long.

oh gosh. well, all girls have vaginal discharge because the vagina is a self-cleansing organ. sometimes when that discharge is exposed to oxygen or whatever in the air, it can turn yellow. if things smell, there's a problem. otherwise, i don't know.

Vagina is dry could mean shes just not turned on, or has a medical condition.
Yellow Residue could just be pee from where the doesnt wipe right, or could be an infection.
Bad Temper just her mood or hormones.



Pregnancy would not cause her to have a dry vagina and yellow residue, and those are not premenstrual symptoms.



She should probably go see a doctor.

I went 13 days overdue with my daughter and the day i was due to go in to be induced i went in to labour on my own.
I guess its because you can never be a 100% sure when u actually conceived, thats why they normally say u can have your baby 2 weeks either side of your due date.

It's not that babies don't want to come out rather that parents and the obstetrical community don't want to wait until the BABY is ready.



I don't think there are specific numbers for being overdue but that is one of the most common reasons for induction, even though the pregnant women are rarely past 42 weeks (which is what is considered "overdue").

Feelings after abortion?



PLEASE REFRAIN FROM JUDGING



I know this is a controversial subject and everyone wants to have their say on it, but I ask that only women who have had an abortion respond to this question-  I thank you for your consideration.



What were your honest feelings after the abortion? Did you feel relieved? Guilty? Did you feel confident that you made the right decision?



And also, can you tell me about your religious background?  Were you raised in a religious family?

Do you TRUSTED in a YOUNG MIDWIFE?



I'm thinking to write a story about a young english homebirth midwife named Jamie-Leigh Gemma Smith. Jamie works as an independent midwife in Great London area where she attends homebirths. Jamie is half american because her father comes from Massachusetts and her mother Sarah is from London. Jamie decided to be a midwife after the homebirth of her little brother. She was present at the birth, supporting her mom Sarah while she was giving birth in her bed.
Jamie is a very beautiful girl that has an amazing body. She's the only person in her family that has black hair, the rest are blonds, so it her an exotic look.
Jamie is a hard worker because she's always ready to help mothers to give birth in their home. She's also a very kind girl for this reason, she's very loved.
Do you TRUSTED in a young homebirth midwife? What do you think of this character?
Thank you !!

Is it possible that I could be pregnant?



Every morning when I wake up, I feel nauseous and I cringe at certain foods, and sometimes at every food I see. This used to happen a few times when I was 11, 12, and 15 (I'm 16 now). I'm on birth control and I almost always take it every day without delay or missing one. I've had sex three times within the past month, all unprotected, and the most recent time (yesterday), he came inside me. My period was at the very beginning of this week and only lasted three days and was really light. I took a pregnancy test two weeks ago, but it was negative, and I'm worried that I'm actually pregnant.

unprotected sex is stupid - condoms are there to stop diseases, not just you getting pregnant.
if you are on some types of medication the pill can become less effective.
you should take another test, also see your doctor if you are worried.  it's maybe partly the worry that is making you nauseous, or something else that should be checked out.

I dont really know what to say to u babe other then u really shouldnt be having unprotected sex at any age unless u and this person have both been tested and been together for a long time.
Ur only a baby urself and still growing up.



If u did a test 2 weeks ago and only had ur period the start of this week then clearly the test would stay u wasnt pregnant cause clearly u wasnt pregnant, at that time u was ovulating.



Please dont take this the wrong way honey but u really need to have someone sit u down and teach u about ur cycle.



U have a 21 day cycle - The cycle starts on the first day of ur period and 14 days later u ovulate and 14 days after that ur period starts and the cycle starts all over again.
When ovulation starts in the middle of ur cycle u have a 2 day window on both sides where ur at risk of becoming pregnant.

I'm surprised your doctor didn't advise you to use some sort of birth control after the miscarriage since it is usually recommended that a woman waits at least one cycle before trying to get pregnant again.



I suspect that you're already pregnant and that you're ovulating just fine.  It's not too early to use a home pregnancy test since the new tests are much more sensitive and accurate than previously.



I suggest taking a in home pregnancy test and if it's positive, make an appointment with your gynecologist as soon as possible.  If the test is negative, consult with your doctor about what to do next.  Good luck.

sorry to hear about your miscarriage



it sounds like you might well be pregnant



don't worry a miscarriage is not going to make you unable to ovulate, miscarriages are very common in the first 10 weeks, how many weeks were you? when the egg and sperm are fusing together and chromosomes are replicating etc it can often go wrong, it has nothing to do with your ovaries



have you actually been trying for a baby? i.e. having unprotected sex, cos then in that case i would say you  are almost definitely pregnant :)

Go and get a blood test from your dr, they are accurate from about 7 days after conception. They should be able to tell you if your HcG levels are still falling because of your m/c or rising from a new pregnancy, which may well be the case.

You can go ahead and start taking vitamins if you want since it will probably be a little while before you see the doctor!

The earlier you take your folic acid the better - preferably before you are pregnant but I would start now, dont wait around for a doctors appointment. There is nothing wrong with taking it as early as possible!



You can also go to your local pharmacy and get special Pregnancy Vitamins, they have a bit of Iron, Calcium etc in them as well as folic acid!

Pretty much any rounded prenatal vitamin should be ok for you to take. I started taking CVS pharmacy brand and my ob-gyn was perfectly happy with that. Folic acid is a very important amino acid you need to take- and most docs would suggest starting taking this when trying to conceive since it can improve conception and embryo health from day one. Once your doc does the blood tests and urine test it will say if your lacking anything the vitamins aren't giving and from there he can prescribe a better one for your body or reccomend one over the counter. Anything is better than nothing so start taking one that makes you feel good ( no agida nausea or heartburn as some might do) and you should be ok! Best of luck and congradulations!!!!!!

I have no difficulty in breathing but have a lot of mucus in the back of my nose and my chest feels slightly asthmary ( spelling) but doc said its not asthma, he told me its normal but i have a feeling that if i went to the doctors with my arm hanging off he would tell me its normal in pregancy :)

Most babies will fit into newborn, but I would not buy a bunch of them at first. If you want to stock up on diapers before birth, then buy more of the # sizes or save receipts so you can take back excess diapers that baby can no longer fit in.

Both of my children were born full term.  My daughter weighed almost 7 pounds, and my son almost 8.  The newborn size, seemed to be big on them for first week, but they soon grow into it, and very soon grow out of it.  My daughter moved to size 1 at 3 weeks, my son at 4 weeks.



The newborn diapers are designed with a special notch, to prevent from covering the end of the umbilical cord, which will come off in about 1 to 3 weeks after birth.



Good luck to you.

mine were in preemie but were able to wear the newborns at 4.5 and 5.8 lbs so really the newborns are supposed to fit up to 10 lbs and now that they are over 8 the 1's actually work even if they are slightly big... and for your sake i hope your child isn't that big.. cause man that seems like it could hurt or they might possibly have to do a c-section... Not to scare you about the section, they are nothing.. I had a c-section and i actually felt nothing till the next day and as long as you aren't breast feeding they can give you some mighty nice drugs ( not that i'm saying you shouldn't breast feed, i know its better)

If she has a registry buy off of that, that is the BEST thing you can do as those are the items she really wants/needs. If not then buy the baby clothes in sizes bigger than new born, and items most people don't think of like baby spoons, sippy cups, disposable changing pads, mylicon drops, and diapers in size 3 or bigger.

If she's registered, definitely buy her something of the registry. I got almost everything off my registry and it helped sooo much! I also got tons and tons and tons of clothes...seriously my son will probably never wear the same outfit twice. Everyone likes to buy clothes--so probably hold off the temptation. Another cool thing you could do is put together a basket of things that are a little less common. You could include baby tylenol, mylicon drops, baby powder, desitin cream, nail clippers, brush & comb, nasal aspirator, bath toys, anything. This way you could get her a lot of things, arrange it in a pretty basket, and fit it in your budget as well. Good luck and have fun with it! :)

You can never go wrong with  diapers.  She will use a lot, and these can be costly if she has to buy them all the time. Also clothes are nice in 6mos and beyond because everyone will buy her newborn, and 0-3mos.  Or get her a gift card, or make up a coupon good for a few hours of babysitting while she takes a nap, or runs some errands.  I wish someone did that for me.

Search for her name on Babies R Us.com
If it doesn't come up, ask her where she's registered.



There's no "perfect gift" when it comes to new babies, because all moms have different preferences and need different things.
She'll probably be getting a surplus of clothing, so I'd avoid getting her any, unless you want to get one little thing to go with the gift.

It depends on how much you want to spend. Diapers, wipes and clothes are always welcome. Or if you want to get something a little more sentimental, a baby book is nice. If she is registered, check out her registry for something practical that she may need.

My wife is 26 weeks pregnant and doesn't want to have sex?



We haven't had sex since she was 23 weeks. She says she's uncomfortable and it hurts and all this nonsense. I don't know how to tell her I want some without making her feel like crap. Do you think I could ask for oral sex or will that offend her? I feel like she's not living up to her sexual duties towards me but i don't want to be an a** about it yet.



</question>

I think you should try to understand her pain. She has a growing child inside of her which is enough to ask of her! but you want sex as well? I understand its a part of what we all want, but try to relate. Take this period as a time of challenge. IT SHOULDN'T be that hard to not have sex. If she can squeeze out something the size of a watermelon out of a lemon, im sure you can go for a few months without sex!

When she's pregnant,, her "sexual duties towards you" take a breather..
she's pregnant.. and its uncomfortable for her to have sex.. it hurts her apparently.. so its not crap..
sex is supposed to make you both feel good..



but if it hurts her, whats the point?
just for you to feel good,,,?  thats selfish and wrong that you'd hurt her for your own pleasure.  Use the time honored tradition of masturbation to hold you over for a little while.  Its not like its the end of the world if you go 3 weeks without having sex with your PREGNANT wife.

It could be that she is insecure, perhaps it would help if you reassure her, i know as i women there is nothing better than a supportive partner, maybe sit down and have a talk with her, as her body changes she may not be feeling like her usual self, you need to let her know that you understand and obviously if you want to have sex with her that you are attracted her.
Good luck and congrats on the baby!

I can relate to your wife.  When I'm pregnant, I'm extremely sensitive and sex is extremely uncomfortable and sometimes painful.  However, I did talk to my husband to let him know that I did care about his feelings but he needed to understand mine.  Sometimes all he got was a hand job.  I also reminded him that he has two hands too and I was the one carrying OUR baby.  Also, I told him that when he did chores and helped out around the house without being asked, that helped me relax and want to do something "special" for him... hint, hint!  Good luck!  FYI:  I'm 30 years old and we now have two kids and I'm still waiting to hit my sexual peak so my husband doesn't have to beg for "special" time.  I feel bad for him sometimes.  Just be patient and remember that doing the dishes is like foreplay for some of us women.

look hun, babies are uncomfortable! they hurt, they make you feel miserable at times with hormones and sickness, they make you feel heavy and akward. unless you have gone through anything remotely similar, you cannot understand. obviously she has been living up to her "sexual duties" as she is pregnant!!!! give her some space and dont pressure her, she is making a little miracle happen and this is the mother of your baby! how would like someone speaking this way about your daughter when she is older? im sure you would think its wrong.
but talk to her about why she doesnt want to, and approach the subject gently and with a little more etiqutte than this question! things like spending time allowing her to be ready, different positions and taking things slowly and gently can help. failing that, she is your wife and there is a LOT more to marriage than sex. just be grateful she is giving you the wonderful gift of a child and back off her, you wont have to wait forever a few months wont kill you.

Hi...



Oral sex might be worse ( I felt like thrwing up for teh first 4 months and then some... )



I'd suggest you give her a massage, and tend to her... It will make her feel good... and the better she feels the more likely you will be to get some! A nice massage can make her feel sexy again too... as we tend to tart feeling fat as we progress through our pregnancy...



Focus on her, instead of yourself, and she'll be much more receptive I think... :) (I know I was *wink*)

With our 1st daughter, my wife was a complete nymph, but with our next child (also a girl), she was the same as your wife, come to find out that sometimes they are a little drier inside than usual not to mention the fact of the constant changes their body is going through, although you can't tell, and it causes them extreme pain and discomfort, so I would have to say that she's quite probably telling you the truth and you can talk to her gynecologist and see what they might prescribe, that may solve everything for you both.

She is carrying you baby. Shes tired, back off. Maybe you should show her affection. Rub her back and feet. Expecting a baby should be a fun time for BOTH of you, planning naming and so on. And asking her for oral.. Im sorry but picture your PREGNANT WIFE on her knees to please you. What does she get for it. Jeez if it will shut you up it might be worth it.

"and all this nonsense"... oh you're gonna make SUCH an understanding dad. If you think its nonsense now then wait til after the baby's born and you don't get any for about six months. You really have to grow up fast in this situation and talk to her. Maybe you could even (gasp with shock) ask if there's anything you could do for her that doesn't hurt. Oral sex works both ways, in case you were not aware of that.

Im 35 weeks now, but ever since about 20 weeks it hurts when i have sex, it doesnt seem to lube up and it feels to tight it really is uncomfy, and now im all big and its hard to find a position... i know he loves me and finds me attractive but i feel so bad, ill grit my teeth and deal with it sometimes for him.. but its gone down from daily to about once a week if that lol.. and honestly when he asks me to do oral, it makes me want to gag ugh.. but she may be different.  She cant help it, it really is uncomfy and probably does hurt alot.  Also some girls sex drives drop insanely like mine.  You just gotta be understanding, make really good friends with your hand...



And remind her everyday you want her, try everyday as well, but dont be upset if she turns you down.  Some girls sex drives spike when they get a little further along.. gl!

I think when a woman is pregnant you have to be a bit more sensitive to her feelings.  Pregnancy is not always the bed of roses it seems on the movies and I think you should just put up with situation.  You should not make your wife feel a sense of obligation with talk of duty.  This will make matters worse.  Give her some space and make do with cuddling.  When the baby arrives you may find things will be pretty sparse until things settle down at home.  Exhaustion is not very sexy either.



Good luck

Unless the mom has a non-brown-eyed ancestor, then there's pretty much no chance.  The baby can't benefit from a chromosome that isn't there.



But his or her children (your friend's babies, when they grow up) will have a good chance of having non-brown-eyed children, if they marry someone who has it in their background.

It depends on Mom's genotype for eye colour, which is determined by two gene contributions. Brown is the dominant gene, whereas blue is recessive and would be masked by the brown in phenotypic expression.



If Dad has blue eyes, then he is homozygous (both genes are the same) for blue eyes. He can only contribute a blue eyed gene.



Mom may have brown eyes, but it is possible (although it sounds like slim if no one else in her family has blue eyes) that she carries a recessive gene for blue eyes.



If Mom is heterozygous, than the chances of blue are 1/4. If she is homozygous for brown, than there cannot be blue eyes.



Green eyes are, if I recall, somewhat more complicated, and I cannot answer to that part, but if Mom is homozygous for dark brown, then it seems unlikely.

Brown eyed people can have blue eyed children - I have 2 of them.
However, the brown eyed person must carry the recessive gene in order to not dominate their partner's genes.



If everyone in your family has brown eyes, then it is unlikely you will have anything but brown.  That is, unless the recessive gene has been passed on through your family without a match for generations.

Not necessarily. Pre-natal depression and post-natal depression are different illnesses.



If you do have pre-natal (partum) depression, it would be best to work through that before the baby is born to try to avoid post natal depression.

There is no 'common for having a girl' besides the results of the ultrasound.  Hope she's right!  :)

its no way to tell bc of how u are carrying different ppl have different body frames so that will be why they carry the baby different, if u are able to get another ultrasound just ask the tech again.

It has nothing to do with the sex of your baby. Every pregnant woman shows pregnancy differently.  There are plenty of pregnant women having boys and only show a slight bump at 20 weeks.

100% STD/Maternity Leave?



Does anyone get 100% pay through STD?  If yes, for how long and who is your insurance provider?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I believe it is a federal law that insurance companies can only pay 65% of a persons gross weekly income on a Short Term Disability policy. Also be careful, in most cases income from STD is non-taxable, unless the premiums were deducted before taking taxes out of your pay check. If taxes were deducted after subtracting your STD premiums, then the benefits received from the policy is/are taxable.

Pregnancy Questions: Part II?



Hi again, I'm continuing my study on life during the prenatal years and came across other questions:
1) If x-ray is a form of teratogen that pregnant women should not be exposed to, why then do pregnant women conduct an ultrasound?
2) Is it safe for newborns to drink milk themselves while lying in their cribs? If not, what impact if any could this cause?



Thanks again!

1) An ultrasound is not an x-ray.



2) It really isnt safe to leave a newborn alone to drink their milk on their own. They could choke really easy and die, or they could just stop breathing.

ultra sounds are not the same as x-rays! the source that comes from ultra sounds are milder in the imagining of thr baby while x-rays can cause pregnant women to miscarry, because of what makes up x-rays;no, a newborn should not be dinking milk in a crib, it usuaaly is breast-fed, it a newborn(could hold a bottle in which I doubt), it would choke to death, because it could not digest it.

So, I've been on birth control consistently for 4 years, Just this past month I started spotting 17 days?



before my period was due (or 11 days after my last period, whichever way you want to look at it). It was a brown spotting, and was usually very light, and was on and off for the whole time up until my period. (Some days there was no spotting and some days there was a little). I was due for my period 9/30, I have what I believe may be my period but its pretty light compared to other periods. I'm not sure why this could be happening. COuld I possible be pregnant? (I took two tests, they were both negative) Also, My BF and I don't use another form of contraception and I have never missed a pill (take it the same time every day)



sorry if this is long, anyone with this experience, or who could know possibly what my deal is, would be a great help! Thanks!

It could be hormonal imbalance or it could be cysts or something. It would be best to consult a gynaecologist. Do not wait too long. If it is hormonal imbalance, than you would only need some pills to treat it but if it something else like cysts or etc, then you better have it looked at

I took two, one at 5 days before the missed period and then one 1 day before the missed period and both of them came back negative.  So, I just figured I wasn't pregnant.  Then I spotted about an hour or so and thought it was just because I had my IUD taken out recently and my system is out of whack.  After about 10 more days, I decided to test again and I was pregnant.  It just didn't show up early.

Yep, I know of loads of people this has happened to, including my mom who never got a positive urine result during her entire pregnancy with me or my sister. We were undetectable!
I think they just don't work for some people, and for others, they should try again in a week or two when their HcG levels are likely to have risen.

<question>



Did any of you ever just "know" what your baby's gender was before you actually found out? ?



I'm having a baby in March and I just "know" that it's going to be a girl. I mean I'm only 11 weeks so I obviously don't know for sure, but I just have this gut feeling. I can't explain it. Everyone does, all of my family and my husband's family thinks it's going to be a girl. We all even call it "she" and "her" without even thinking about it. So, In other words did any of you get a feeling, woman's intuition, a dream or anything? Were you right?



</question>



<additional details>



With my first one I didn't have a really strong feeling either way, I wanted a girl which is strange because I always wanted a boy to be my oldest, I just had a sudden craving for a girl. I got a boy (very glad about that for several reasons). With the second one I wanted a girl again because I hadn't had one yet, I had a slight feeling that it was going to be a girl and it was. But, I'm not sure if that was just bacause I wanted one so bad. Now, that I have one of each and it doesn't really matter what I have, so I don't have feelings clouding my judgement, I'm getting a REALLY strong girl vibe.

Yes I had a pretty strong feeling that my baby would be a girl, ever since I found out I was pregnant all I could think of was girl names and I always looked at the little girl clothes. At 19 weeks we found out it indeed is a girl so Im very happy. Good luck!

I knew from the very beginning I was having a girl and my mom did, too. My husband swore we were having a boy. A week before the ultrasound, my hubby admitted that he had been having dreams that we were having a girl. Sure enough, at 21 weeks I had a scan and she is ALL girl. My husband missed the scan due to work and kept saying "what if" its a boy since the tech didn't give my a picture of her "part" to show him. So, at 26 weeks we had a 4d scan done and he got to see that she was DEFINITELY a girl. Haha. Anywho, I'm now 33 weeks with a baby girl. But yes, I got that gut feeling and it was right! Best of luck and I hope you're right!

I think it's possible. I thought both of mine were boys...they were. I've known women who wished and wished for a boy or a girl, but wishing hard doesn't make it so. Don't you wish, in history, that all those men who abused their wives or were so disappointed for having girls knew it was the male who determines the child's sex? I also knew a woman who had 2 boys. The 3rd pregnancy, she prayed the whole time for a girl. She said if Hannah could pray for a son and have Samuel, she could pray for a girl. She had a girl.

Now I'm 7 weeks with our second and I don't have a feeling either way yet. Everything is different about this time-I'm nauseous and not as hungry.

I started measuring 2 weeks small at 32 weeks and my doc said it's probably because I am so small...5' and 95 lbs pre-pregnancy. Her head has been down since at least 30 weeks which can cause you to measure "smaller" than you actually are too. He actually said it's kind of a good thing, he doesn't want me trying to push out a 10 lb baby lol. My son was 3 days late and still only came out at 6 lbs 6 oz but he was perfectly healthy.  There is no need to worry.

What are you measuring? Mine never tells me what I am measuring. She just says, "You're not measuring too big." And, I feel like I am smaller with this pregnancy than my last for some reason. But, at 36 weeks, I had an ultrasound that estimated his weight to already be 6 lbs. 8 oz!
So, I know he's not small. I am also right below 5'1. So, it might also be the position of your baby/uterus....It seems like if your doctor was concerned, you'd be in for an ultrasound soon.

My doctor said the same exact thing when I was pregnant with my daughter two years ago. They did an ultrasound and said I was just going to have a small baby. They said she would be no more that 7 pounds..... She came out 8lbs 6oz. lol.



I'm gonna say you don't have anything to worry about. She's probably just tucked in there really good like mine was and it's hard for them to get accurate measurements when the baby is like that.

I was induced and they inserted cervadil (sp?) the night before and that's a 12 hour process. Then the next morning since I started dilating they used pitocin. I was okay with it. The pain wasn't as bad as people talk about. The nurses were great offering pain meds before I felt I needed them. I think I had the meds in my system and that cut down on the pain before it started. Then I went for a spell of no pain meds and the doc was delivering twins so the epidural was on hold also. That was a 20 minute period where I was bad-but I didn't lose it or anything. Pushing lasted 45 minutes, and 15 of that was waiting on doc and NIC to be ready.



It was a good experience, we had a healthy baby and I like things being planned. I'd do it again and in fact nurse mentioned it yesterday at my first appointment since my second is due within 2 days of my daughter's birthday.

I was induced via pitocin drip both times. I loved it! I'm hoping for a 3rd induction this time as well. Short easy labors, and the pain wasn't horrible until about the last hour as the baby was decending to crown.



Labors were:
8hrs45mins, pushed 2 times (slept 6 hrs of that)
5hrs20mins, pushed 3 times (slept 3 hours of that)
No epidural. I had Demerol pain meds with my first, which worked great on taking the edge off.
I had Nubain meds with my second, which did nothing but pass to the baby and cause his stomach to be pumped at birth.



I will be attempting no meds this time....we'll see how that goes!

I was induced with my 1st with Pitocin, and was the most horrific labor that I ever had to endure!



I had pre-eclampsia so I was induced at 36 weeks, he refused to drop into my pelvis, so no epidural for me as his head was too high up on my spine, after 19hrs of pitocin induced labor and pushing for 2hrs, I finally got my OB to agree to a c-section.



If you dont have to be induced, don't its horrible IMO

My water broke at 9 in the morning but contractions never started. I got pitocin at about 2pm and the baby was born at midnight. Everyone says that it makes contractions stonger. If that's true then people who don't get it must have a really easy time of it because with the help of an epidural I did just fine. I'm sure that what you are going through now is worse than just getting on with it.

I was induced with Pitocin two years ago because my water broke, but I didn't go into labor.  I went from having no contractions to having very hard very painful contractions.  I had planned all along on having an epidural, but found out that they wont give you one until you are at least 4 cm dilated.  People who have gone into labor both ways say that natural labor was much more comfortable than being induced was, so I'm hoping to not need to be induced this time, but for now I can only tell you that the pitocin induction was very painful.

When my water broke without labor they put me on pitocin.  I never got pain relief, so I was doing labor on pitocin with no help (none of the two epidurals worked, bloody doc poked me 10 times with each try, guess she wasn't used to a 6' tall woman in labor).  Not the most awesome ever thing to do.  If you get a good epidural, it's fine - the big thing about pitocin isn't that it hurts more it's that the contractions come close together and take longer so it's like you're in transition for HOURS.  There is a chance that your uterus will be overstimulated and you will not dilate as well with pitocin, and you'll head off to c-section as I did.



Just make sure that you have a chance to get pain relief before it gets too bad.  Labor normally is painful, pitocin is a ***** - did a VBAC with my 2nd, labored naturally and got an epidural after 16 hours of labor, just before transition, never as painful as pitocin labor.  If you're ready to deliver it's great, but without careful administration it can be a bad thing.

Don't get your self all stressed out over it. I know it's hard not to worry, but try to relax. It could be lower than normal because you could of conceived later than the doc or you thought. Hopefully he is getting you in there soon so you don't have to stress over it all weekend. Good luck and I hope everything works out for you and your baby.

Hi There. I had a similar issue when I first found out I was pregnant my hcg levels just weren't doubling like they should and the doctor ordered blood tests every other day. Unfortunately my pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. I don't want to freak you out but since your going to the doctor you may want to ask her/him what low hcg level means and if there is a vitamin or supplement that you can take to help boost your hcg levels. Also remember that some women have low hcg levels there entire pregnancy and go on to deliver healthy babies. Good luck!

They just want to be sure the HCG levels are going up and not down.  As long as they are increasing, you are ok.  I was sick with my first two and the whole pregnancy with both..  But, I had a boy and a girl.  So, this time, I'm not vomiting as much, but I just feel nausea.  I don't think that matters so much.  But, we can send girl vibes your way!  Smile.  Best of luck!

Hi I also had low levels with both my last pregnancy and my current one.  The doctor knows my fear of needles (normally he would retest levels a week later) so sent me for a scan to determine the dates - based on the size of the baby.

That's fairly normal. Some babies "drop" earlier, and others don't drop until labour actually starts. Enjoy being able to breathe better for a while :-) (countered by the fact you probably need to pee every 5 mins).
He may not stay there though - at that stage they do move round quite a bit. At 24 weeks, I feel like I'm getting kicks to the cervix, as well as having my ribs played like a xylophone!
All the best for the last couple of months xx

Yep that is normal. Unless you have cramping that is hurting you or bleeding I don't think it's anything to worry about. Try changing positions and see if that helps any.

Personally I wouldn't buy ether! That's just me though! I like to buy items that are rated well and are the best buy! I bought a stroller that came with a baby car seat! It was 140$ for both items in one! I personally recommend buying a stroller that comes with a car seat so you get a better buy! It can still be rated well too, you just have to check out the rating on the item! Good luck and hope you find what works for you!



We bought the first! The Journey elite! It was the best choice for us and in our price range! Ours has a different pattern cloth design on it then the picture!

You really haven't given much information, but the generic answer for this question would be to take a test. While I understand you're scared, you can't decide what to do without knowing. Being tired and moody isn't always a sure sign of pregnancy, and if you haven't missed your period yet the chances of having symptoms this early are slim. Good luck.

Hey.. You should take a pregnancy test for you to be able to know if your pregnant or not. Coz, If your not going to see the reality.. You'll just becoming more paranoid, and acting as if your pregnant or not. The case that your experiencing, it may just cause of the stress that you feel.. So, get up and take the test.

Even women with PCOS ovulate once in a while.  What makes it difficult for women with PCOS to have children is that they don't know when they ovulate or when they may have a period, so they cannot time sex in order to conceive.



You may have ovulated.  If so, you could be pregnant.  Time to take a test!

I would suggest that you go to your family doctor and ask him/her for a pregnanct test.  The consultation is completely confidential and then you can confront the situation when you know for certain.  Whether or not your are nervous about your bf reaction you still need to know.

Help with Morning Sickness?



My morning sickness finally hit me full on this morning, ive had nausea for a while but this is the first morning ive actually been sick.
And i feel like crap &gt;.&lt;
I had a cup of tea which made me feel a little better, but then i had some dry toast, which made me feel even worse lol.
Im going food shopping later and i wondered if there are any foods i should pick up to help,
Ive heard people say crackers, but i don't like them.
Would Digestive biscuits be an ok supplement?



Thanks :]

Popcicles always helped me for some reason.  If breads make you feel ill, then stay away from them.  Also, stay away from anything creamy.  Stick to things like fruits, vegetables...without a lot of stuff on them.

Saltine crackers !  They really DO work !  And if you don't like them enough to eat to quell the "morning sickness". . . .then your "morning sickness" isn't BAD enough !  Because when I had "morning sickness" I would have eaten a bull's *** to STOP IT !  So. . . .just how BAD is this morning sickness of yours, anyway ? !

The whole reason people say dry crackers is because women keep them at their bedside to eat before they get up. I get sick if I get up to fast or do not eat right away. Sleeping is still not eating for 7-8 hours. A pregnant woman needs food every 2-3 hours. I would try eating something like cereal before bed, and have something ready to eat in bed before you wake up.



I had morning sickness for 2 months. I am over that part now. I wanted to cry because I was so tired of feeling that way. This is my third pregnancy so it was much harder on me. I hope you start feeling better soon. You can also ask your doctor for a prescription, but the pills will make you very sleepy. Its not worth it!

You poor baby. Try digestive biscuits and see if they help you. Eating chipped ice helped me. There's something about eating the cold ice that settles the stomach. So I would think popsicles, as someone else suggested, would help too. Try not to get overly sour ones (like lemon or lime) though.

nothing seemed to help me but I suggest saltines.  Have by your bedside and eat some before you get out of bed.  ALso, drink lots of water because you will prolly get dehydrated if you are sick.  I have been sick this whole pregnancy up until about a month ago and I only have 5 weeks left.  Good luck.  I agree with the popsicles.  They do help and are addicting.  YUM

I had bad morning sickness, especially with my first pregnancy. All day/all night and lost 15 pounds in the beginning. I got tired of crackers pretty fast. You can only eat so many of them. Bland food seems to work the best. Somethings that I could eat...



Scrambled eggs
Hot pretzel
Baked potato
Plain chicken breast
Coke or Pepsi with the fizz stirred out of it.
Toast with light butter.
Plain cookies like Ginger snaps or just vanilla wafers.



Tums can help a lot. Take a tums before you eat. It helps the food stay down. Also try to eat something every 2 hours instead of regular meals. Having something in your stomach actually helps. Let water warm up a little rather than drinking it right out of the fridge or with ice.



Hope you feel better soon.

Whenever i start to feel sick, I just snack on a digestive biscuit. Or whatever i tend to find. It seems to do the job for me.



Ive also heard that Ginger biscuits are meant to help..

I'm scared i may be infertile due to masturbation?



I'm a 16 year old male and have just started college, i scared of being infertile. i will ask a few questions.



Does Masturbation make you infertile?



i used to masturbate between the age of 13 - 16 but not anymore even though i have the urge i don't do it. i used to masturbate with a shower head about a 2 - 3 times a week but im scared it may have made me infertile because i really want to have kids when I'm older.



My Penis Shape?



I'm also worried about my penis because it has started to curve and i think this is to do with the shower head because i was rubbing it on the base of the penis, however when i have an erection it looks pretty straight, another worry is it is quite upwards so i was wondering when i lose my virginity will i have to bend down lower to make things happen. Sometimes when i wake up and go for a leak my penis may be curved more than usual to the left side, i heard this is due to the way i sleep because i lay on my side.. naturally my penis curves to the right side.



Also im 16 and penis ain't very big, will it stay like this?



Testicles?



My Testicles are very small and i was wondering is that something to do with masturbation and will it affect my fertility, because i can still get an erection, sometime there and there my left testicle has a little pain but not always do you think this is a problem, will my testicles grow or is it normal to have small testicles.



Finally will my penis grow, because im worried about the upward penis will girls laugh, and how will i approach intercourse, will i have to bend lower, because i don't really know where the vagina is and im kinda knew.



Thank You, sorry for being so long

It all sounds fine to me.  Continue with the masturbation, as it takes the desire away, and you won't decide to force a girl, and get charged with rape.  Size and shape are OK, and the upward trend during an erection, is also good, as you will eventually find that this helps stimulate the female during the act of sex.

Masturbation won't make you infertile. Simple as that. If masturbation did make you infertile, then logically, sex would make you infertile. Fact. Everybody masturbates (Yes, we're all a pack of wankers)...and the chances of people being infertile from it are stupid. As pointed out here, being unhealthy will make you infertile. Masturbation may turn your palms hairy though ;p



As for your 'size' issues, don't worry about it. You're what, 16? You have time to grow. Even if it doesn't, so what. You know, a huge penis is pretty useless and chances are you'd just end up hurting lots of girls :p You'll find the vagina easily enough when 'it' happens and you'll be able to perform without having to bend lower or adjusting anything :p

You are 16 in college, wow, that is good.  Which basically means that you are probably considered to be one of the geeky guys which is also good.  You are head smart.  All of these questions you are asking about your body is something you need to talk to you doctor about.  Especially infertility.  It is 300% impossible for someone to check your fertility status online without any sperm to test.  You answered your own question about the shape of your penis.  As far as all of the other questions, go talk to your doctor and get tested.



Masturbation is not likely (not saying it wont) to cause infertility.  It can lessen your sperm count which usually builds back up after prolonged periods of not masturbating.

Everything that you are worried about is completely normal.  I'm sure you are relieved.  You will have a great life with a woman.  It'll be OK.  You are very outspoken to us, so you will be fine with a girlfriend.  She will understand.  I wouldn't bring it up though.  You'll have her worried over nothing.  You are normal.  It's how you use it is what matters and how much love you show her, not size or being straight.

Masturbation is a very healthy thing. No, it will not make you unfertile. And men are very different in shape and size. Your penis may have a slight curve to it. That is perfectly normal. If you are only 16 your penis could also grow a bit more, but usually at your age, it is as developed as it will get. I'm sure the size is more than efficient. You can't judge yourself as a small sized penis after watching pornography. Those penis sizes are unrealistic and hard to come by. Everything is perfectly fine. No reason to be insecure.

How late are you?  One day or two is normal.  Not everyone is like clockwork.  More that two days, then you need to get a pregnancy test.  Sometimes worrying over your period will make you not start.  I would just to buy a pregnancy test to be sure, that way you will sleep easier, or not.



Good luck.  If you are pregnant, you'll be just fine.  It's not the end of the world right?  Babies are great.

Mirena is a plastic/hormone gadget that is placed in your ueterus through your cervix.  it can stay in place for 5 years.  it realeses hormones to the local area that work like the pill, only you dont have to take a pill everyday.
it is usually inserted towards the end of a period, the doctor uses a speculum to open the vagina and inserts a rod through the cervix.
then the doctor pushes a little lever thing which leaves the T shape mirena in your uterus.



it can cause some discomfort and bleeding for a little while while the body gets used to it. but then you can forget about it for 5 years.



lots of women find the added benefit of not getting a period or a very light period while they use it.

It is a slow release contraceptive.
I have heard of many women suffering heavy bleeding and other complications as a side effect but with most things these days there comes the risks.
I would not use this myself personally as I think it may cause some kind of permanent damage and I would not like to be infertile just yet.
You need to weigh up the odds and make a decision before using this.
The only totally safe bet against pregnancy is - no intercourse.
I fell pregnant while on the pill and bled for like six months of my pregnancy.  So be careful with whatever you do.

I had a Mirena put in 3 yrs ago and after 6 months it changed my life! It does hurt a little bit when its put in and I bled for about 2 wks afterwards, although not much and it took a while to settle down but it was worth it in the end. Its basically the same as having a smear test but takes a little longer to do. I don't know of any side effects once its in there. As with any other contreception, it's not 100% proof but it must be at least 98% and you don't have to remember to take it every day. I actually forgot mine was in when I went for a smear a few months ago!! Got told off cos I forgot to mention I had one lol. Before you have it inserted, take a couple of painkillers 20 mins before and have someone with you to take you home, even if you can walk home as being on your back, not moving, can make some feel faint.

They insert the mirena through your cervix into the uterus. You may have more spotting for the first six months. Then some women have no period at all or very light. They usually require you to have had at least one pregnancy so your cervix is open a little. I got one before I had been pregnant and wouldn't suggest it. They had to dilate my cervix to insert it and it did not feel good. I can't remember the exact percentage of protection, but you need to be in a stable monogamous relationship because with the device in place std's have an easier route straight to your uterus which could lead to a bad infection. Hope this helped.

You can use hair dye, but it is not recommended to use during pregnancy.  Use of hair dye in the first trimester is much more dangerous than later on in the pregnancy.

I would not for the safety of your baby! I had a friend with this same problem when I was younger, her hair went white early! She had mostly grey hair by 19! I never got to tell her that I thought it was really cool! You know because everyone has red, blond or brown hair. Their was only one girl I new with hair like hers! In fact I used to want to die my hair that color! Maybe I'm weird but I liked the look of white hair! Its regal, cool,  and super hero like! I say don't worry about it and after baby is born if you don't like the white look you can go back to dieing your hair! Good luck!

Hi,



I'm 16 weeks and was advised that colouring these days is ok, but most people try to avoid the first 12 weeks.  My hairdresser advised me to just get highlights using foils if in doubt - that way your scalp only gets minimal contact with hair dye.  That's what I did and it made me feel much better about my grey hairs.  It also means that you can go longer without looking like your roots need to be done :-).



As for after the birth, I'm not aware of any issue with colouring your hair, in fact it was one of the first things I did when I felt able to escape the house to the hairdressers for an hour of pampering.  Perhaps best to check with your midwife if you are breastfeeding, just to be on the safe side.



Wishing you all the best!

Homebirth or birthing centre?



im due in jan with my second child, dont want to have this one in hospital, anyone been to a birthing centre and what did you think? i was also thinking about a homebirth, but i had a 3rd degree tear with my first, do you think they would let me? the only reason im asking is the hospital have lost my notes havent seen them from my first blood tests, so with my tear ive been from midwife care to consultant care, now i havent a clue whats going on, but im back in a few weeks so hopefully this will be sorted, just wondering what experiences anyone has had with homebirths or birthing centres



</question>



<additional details>



just to say, i know witha homebirth there can be problems but im 5min drive from the hospital so this would be perect chance to try it out, and many m/w have told me if i need a c section that they will call the hospital ahead of time so it would be ready for when you get there, so its prob faster than being in the hospital

I am also pregnant and your question made me think about many things. I understand that you have bad experiences with hospitals but don't think if you give birth at home, it will be easier. Well, I would not give birth at home, it is still dangerous but a birthing center can be appropriate for this purpose depending on its amenities. I think you should contact one and ask how giving birth works there exactly.



What I don't understand is that if you have to go to the hospital even if you give birth at home, what is the whole point of giving birth at home?

Would you really want to be at home, without the emergency backup should something go wrong, my wifes labour did not go plain sailing and I hated being in the hospital, but now I have seen what happens during labour I would not want her to be anywhere else.
Could you imagine if something did go wrong midway through labour and they needed to get you to a hospital, does that not terrify you ?
Not trying to scare you but all the proper equipment is there and all the backup you need, not just 1 midwife for everything.
Anyway, whatever you decision, good luck, I am sure everything will be fine whichever decision you make

It really depends on the reason for the tear....



If it's likely to happen again, then definitely hospital.



If it's possible, then birthing centre.



If not, then home birth.



As long as you don't have any problems, and the baby doesn't have any problems, a home birth can be perfectly safe.



Ask the consultant if you're likely to tear again, and discuss what you want with them.



Good luck.

Whichever one you prefer.



A third degree tear should not rule out a home birth for you -- most severe tears result from the mother being made to push while lying flat on her back, or are an extension of a previous episiotomy.  If you are allowed to push in an appopriate position, you shouldn't tear.  And if you do, the midwife can repair it.



I'd talk to a midwife.  If you DO have risk factors that would make a home birth  unsafe for you (including lack of back-up for complications) she will tell you so, and not take you as a client.



In the abcense of specific complications/risk factors, a home birth IS safe (safer than a hospital and at least as safe as a birthing center)  -- so whatever you feel most comfortable with is right for you.

It's not advisable if you had a 3rd degree tear the first time.  You are likely to tear the same this time around, and as you know that requires an immediate surgical repair.



If you give birth in a birthing center, half the time you'll end up being rushed to the hospital anyway.  To me, that sounds more stressful than anything and would only prolong the birth experience.

I've known people who have had really positive experiences with both, and one person who almost had a really tragic experience with the home birth (I should add that she went on to have 5 successful experiences with home birth after the first one).



While I personally am way to paranoid and nervous to ever even consider it, if I were inclined that way, I would go with the home birth since you live that close to the hospital.  Two of my friends who  used birthing centers the first time are pregnant again and both plan to do home births this time.  The midwives that they are working with have told them that they bring the same equipment out to the house with them that they would have available in the birthing center.  One of them told me that the birthing center sent her home 2 hours after delivery (2:00 AM) after her son was born.  I personally was horrified until she explained to me that that was what she actually wanted.  If they are going to send you right home anyway, then you may as well just have the baby at home.



Best of luck to you with whatever you decide.

I have had a homebirth, and it was absolutely wonderful. I found a midwife with excellent statistics (1400 babies and not one death). She knows her patients (of course, all low-risk patients) so well because she meets with them once a month for a full hour, and she knows when a transfer to the hospital is needed well before the situation has become a dire emergency.



I get very heated about how everyone makes birth out to be a hugely scary and dangerous thing. Birth is not dangerous in a low-risk woman. Midwifes practice very safe and effective care. As a matter of fact, The Netherlands has far better birth outcomes (more babies survive) than we in the US do, and 70 percent of babies there are born at HOME with midwives! Only the high-risk women are seen by obstetricians.  There is a lot of literature out there that proves homebirth to be as safe or safer (there are risks at a hospital, as nobody seems to realize) than at the hospital. Hospitals can also create problems in the birthing women with the "routine" interventions that they make mandatory for women.



It seems like everyone is here to make you nervous, and I wanted to stress the fact that homebirth can be a safe option for you and you don't need to rule it out, even if you had a tear last time around - in fact, you are probably less likely to tear this time because you have already had a baby and have been stretched.

I had a waterbirth at home.  It was a great experience.  I was 6 days overdue and VERY ready to have him!  At 2 am on Saturday morning I woke up with contractions that were irregular and crampy like period cramps.  I had them off and on all day and everyone said that it wasn't likely anything.  At 8:30 pm that night we went for a walk and got ice cream.  My contractions were a little more painful, but still irregular.  When we got home we thought that nothing would likely come of them and settled down for a movie.  At 9:30 pm they started to come regularily and I made my husband time them.  at 10:15 pm I called my midwife and told her.  She wasn't really concerned and wasn't going to come.  After three contractions in 10 minutes on the phone with her, she decided she would.  She and the student midwife and my doula arrived at 10 to 11 pm and my husband started the tub up because contractions were 3 min apart.  I got into the tub at 11:30 and my contractions were coming at 2 min.  I started to feel like I wanted to push about 10 min later.  After the first two pushes, the midwife called the second midwife.  (She told me earlier that when they call in the second it's generally 1/2 hour til the birth).  I was shocked and asked in the middle of a contraction, "Do you think he'll be here that soon?"  I started to get excited but freak out at the same time.  I was all natural and I was starting to feel more pain and a burning feeling down there.  The second midwife showed up at 12 pm and at 12:18 (only 5 pushes!) my son was born.  LESS than 3 hours.  I would DEFINETLY go with a home birth again!  Especially in water.



I have also heard that birthing centers are kind of like home away from home.  I've also heard that they are very nice.  I never liked the hospital and I loved to have my baby at home.  Everyone left within two hours and I got to sleep in my own bed and move around my own house and take care of my baby without all the nurses poking and proding me every few hours and doing things to my baby.



EDIT:  Just a statistical fact for those that say homebirth is unsafe:  MORE than 90% of the people in the world are BORN at home!  It's only in the Western world, Australia and some of Europe where women ACTUALLY go to a hospital to have a baby.

Only your doctor would know for sure.  You haven't had any cramping so that's good, but you need some blood work and possible an ultrasound to know for sure what is going on.  If you had a miscarriage it would be heavy bleeding-like a heavy period.  Spotting does not necessarily signify a miscarriage.  Call your OB so you know for sure. Good luck!

I have just had a miscarriage 2weeks ago, try not to panic !!
I was bleeding like a period and minor pain.
I would not go hospital or doctors ok  There is nothing they can do for you .The more you walk about the more you will bleed , just rest allot until tomorrow
the reason i say not to go is cause i done the same as you and all they said was to rest and wait for the scan .
What will happen is , you will have a normal scan (drink a lot of fluids dont go the loo)
if they cant see from that , they will do a vaginal ultra sound witch they can tell you a lot more .
they will take your blood sample to make sure ur hgc levels are high .
I had clots , bled for 7 days and period pains then i lost mine , on the positive note my Friends brothers girlfriend was spotting and she was fine x
good luck please let me know how you get on and stay positive until you know more/



dont have hot baths or showers or hot water bottle until you have asked them tomorrow , just wipe your self down or take a warm shower

You need to contact your OB's office. When I miscarried at 7 1/2 weeks it was nothing like a period or spotting. I woke up in severe pain. It felt like someone was repeatedly stabbing me in the stomach and I could barely even walk and I couldn't stand up straight. I went to the bathroom and as soon as I looked down I noticed there were pools of bright red blood and tissue everywhere. I was bleeding through a heavy pad in less than an hour for over 8 hours. My husband took me to the emergency room where they did an exam and saw that my cervix was open and an ultrasound that showed that the baby indeed did not have a heartbeat and that I hadn't passed everything on my own. The very next morning I had to have an emergency D&C to clear my uterus and control the bleeding and pain.



With my current pregnancy I started having severe cramping and heavy bleeding at 5 1/2 weeks and I thought for sure I was miscarrying again. I didn't take any chances and I immediately called my OB's office and he told me to come in right then for an ultrasound. At that point they saw the gestational sac and the yolk sac and it measured perfectly to 5 1/2 weeks. They measured my HCG levels for a week or so and did another scan at 6 weeks and 1 day where we saw the baby and its heartbeat.



Just because you are spotting or bleeding some it doesn't mean that you are miscarrying or are going to miscarry, but it does mean that you need to get checked out as soon as possible.



Good luck to you.

Usually a miscarriage would come with cramps and it would be alot of fresh blood. However no one can really answer that for you here. It is quite common for woman to bled through there first trimester during the time their periods would have been and this is usually spotting. Or you can spot during implantation. Hope everything goes well for you tomorrow.

You don't get bloating and heartburn until the later stages of pregnancy, they're not a symptom!. The chances of you being pregnant whilst on the pill and using condoms are virtually nil. You don't sound mature enough to be having sex. You had a period last week for God's sake.

If you just had your period and it was heavy, it is unlikely that you are pregnant unless something went wrong with the pregnancy and you had a miscarriage. Stress can also affect your body, these symptoms do not necessarily mean that you are pregnant. If you have medical problems, you should go see a doctor and they can give you an answer. In theory, you can take a pregnancy test after your period is missed but this wasn't so I don't think it would show much. If your symptoms get serious, go to the doctor.

It's very doubtful, especially because you had your period on the 23rd of September. It is possible to get pregnant on the pill and with condoms but the chances are VERY slim. And again, not likely considering you have already had your period. I think it's in your head.

well the pill is usually 99% safe if you use them correctly, thus take them more or less at the same time every day... please be aware that if you had been having diaroerah or vommiting then obviously the pill also might lose effect if it didn't stay enough in your system.
condoms are 40% safe, so any you probably are not pregnant if you took your pill correctly...
now stress from not getting your period might result in the delay of your period itself...



head aches bloatedness and heartburn are also common symptoms in side effects of the pill.



your last period wasn't even 2 weeks ago.... so might be early to tell.... make sure you didn't miss a day when you started taking the pill again after the break...



it is very unlikely you are pregnant, if you are concerned about your symptoms which might also be stress related you can consult your gp...

Nope, I don't think you are pregnant.  Just stressed.  Go take a long bath and relax.  Those bloating and headaches and such doesn't happen that early in pregnancy anyway.  What you are describing to me is cramps and getting ready to start your period again.  You are fine.



Stay responsible with those pills and condoms.  You can't get pregnant with both.

Pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks. However the baby could arrive 2 weeks before or after your due date - this is absolutely normal. Conception is somewhere between January 15 to January 23, 2008. Go to :-

38 weeks prior to your due date.



In the United States, Dr's consider a pregnancy to be 40 weeks.  They go back 2 weeks prior to the date of your conception, so the dating is typically from the first day of your last period (it's just an old school method that has never changed).  So, you actually get pregnant 10-14 days after the first day of your last period; THAT is when conception occurs, hence the subtracting 38 weeks from your due date.



From what I calculated, your conception was on 1/19 (give or take a few days, because sperm can live inside for a while before fertilizing)

Flying while pregnant...?



My wife and I found out last Monday that we are Pregnant. YAY!



The Doctor pegged it as 5 weeks pregnant, so that would make us 6 and a half now.  The problem is that we have had flights booked since April.  The flight is a one stop about 5-6 hours each leg.



I have read that Airlines wont really let you fly in your thrid trimeser adn that the safest time to fly is in your 2nd.  But there is nothing about the first trimester.



We are both worried about miscarriage and the risks that flying may potentially increase the chances.



It is our first and my wife is 31.



Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!



Thanks,

Traveling is safe until the third trimester. The concern is just going into labor during the flight.

Your fine...I wouldn't think twice about flying during my first trimester. Just realize that she may get more motion sick than usual if she is having morning sickness to start with. Also you can not take Dramamine or other motion sickness pills. When I have flown while pregnant I use sea bands, the little wrist bands that put pressure on your wrist to control nausea. They work great for me. I have flown twice while pregnant in my second and then again in my third trimesters. If you are too worried talk to her doctor but I am sure he/she will encourage you to go ahead with your plans and enjoy your trip. Also for pregnant women the risk of blood clots is always elevated so it would be wise for your wife to make a few trips up and down the isles just to get the blood circulating. Good Luck. Have fun and don't stress the real stress is yet to come...like when you fly WITH the baby!! LOL

The best thing to do is consult your wife's doctor. Every woman is different and her pregnancy is different. I had plans to fly in my third trimester, which the my doctor said was fine at the beginning of my pregnancy. But I developed pregnancy induced high blood pressure during my third trimester and had to cancel my trip. So, you just never know.I've had friends who flew in both their first and third trimester with no problems at all. Your doctor can help give you the best assessment. best of luck to you...this is such an exciting time in your life..enjoy every minute!

I would make sure that your doctor and midwife are aware that you are going away and about the journey but it is safe. It wouldn't make your wife miscarry. It is only unsafe in the 3rd trimester in case you go into labor and you are stuck in the sky somewhere. Have a nice trip and Congratulations on baby.

Flying while in the first trimester shouldn't be a problem but it is important for your wife to keep really well hydrated and wear flight socks. She should also try and walk around on the flight as pregnant women are at a slightly higher risk of developing a blood clot.



The other thing you both need to think about is if something were to happen, are you happy with the health services of the country you are flying to?
Hope this helps and you have a nice time.

GD & stillbirth? How common? Why?



What causes stillbirth due to Gestational Diabetes? What is the percentage that this actually happens? Wouldn't you have to have had uncontrolled blood sugars since you had it, say, in the 200s or something from day 1 of being diagnosed, or could the ending week or two do it? My sugars have been getting a tad bit higher, not too bad, but I'm still scared. I see the doctor again Monday. I have twice a week NSTs to monitor him and he's fine on those. They have not measured him via u/s at all. (Which I hear is inaccurate, anyway..) But if my sugars are up for a few days .. would this cause my baby to be stillborn? It's only Thursday, so four days until I see the doctor and they do not consider this an emergency to talk to him now.

Your being way paranoid and buying into all that crap they spout about pregnancy these days.  Its a wonder we are all here because these things weren't told to people before and they all had healthy babies.  Sex is completly find during pregnancy so long as you have had no problems so the doc/midwife has told you not to do it.  Those 'germs' created your baby

31 weeks pregnant....when does it start getting bad?



Hello....I just wanted to ask everyone when they started feeling "miserable" during their pregnancy.....Despit the first 14 weeks of morning sickness....and then the subsequent moodiness....that lasted up until the 5th month....I feel pretty good....and I have been for awhile......
All the books that I read say that the third trimester is the worst.....
your feet will swell up....you wont be able to sleep....you feel uncomfortable.....but none of that has happened.....you start getting moody again....
When should I be expecting all of this??? I am scared that its all just going to hit at once!!! This is my first and I have never really been around pregnant people so any experience would help!!!

Im 39 weeks today and i think my third trimester has been pretty good.  The only problem i have had is a bit uncomfortable with sleeping cos needing the loo all the time.  I have had no swelling or anything like that or been moody.  However, the last week i have been a bit tearful.  Apart from that though i feel really good and cheery most days and have had no problems in the third trimester at all.  Some people find it hard others dont.  Think it depends on your size also, im not carrying that big so that may be a factor.

Everyone is different, i became miserable at 35 weeks with swelling and also intese pelvic and hip pain (which is normal according to doc) but now I am 37 weeks and 3 days and am feelling so much better than I was, no more swelling, more energy and barely any hip pain.  Some foot aches if you stand for too long but not unbearable.  The unbearable, miserable part is waiting for this baby to come out.!!!

those are all possibilities during the 3rd trimester but dont all happen to everyone, just like, not everyone gets sore boobs and morning sickness in the first trimester! I was not moody during my pregnancy at all, but was so sick from weeks 6-15.



Anyways, I am not swollen very much. My ankles are just starting to swell a bit this past week. (I am 38 weeks tomorrow) but they are not uncomfortable and my shoes still fit :)
I sleep pretty good, but when I am on my right side my hip will hurt occassionally so I just roll over. Thats been going on for a couple weeks. But sleep is not a huge issue for me. I also am not moody, just anxious, nervous and excited..oh and TIRED!!
I guess the worst part for me now is the soreness 'down there' I pulled a muscle a WHILE ago and it wont get better. Lots of pressure sometimes. I have also been getting contractions/false labor for a week. WHich also isn't awful, I just wish she would stop faking it and come for real!!!

With every woman and every pregnancy it is different, but I'll share my experiences with you.  With baby #1 I was great up until about 7 1/2 months.  By that point I was just sick of being pregnant and wanted to have my baby.  I didn't get moody & evil, and wasn't in any pain, but I was swollen and uncomfortable and the novelty of being pregnant had worn off and I was ready for it to be over.  With this one , #2, I've been so sick and had so many different aches & pains that I've been fairly miserable this whole pregnacy.  I actually don't have any swelling this time, and I look way better than I did with #1, but I feel like crap most of the time.  I don't think I could give you a date when it actually started, but I'm sure it was around the time I realized that my morning sickness was going to last well into my 2nd trimester this time around rather than ending at 16 weeks like it did the first time.  It has been down hill since then.  As much as I am so glad to be having this baby and can not wait to hold him in my arms, I will never go through this again, and if my first pregnancy had been like this one, my first born may have been an only child.

With my first pregnancy I was sicker than a dog for the first 3 months and then felt great until about 2 months before I gave birth. I had trouble sleeping because I could not seem to get comfortable and I also had bad headaches,  swelling in my feet, and felt like I was not going to stop leaking urine and having to go to the restroom. With my second pregnancy I was not sick once, felt great the whole time. Did get uncomfortable at the end because of not being able to sleep and the urine irritation. I would say probably the last month or two you should be feeling different, less comfortable, more irritated with your uriation and bowel movemnts, and feeling super fatigued. Your feet do swell, but mine didnt with the second pregnancy because I was very active, is what I think it was. It may all hit at once or it may take its time and one thing will hit then another. Good luck to you!

I just started feeling really miserable yesterday and I am almost 34 weeks. It started when I asked my doctor if I go past my due date when will she induce and she won't induce me until x-mas week when I'm due December 13th. As if that's not bad enough she said she is taking vacation that week so she won't be there to deliver me, yet she refuses to induce me earlier. That just made me feel hopeless. I feel like I just need to accept that I'll be pregnant forever. I feel like my baby is never going to get here! Sorry for the ranting, I'm just MISERABLE!

In another 3-4 weeks (at about 35 wks) is when it started getting bad for me.  You start getting bigger in the belly due to the baby putting on weight (and if you're a thin person, it becomes uncomfortable because you don't think you can stretch any more).  The peeing was my worst part.  Seemed like every 15 minutes, I had to go... only to get a couple of drops out... and then it would all start again.  The worst is at night when you're trying to get some sleep and have to keep getting out of bed to go pee (Brrr... especially during the winter months).  The baby gets less and less room to move around, so all the jerky jabs sometimes hurt.  My son barely bothered me... but my daughter was like an alien and kicked me in the ribs alot.  People would see her moving in my belly and were shocked... but it made for interesting conversation.
Sleeping can be very rough... I recommend lots of pillows to put between your knees, behind you to prevent from rolling back, and one to hug in front of you.  I slept with 4-5 pillows every night to keep me snuggled and in one position.
I never had any swelling of the feet... but did experience knee pain from varicose veins.



At the end of the day... all the discomfort you'll feel is nothing compared to the breast pain you'll go through when your milk comes in.  That too shall pass.  Don't be scared about any of it, because it always sounds worse, and you can drive yourself crazy trying to anticipate what and how and when.  You'll deal with it when it happens... and you'll eventually realize that it the whole scheme of things... all this discomfort is nothing compared to how crazy they'll drive you when they're out and walking and talking.
I delivered both my kids drug free and always chuckled that the labor was more tolerable than the few weeks before giving birth.  I had both of my kids 12 days early... and it wasn't soon enough for me.



Good luck... and try to make the best of it.  There's not much you can do to change what will happen (and no, it doesn't all hit at once... thank god), but it's how you choose to deal with it that makes the difference.

My pregnant gf says we moved to fast?



me and my girlfriend known each other for only about two months and found out she was pregnant.  Everything was good we decided to have it and we were happy.  I have noticed the last month or so that she has been distancing herself from me (not coming over to my house or calling as much).  I would go and see her at work for a couple of hours a night and we would talk and hang out like there was no problem.  She is pregnant and I do everything I can for her.  But last night when I went to see her I got a weird vibe.  So I asked her later on if I was annoying her or anything like that and then asked her if I was still her boyfriend.  She said she didn't know and that hurt me.  She said we moved to fast (i can agree) She also said I did nothing wrong and everything right and told me that she was sorry and never meant to hurt me.



What should I do?  I told her we could start over and take it as slow as she wants too.  I just don't want to lose her she means everything to me.  How do I keep the woman that I love?  and I know I love her because everytime I see her I fall in love all over again.  Please help.



could this be hormones.. she said something about stress and didn't need it for her or the baby.

<additional details>



by the way I am 33 and she is 26 with a 6 year old and lives with her parents.  we both work.  I am going to second shift when my daughter is born so she can be with her girls during the evening and i can get some daddy time during the day.  save on daycare.



she is half way on the pregnancy right now... and I know her ex is a real j**ka**.  she was with him for 7 years.  I was married for 10 years and have no kids except the one on the way...

that's nice you want to be there for her and your baby together but give her a little space. Be sure she knows you are there and ready to help or talk or whatever and hopefully she will come around. If you do breakup still try to discuss with her how you would liek to have a relationship with your child etc.



Most likely she is scared!! 2 months is not a long time and her body and life are going to change A LOT so be patient with her. Pregnancy is not easy.

Give her some time but don't leave her alone, be there and be persistent without being too in her face and annoying, chances are she will come around



Good luck

You are being supportive and that is wonderful! Congrats on the baby!



Your girlfriend is going through a lot right now and is facing what she thinks of as "the rest of her life" thoughts right now. I'm sure she cares for you, but if this pregnancy was unplanned then it can really make her evaluate her decisions and her life.



She probably is really confused (and hormonal!) and feels as though she lost her independence and "young years". It's normal, just give her space but continue to be supportive.



Good luck, you sound really sweet. Congrats again Daddy!

It could be hormones.  You should give her some space.  Let her know that you will be there every step of the way, but back off a little and let her come to you if she wants to.  Ask her when her doctor appointments are and tell her you'd like to take her to them.  But other than that, she may just need some space.  You two did kind of move too fast, and she may not be ready for a relationship, you might just have to accept that.

Well it could be stress or it could be that for her the honeymoon is over and she's just not interested in you any more.  It happens with most couples unfortunately and that's why a lot of people have a few relationships before they find someone that they stay with.  A baby is not going to change her feelings for you.



You need to ask her to give you a straight answer and if it ends up being that she doesn't want to be with you romantically, you have to work out how you're going to stay involved in the child's life.



I'm really sorry for you and I hope its ok.  You sound like a decent guy.

The best thing you can do right now is to back off and give her some space.  Two months isn't a very long time for a relationship, especially when you suddenly add an unexpected pregnancy when you've hardly had time to get to know each other.  You may like her a lot, but she is trying to come to terms with the fact that her life has officially changed forever.  She has to come to terms with the fact that you and she will always have a common link through that child even if the relationship between you two doesn't work out in the end.  She is probably also processing things about you that she may not have cared about when you two were just going out but which change everything when she has to think about the well being of the baby.  So give her space, give her time, and let her set the pace for your relationship for now.  You still need to be there for her, emotionally and possibly financially, but meanwhile, just give her time.

She probably starting to feel a little overwhelmed with everything that is happening to her right now.  She is feeling all sorts of emotions she has never had before plus the hormones are really starting to kick in.



Tell her how you feel about the whole thing.  She may just need constant reassurances right now that she made the right choice and things will work out.  Keep reminding her that you here for her no matter what.  That you can work things out as fast and as slow as she wants.  Tell her you want to really get to her know over the next few months and vise versa.  Tell her thats it ok to feel that way, a lot of things are happening with her right now, but you will be there for her and they baby.



Try starting to re-date again.  Take her out on real dates and show how much you care.  If you try to tell her how much you love her, it could only overwhelm her more.



Good Luck and just keep trying, remember she can't control everything she is going through right now! :)

If this is her first child, she is having to cope with a lot of emotions at this point. Not to mention she may not be feeling too well, along with being extremely exhausted and of course feeling somewhat stressed. You should definitely give her time and space to work it out for herself, so she can decide just what kind of support she needs from you.



My husband and I went through something similar with our first son, and I discovered that for a first time mother, it's not always easy to properly communicate the variety of emotions your experiencing, but it truly helps to listen and make sure she understands that you're here for her, whenever and however she needs you.



Things will get better as long as you both keep communicating honestly with each other and always remember why you came together in the first place! You're bringing a new life into the world, and that baby's health and well-being is the most important factor, so the less stress for her is all the better for the baby.



Good luck!

It could be hormones or it could be the fact that she realized you're not the one for her. Only time will tell. For now, give her the space she wants, but let her know that you will be there for her if she decides she wants a relationship. Tell her that you want to stay involved with the baby, even if it's only to take her to doctor's appointments, childbirth classes, etc. She's going through a lot right now, and you guys weren't together for that long before she got pregnant, so she may just not know what she wants right now.

If you had a miscarriage at 8 weeks preg you would know and have to visit the hospital or see a doctor.
Maybe you weren't pregnant at all and just thought you were cuz you missed a period?
The blood test you are taking ...whats it for?  you say everything but truthfully the doc will only mark certain things to be tested for and pregnancy might not be one of them
Ask the doc if they check hcg.
It depends if you did miscarry or not, you can still have some bleeding during pregnancy and be ok, the test if it's 2 weeks from now may not show it.
The hormones decrease every 48 hours, when I miscarried I had to be retested every 48 hours to be sure that they went down and it was a miscarriage consisting of all of the baby

Have you discussed all of this with a doctor?



You need to get checked... to make sure that your uterus is completely emptied out.



I lost my baby 2 months ago.  I was about 7 weeks.  My body did take care of it on it's own...but I did have several ultrasounds to be sure that everything was cleared out to make sure I didn't need a D&C.



But to answer your other question... my hormones (hcg) did not return to normal until almost one and half months afterwards.  The numbers took that long to go back down.

Yes, it takes a few weeks for hormones to go down.  I would see the doc right away to make sure you are miscarrying, as if you are hemorraging it could be life threatening.  Plus, the baby may still be able to save with progesterone if it isn't too late.  Also, sometimes the baby is okay and you will bleed, so it would be good to check with a doc regardless.

It could be quite possible that you did pass the baby. I have had three miscarriages and after the first time I had one my doctor told me that in most of the early miscarriages the baby disappears back into the uterus and is then undetected on ever being pregnant or that you will pass the baby and it will look that of a blood clot. Sometimes you can be told that you were pregnant after miscarriage sometimes you can not. I would go to a doctor and have them valuate the situation. Some woman do bleed during their pregnancy like they were having their period.

Before I had my miscarriage I had spotting, then a few days later I had brown blood every day for like 2-3 days, then I started losing blood clots, (the actual miscarriage).  Miscarriage is different from a period, because you lose blood clots (decent size ones).  When you go for your blood work in two weeks it won't show up, as long as it was actual miscarriage.  The only way it will show up is if you didn't lose the baby and you are still pregnant.  Normally they have you come in in two weeks after a miscarriage to test, to make sure you aren't still pregnant, especially since there have been cases of people losing a twin, but one baby is still fine and healthy.  But to say the least, if you truly had a miscarriage then there is still a possibility that it will show up.  Just because every person is different, and the amount of time you were pregnant and hcg levels (how high they were) and how slow they drop make a difference.  So it could show up.

I suppose I had missed it by a few days. I didn't actually keep count of my period. I knew it was regular so I usually just expected it whenever I would have light cramping, it would signify my period was coming the next day. I didn't think I was pregnant because I was on birth control, so I took a test like a few days after my period was missed and found out.

It's dangerous, I personally would trust the ultrasound. When you go back for your second ultrasound, I would ask for them to confirm the sex one last time before you buy clothing. Doctors are hardly ever wrong when it comes to the ultrasound.

It does not work and it's been advised on a lot of sites that you not do it at all. Drano is a toxic chemical that you really shouldn't be around in general when you are pregnant. If it helps, the chinese gender chart was right for me. I'm having a girl...the tech and genetic doctor said they were 100% sure.

I've seen the drano test done at babyshowers...someone other than the pregnant woman should always do the test for you AWAY from you!  This is because it is very toxic.  Basically you pee in a cup and then someone adds about 1tbsp of drano crystals.  Based on the color and the amount of foam they'll predict the gender.  Of course its only about 50% chance it's correct.



At one baby shower, my mom did it for 3 pregnant women there.  One of them had results that for sure indicated girl so the mom went out to buy all kinds of girl and pink stuff.  Turns out it was a boy.



I'd say have someone do it for fun, but don't rely on it.

b/c sometimes your body doesn't react the way they want it to and it could cause a c-section and or a long drawn out labor.  they still offer the medications but you have to dialate more before taking them i think, b/c they can slow the process down alone

I was induced with my daughter. The reason why it is so much harder is the drug Pitocin that they use to induce your labor. The contractions are much harder and you often do not have a break in between. I had as many as 4 contractions in a row. Yes, you can still have an epidural. I had an epidural and it didn't take, so I ended up having natural childbirth. Good luck.

The big difference is that it labor progresses faster generally with induction.  So your body has less time to adjust to the faster increasing pressure.  Induction don't make your contraction harder, they just tend to feel more painful because of this faster paced labor.



You can get an epidural and everything just like natural labor.  So you shouldn't need to worry.  However, you might want your epidural a little sooner than a person going into labor naturally.  Congratulations on your up coming bundle of joy.

Because anytime you force the body to do something, it doesn't always work right.  Contractions come on hard and fast unlike natural contractions.  Your body doesn't kick in its natural reactions to labor and delivery as it is not a natural delivery.  Usually pain medications slow down or stop an induced labor, then they have to give you more medication to override the pain meds!  Your body just isn't given the time it needs to do all that is does during labor.  And often times it puts the baby into stress, low heart beat, and then you have to do a c-section! It is a mess and best to go natural when you can!

neg blood test, but I have pregnancy symptoms, if pregnant, I would be almost 6 weeks so I am sure that the blood test would pick up hcg if I was, but the weird thing is that I am never late and I have the same symptoms as I did with #1, mild low back pain for 3 days now and mild cramping, dishcharge and sore boobs, doc said to take another blood test next week.  Also last night during sex there was a burning feeling down there, afterwards it was a bit sore and when I wiped I saw very little light red blood.  I have no idea what is going on with  my body.  Pregnant? Uti? So confused, almost 6 weeks since last period.

The HCG should pick up especially on a blood test.  It is possible you had a very early miscarriage.  I would wait for the other test to see what happens, the light blood may be the start of your period.  Good luck!

Test in the morning when you wake up. the box says to do that. a late period and symptoms like that could just mean you're not giving your body enough TLC...eat right, stop stressin', exercise, sleep well, these things keep your clock right. If you don't get it in another week and keep testing negative go to the doctor again.

A lot of times, yes. But if you are worried about it (I know I am, lol), you can request to have an enema to have your bowels emptied and not eat anything during labor. That's what I'm thinking of doing--unless I'm in too much pain from contractions, then I probably won't get an enema and will end up pooing on the table..nurses and doctors are used to it and they aren't going to let it get onto your baby, though.

Sometimes.  depends on what is in you and last BM and all other factors.  Soemtimes they will ask you if there is time, if you feel you need an enima while in labor so this doesn't happen and so you will not have as much constipation afterwards.  Embrassed to say but it happened to me with #4.  If it does happen, don't worry, they see it all the time.

It's very possible. But don't worry, there isn't anything a labor and delivery nurse hasn't seen... They'll whisk it away before you even realize it's there.



One way to get around it is to take an enema when you realize your in labor. They used to be routinely given in the hospital when a laboring mom came in, but the practice is going out of style. And it doesn't mean you won't end up "pooing" anyways.

Sometimes, but my doctor said that most of the time no.  Frequently women get diarhea just before going into labor, and that tends to clear out your bowls.  It will feel like you are pooping though beause you use the same muscles to push out a baby as a BM

yup. it sure can. you are supposed to push as though you are making a bowel movement. BUT it doesn't always happen, and if it does it's usually not much (according to the nurse at my birthing class).



A lot of women will make a bowel movement early in labor before they are in the hospital to get rid of some of the waste, others actually give themselves and enama (sp?)
BUT don't worry about that. You will not know if you do, and the nurses are used to it! They just wipe it away, no big deal!

Like everyone else said, yes it can happen. But that's not why they don't let you eat solid food. The reason for that is so you don't vomit, if you need pain meds or an epidural these things can make you nauseous. Also if you end up needing a C-section, they don't want you eating just like before any surgery. So the not eating is preventative for other reasons.
And as for getting diarrhea befor labor, well I was actually constipated, and they gave me an enema. Not only so I wouldn't poo, but because being constipated would have made the labor more uncomfortable.

In the UK, that would considered direct sex discrimination.  An employer cannot under any circumstances fire you for being pregnant.  If you are in the US however, I don't know.  I can only imagine that it is also illegal given that you have good employee protection laws there too.

<answer>



It is usually illegal to fire an employee because she is pregnant. But in some jobs, there may be exceptions.  If the job involves physical risk to a pregnant woman, the employer is supposed to reassign her to different duties, but that isn't always possible.



If pregnancy is treated the same as any other physical condition that prevents an employee from doing their job, then it may not be illegal.  For instance, if an employer would let someone go because they broke their leg and couldn't work, then I believe it is also legal to do the same in case of pregnancy.  It depends on the job.



The other issue is whether you can prove that pregnancy was the reason why you were fired. If they can document any other reason, such as poor work performance, absenteeism, or insubordination, they may get away with it.



If you feel you were discriminated against, it would be worth consulting an attorney who specializes in employment cases or going to your local equal opportunity office (if one exists).  Most attorneys will give you a free initial consultation, and then you can decide if it's worth pursuing a lawsuit.

Yeah, he can't do that. You need to call the Better Business Bureau; if you look in the phone book, it should be there. If you can't find the number, you need to look online, or look online for your local unemployment agency and file a claim with them. How long have you been at your job? What kind of a place was this, a factory? A store? If you haven't been there long enough to draw unemployment benefits, you can still get him in trouble and probably get some kind of monetary compensation. This is very unfair and you've got to do something to let him know you are not going to just let him fire you over being pregnant; that's illegal and it's discrimination!

He cannot fire you for being pregnant.  You can sue him for discrimination if he does.  What reason did he give you for firing you, and does he have any documentation?  Most of the time an employer will need to have some sort of written documentation.  For example if you are consistently late to work, or miss work and they have called you in to talk about it they should have put something in your personnel file showing that there were problems and that you were aware of the problems and that you did not remedy the problems.  Or if they have told you that you need to increase your sales by 25%  by a certain date and you didn't do it.  If you really think that he fired you because you are pregnant and he didn't give you a good reason then you should talk to a lawyer about it.

Probably not. Obviously, as you got your period, you are not now pregnant.



Most people have a ripe egg (called ovulation) about fourteen days after the start of their last period. For 3-4 days either side of that Day 14, you're highly likely to conceive. Before and after that time you're technically safe, but absolutely not guaranteed!



Probably a greater concern is the risk of sexually transmitted disease.

No, the chemicals soak through your skin and are harmful to your baby. It's best to stay ghostly white until your baby is born.

I was told by my doctor that since research hasn't been done about self-tanners and how it would affect the baby, to just not use it.  Especially in the first trimester when your baby is developing.  Go natural!

It depends on the specific item you want to use. Each brand has a different recipe and uses different ingredients.



I would suggest asking your doctor if the specific spray or creme you want to use is safe for you.



Even a nurse could tell you that if you call the office. She'll run go ask him real quick and if they dont have an immediate answer they'll usually call you back within an hour.

I feel pregnant but the test says no, what's up with that?



Ok, here are my symptoms:



-I'm tired ALL the time
-I yell at my husband for NOTHING
-My breasts hurt, have new stretch marks and I can see the veins, and I never could see them before
-I am craving the weirdest things, especially apple juice and ranch dressing.  And the other night all I wanted was tomato soup and I hate tomatoes.
-Dispite drinking my weight in apple juice every day, I am so constipated.
-On Sunday night, I had killer cramps, which I have only ever gotten on my period
-I have heartburn
-Food , sometimes even the smell of food, makes me nauseous
-I am getting car sick all the time, even if I am driving
-I am having major headaches



All this being said, you would think that the pregnacy test would come up with a flaming "YES" in 10 seconds.  But it is coming up negative, but I have taken 2 in the past 2 days.  The one I took yesterday was a very very faint line, but the test today had nothing. (Note that I took 2 different brands.)  So what is going on?  Should I wait a couple weeks and try again or make an appointment with my OBGYN? This is my husband's and my first baby, so I have no idea what is going on.  Please help!!!

I know what you mean, I knew I was pregnant even though I kept getting negatives.  The test you took with a faint line, if that line was one of two then you are pregnant.  It doesn't matter how bright or faint the line is, if it is there at all then you are pregnant.  Congrats lil' mommy!  Next step is to make an appointment with your OBGYN.  On your first visit they will give you another test to make sure.  Good luck!!

As long as the controller line was visible, if you got a very faint line, you are pregnant. Congratulations. If you want to be positive, wait a couple of days and test again. It will come up dark. When i tested to see if I was pregnant, the line was so faint that I had to hold it in certain lights to see it. I even thought that maybe I was imagining it because it was so faint. But I am pregnant!

If you got a faint line you are def pregnant, any type of line is a positive!  Congrats, wait a few days, test again....the Dollar General brand pregnancy test works well and the tests are cheap, or you can take a 1st response test that should work too but its much more expensive.....Go to the doctor if all your future tests come up negative and have them do a blood test to tell you for sure. The line for me was so faint I almost dismissed it as me not being pregnant, but waited a few days and the line was little darker, I am now 30 weeks prego. Good Luck!

My husband has a girfriedn while i am prego ?



Okay please if you have nothing nice don't comment on my question not really able to deal with mean people.



So I am 27 week pregos. My husband in Aug the week of the Olympics went in a business trip and meet another women. He came back and told me he is having these feelings for her and he wants to separate from me and try it with her. I explained that this is lust and it would go away but he said he has to try it. The other women lives in DC he live in Florida so is a long distance relationship they are having at this point. He goes and visit her every 2 weeks or when ever he has money to buy a ticket and talks on the phone with her every night for 3 hours. I am planning on divorcing him when I have the baby so don't worry about me doing the right thing. the fact that I am prego and he doing this means he does not respect me and I am not going to stand for that. My question is



They tell each other I love you already do you think this is real love or efatuation AKA lust talking and that he will snap out of this. He already has a kid with a women he had a one night stand and now having another one with me his wife of 3 years. This women according to him knows this and is willing to still try the relationship. I told him it will pass but he dosen't believe me he think it will work out. He say he loves me still but he dosen't feel that passion that he feeling with her. Can someone tell me can i be wrong maybe they do really love each other. He is in the navy and can't leave florida until June so they won't be able to be together until then. Can someone give me some insite b/c I am really trying to understand this madness.

Are there any statistics that state when a women usually delivers her 2nd child?



i.e....early, late, etc.  I am just a little nervous bc with my first I went into labor at 730pm the day before my due date and delivered less than 5 hrs later at 12:15 am on my due date.  If you usually take less time to deliver I want to know when I should be on "high alert".  I am just 5 weeks now so I have a long time to go.

I also had my first son on his due date at 4:21am.  My second son was born 2 days before his ultrasound due date and 4 days before the LMP due date.  After that, I had a scheduled c-section at 38 weeks and 5 days, so that doesn't really count.



I've also heard that your first baby is usually your longest labor and those after are often a bit shorter.  I think I read it in "What to Expect when you're Expecting."  Go check it out.



Good luck and congrats!

Your family history is the best indicator.



All four of my children were all 10 days past the due date just like clockwork.  I can't tell you how discouraging it is to still be waddling around several days after that target date!



I remember my doctor always told me anytime 2 weeks before or after my due date was very normal.

It is rare, but certainly possible, as fluid released from the penis to lubricate can contain some live sperm... It's a roll of the dice, and a risky one at that!

Not to, rare, cause you have to remember that the male will pre-*** and that can easily get a woman pregnant. Strap one on, or just be ready to have little ones.

The failure rate for withdrawal is around 20%.  Which means that in 100 couples using the method for a year, about 20 will become pregnant.



By contrast, the failure rate for condoms (used carefully/correctly) is about 2%.  For pills it's about 1%.  (And if you use no method at all, about 80% will be pregnant.)



So, while withdrawal is better than nothing, it's far from a reliable method -- there are many better options available.

No, I'm sorry to say but all those methods don't work. You don't even have to penetrate and you can still get pregnant if his pre-*** touches the outside of you...it's still possible. Don't be another Yahoo! Answers statistic who will ask "Am I pregnant?"

This is not rare at all. You need to use protection. Sperm comes out of the penis before the man comes, so you need to be protected for the entirety of sex.

The pull out method is not a form a of BC at all. Teh fact is that pre-c** is more fertile then teh actual Stuff and he can get that in you at anytime just becasue he didnt ejaculate insid eyou doesn;t mean you won;t. it is roo of teh die. USe  The pull or condoms or both but no methid is 100% the best way nto to get pregnanct is nto to have sex.

How much weight is safe to hold?



I am now 32 weeks pregnant. I usually carry my laptop bag in one hand and my stuffed lunch bag in the other at work every morning. However, I use elevators and have to walk very little with all that stuff, altogether a couple of minutes. Could carrying this weight be harmful to the baby in any way?

Hi, I had my regular period in the beginning of last month. After two days that it had stopped I was spotting. I know there could be implantation bleeding could it be it or maybe just my period? Now it's the end of the month and I have cramps and breast tenderness can it just be pms or baby?!

33 weeks pregnant mucus plug?



Okay I am 33 weeks and I will be 34 on Sunday and I been having more discharge than usually. Some it is green at times and sometimes it is yellow and white. It looks like boogers to me or something similar. My question is can it be my mucus plug coming out slowly or is it normal? I also been having some contractions off and on and they were so bad last night that I could not sleep on either side it went from my back to my front and into my legs it was really bad. I also can feel the baby drop a little too so I was not sure if these are signs of labor or not.

sounds like a yeast infection, very common during pregnacy, sounds like your just having contractions cause the baby's starting to get engaged, its normal to have that happen around 33/34 weeks

Getting a physical after pregnancy?



Hi,
So I had my last physical when I was 25 and everything came back great. I am 28 now and going to have my first baby in a few weeks (or sooner). I think I should go get another physical but no sure how long to wait after the baby is born and I go back to my normal exercise and eating like a non pregnant woman routine. How long did you wait?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You should get a physical every year. Since you'll be followed up by an OB-Gyn after your delivery, I would wait about 6 weeks (when the OB-Gyn is supposed to give you a clean bill of health) and then have my physical.

Moms who have been through this before,?



please give me some encouragement. I don't know how you got through it. I have not slept in what feels like years. There is no such thing as a comfortable sleeping position. I am 36 weeks pregnant. I've been doing so well with my weight & now between the eating that's been going on today and yesterday I am sure that before this is all over my butt is going to spread like butter on hot bread before it's all over. I thought I was doing so well.



Please tell me that the end is worth all the hard work or @ least that i'll be able to get my figure back :(

Chances of pregnancy while spotting?



had my period on Sept. 22-25 My boyfriend and I have unprotected sex all the time and we use the "pull out method" We're not to concerned about not getting pregnant. On friday. I was still spotting lightly and I think he was a little bit late pulling out and may have got a little inside me. On sunday I woke up with a bad headache and was throwing up but was only sick for about 2 hrs. We've had unprotected sex several times this past weekend. I know it's to early to test but I wanna know!
i'm not having any symptoms really-just the throwing up and having a dramatic change in appetite.
what are the chances i'm pregnant?



Friday-he may have came inside me
saturday-he took me out to eat and my stomach hurt soo bad, I couldn't eat anything!
Sundayy-bad headache and throwing up.
ever since then-changes in appetite.

Most of the time when the baby attaches itself you have spotting or discharge. About the headaches and throwing up I dont know because people can have symptoms the minuet they get pregnant and some people don't have those symptoms at all. And by the way the pull out method never works. During sex there is a thing called pre *** men ejaculate a little as soon as there penis gets hard, and you can get pregnant off of that. If you don't wanna use condoms there are a lot of different things that you can get. They have spermicide lube, sponges, and they have this thing called contraceptive film, its like one of those listerine breath strips things and all you do is stick it in there and it kills sperm for three hours and neither you or your partner can feel it. Just go to like wall greens or wall mart they should have it there.

Sleep increase during first trimester?



My husband and I are waiting to find out if I'm pregnant, so we don't know yet.  For the past week or so, I've went from sleeping 5-7 hours a night to 12-13.  My apatite has also increased and I pee more often.  Do you think I could be pregnant?  I'm really keeping my fingers crossed!!!

Before i found out i was pregnant my boobs where my first sign - they were hurting and they started getting bigger.



I did a test the day before my period was due but it wasnt till the end of that week i started being sleepy more.
I would sleep all night and soon as i got home from work i would go to bed and ignore watching my soaps, doing my husbands dinner and i would stay asleep till the next morning when i had to get up for work.
That lasted till 1 week into my 2nd trimester.
Now i am in my 3rd trimester i keep finding myself napping in the day.



Soon as i hit 6 weeks i had really bad sickness that didnt lay off till around 20 weeks but now i am in my 3rd trimester its starting again.



As for ur bladder - mine didnt kick off till i was around 8 weeks - gets worse the bigger u get.
I cant go anywhere without going the loo first and even then i need to go again after i have locked the front door lol.



Hope ur pregnant hun and good luck.
Love Manda xXx

The sleepy thing usually hits you the hardest. I slept so much people thought I was hibernating. As far as running to the bathroom this early, I dont know because the baby isn't big enough to push on your uterus. Like now I'm 14 wks and the baby isn't that big, but when I drink fluids, depending on where and how I'm sitting I will go every 30 to 45 mins. That's how long it takes fluid to travel through you. Thats why if your going to get an ultrasound, you should be done way before you get to the doctor. Being hungry, yes. If your appetite has picked up more than normal, chances are you could be. Hope for the best.

The shot will make you gain A LOT of weight, one of the many side effects to the joyous things. The shot is a horrible horrible form of birth control. I wouldn't suggest that anyone use it, with all the crazy side effects that it has.

No birth control is 100% effective, not even the shot. Granted, it doesn't happen often, but it has been known to happen here and there. Not sure exactly what your question is. Do you think you're getting bigger because you're pregnant? If you were pregnant, you'd have to be at least around 4 months to really be getting bigger. But you'd have other symptoms as well. Give some more details for a better answer though.

Blames me for wanting to get PREGNANT!!!?



So I got on Birth  control starting last week. Well I accedently left it at his house so I eneded up skipping the pill for 2 days and well now I finally got it back. Well when I got it back he got really angry at me. He saids, "Is this some sort of GAME your trying to play to get pregnant?"



(By the way he's 17 and I'm 18 so we both know that were really not ready ofcoarse and I really dont want kids until I'm 23-25)



And I dont know..I didnt say anything when he said that cuz I didnt want to get things worse but ..I CANT BELIEVE HE ACTUALLY THINKS THAT I'M NOT TAKING IT JUST SO I COULD GET PREGNANT! That'll be VERY cold of me to do that and I would never trick him in any sort of way. I would be a total b itch to do that.



I told him that it was just two of them that I missed and even though it was only a week of me on birth control, we still used condoms anyways. I don't know what his deal is but it just really made me sad and upset that he would think I would do something like that. I don't know....I dont want to brake up because of this (its been a year)..i think we just realy need to talk it out but...I dont know...I think he should be the one to come to me first if he wants to talk....what should I do?



[Please NO RUDE comments. I did this question for 'ADVICE'...not to bring me down]



</question>



<additional details>



Please No Rude comments! He really isn't a jerk..hes very loyal to me and good its just he really doesn't want kids especially right now I mean...were still younge and WE STILL do use condoms anyway. I think things just might of freaked him out or something but I know that shouldnt be an exuse for him thinking I'm playing a game..thats not cool of him to think that.



Can people PLEASE stop sending me rude comments that he's a jerk..thats not helping at all.



And no Duh I don't wanna get pregnant..why do you think I'm on the pill and we STILL use condoms just to be on the safe side.

You say he 'blames you for wanting to get pregnant'...so are we missing something? Do you want to get pregnant? Because he's accusing you of wanting to get pregnant.



Either way, I agree with the other posters. He sounds like a jerk.



If you think you need to talk about it, or anything, have the guts to bring it up. What good is it to be in a relationship where you cannot even have a talk about something important with your partner?

It's an understandable reaction on his part.  But you did just now start on the pill.  You're not used to taking it yet.  Talk with him and reassure him that it was just an accident of inexperience.



Besides, you probably shouldn't be having unprotected sex during the first month of taking the pill anyway.

The fact that you are not ready for children is a clear reason to use more than one form of contraceptive! Have you ever thought of using a diaphragm? They do work very well and are comfortable for men during sex with women. Be careful with your life because you only get one chance with it and if you make a mistake it always hurts for a while. In carpentry there is a saying and it goes "measure  twice and cut once"! You were a child once and you remember being hurt, so try not to bring a child into this world without the love of both party's involved. Children really do need the real mom and real dad to be really secure in life and you sound like a very responsible person so take care and have a wonderful life! Oh and as for your man, they always get over it in time if they really are real men!

There are two issues here: your mistake in not being diligent in taking your birth control pills, and his reaction to it.



Now, I have some sympathy for him on the first front - if the two of you are relying on the pills for your birth control needs (though it sounds like you're using condoms as a backup), then you are required to be responsible about taking the pills.  There are a lot of unwanted pregnancies resulting from women who "accidentally forgot" to take the pill for a few days.  He is justified in being a bit upset there.



HOWEVER . . .



Getting "really angry" and berating you for it is not exactly the behavior you'd expect from someone who (presumably) claims to care for you.  From that, he sounds like a bit of a jerk.  Whether he's a congenital jerk or was just a jerk in that one stressful moment is something you'd know better than anyone here.



What you need to do is talk to him about this - acknowledge your mistake, but make sure that he knows that you don't think his reaction was appropriate.  Don't just wait for him to talk.  And, if he really is a jerk, don't feel the need to stay with him just because you've been together for a long time.  I've seen this in many friends, and seen that staying with someone who treats you poorly is worse for your mental health than just being alone.



Again, I'm not saying that he is a jerk - you have to judge that for yourself.  If he's not, then he'll listen when you have your talk.  If he doesn't, then that should be a red flag for you.

I did forget to take my pills and got pregnant.  I knew I could get pregnant, but somehow didn't think it would happen, and in the moment really didn't care.



My husband and I laugh now that I "tricked" him into being a dad.  Maybe I did, but we're both extremely excited for our new baby.



I guess that's what 10 years of maturity and being with the right guy looks like.



Let him know that you won't trick him and you will let him know if you've missed pills so that he can use a condom.  The responsibility of birth control can't fall entirely on you and he needs to know that it's hard to remember to take a pill every day.  You'll try your best, but there will be times you'll let him know to use a backup method.

If you made an honest mistake (which everyone does) and forgot the pills at his house, he needs to grow up.  But if I was you, I wouldn't have sex with him since he is accusing you of "wanting to get pregnant".  Next time he asks you for sex just tell him no because I don't want to get pregnant. I'm may be older, but I still have mind of a child. Oh and by the way, birth control pills don't go into effect right away. So keep that in mind.

I have a feeling you won’t like my advice and thus it will be “rude” in your prospective.



Why hold on to a relationship with a guy who would treat you this way? I don’t understand the appeal.



If you think it needs to be discussed, you need to have the maturity to bring it up. Don’t stew about it, just deal with it.



I still think this is a pretty big issue to just work through, especially with someone you’re sleeping with. Do you both not realize that the pill can fail?



Will he blame you and walk out if you get knocked up inspite of the pill? If you’re both not ready to be parents, you’re just playing with fire. I think you should consider yourself lucky that you got a taste of what would happen IF that did happen before you actually had to deal with it.

OKAY, I am now 19 and i have a ten month old i got pregnant about a month after I turned 18 with my boyfriend at the time he was 17 and he accused me of the same thing i went to get birth control and so I wouldnt get accused anymore but i was already pregnant.. so of course the entire family blammed me he said he would be there for me and he loves me but that i shouldnt have been playing GAMES with him and trying to make this happen. so i tried to explain to him that i didnt and there were many fights about it. so when i was about three months pregnant he dropped me off at the mall broke up with me and told me he wanted nothing to do with this baby and he signed his rights away and i will never hear from him again.



it sounds to me like this guy is jerk. and doesnt trust you at all obviously so if there was an accident... do you really want to take a chance of something like that happening to you?

I think its annoying that he is so accusatory...he doesn't take the pill everyday and most likely doesn't understand exactly how it works.  I don't think he is actually angry about missing the pills, it sounds like he is just paranoid about the possibility of pregnancy in general.  And rightly so...I realize you are both taking precautions, which is terrific and more than most people do.  I would confront him about this in a calm and rational way to try to get to the root of the problem.  The main point is, if you are going to be sexually active together, you are going to have to deal with whatever consequences there are...condoms break, women forget their pills.  Its part of the risk, but you are clearly both doing your best to be responsible.  Good luck!

Well I can kind of understand why he would think that. I mean yeah, he should trust you more but still, if you leave your pills somewhere for two days that's being really careless and it does make it look intentional. I mean, after the first day, you should have realized you didn't have them. But to go two days without taking them is really irresponsible so that gave him a reason to question your motives. Just explain to him that that's not what you're trying to do. If it's hard for you to remember to take your pills, you may need to get on the shot. Condoms break and you can still get pregnant and if that happens you both will be devestated seeing that you're not ready for that yet.

what an ***. being a good guy most of the time doesn't excuse jerk moments. he needs to realize that, and now how he made you feel. he needs to come to you to apologize, DON'T go crawling to him. he needs to say sorry and trust you or else your relationship won't go anywhere. if he really thinks that low of you than it is way better off for you to leave him-- just because you have been together a year is NO reason to stay together, never use that to justify not breaking up. anyone who thinks u are that kind of person or doesn't trust you DOESNT DESERVE YOU. if he refuses to apologize get rid of that jerk and find someone better. i know it's hard but trust me, it's for the best. there is someone out there who will actually respect you. if he can't apologize to you and realize his wrongs, bye bye boy! don't let this go and don't give in to him, he's being a real ***. good luck =) again, u deserve better and u can have it too. if he apologizes and sees how bad he made u feel, then hurray! sounds like u guys need to have a big talk

You're going to need to tell your parents.  Trust me, I know how hard it is.



I got pregnant at 17.



My parents got mad at me for a few weeks & then everything was fine.  Honestly you pretty much screwed up big time.  Just be grateful that you didn't get an STD or AIDs.  You really should always use a condom unless you want to get someone pregnant...pulling out is only like 85% effective anyways.  Its best to tell your parents before they hear it from somebody else or worse....her parents!!



Oh yeah, abortion is not the answer.  There are plenty of people in this world who would love to have a child & can't.  I would adopt someone's baby in a heart beat if I knew they were even going to consider that.

Hi sweetheart!



I was induced with 2 of my babies and I guess, since it's the only way I've ever delivered- I don't see what's so "awful."



I didn't have an epidural with either baby, went 100% natural and yes, it was painful, but it was such a small amount of time I didn't mind it. It wasn't scary for me at all. With each of my kids, once I got the pitocin my contractions picked up like crazy and they were painful, but I don't think they were any stronger than the contractions I was having at home.



The only super painful time was right before I needed to push and during pushing...and I'm pretty sure that's going to be painful no matter what!



Don't worry about getting induced...labor is labor and it's different for everyone. That's why some women swear by epidurals and some women refuse them. Some women have 3 hour labors and some have 30 hour labors....you'll see it's not scary any way you have it. You'll be taken care of, baby will be taken care of and it'll be over before you know it!!

The only thing positive, is you'll know when your going into labor! I have had an inducement and went on my own. My second was suppose to be induced but he decided to come on his own THANK GOD!! Inducement is stronger pains and stronger labor itself. I swore up and down after labor with my first I would never do it again. Then when my son decided to come on his own, i was so thank full, and I would rather deliver him 10x over again then ever go through an inducement again!!!!

I've been induced twice, with my 2nd son it was horrible and ended in what I completely believe was an unneccessary csection due to the induction.  With my 3rd son I wanted a VBAC but he didn't do so well on a NST so they decided to induce me the day before my due date but they did it differently this time.  The used Cervail which ripens, softens and prepares your cervix for labor, doesn't really induce you, doesn't start contractions, just prepares your body for when they will give you pitocin.  Well that alone put me into labor but they did still use a bit of pitocin and that labor and delivery went great, couldn't have been better.  In the matter of 1hr and 43min I went from being 4cm to 10 and delivering him :)



But really if possible I would try and avoid being induced medically, maybe try some at home stuff, lots of walking and sex.  If you do have to do it medically I would really ask about the cervadil first.  Why do they want you do deliver before your due date?

I basically got induced last Friday. My body went to 4 cm, but that's as far as I would go on my own. I showed up at the hospital at 8:30 am. They checked me in and got me comfortable. I watched some TV and wrote in my pregnancy journal. Just relaxing. They started Pitocin by 10 (I had a side effect of getting the "shakes" when I wasn't having a contraction....not a big deal) and the contractions weren't that bad (my pain tolerance may be a little high from some past experiences, but really it was no worse than your monthly friend)! The epidural came at 12:30 (the most painful part of the whole experience) and they broke the bag of waters by 2. My family was in and out, as well as my hubby. Everything was completely relaxing and exciting at the same time. At 3:50 they brought the doctor in and I started pushing. My beautiful baby boy was born at 4:13. I was so scared of labor and the induction (etc) that I thought when the time came I would be a horrible mess. In reality? It was an amazing experience (my first child BTW) and I would do it all over again.......not right now though because I still feel like I have been riding a horse for a couple days! It isn't painful, just sore! I wouldn't worry about it at all. Even if it does hurt, you won't even feel a thing once that baby is crying and you get to hold it for the first time!

On a 1-10 scale, it was about a 7 for me. I didn't have an epidural though. It was NOTHING near as bad as I thought it would be. I didn't really have major pain until the last 1-2 hours of labor as the baby made it's way down to crown. I was induced with pitocin with both of mine, and will be this time as well. I loved it, and have no complaints at all. Short easy labors and deliveries.



Labors were from first contraction:
8hrs45mins, pushed 2 times (slept 6 hours of that)
5hrs20mins, pushed 3 times (slept 3 hours of that)

Mine was great.  I got induced because my first child was 12 days early... and I had a fairly quick labor.  So for my second (and since my doctor would be out of town when I was due) we decided to induce to avoid the possibility that I would go into labor too fast to make it to the hospital.  So... I heard stories that it would hurt more and bla bla bla.. and was worried myself.  They broke my water at 9:00 am... and I asked not to have the pitocen (not sure if I spelled that right) to see if I would start contractions naturally.  I put in a house/techno CD and started dancing around the room... in about 10 minutes I started contracting... and continued dancing through all my contractions (of course you stop and buckle over when the actual contraction comes on and stay in that position until it passes) as best as I could up until 10:55 am when I had the urge to push.  5 minutes later, my daughter was born.  I highly recommend induction if the baby is fit to come out and you want to deliver.  It all hurts no matter what, but don't be afraid of the induction itself.  I would definitely recommend trying to contract on your own before resorting to meds... and dancing and jumping around definitely helps bring that on.  My first pregnancy, I laid in the hospital bed wrenching in pain and mangling the bed rails through each contraction... and couldn't believe how much more tolerable the pain was up on my feet and dancing around the room like I was at a night club.  I truly believe that it helped with the contractions and the quick labor/delivery.
If you're planning on using meds for pain, it may delay delivery in some people.  Everyone is different.  But it you're looking to get the absolute raw experience, I highly recommend drug free which is what I did with both my kids.  I know it hurts, but believe me... you will be able to make it through.  The best and least painful part (for me anyway) was the delivery.  Good luck and don't be scared.

My experience wasnt that great, but i cant compare it to a natural birth with out being induced. I pushed for almost three hours with my daughter stuck. I had to have an episotomy and they used the suction too. I almost had to have an c section. I had an epidural which numbed that area but i had back labor and my contractions were so close that i did not have a break in between. I ended up having to wear an oxygen mask and my duaghter wasnt breathing right when she was finally born probably from being stuck so long they took her out of my room to care for her then once she was doing better they brought her back.



Everyone is different though. I had a healthy pregnancy and took care of myself maybe it was cause i am a rather small person and she was 8 lbs i know people have bigger but that was good sized for me

DO you think the time I'm going is spend at the hospital is too little?



okay so the "health group" I'm with (Kaiser) only lets you stay in the hospital for 24 hours after the baby is born (if everything goes normal) and if you have a c-section  you get to go home 48 hours after the c-section. Should I be happy or concerned about this?

My Health Insurance Blue Shield/ Blue Cross of CA said 24 hours after birth for Vaginal and 96 hours after C-Section. Based on normal deliveries. I had a C-Section and ended up staying 5 days (Counting birth day as day 1) I felt it was a LONG time. I do personally think 24 hours for a vaginal birth is way to short! To each his own though.

Women used to have babies in caves and log cabins.  I think you will be okay in the hospital for 24 hours - if you have concerns, voice them, and perhaps the hospital will keep you longer, but it probably isn't necessary.

As long as the baby is healthy and your bleeding isn't crazy, you can be happy. I wanted to go home early so I could sleep in my own bed (I took some of the pads they use so you don't soak the bed with blood). YOu just have to relax and lay down at home, no one will force you to like in the hospital. If you feel like you need more care and/or aren't recovering well, I'm sure you can get help or have a nurse come to your house to check on you. I had a nurse come to my house and she checked the baby and me for signs of problems. It was also really nice to have someone come over... you start to feel like you're secluded from the rest of the world.



Try not to worry, after 24 hours you'll be very tired and want to go home. The only thing that bites about going home is that your baby has to sleep in the same place as you, you can't send them to the "nursery" at night like in the hospital. In the hospital they brought my baby in at 5 am and placed her in my arms while I was half asleep. I just wanted to return to normalcy! Good luck, you'll be fine!

HI and unfortunately it is the way of the world now. I stayed at the hospital for 8 days but they don't do that any more. If you feel that it isn't long enough then make them pay for another day or two. But, there are people who work in fields who give birth and then go right back to work. It is stupid but they do it. Good luck on the baby and have a peaceful pregnancy!

Wow, I thought I was getting screwed with 48 for normal and 72 for a c-section....never mind!



There’s usually a clause that you can stay longer if the doc has a valid reason for you to. Review your plan’s take on the matter and what you have to do to get more time approved. Then, if you’re not ok after 24 hours, have your doc contact them to explain why you need to stay longer.

I stayed for 4 days after a normal delivery (its 5/6days with c-section), thats the regular timeframe in Ireland.  and i needed that!  It was nice to rest, but i probably would have been happy to go home after 3 days.



There is a group in our hospital that have the same timeframes as that too, its the midwife service, they go home after a few hours but their midwife visit them at home for about 3 weeks every day

Hospitals are dirty, and can be noisy, so you probably won't sleep well there anyway. If everything is normal, you won't have much help anyway, so you'll be much more comfy at home with your own toilet, etc. As long as you got the baby's feeding an pooping okay, you should be fine at home (even better if you have someone to help you at first). And, if you have any health concerns afterward, you could always go back to the hospital.
Hope all goes well!

I had group B strep so they want to keep me for 48 hours to monitor baby. By 36 hours I was packed and pacing around, begging them to let me go home. You aren't allowed to carry your baby in the hallway while you are a patient so it gets very boring staying in your room.



If you have an uncomplicated vaginal birth and you and baby are okay you will probably want to leave.

I had a c-section and i was in the hospital for a week, they were in no rush to have me leave, they actually adviced me on my 5th day to stay another night because of my pain. Ouch c sections are so painful for some, if you can deliver the natural ways please do it! I think 24 hours afterwards is a little bit short, it just feels better if you stay a tad longer because you can get some help from the nurses and such, they re insure you and that makes you feel better since it's your first. And it's good for the dads too, since they are new with everything too! Good luck with the birth of your little one, enjoy mommy-hood :)

I had a 36 hr stay with my first, and a 48 hr stay with my second. Both were vaginal deliveries. I had a D&C after birth of my first, so they held me a little over to keep an eye on bleeding. I stayed complimentary for an extra day with my second because my son was circumcised that morning, and they like to keep them for a little while after that's done.



I'm having a tubal the day after birth this time, and should be looking at another 48 hr stay if all goes well.

With my first child I stayed in the hospital for 48 hours. But when I had baby number seven it was much different. Three hours after I had him the nurses watched him while I ran home to check on the babysitter and the other children, I then took them to lunch before returning to the hospital. I felt amazing and the hospital stay wasn't needed.



Many women are different and in some cases like mine it depends on the birth experience. Mine were drug free which allowed me to get up and move around without being "out of it". Many women actually give birth at home these days with midwives. baby number eight will be born at home come March. For me, the hospital stay is pointless. but many women need that time and some births require it.



What is right for one woman isn't right for another. However, if you feel you might need the extra time there is nothing wrong with laying in your bed at home for an extra day.

Some sites say one thing, some say the other. The first trimester is 13 weeks. So if you're 13 weeks (completed) you can say you started the second trimester. The third starts at 26 weeks.

Remember that week 12 runs from 11 weeks & 1 day to 12 weeks. So week 13 is 12 weeks & 1 day to 13 weeks.

Each trimester lasts 14 weeks for a total of 42 weeks, which is why the due date is commonly set at week 40.  So at 13 weeks, you have one more week of 1st trimester, then 14 weeks of 2nd and then 14 weeks or less of 3rd or until you deliver.

13 weeks.



1-4 weeks and a couple days= 1 month
4-8 weeks and a few days= 2 months
9-12 weeks and a couple days= 3 months
It totals about 13 weeks if you add the extra days together.

Pregnant bleeding, not from vagina?? TMI warning!?



Okay so I've noticed once in awhile after going to the restroom that when I wipe there is red blood on the tissue. However, it is NOT coming from my vagina...I've actually been in for spotting a few times before and everything checked out okay, so I'm wondering now if it was not coming from my vagina those times either...I plan to ask my OB since I have an appointment on Monday, but now I'm nervous to ask her since I don't want her to think all that testing was just for outer bleeding (i am a paranoid person though and will ask anyway to make sure). Since I have to wait till Monday I thought I'd see if anyone else had experienced this... Its usually either on the inside wall of my "lips" or around my clit area...and its usually after I wipe quite a few times (I keep wiping till all the discharge is gone...) so could this be what causes it to bleed? It's not painful...I'm just wondering if this is a symptom of something or I just need to stop wiping so much...also, it's not continuous, by the time I use the restroom again it will be gone. Thanks in advance, I'm already embarrassed for asking...lol. ~paranoid first time mommy~

While I "always" gain 10 pounds in the first trimester, I actually did have one pregnancy where I ended up 5 pounds lighter by the end of the first trimester and only gained 16 pounds during the entire thing.  And I wasn't overweight either.  I was just really sick that time.  I'm on my fifth pregnancy now and again, have gained 10 pounds.

I lost weight in the start of my pregnancy cause i was really ill with morning sickness, but in my case it was 24/7 sickness.
I started being sick at 6 weeks and it didnt really lay off till around 20 weeks - was rushed into hospital 3 times on week stays cause i couldnt keep food or even water down.



I am under the hospital now with a specialist doctor and i have to go for growth scans to check the baby is the right size for each stage in my pregnancy.



If ur unsure - go see ur doctor hun.

It takes a while for your periods to become normal again - even when breastfeeding. I think mine were off for about 6 months or so. If you are concerned that something is wrong, you should call your OB/GYN just to make sure.

Is that when the baby and your blood type is incompatible? If that's what you mean, then there is no worries to the first child you have, but there is a shot you need to have to prevent your body from rejecting future children with the same blood type.

It is possible that your going thru a "false pregnancy" or "phantom pregnancy". Have heard stories of these, its not very common and more psychological than anything else, but read up on the site below, and then see your obstetrician to make sure and he / she can help if you need medication for the phantom pregnancy.

What do doctors mean when they say a babies DNA "spills over" into the mom's blood during pregnancy?



This is for an assignment I'm doing on the new technological developments related to prenatal testing for down syndrome and similar diseases. I read an article that explained how they test the blood of the mothers for certain number of chromosomes and if the baby carries an extra chromo #21, it has Down's.  Just don't understand how the DNA gets into the mom's blood???

I'm the same way.. I never lose the weight I gained with my daughter... When I sit down my stomach does get squishy. What makes me even more sad is that my bump seems soo small because of it... I see these others with these huge hard stomach and the only time you can find my hard part is when I'm laying down..sometimes when I'm standing too... But you can't tell unless you touch my stomach.. .but I notice it all the time

Your stomach probably feels flabby when you sit down because you have a bit extra cushion; that's perfectly normal.

Weird cravings happened to everyone.  I had a huge craving for sheet cake when I was pregnant, oh and coleslaw and sweet potatoes.  I hated coleslaw and sweet potatoes before I was pregnant.  If you want to fulfill your craving just have a little bit of something greasy and salty.  As long as you don't over do it you'll be fine.  Congrats on the baby lil' mommy!!

Yikes.. maybe try to have some french fries. I had this feeling the other day but I was in the mood for something salty/peppery and cheesy.. so I had a grilled cheese sandwich with pepper on it and some chex mix, the original kind, because it's salty.. Afterwards, I threw it right back up.. I don't have sickness anymore so I figured it wasn't very good for me if it came back up. Ugh, it was awful.

Personally, I would opt for mashed potatoes and gravy..mmm. But if you are craving greasy and salty, maybe a ham and cheese sandwich with some potato chips? Or something baked in the oven, like corndogs/fries/lasagna..ravioli is greasy when it's from the can, lol. I was craving sweet foods for a while. Sometimes I want to eat the Crest toothpaste, I don't know why...or Vicks becaue of the way it smells. Good luck and I hope you find the salty/greasy lunch you so desire, lol. :)

so, i'm still young, i don't wanna say my age, and i still have my whole life ahead of me and goals and stuff. but for some reason i've gotten into this mode where all i can think about is having a baby. i've been around a lot of children lately, but i can't imagine its making my maternal instinct this strong. and i don't have like any guy that i wanna have a baby with. i actually just got out of a relationship. i just have something inside of me telling me that i NEED a baby. i'm not gonna act on it, cause i know i'm not ready for one, and i'm not gonna have a child and not be married, i'm just wondering if anyone has any advice as to why i have such a strong urge to be a mother at such a young age?

Scared of having a c-section ?



I am having triplets, and am going to be having a c section.  I am overweight to begin with, and my Dr said because of that there is more of a risk for infection because there is more skin to cut into, and if the epidural don't work they will have to put a tube down my throat.  I was scared to death before he told me this, and now I am petrified that something may go wrong. Any body else who is overweight and had a csection, how did everything go ?

Is it normal to feel scared?



I am about 6-7 weeks pregnant, married, good jobs, secure, and I can't help but be really scared of the childbirth. I am scared of the process in general. I feel like I am not being "Motherly" like there is something wrong with me for feeling this way. I am over joyed about the thought of my hubby and I having our baby. But that One day of birth, scares me. Is this normal? Are most women a bit fearful of this?

Maybe because you can't feel the baby inside you yet you don't feel motherly yet? I'm sure it will come when you have a huge bump!

if it helps talk to friends/family that have gone thru it. Also take a birthing class in the end of your 2nd trimester or beginning of your 3rd and get a tour of the labor and delivery floor you will be delivering on.



Read a book on what to expect if that will help, but keep in mind, EVERYONE's experience is different! Just because your friend had a great or horrible experience in no way means yours will be the same.



Relax and enjoy the next 9 months. You will be fine. Good luck

Yes, it's normal. I'm almost 36 weeks and I am really scared of everything still! I thought I would be prepared by now, but I'm not. I guess if it's an experience you've never been through before, then you can never really be fully prepared. I'm not feeling motherly either, but I'm sure it will come when I have the baby. I am scared of labor and the birth process too, don't worry, everything will be fine :)

Its very very nervous to think about it. To be honest, when I was getting closer to having my second child, I was even nervous about what to suspect during labor. For first time mothers, its perfectly normal to worry about it. It doesn't mean that your not "motherly" or un excited! Labor hurts and it can be very strenuous on you. Until you have expericenced it, you don't know what to expect. The channel that shows labor and delivery shows. Labor isn't always like that. Them shows scared the hell outta me, and it was nothing like that. When I was all done and my precious daughter was laying in my arms, you forget all about the pain you go through. You never forget, but its not something that's suppose to make a tragedy! You'll do great! But your not a bad mother b/c your scared or nervous about what labor is! Congrats on your new baby!

I was terrified all the way through all of my pregnancies. Childbirth is scary. It's life changing and it's painful and amazing and painful and wonderful and did I say painful? Oh and there is the element of the unknown which is always intimidating no matter what people say.Rregarding the maternal instinct, it will kick in when you're holding this tiny warm helpless angry little human being.
Good Luck with everything.

Does anyone else have hip pain when sleeping?



I'm 29w3d with twins.  I usually wake up every 2 or 3 hours to go to the bathroom and I've noticed the past few nights that whatever side I sleep on, my hip on that side hurts.  I usually start out on my left side and when I wake up my left hip is hurting so when I go back to bed, I lay on my right side.  Then when I wake up again, that hip is hurting.  Most days, when I get out of bed, the paid goes away after a few minutes of moving around, but today its lingering in both hips.  Does anyone know what this is?  Is there anything I can do to help the pain?

god i took everything bar the kitchen sink!! i took 4 vests, 4 sleepsuits, outfit for leaving and a snowsuit, loads of knickers, breast pads, nintendo ds, nappies, cotton wool balls,camera, video, ipod, towels, shampoo etc. slippers and warm socks- my feet were freezin during labour!. make sure you take everything you need cos you will be relying on your fella to get things for you and they always get the wrong stuff--guaranteed. its better to take too much and not need it. i could hardly lift mine! good luck

Pack stuff that makes you comfortable.  Baby won't be wearing anything but hospital garb.  Make sure you pack an outfit for the ride home for the new little one.  I would'nt pack too much for the baby because the hospital is going to charge you for everything anyway, even if you don't use it.



I would pack myself a robe, plenty of pads, my OWN pillow, (maybe two), an extra blanket for myself and the usual, toothbrush, brush, make-up etc.



Congrats!  Looks like you won't be on the internet for a couple of days.  We will miss you in cyberworld!  Good luck.

I know this might sound crazy, but Ive packed 3 bags!
Bag1: Labour Bag
birth plan, all paperwork needed by hospital, socks, old tshirt, lip balm, music/mp3, magazines, toiletries, cushion, labour bal, flask for ice, snacks, energy drinks, headband&pins, CAMERA/videocorder, essential oil (clary sage- helps with fear, camomile- helps with relaxation), first clothes for baby



Bag2: Hospital Bag
new sexy nighties + backup nighties, cute clothes for baby, blanket for baby, comfy flip flops/feetwear, make up, hairdryer, disposible maternity panties, maternity pads, breast pads, tissues, feeding bra, toiletries, nipple cream, cellphone, charger, socks, going home outfit



Bag3: Baby Bag
-Our hospital gives a complimentary bag with baby toiletries, nappies, wipes etc. so this is only a backup bag in case I want something extra for baby like baby oil, baby brush...



This way you dont have to pack one big bag, but can have 3 seperate ones.
Your hubby/partner can bring your hosp bag after labour, and put the labour bag in the car. The baby bag stays in the car, except for when you need something from it!



Good luck, hope this helps a bit!

Call  your hospital and find out what they provide first, but you will not need half of what most first time mother's bring with them (at least I didn't and will be packing much lighter this time).  Here are the things I actually remember needing and using:



1) toiletries - tooth brush/paste, lotion
2) socks - I don't know why, but cold feet tend to be a problem in labor
3) reading material - you will probably be in labor for a while before it is time to start pushing
4) bathrobe - only needed if you plan to walk around while in labor prior to getting an epidural
5) FOOD - I can't stress this one enough if your hospital is like mine and has a no eating from check-in until after delivery policy.  Not all hospitals do, but most have that policy and I had to make my husband sneak me food from the cafeteria throughout the day when the nurse wasn't looking.
6) Sanitary Pads - While you are in the hospital, you will want to use theirs because they are the super size industrial strength variety that you will still need to change every hour for the first day or two.  But you will want your own to go home in.
7) Phone/email list - Make sure you have the name and number of everyone your husband needs to call as soon as the baby comes.  Trust me, you will have too much on your mind to even remember your mother's phone number at that time.
8) cell phone or phone card - especially if any of the people from your list in #7 are long distance calls
9) Pillow - or whatever you need to rest comfortably
10) camera - to record the birth if you want that, and for taking pictures of the baby & you after even if you don't want to record the birth.
11) Going home clothing - for both you and the baby
12) Car Seat - hospital wont let you take the baby home without it.



Remind your husband to pack a bag too
1) change of clothing - you all might be there a few days
2) food - or money for the cafeteria just in case they don't feed him
3) money - parking, vending machine, etc.
4) Gift - After 9 months of pregnancy, and who knows how many hours of labor, & then pushing a water melon out of a 10 cm hole, you deserve a gift, and he deserves a smack if he doesn't get you one.

I always brought way more than I actually needed/used, so, this time, I'm packing light!



Heating pad



Squirt bottle and mini-fan. (I get hot, and these work wonders! And, keep me from fainting, while getting the epidural, if I get one, this time.)



An outfit for myself, for when coming home.



An outfit for baby's FirstPhoto, as well as an extra one, in case an accident happens. :)



Receiving blanket for baby.



My make-up... Yes, I always put it on, before leaving the hospital... Lip gloss is a must, cause my lips get chapped!



Hair tie, for when labor gets rough, and I want my hair our of my face.



A few movies to keep my kids (and myself, and hubby) occupied.



Massage lotion/oil



Deodorant



Toothpaste/toothbrush



My own shampoo/conditioner/soap.



Camera and batteries.



I think that's it! Of course, my older kids will be there, so I pack snacks for them, as well as my husband, and I bring some board games for them, too, cause they play them with their Grandmas, in the waiting room, during times they have to leave the room. :)



Good luck!! I need to pack, too...

yes it is more common. It is more difficult during pregnancy to fully empty your bladder, thus urine stays in there longer leading to more UTIs. You may also not have any symptoms.

I really dont think i should be expected to walk over the road everytime i need to go which is a lot with the pressure on my bladder!!

This may not be the answer that you want to hear, but they don't have to totally accommodate you.  They have to make sure that you are safe, not because you are pregnant, but because you work for them.  Other then that, they don't have to do anything extra for you.  The way they see it, you can either do your job while you are pregnant or you can't.  And if you can't, why are you there?
It doesn't sound fair, but what's to stop someone else from demanding special treatment too? Pregnancy is not a medical condition.

I'm sorry for your many losses. I've experienced a miscarriage before and it was an emotional and physical pain that I prayed to never experience again. I wish you the best.. perhaps you have an incompetent cervix, in which case that can be fixed for future pregnancies.

Then YES, you might be pregnant!  Doesn't matter that you are on birth control or not.  I don't think that there is a single contraceptive out there that is 100% effective.  Maybe 99.9%, but no 100's.  Abstinence is 100% effective.



ok, I guess this is more of a statement then a question, but....

If you come in contact with a "peter" you have a chance of catching "peter poisoning" even if it was covered....lol.

that's why it's an edd, an ultrasound is more accurate than your doctor would be, so you are probably only 6 weeks pregnant, and most likely you won't hear a heart beat for a few weeks yet.

Your ultrasound usually changes your due date, no big deal, and as for the heartbeat, you usually can't hear it until 7-8 weeks, even though they have one at 5 weeks.  What do you mean the bleeding stopped?  If there was a reason to be concerned your doctor would have talked to you about it. Good luck and Congrats!!

Honestly at 6 weeks there should be a visible heartbeat with ultrasound.  Did they explain to you why they couldn't see one?  Why not call your doctor up and ask what this means for you?  No one can really tell you what is going on for sure, but you certainly have my best wishes.

I don't want to scare you but there's a possibility that you had a missed miscarriage. That is when a girl miscarries but the sac stays in place.. a heartbeat is lost or never detected and no more growth is continued. This is, of course, just one of many possibilities. Another possibility could be that your EDD is off.

I'm not sure how far along you are but I'm 31 weeks and I started with the same having thing happen about 2 weeks ago.  I asked my doctor about the pain in my lower abdomen and she asked if it sort of felt like a burning sensation.  I told her it felt like my stomach was ripping open and she looked and said it was because I was getting stretch marks.  I never knew you could feel stretch marks!  As for the peeing, it's never ending.  And I especially have to go every time I stand up it feels like.  It's just the pressure of the baby on your bladder.

It is perfectly ok!  However, you can not use the dyes out of the bottles, the chemicals are harmful to the baby.



You must have your hair dyed with professional hair dye.  The only time it is not good to dye your hair when you are pregnant is if you are high risk.  So make an appt and dye away!

I think it can be harmful to the baby because even if you dye it away from the scalp, you are still inhaling the chemicals which is the main thing that can be harmful to a baby. Not only that, I don't think the hair would look like being to different colors/tones. I think you are better to just wait until after you have the baby.

This was an issue for me as well. My doc said that there isn't any evidence about dying your hair in the first trimester, but to avoid any harsh bleaches or things that sit directly on your scalp. After the first trimester pretty much dye away, most over the counter products are a little less harsh these days. Just make sure you are in a well ventilated area. I just hit thirteen weeks and immediately called my stylist :) I can handle no coffee or wine, but I have to get my hair and nails done! Congrats!

I have heard that dying your hair after your first trimester is typically ok. Getting highlights is better, since it's less dye and isn't put as close to your scalp. You also want to find a salon that is well ventilated so you aren't sitting there inhaling the ammonia fumes for hours on end.



The best choice is to dye hair with vegetable dye, which is entirely safe. You can call salons and see if they offer this service.



It's always safest to avoid these things during pregnancy if possible but you have to weight the potential risks against the potential benefits. I have decided not to dye my hair but have heard that after the first trimester it's ok to do.



Hope that helps!

it is a fact. it also depends on the duration of the pregnancy even though you did the ends or the roots it's still harmful. when you sweat it mixes with the dye and seeps into the pores of your skin thus making it harmful for you BABY. no chemicals of any sort should be used. no texturerizers, straighteners, dyes nothing. it can cause your baby to become brain damaged, deformed or sick. so be wise and protect your baby and your self.

32 weeks pregnant with upper abdominal pain and upper back pain...........?
I woke up early in the morning to strong abdominal and back pain last night. A few weeks ago I went to the doctor for this same thing and they told me it happened because I was dehydrated but when I remembered this I tried to drink more fliuds and see if the pain would stop. It eased down after a while but then came back again. THis pain was so painful that after I through up I felt a littel better and tried to take a hot shower but in the middel of the shower I had the pain again and was shaking and could hardly move and breathe. I was about to go to the hospital if it was for my fiance telling me to lay down and propped pillows up around me which made me feel better right awy. But he felt I had an upset stomach to food I ate earlier and that it didnt digest. but I dont know what that was but sure was glad it went away. Did anyone experience anything liek this?????

Contractions, OUCH!!!!!?



Im 4 cm dilated at 75% effaced, 40w2d (yes i just asked a different questions, but then I thought of another). Anyways, I had the chance to be induced but denied it, I want to go natural. Today Ive been having contractions, but they are not consistent. But when I do get them, they hurt like HELL. Like real labor contractions, but they aren't consistent, nor are they getting any closer...They even have that horrible labor back ache with them!!! . Is that normal?



I had doctor appt today and thats when i was told I could go to  L&D and have my water broke, but ehh Id rather wait it out at home..

Any suggestions? Thanks?



40w2d pregnant 4cm dilated 75% effaced, baby is engaged and ready to go (as of my appointment this morning). Had the choice to be induced today, but chose not to (baby is not overly large, so i can go a bit longer.)  I would rather it go naturally. Anyways I feel like complete JUNK tonight.. I keep getting little itty bitty sharp pains every where, my back my sides and my stomach. It just feels like someone is poking me with a needle. Not painful, just sharp. I have a horrible headache, I feel miserable. I wish I would have accepted the induction! I have been having contractions today but nothing consistent at all, little tiny bit of cramping, lots a HUGE blood tinged glob of mucus tonight.. I know im not getting the flu, I had the flu shot a few weeks ago (well small chance i could still get it). I just feel like complete JUNK.. headache, body ache, and i feel extremely tired, even though i took a nap today...just yucky...Any suggestions...Thanks!

that huge blood tinged glob of mucus could've been a mucus plug or the "bloody show".  sounds more like the bloody show to me.  if it is hang in there, it usually means labor is no more than 2 days away

37 weeks - Pregnancy induced Hydronephrosis of Kidney?



I was told yesterday my kidney infection they thought I had is not one after all and I have hydronephrosis of my right kidney.



Because I am too far pregnant for them to be able to stent my kidney, I am being induced next week.



In the meantime they have given me Panadeine Forte for the pain which is taking the edge off the pain but I am still in excruciating pain.



I can't stand, sit, lay down or anything without the stabbing pain through my right hand side. Even hot water in the shower is not working.



Has anyone had this or have any suggestion for a position to relieve some of the pain??



</question>



<additional details>



Once baby is born they will stent and and drain the kidney.



From what I have been explained, hydronephrosis of kidney is when the fluid goes back up into the kidney rather than drains, and causes the kidney to enlarge. It can cause it to go septic, cause permanent kidney damage or at worst cause renal failure.



And of course, the baby's arms and feet are all on my right side so everytime the baby moves my kidney takes a bashing!

Oh Hun, this is turning out to be a bit of a drama isn't it.



Keep taking the panadeine fort as prescribed because it will have a cumulative effect and hopefully take the edge off that pain by the next dose you are able to take. I have no idea about what else you could do for the pain, maybe a cold compress instead of warm if your Doctor said it was ok. I wonder if deep heat or the equivalent would help, I know it isn't muscle soreness but it has a warming effect of the surrounding tissue. Take it easy and I hope your kids are behaving for you.



You need a slave to be at your beck and call just in case you do find a position to get a little bit more comfy. Maybe you could stand upside down with your head in a bucket?? lol.

Tried the cold compress... was no better.



The only relief is when I am laying on my left hand side so that no weight is pressing on my right kidney - even then there is still the constant ache.
Have spent most of the day crying and not sure I can take this for a week.

Have you tried a heating pad or hot water bottle? I honestly don't know if a change in position will help though.



I hope you feel better soon. I have had this quite a few times and it is probably the worst pain ever.



EDIT: that is exactly what it is, the urine is unable to drain and backs up into the kidneys. If left untreated, it can cause permanent damage.

Okay I know this is weird but.... I thought that my daughter at this time should be able to hear pretty well. But it worries me because loud noises and stuff like that don't startle her or anything. Does that mean that she may have a hearing problem? Because people are always saying how noises scared their baby... but she doesn't seem to react to them.... Should I mention this to my doctor.. or is this normal?

My son never responded to loud noises and this one doesnt really either, or not that i have noticed.  They do a hearing test within a couple of days of the baby being born so i wouldnt worry about it.  A lot of the sounds in there are muffled because your heartbeat and the rush of blood and fluid around the body will be what she mainly hears (try putting your head under the bath water and getting someone to make a loud noise, it doesnt sound so loud under there).

My first was a very mellow child inside and after he was born but as he's grown we have discovered he's autistic and actually has painfully hypersensitive hearing.  What I mean is that he certainly heard much more than an ordinary baby when he was inside me but just wasn't the type to react to it.  His brother and now sister on the way are jumpy sorts and you know everything they hear.  You know what my first is a sound sleeper and my second is a very light sleeper so it does tell you something just not necassarily about a hearing defect.

She can hear.  she is use to loud noises being inside you is not as quite as you think.  She hears your stomach grumble your heat beat all the swishing of blood and your voice.



Have you tried talking to her and seeing if she reacts or playing music. You might get more of a response to that then a random noise that was loud to you.  Because what's loud to you is not going as loud to her.



I think she is fine and you are over thinking.

my test was neg. at the doctors office today, my left boob has been hurting off and on. my boyfriend and i had unprotected sex today, he came... ( in me)  could i get pregnant right away? or do you think it takes a while longer? and how long does sperm stay alive in you for? i figure just a few days at the most...... and how many days before my missed period should i test? cuz my last period was around the 12th of this month, so around the 9th of november i should be getting it again.. how soon should i test? or should i just wait till i miss my period? i am wondering this, i am not saying that we had sex today and i think i am pregnant not even 12 hours later. i am jw if it is possible for my egg to be fertilized already or do you think it takes a few days?

It definitely takes a few days for your egg to be fertilized



i believe its 6 - 10 days



If you really are wanting to know fast,



You can take the test 2 - 3 weeks after unprotected sex .



First response is a good suggestion

if you dont want to get pregnant why are you having unprotected sex. yes you can get pregnant,  , it depends on the test you use to  tell how soon you get a positive reaction.  different doctors use dofferent test. ask your doctor how soon the one he uses shows positive.

okay you maybe could be .



although your ovulation is the 26th of this month. most chances for you to get preggers. is approx 14 days after period. (first day) when the egg drops and wait to get fertilised inside.



6-12days after the 26th(ovulation) is when the egg will implant itself, meaning preggers. a blood test will be accuarate 1 week b4 the 9th of november.



sperm can stay alive for 24-48 hours inside depending on body temperture.you need to test on the 9th which is when ur period would be due.



so in few days is when you are releasing your egg, so have sex then..
there is a chance that u can become pregnant in few days.



good luck hope it makes sense for ya.

Episiotomy question???? possible tmi =(?



i had a baby a month ago, and i had an episiotomy. it still feels really painful, and the site kindof burns when i go pee. after not having looked (although tempted) with a mirror when i got home at first, i gave in and looked at it with a mirror the other day...and it doesnt look healed. it looks like it has a little open hole underneath the regular girlparts hole. is that normal? how long does it take for this to start feeling normal again? its still painful and im just over it. And for those that have had an episiotomy, how long is it until you can have sex again? any experience or answers will help! im totally spazzing out about the way it looks/feels



</question>



<additional details>



i definatley have been following orders, but my six weeks is coming up soon and it just doesnt feel...anywhere close to healed. im for sure going to mention it to my dr at my appt, but im freaking out now. ive been taking very good care of it, so i hope its not just...permanently messed up. scary!



i guess i wasnt too clear, i mean how long after the six week mark can you have sex? i know some people say dont try it til a bit later, im just wondering what other peoples time frames are. right now, i dont even think sex is in my immediate future thats how raw and pained it feels.

ok that is not what it should look like and or you need to contact your doc right away and have them look at it and make sure that is what you need to do so that you dont' get an infection and it takes a while for it to heal as long as you dont' do what your not supposed to do

Okay, relax. I've been there. Do you take regular sitz baths? Have you had your 6-week check-up yet? It is possible for those not to heal correctly, and perfectly alright for you to go see your doctor now, instead of waiting the full 6 weeks. I would recommend not to have sex until after the doctor gives the go ahead. Surgical incisions can take up to 2 months to heal, not counting any complications, which it sounds like you have.

You shouldn't even think about having sex until after your 6 week check up.



What you describe, that extra hole...red flag!  Are you having any extra/weird discharge?  Can you control your BMs?  I developed a fistula after my second child.  It was basically a part from my anus to just outside my vagina that didn't heal.  That's kind of big deal if that's what's going on.



But don't expect to be healed already.  It's a work in progress.

I was TERRIFIED when I took a mirror to my episiotomy! Mine was a pretty good cut I think....the doctor took over 45 minutes to repair. I didn't have and open hole, but I was irritated for about 5 weeks. I resumed sex right around 5 weeks.

I didn't have an episiotomy, however; I did tear during birth.  And the reason that they do episiotomies is because they are supposed to be less damaging than a tear and are supposed to heal better.



Since you didn't mention how far they had to go down, it is hard to say how fast it should heal - but a month definitely sounds too long.  Call your doctor immediately!!  Get it checked out, better to do that and have them tell you everything is fine than to wait and find out there is a problem.  The longer you wait the more it will heal in it's present state - and if the stitches slipped or something - it could be healing wrong.



CALL YOUR DOCTOR!!

Yes, but you should learn to sleep on your left side, cuddle with a pillow thats what I do. This way it's safer for the baby in the long run when you're used to it, it's better for your back, and  the baby recieves more nutrients.

Hey Rebecca,



During implantation bleeding it can be all sorts of colors...Or so i've read.
From brown to brick red. I would wear a pad, to make sure of the color, and to find out how much the bleeding it. Or a panty liner.
Unless its only there during wiping.

My mom is pregnat !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?



my mom is pregnant! and i am 14 years old! i will be almost 15 when the baby is born! I not sure how i feel about this. I think it is unfair because the baby will only be about 3 when i move out for college (and yes i am going to college)
I wil hardly know it! When i do come around it will be more than likely to babysit!



And i already have 3 other brothers and sisters and i am the Oldest!!!



What do i do! i don't want to feel this way but i don't really want another baby around the house! I am sure as soon as the baby is born i will love it but i don't want to remember my moms pregnancy as me not wanting this baby to come into the world. also my mom has major morning sickness she has seriously been in bed for the past month and i have had to take care of my brothers and sisters until my dad gets home from work. This means i cook, CLEAN and try to figure out how to get A's in my freshmen year of high school.
I know my parents did not intend to have this baby but there is nothing they can do about it now.

Theres nothing you can do. you havent said if this was a planned baby or not, but chances are your mother is in more shock than you if the baby wasnt planned.



Imagine how your mother is feeling. you will probably find the baby wont get in the way of your life much, I mean you will have baby stuff around the house, and may hear it crying at night, but I doubt your mother is going to make you do eveyrthing for it.



I acutally think youll be surprised when the baby is born. in a good way. sometimes life throws you lemons and you just have to make lemonade.

It's not going to be easy, and I know how you feel with taking care of the house and younger siblings. Your mom just needs some extra help right now. Talk to her about your feelings and see if maybe you can also be more pro-active in this pregnancy...... I think you may find it very interesting to go to your moms appointments with her and know what is going on. I think you'll get more excited about the whole thing when you get to be there for every step, hearing your new siblings heart beat for the first time, seeing the ultrasound in person. Just a thought..... maybe it's not in the cards for ya but worth a try....

First of all the correct spelling is pregnant. You do sound a little selfish but at the same time your mum is expecting too much of you to look after your siblings.
Have a chat to her and tell her that you do want to help her out but it is too much for you to do so if she could help or get one of her friends or her mother to come over and help you would appreciate it.



As for not wanting a baby around, unless you are going to move out you will have to get used to it. Maybe because it is a shock for you you are not totally happy about it all.



Wait a few months and I am sure you will be first in line to feel the baby move all the time.



Good Luck

its ok i felt the same way when my youngest brother was born. i really havent been around a lot in his life but i try my best to see him when i can. wat your going through is completely normal and it will get better later on. as for not thinking about it try and think more about school and wat u want to do with your life. i have 9 brothers and sisters and had to b a mom to 4 of them so i knw wat that feels like too. just think of it as your getting prepared for when u have your own family, this way u know wat to do and u wont b completly lost about things. it only gets harder before it gets better. and let your mom and dad know how u feel about having to do everything they should. maybe they can get the other kids to help out. give it a couple more weeks and your mom will b feeling better and u wont have to worry about cooking and cleaning.

What you are feeling is completely normal.  Instead of seeing it as a burden, think of it as a chance to greatly influence someone's life.  You will be a big sister and your little sister will always look up to you, if you can set a good example for her.  You have the chance to be very close to her, even if you are in college.  By the time you are done with college, she will be old enough to hang out with you at the mall, or the movies, or whatever.  Be supportive for your mom.  I'm sure being older and pregnant isn't easy on her.  And like you said, there is nothing she or you can do about it.  Now, you must accept it, or be miserable and resentful, and that's not fair to anyone.

Its normal to feel this way. Completely. Yes it is your responsibility to take care of your siblings while your parents can't , that is just a part of life. What would you do if your parents dies? who would your have? yeah you'd probably be sent to other family, but they already have THEIR OWN family to contend to , you would be the one who would CLEARLY have the responsibility.



The fact that that kid wont see you much while its growing up wont matter, because of the difference in age between both of you ( 15 years) you wont have much to talk to him about, in fact you'll probably be what your dreading the most, a mother figure.



The thing is , that kid will bond and relate to the sibling closest in age, so yeah you'll love it, and yeah you'll have feelings for the little twerp but things are going to play out the way their going to play out, and life gets more complicated than this. So if you learn to handle situations like this you'll be better for it, you'll be stronger, and you'll also not be put into shock or break down in a crisis in your future.



10 years from now , you'll see what i mean.

My mom also had a baby when I was a teenager (and I was an only child to that point). I promise it may seem bleak and it is perfectly normal to be upset about it (I cried for a weeek).



However it does get better. I actually found that my mom was even more attentive to me after my brother was born because she didn't want me to feel unloved. She tried harder and actually came to me for advice and because a friend instead of a mother. It is also scary for older mothers because they are worried they are too old to be starting over again.



If you really feel bad try talking to your mom and telling her how you feel. Also remember that no matter what she does love you and will want the best for you anyway. I'm sure it'll be ok. All your emotions are perfectly natural so don't worry to much about it.

Its normal, and you shouldnt keep having sex if it feels like this. Theres lots of blood flow down there now, so things that felt good before you got prenant might not feel good now. I felt a great deal of discomfort, including terrible terrible cramps after sex ( often I thought I was having a miscarriage). You should talk to your doctor. Just lay off the sex until it becomes pleasurable, but do keep trying. If it feels wrong, just stop.

It could be normal. When you are pregnant, things are a lot more sensitive "down there," due to hormonal changes. I know when I was pregnant, I was WAY more sensitive down there. If you are having bleeding or bad cramping, that isnt normal and should be addressed right away. I would suggest just holding off on the sex and mention it to your doctor at your next appointment.

If it hurts - don't continue. I can't imagine that being enjoyable.



I had pain during sex from around 6 weeks to about 17 weeks. My doctor told me it was probably my cervix as it can be really sensitive during pregnancy. But at about 17 weeks my cervix became more posterior and harder to irritate.

Take a pregnancy test. Personally, if I get pregnant at 15, I would take a test, just to be sure, and then I would talk to my boyfriend and my parents to discuss what would be best. I'm against abortion, so I would defenitely keep it. Adoption, maybe? Whatever seems best for the baby, and for you. Just talk to your parents before it's too late!

ouch.
I have had 5 c-sections so I have never had an episiotomy, but I have had friends who have had trouble, but not needing to be restitched like that, did they do it too tight the first time? I hope you are not having to pay for their mistake if it was something they did



I hope all your downstairs bits are working painfree soon

It is all perfectly normal. I also noticed many deep blue veins on my breasts and my doctor told me it was because my breasts are getting bigger and ready to produce milk for the baby. These will go away after the baby is born.



As for the cramps it is also perfectly normal. I personally find (and sorry if this is TMI) that when I am constipated the pains are worse. It is normal as your uterus is expanding and the baby is movign and stretching everything inside you.



It is not pleasant but in the end it is all woth it!



Good luck

Hiccups and kicks in the same region?



ok so i am 26 weeks pregnant and the past week i have noticed my baby hasn't been moving around like she used to, she seems to just stick to one spot (i have a small shape so i think its possible she is running out of room already) anyways, lately she has had the hiccups and i can feel them in my way lower stomach but i can also feel kicks down there too.. does she turn completely around without me feeling or is she in a ball because i also feel her kick in my ribs too.. is her head down? and if so is she folded in half sometimes haha
thanks

I'm 22 wks pregnant and I feel everything everywhere. Babies are ruling right now . they can toss and turn however the like cause they have more than enough room to roam around. So its normal to feel kicks and tugs everywhere. As they get bigger and settled you can tell how they are and if it was a kick or  punch.

She could very well be running out of room in there. And that may be a hand or an elbow or even her head you're feeling. My baby was right side up (breech) until about 36 weeks and I always felt "kicking" in my ribs. Hiccups are totally normal. And, some days I know it'll feel like she's doing somersaults! Just have your doctor check to see where the cord is and make sure she's not getting tangled. My baby was born with the cord around his neck and shoulder, and he had turned purple by the time he was out! He's totally healthy now, just ask your Ob/Gyn. Good luck to you and your new little one!

Is this normal weight gain for my pregnancy?



I was 111 lbs when I first saw the Dr, but was real sick due to morning sickness and so next appointment I found out I lost 4 pounds. So I was at 107. But now I weighed in at 129 lbs. Is that too much or normal considering I really was 111 in the beginning? Thx

That isn't alot of weight. That's a little over twenty pounds. Alot of women gain more then that.  I gained about 25 pounds during my pregnancy but lost of my mine when I had the baby. Once you give birth you will tell a difference. Your weight is normal don't worry.

i was 115 when i got that positive test, and had HORRIBLE morning sickness for the first four months...and then after i got over that i gained a ton of weight. like 70 lbs. just try and make your pregnancy as healthy as possible and dont worry about weight gain, as long as youre eating good and trying to exersize a little youll be just fine. dont be like me, and fall in love with cheeseburgers..BAD IDEA. i would give anything to go back and NOT eat like a crazy food craver. good luck!

No its not mucus plug. mucus usually is stringly and bloody, u will know for sure when its mucus plug. whiteish is harmless and normal and it happens, when the bloody looking jelly things come out, thats the plug and it means labor is near. i got mines like slowly 2 weeks before labor each dr visit, then my final show was like the day i was in labor.

You should definately call  your doctor just to be sure since you are still early. I have heard of women losing their plus early. Good Luck!

yes, its normal for you to start losing "pieces" of it. it doesn't really mean anything.. your cervix are starting to thin out, your body is getting ready to push out a baby! now if you start seeing bright red blood, then you need to go to L&D.. anyways, don't let that scar you, i started losing my plug around 28 weeks and never bleed... good luck!

Why am I late if I am not pregnant?



Hi... I got married about 7 mths ago, and though usually I have a regular 30-day cycle, I did suffer from one or two late periods right after I got married (I guess it was from the change in normal routine/shifting to a new country thing).



My periods regularized after 3 cycles. Anyhow, this mth, I am 12 days late. I do not know when I ovulated, but I have been getting unusually excessive discharge all mth (usually I experience it only around the time of ovulation and a little before and after). However, 29 days into my cycle (one day before my period's due date), I saw egg-white discharge.



I took the pregnancy test 6 days after I missed my period and it was negative. Now I am 12 days late. I do not remember having been this late since I was 15 (11 years ago!). If I am not pregnant (I have NO symptoms whatsoever either!), then what could it be?

I have had 3 children, 2 came on their own and 1 was induced.  And to me, being induced was far less painful and a whole heck of a lot quicker.  With my first pregnancy I was in labor for 21 hours, he came on his own, with my 3rd I was in labor for 17 hours, and she came on her own.  Now with the one I was induced with, I got my pitocin around 9am, felt my first real labor pain around 11am, got my epidural around 1pm, and had her at 417pm.  The only thing I had with her was my epidural, no other pain meds.

It can make your labor more intense, and last longer. But everyone is different!



I was almost 2 weeks overdue so was induced with Pitocin (sp?) at 6am on a Monday morning.  I had my daughter 38 hours later on a Tuesday night!  I did not get an epideral until after about 30 hours... Don't ask me why!!  The labor got extremly intense after about 4 or 5 hours after being induced.



Even though you will not want to walk, do it.. it really does speed things up.

sorry to say but they wont induce you unless there are high risks o you or the baby. have gastrogel liquid for the heartburn get from chemist six dollars. for constipation have some apples,grapes,prune juice,they will get you going to the toilet. elevate your feet as high as you can get them, massage them or get hubby to massage. i also used a cold pack on them to relieve them. good luck. unfortunately this is the suckiest part of pregnancy.

Depends on where you live.  In Las Vegas hospitals will not induce you unless you are at least 39 weeks, or if there is something that is life threatening to you or your baby.

You have to be at LEAST 38 weeks for a doctor to induce for any reason othet than the health of you and/or the baby.  After that, its up to the doctor.  It cant hurt to ask but at the same time, every pregnant women feels the way you are right now.  The last couple weeks are always the worst but you stick it out for the baby.  Yes, he would be healthy if born right now but the longer he "bakes" the better for him.  Maybe your doctor would induce you a couple days early, say two days before your husband has court.  That would make you about 39 weeks, but again its up to the doctor.  i had three different doctors during the course of 3 pregnancies, none of them induced unless there was a risk to the mothers or babies health or if the baby was 2 weeks overdue.

You could ask, even though you could be classed as full term now many doctors will not induce early unless their is a risk to you or your babies life.



I was in the same situation when my 1st was born, I called and tried to get him day release so he could be their for the birth, I said jail security could even stand in the room if they had to but they said no (even though he was only on remand)



My other half missed the birth of our first child it was heartbreaking for me, I cried for him the whole time I was in labour. He didn't get to see our daughter until she was 3 days old (and I did not enjoy taking my beautiful girl to a prison for her first outing)



I did eventually get over it but he has been told if he misses the birth of our 2nd baby I do not want to know him and he will be having no contact with me or both the children. That threat has kept him in line and he has not been in trouble with the law since.



Also depending on what he is going to court for you could ask his lawyer to mention to the jude that you are about to have your first baby with him and if you get a nice judge he might make bail.

My LMP was on 09/17/08? Hope I'm preggers with #2?



But I started spotting 9/14/08, so it's now been 35 days since the actual flow and 38 since the spotting and my cycle is usually 30-34 days. So we are TTC and I sort of confused if I have actually missed my period? I only had a nauseous feeling for like 5 secs the other day, that's about it as far as symptoms. Oh and we had sex on 09/30/08, I believe that is when I was ovulating. Test was a negative 2 days ago and today. I also have white discharge and mild cramping above my pelvic. I sord of feel pregnant, but test says negative. I just called the doc for a blood test.

Tell me something......why are you putting up with this? Mothers are suppose to protect their babies and you aren't doing that by staying with him. You are going to get yourself so stressed out that it could cause a miscarriage. You need to think of your child first and your relationship 2nd. You can get another man!

You really need to see what women's services are a available in your area. For instance, where I live, there is a women's shelter that takes in and helps provide sanction and housing for abused women.  They even help abused pregnant women get apartments of their own.  You need to make the decision to leave your boyfriend, don't change your mind.

You need to leave here instantly. The other poster is right. How would he treat your baby if he treats the mother like s**t. I suggest that you start your own life somewhere else.  Also there are transition homes that you can stay at for any amount of time that you may want to look at as well.

You had unprotected sex during your most fertile time. I'd say you are pregnant. You are most fertile 2 weeks after your period starts.



You really shouldn't be having sex if you don't even know basic facts about fertility and sex.

I had a drs appt today and i want to get induced?



I'll be 38 weeks on Sunday. I'm scared of my baby being stillborn I've done so much research and I'm just scared. So I asked my doctor if he could induce me next week and he said he could. the thing is I've heard so many stories about how much more being induced hurts than naturally going into labor. Also will this hurt my baby I think if she is still in the womb is because shes comfortable in there and she'll come whenever she wants. It took me 7 years of ttc and finally got pregnant after so many medications and pain. My pregnancy has been fine but im just scared of my baby dying in my tummy..help what are your opinions.

So, am I pregnant? :)?



Yes a lil redundant as a question, but I'm going to ask anyways. My boyfriend and I made love 2 days before my period which was Sept 29th, 2008. After that, I've gotten mood swings, and my uterus has been getting bigger by the week, my breasts have been killing me for almost 3 weeks before my period, I'm slightly nauseous, and my heartburn is really intense. I've also have been extra sleepy, like I'd sleep all day, and I'd still want to sleep in, and I've also have been getting headaches. Just to be known my next "supposedly" period is October 28th, and my symptoms started 3-4 days before my birthday which was October 8th. I NEVER get bloated, and I get my mood swings right on my period, my boobs would normally hurt at around a week or less before my period, I never gotten heartburn on a daily basis, nausea, or headaches like I do now. And if I recall i haven't slept this much ever. I hope I'm pregnant, after all of this happening to me, right? Oh, and to add, my sister is 8 months pregnant, and she got pregnant on her period. She tells me that you're most fertile then, but I'm also told on the 14th day...ugh I'm so confused! lol Please help me! :D

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Given a regular 28 day cycle, a woman is most fertile between day 8 and day 16 inclusive, if day 1 is the start of her period.  However there are always exceptions.  Teenagers and young women should consider themselves fertile anytime, since their bodies are still developing their rhythm.
I'd say you are pregnant given the long list of symptoms.  Use a home pregnancy test if your next period doesn't show up.

go to the doctor or atleast call them and ask, if its normal they will tell you not to worry, if its not normal they will ask you to come in to be examined. did you try tylenol for pain, you can take that while pregnant.

Do I have everything ready? Baby coming next week...?



My baby is being delivered next week.



As I don't know the sex, I have only purchased a small amount in readiness. If it is a girl, I have lots left from my 2 year old daughter, but if it is a boy, I have NOTHING extra.



What I have in white ready is:



2 x nighties
2 x pyjamas
2 x jumpuits
2 x all in one body suit
6 x singlets
4 x socks
2 x hats
2 x mittens
Lots of blankets/wraps



Dummy
Nappy Cream
Washers (I don't like the wipes)



I also have a list of other things to get tomorrow, which are:



Nappies
Nipple Cream
Maternity pads (for me obviously)
Breast pads (again, for me)
Bath wash



And my husband just came home with the new car seat.



We will be going shopping for more as soon as it is born and we know the sex. I also have a large family and will get lots of clothes as everyone knows I have not brought too much.



My brain is going all over the place... what else can you think of as an essential for the first few days??

Vaseline during pregnancy....?



i was just wondering if anybody knew if vaseline was ok to rub on your stomach for stretch marks and if it works.  I know most people say use cocoa  butter but to be honest i dont really like the smell of it so i thought maybe vaseline would work.  I dont have any stretch marks but i still want to try and prevent them if possible so if you know about this please let me know or if you know anything else i would appreciate any ideas.

I'm not sure about chicken hearts, but here is what I found about chicken livers (copied from the marchofdimes.com)



Should a pregnant woman eat liver?
There is some concern about consuming liver during pregnancy. Liver is a good source of protein and is rich in certain vitamins and minerals. These include:



The B vitamin folic acid, which helps prevent certain birth defects



Iron, which helps prevent anemia



Vitamin A, which is needed for normal fetal growth and development



However, in the case of vitamin A, liver may contain too much of a good thing.



Some studies suggest that high doses of vitamin A may cause birth defects. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A for pregnant women is 2,565 IUs (international units) per day (7). In a 1995 study, women who took more than 10,000 IUs of vitamin A daily (nearly 4 times the amount recommended by the IOM) in the first two months of pregnancy had more than double the risk of having a baby with birth defects (8). Other studies have suggested that doses under 30,000 IUs daily probably do not cause birth defects, but the lowest dose that may cause birth defects is unknown (9).



The body makes its own vitamin A, when needed, from substances such as beta carotene, which is found in yellow and green vegetables. This raw material for the vitamin is completely safe and healthy during pregnancy. However, much of the vitamin A consumed is the preformed vitamin (retinol) which, in excessive amounts, may cause birth defects. Preformed vitamin A is found in many vitamin supplements and some foods, including meats, eggs, dairy products and fortified breakfast cereals.



Liver is the only food that provides very high amounts of vitamin A. For example (7):



A 3-ounce serving of beef liver may contain 27,000 IUs.



A 3-ounce serving of chicken liver may contain 12,000 IUs.



A pregnant woman who eats liver regularly may consume enough vitamin A to pose a risk to her baby.



Though it is not proven that eating liver causes birth defects, the safest approach is for pregnant women to minimize their consumption of liver. A pregnant woman also should be sure that her multivitamin or prenatal supplement contains no more than 5,000 IUs of preformed vitamin A. Some prenatal vitamins contain no preformed vitamin A, substituting beta carotene or omitting vitamin A entirely. She should not take any vitamin A supplements beyond that amount (10).

If you used a condom and it appeared to be in tact at the end, you should be fine. The fact that he didn't orgasm is also stacking the odds in your favour, although pre-c** is enough to get a woman pregnant (during unprotected sex).



Worrying can also delay your period so try to relax and hopefully you should see it come very soon. Stress from your exams is highly likely to be the cause. It's quite common for a period to be delayed from time to time.

It doesn't matter, there is sperm in pre-***.  Also, you are most fertile starting a few days after your period ends (as early as day 8, depending on your cycle).



Have you not 'considered' taking a test yet since you're over a week late?!  No point in stressing if you can just find out, surely?!

if the condom didn't split it should be okay. you are under stress so it may take a little while for your body to adjust. leave it a couple more weeks and if still no show take a pregnancy test. also if you worry that will delay your period more (i know it's hard not to worry) and if you start believing you are pregnant your body will tell you, that you are.

you can get pregnant on the pill even if using a condom sometimes these things just happen.  The best thing to do if you think you are pregnant is to go to the chemist and get a preganancy kit I use the crystal clear digital ones from friendlies chemists.  then take the test first thing in the morning as this is when your hormones are the strogest.  if it comes back negative wait one month then take another one(you usually get two tests in a box).  if this comes back negative then you are not pregnant.



if it comes up postive then you need to go to your Dr who will do another pee test and then if this comes up postive then you will need a blood test to confirm.



good luck.

Sounds like you are only at the end of week 4, or the start of week 5?  Do not worry, there is still hope for the pregnancy.  They usually can't see much/anything until your levels are over 1000.  Just get another hCG in a few days, you should be able to see your bean on a transvaginal ultrasound by then too.  Good luck!

So far I’m surviving on TUMS. Beyond that, you just have to experiment to see if you can find foods that don’t cause heartburn/reflux for you. Mine is unpredictable from day to day. Something that bothered me last week is ok now and vice versa, and the foods that bother me aren’t always the usual suspects like acidic, spicy or fatty foods.

I never had acid reflux / heartburn until the beginning of my third trimester - about 2 or 3 weeks ago. Now it's a regular occurrence. ugh.  I found that the following things help me quite a bit:
- eating small amounts at a time, but more frequently
- limiting heavy or greasy food
- limiting spicy food (even if you really like it)
- not eating too close to bedtime



- Drinking milk - the calcium in milk helps neutralize your stomach acid
- limiting intake of acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus fruits
- limiting carbonated drinks, even ones without caffeine
- Always keeping Tums on-hand!



Calucim-based antacids like Tums are safe for pregnant women, and they seem to work well for many people. Zantac didn't work for me but Tums works nicely. You might want to try another antacid and see if you have more success.



Hope you're feeling better soon!

Should I get a 2nd opinion?



I am about 5 weeks pregnant and as of yesterday morning I was suposed to be 7 and they did a sono it showed a sack at 5w2d and I was having 4 days of bleeding and cramps so they said yesterday thta I am a threatened miscarriage full bed rest and now this morning my hormone level doubled and is in the 1700s so they said everything is fine and they canceled my appointment and will see me in a month. I would have felt a little more at ease if they would have done another sono in a week or two to see a heartbeat. what do you think?

Call them back and tell them your concerns.



When I was having some issues in my early pregnancy they wanted to have a 10 or 13 week scan done to make sure that everything was progressing well since I had issues in the beginning.... they were going to send me to a specialist to have this done.



I would call them.  Tell them you want to have an ultrasound to be sure everything is okay.  IF they do not do this for you, and you are concerned it is time to see out someone else who will help ease your mind and will do what YOU want.



Pregnancy is not a time to be stressed out and they should do all in their power to help ease your mind.

It was not scary, and my boyfriend was great with me through every second of it, that made such a big difference!



I would do it again in the morning if i had to...and no, im not one of those airy-fairy hippy people who think birth is an amazing life changing thing. Im a normal girl who was scared of her life of it!

Hi sweetheart!



I was induced with 2 of my babies and I guess, since it's the only way I've ever delivered- I don't see what's so "awful."



I didn't have an epidural with either baby, went 100% natural and yes, it was painful, but it was such a small amount of time I didn't mind it. It wasn't scary for me at all. With each of my kids, once I got the pitocin my contractions picked up like crazy and they were painful, but I don't think they were any stronger than the contractions I was having at home.



The only super painful time was right before I needed to push and during pushing...and I'm pretty sure that's going to be painful no matter what!



Don't worry about getting induced...labor is labor and it's different for everyone. That's why some women swear by epidurals and some women refuse them. Some women have 3 hour labors and some have 30 hour labors....you'll see it's not scary any way you have it. You'll be taken care of, baby will be taken care of and it'll be over before you know it!!

The only thing positive, is you'll know when your going into labor! I have had an inducement and went on my own. My second was suppose to be induced but he decided to come on his own THANK GOD!! Inducement is stronger pains and stronger labor itself. I swore up and down after labor with my first I would never do it again. Then when my son decided to come on his own, i was so thank full, and I would rather deliver him 10x over again then ever go through an inducement again!!!!

I've been induced twice, with my 2nd son it was horrible and ended in what I completely believe was an unneccessary csection due to the induction.  With my 3rd son I wanted a VBAC but he didn't do so well on a NST so they decided to induce me the day before my due date but they did it differently this time.  The used Cervail which ripens, softens and prepares your cervix for labor, doesn't really induce you, doesn't start contractions, just prepares your body for when they will give you pitocin.  Well that alone put me into labor but they did still use a bit of pitocin and that labor and delivery went great, couldn't have been better.  In the matter of 1hr and 43min I went from being 4cm to 10 and delivering him :)



But really if possible I would try and avoid being induced medically, maybe try some at home stuff, lots of walking and sex.  If you do have to do it medically I would really ask about the cervadil first.  Why do they want you do deliver before your due date?

I basically got induced last Friday. My body went to 4 cm, but that's as far as I would go on my own. I showed up at the hospital at 8:30 am. They checked me in and got me comfortable. I watched some TV and wrote in my pregnancy journal. Just relaxing. They started Pitocin by 10 (I had a side effect of getting the "shakes" when I wasn't having a contraction....not a big deal) and the contractions weren't that bad (my pain tolerance may be a little high from some past experiences, but really it was no worse than your monthly friend)! The epidural came at 12:30 (the most painful part of the whole experience) and they broke the bag of waters by 2. My family was in and out, as well as my hubby. Everything was completely relaxing and exciting at the same time. At 3:50 they brought the doctor in and I started pushing. My beautiful baby boy was born at 4:13. I was so scared of labor and the induction (etc) that I thought when the time came I would be a horrible mess. In reality? It was an amazing experience (my first child BTW) and I would do it all over again.......not right now though because I still feel like I have been riding a horse for a couple days! It isn't painful, just sore! I wouldn't worry about it at all. Even if it does hurt, you won't even feel a thing once that baby is crying and you get to hold it for the first time!

On a 1-10 scale, it was about a 7 for me. I didn't have an epidural though. It was NOTHING near as bad as I thought it would be. I didn't really have major pain until the last 1-2 hours of labor as the baby made it's way down to crown. I was induced with pitocin with both of mine, and will be this time as well. I loved it, and have no complaints at all. Short easy labors and deliveries.



Labors were from first contraction:
8hrs45mins, pushed 2 times (slept 6 hours of that)
5hrs20mins, pushed 3 times (slept 3 hours of that)

Mine was great.  I got induced because my first child was 12 days early... and I had a fairly quick labor.  So for my second (and since my doctor would be out of town when I was due) we decided to induce to avoid the possibility that I would go into labor too fast to make it to the hospital.  So... I heard stories that it would hurt more and bla bla bla.. and was worried myself.  They broke my water at 9:00 am... and I asked not to have the pitocen (not sure if I spelled that right) to see if I would start contractions naturally.  I put in a house/techno CD and started dancing around the room... in about 10 minutes I started contracting... and continued dancing through all my contractions (of course you stop and buckle over when the actual contraction comes on and stay in that position until it passes) as best as I could up until 10:55 am when I had the urge to push.  5 minutes later, my daughter was born.  I highly recommend induction if the baby is fit to come out and you want to deliver.  It all hurts no matter what, but don't be afraid of the induction itself.  I would definitely recommend trying to contract on your own before resorting to meds... and dancing and jumping around definitely helps bring that on.  My first pregnancy, I laid in the hospital bed wrenching in pain and mangling the bed rails through each contraction... and couldn't believe how much more tolerable the pain was up on my feet and dancing around the room like I was at a night club.  I truly believe that it helped with the contractions and the quick labor/delivery.
If you're planning on using meds for pain, it may delay delivery in some people.  Everyone is different.  But it you're looking to get the absolute raw experience, I highly recommend drug free which is what I did with both my kids.  I know it hurts, but believe me... you will be able to make it through.  The best and least painful part (for me anyway) was the delivery.  Good luck and don't be scared.

Epidurals stop the pain of contractions.  They are wonderful and i would never give birth without one.  I don't know what entonox is and i've never had a water birth.  I had an episotomy and i didn't feel it since i had an epidural.  It did take awhile to heal since I had stitches, but i would assume it'd be the same as if you tore.

I recommend DEMURRAL!!! It makes you very relaxed when not having a contraction(hell I was singing Johnny Cash when I was in labor for my second baby) I dont believe in epidurals...my sister just had one, and its very painful going in, and they had to up her medicine twice and it still didnt work!!! Its suppose to basically numb you from the waist down so you dont feel hardly anything. It is less painful as I have been told to be cut instead of tear b/c then you have a chance of ripping inside and out if you just let them tear you when they come out. As far as the other two, I have not been through or have any one close to me experinced them. Good LucK!

Tear naturally is better than being cut...it heals faster and its usually only the outer layers of skin, where as if they cut you it is a deep cut, and you will most definetly tear farther.



Water birth is supposed to help you relax and make the birthing process less painful (but sometimes slows down labor) I really wish my hospital had a birthing tub, cuz I would soooo be in it.



An epidural is a shot they give you in your spine that numbs you from the chest down. It makes for no pain during delivery. Personally I want to go all natural, but dont let anyone tell you you didnt "really" experience childbirth if you get one.



And I have never heard of entonox sorry!!!

Tear, because it can heal faster. But there are some (only a few!) horror stories of women ripping from their V-hole to their A-hole.



Ive heard water births are less painful, but Ive yet to experiment with this idea.



And an epidural is supposed to ease the pain from the waist down. Some women feel the full effect and cant even feel themselves pushing the baby out. Some women feel it and it wears off, or it onyl works for one side of their body. And in some women it doesnt even work. Its all about your body chemistry.

Alcohol during first month of pregnancy?



I have a friend (I know how that sounds but it really is a friend!) who is pregnant with her first child.  She suspected pregnancy when she missed her period, but tested negative (after the missed period) so she felt it was safe to have one margarita with dinner.



She is really nervous about the effects (if any) it had on the fetus.  Her first doctor's appointment is next week, so I wanted to find out some information to try and calm her nerves before then.  Is it possible that the small amount of alcohol at about 5 weeks pregnant caused any harm?

The chances of any defects are slim to none. Many women drink within the first month of pregnancy without even knowing that they ae pregnant. Unless she was drinking all day everyday, doing drugs and what not, i think she will be ok, but she can always ask the dr and they will reassure her. As long as she doesnt continue to drink, everything will be fine.

I was in the same boat as your friend. Before I found out I was pregnant, I went out drinking with my friends.. like getting drunk drinking. Afterwards, I was worried that it might have some effect on my baby. The doctor told me that since the first month of pregnancy is the baby attaching to your body and not developing, there's a slight chance anything could happen to it. I've had my testing done,and she's perfectly fine. You should just ask your doctor about it when you go in.

Everything should be fine. My husband and I were told we couldn't have any more kids, so I didn't watch the drinking. I had a lot to drink at my brother's birthday party and found out I was pregnant a few weeks later. My son(who is now 2) was born healthy, not a problem at all.



Just as long as she doesn't drink anymore, she and the baby should be A-OK.

You can actually drink alcohol while pregnant - just don't go overboard. They say to AVOID alcohol during pregnancy. But large consumptions of alcohol can cause damage, but one margarita won't do anything to the bub. Tell her congrats and calm down, she'll be fine!

That small amount of alcohol is not going to hurt the baby.  One margarita is not going to hurt the baby, it is a small amount and taken in with food, and the doctor will reassure her that one drink will not hurt and to just not drink any more.  :D

She and her baby are perfectly fine.  Nothing to worry about this kinda thing happens all the time and usually women drink way more than just one margarita.

Yeah I was probably 3 or 4 weeks and came home from work one day and had a beer. A lot of women drink normally if pregnancy was an accident or they took a test to early and got a negative and it has no effects. The only time she should worry is if she has been drinking excessivly or if she still is which if shes worried about a margarita I'd say she hasn't so she should be okay. One drink isn't going to hurt anyone. In fact, some doctors suggest a glass of red wine every once in a while during your pregnancy! lol. Best of luck to your friend!

<question>



Can I be pregnant under these circumstances?



I fooled around with my boyfriend a couple times 2 to 3 weeks ago. We never had sex. He put his finger inside me and around the area, but he never said anything about having semen on his hand and I never noticed any. I took two pregnancy tests, one a week ago and one 3 days ago, and both were negative. Now I'm spotting kind of pink and brown, and I'm constipated and nauseous this morning, and I was nauseous yesterday morning as well. I have also been feeling sick- like congested and coughing and a little dizzy. My periods are irregular as it is, so I don't know when I am due for the next one, and I'm supposed to start birth control when my period starts- can I start now just with spotting? I'm super paranoid that I might be pregnant- like I said I've never had sex, but I know that it's possible to get pregnant like this. Can I take a test now, even with spotting?
Sorry this is so convoluted and long hahaha but I just wanna be sure. Thanks in advance!

37 weeks - sorry if TMI!?



Hi,
I am 37 weeks pregnant and last night my knickers felt really wet. I went to the toilet and it was just LOTS of white discharge. Well, the next time I went to the toilet when I wiped the colour on the tp was bright orange with a slight shading of a pinker colour on some of it. It was hardlt noticeable and I may have even been imagining it - but it still worried me.
There was no discharge at all that time round just this odd colour on the tp.



I just wondered if anyone had any advice or opinions on what it could be? I have heard of the mucous plug obviously but this wasnt like a discharge in texture or consistency it was just "stained" that colour.



I havent had anything else since - so I dont know whether it was just nothing or not?!



</question>



<additional details>



Lynnie:
obviously I have rang my midwife but she hasnt got back yet - I wouldnt take any risk regarding our baby.



I thought maybe it was the plug - but I was always told it was dischargey and "stringy" in texture - this was just "stained" that colour. Thats what confused me!

It most certainly sounds like this is your mucus plug.
This can be white, and may lead to a pinkish or brown discharge afterwards.



Ooh, you lucky girl, bet you're not 2 weeks overdue like I nearly was with my second, after having to be induced with my first.



Although your mucus plug has come out, this does not mean that you will instantly go into labour, but, it means your cervix is obviously ready for dilation and delivery, so don't go anywhere remote and off the beaten track in the next few weeks!  Lol.



Make sure your bags are packed, all is ready and I think you will go in the next couple of weeks - let us know the good news!!
Good Luck.

Shouldn't you be best asking a doctor/midwife, this?



They'll know better and if it IS something they can deal with it.



Edit: I'm sorry - I wasn't insinuating that you would put the baby at risk. I was trying to be logical. But if the midwife hasn't gotten back to you, my suggestion would be phone NHS direct (if you live in the UK) and ask them for advice OR relax... if it's serious, the midwife will get back to you.

Yes, it is normal but brace yourself because your baby will be just as active when he/she is born. Mine started wiggling in the womb and has not stopped since. I bought a jumperoo for him at 2 months so he could jump himself silly (it is so funny to watch.) It seems that women who say their babies were active while pregnant have very alert and active babies after they are born. Good luck and have fun.

Hi your just enjoying your baby and learning the best exciting things about being pregnant. I loved all that when i was pregnant. It is normally for your baby to be really active the further on you get you will learn and see where the baby's hand is. If you lye in a bath which i loved doing you will eventually work out if it is the hand feet or head and so on. It is amazing to see when you get further on your baby can move the shape of your bump away up to one side. Beautiful words cant describe it. To answer your question this is normal you may just have an active baby in good health. I hope i have helped you and good luck you have a good strong healthy baby enjoy. Tina

at 18 weeks I was feeling my son for hours at a time, at some points since then it doesn't feel like he even sleeps, can't go 10 minutes with out feeling him. Now he lets up but he still moves and kicks/punches enough for me to feel him at least a few times every hour. He wakes me up sometimes. So yes it is normal. I talked to my doctor about it and he said that is a really good thing. And I have been noticing my belly move a lot since about 21 weeks. No it definitely isn't too early for any of that.

What has your experience with a VBAC?



I'm still waiting to find out if I am actually pregnant with my third baby. But that aside, I am a the type of person who likes to be informed and well prepared.



I've had 2 children already. The first was nearly a textbook pregnancy and birth. I was in labour for 24hrs and I delivered vaginally with an epidural. no problems.



The second was great until the end when it was discovered that she was breech. I was scheduled for a version and was told that my fluid levels were critically low and instead of trying the procedure, I was scheduled for an urgent c-section that day.



I was extremely sad when I had to have the section but in the end I was happy that my baby was going to be born without complications and was healthy.



If it turns out to be certain that I am pregnant, I am almost dead set on having a VBAC but am also not a huge risk taker and will do what is best for my baby and myself.



I am wondering what your experiences have been with a VBAC? did you go the midwife route or the doctor route? were they supportive?  Was there complications after or during? did you feel like you were being selfish wanting a vbac rather than another c-section?



any input would great and will help to make up my mind....
and hopefully my sore boobs are really indicating that I'm pregnant.

I actually just had a successful VBAC and i wouldn't go back (if i could) and change my decision you see my first i went in thinking and in hopes of a natural birth but after being in labour for 24 hour bubs heart rate dropped and they had to wheel me in for a c-section. That was 18 months ago and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago, that was a successful VBAK that i went in route with a doctor that was very supportive, this is the way god intended for baby's to come into this world so no i didn't feel selfish when i choose that route. If anything  would have felt selfish having a planned c-section. I didn't have any complications during or after i felt like i was a pro after bubs was born as if i had done this before. This decision is truly up to you go with what your heart tells you and good luck in whatever situation you end up choosing.

I'm in the same situation, i went to my 16 week consultant appointment and we talked about my options, he said that he thinks that i sould have a VBAC, but have an appointment at 34 weeks where they will confirm this. So instead of worrying about it i'm going to wait until then as anything can happen. I'm ok with having another C-section if needs but would like to try VBAC

I lost a pregnancy exactly 4 weeks ago - a "missed" miscarriage. We discovered at our first appointment at almost 10 wks that there was no heartbeat, and three weeks later I lost the pregnancy naturally at home.  Our doc recommened that we wait two cycles before trying again and we had a brief discussion about going out to buy some condoms, but neither of us did, and we were not really all that careful.  Yesterday I all of a sudden felt super hormonal and have been noticing extra sensitivity in my breasts (until this week though, all pregnancy symptoms from the miscarriage had disappeared). I figured I was about to start my period, but got to thinking and decided to take a preg test - it was positive.  My question is, what is the liklihood that it was detecting residual hormones from the miscarriage, vs. hormones from a new pregnancy.  And, if I do have a new pregnancy, is there any big reason medically (I realize the emotional implications of another pregnancy so soon) why this one would be at a much greater risk for miscarriage being so soon after a loss? I have read tons online about this and the info is widely varied. I know there probably is not a cut and dry answer - I guess what I am looking for are some stories from people about their experiences with this.

That's a hard one because the pregnancy was pretty established when you miscarried so you would have had a lot of HCG built up. Did you take any pregnancy tests during the past 4 weeks that have been negative? I miscarried but very early on and I was still taking HPT's (to check) and they were negative and then gradually started to go positive again. That is how I knew I was pregnant again because we didn't wait to start trying again either. I would say just keep taking tests every couple of days and check if the positive result is getting stronger or weaker as that should indicate whether HCG is dropping or not. In regards to the increased risk of a second miscarriage, I did a bunch of research after mine too because I was concerned about losing this pregnancy, when I asked people on a forum there were a bunch of them who DID lose their following pregnancies which I think was more than just a coincidence, this doesn't mean that you will though, all you can do is hope. I am 33 weeks pregnant now and conceived about 3 weeks after my miscarriage. Good luck to you and I am sorry for your loss.

I doubt that the hormones are from your last pregnancy. The reason is b/c you have a natural miscarriage at home, and when you lose the baby/blood, all the hcg hormones go to 5 or 3. I had experience a miscarriage b4 as well, and right after i had a miscarriage at home, i took a pregnancy test to see if it wa spositive or negative and it was negative.



I am sorry for your loss, but i think you might be pregnnat again, you will never know until you find out from taking a blood test..Congrats!
After I miscarried my doc told me to wait a month, and try the next month but it took me  four more cycles to get pregnant. I t hink you should be fine, once a miscarriage does not mean that you will always have a miscarriage. Every pregnancy is different. I think the last miscarriage you had wasfrom chromosonal abnormaltiy which is the major cause for one..

Well, in April of this year I miscarried at 6 weeks. I knew when it happened (it happened immediately) loads of pain. I was completely devastated because me and my husband wanted a baby soooo bad! I had the bleeding from the miscarriage and then missed my next period. I however did not get a positive home test. I got a blood test done a week later when my period didn't come because I was well obsessive I guess lol. But no pregnancy. Since my miscarriage my periods are always late and I haven't ovulated since I miscarried (besides this last month). So I guess what I'm saying is that I had the 6 weeks worth of the pregnancy hormone and I didn't get a positive test the next month when my period was due. I had absolutely no pregnancy hormones left 2 days after miscarrying. Yours could be different but I have heard of A LOT of people getting pregnant immediately because the hormones are so high. The reason they say not to try so soon is because your body has to get back to normal.  It has to recover. Someone I know has had 3 miscarriages and 3 babies brought to term. Each of her three kids were conceived directly after a miscarriage and she didn't have any problems. I would recommend that you call your doctor and have them do an internal ultrasound. That will tell you for sure if your pregnant again. From there your doctor can help you with what to do. Good luck and God Bless♥ I hope you get everything you want!!

Well, from experience here. You are most definitely pregnant again there. So, first of Congrats to you & your other half!!! Okay heres the deal with the HCG issue first. When your baby is not alive inside you, they HCG level decreases by half everyday. So, 4 weeks later there would have been no trace of the hormone. And, when it comes to conceiving again so soon, its for you more so then your body. We seem to be more prone to conceiving again within 6 months of a miscarriage. Dont know why, but its true!



My sister & I have both been cursed with spontaneous miscarriage here. She lost 11, & myself 8 here. And I inquired why they give you a time constraint on getting pregnant again. My doctor told me, its so your hormones can settle down to normal again & to sort of grieve some too. It never easy & as women when we lose a baby, we subconsciously want another to replace this lost one. I know it sounds odd, but if you ask any woman that has lost a pregnancy, they will tell you, they have never felt complete till they had another. Theres like a piece of us missing. But then on the other end there, try being set in your ways so much so that you are done having babies & finding out your expecting. I was waiting for my period to get my tubes tied here & guess what, period never came! Instead a beautiful son did! This was scary for us, with my history as I told you & it was just difficult the whole time, the worry, the not wanting to get excited till the end! It was hard for us! Myself I lost most in the first & second trimester. But one of my babies was stillborn at 7 months. So, I really couldnt get excited till the very end here! And come to find out, he was a scheduled c-section, but the cord was around his neck... the doctors never told me- till he was 2 weeks old & a nurse slipped up & said something! I freaked!!! Knowing that I could have lost him also! But I didnt & I love him to pieces!!! Anyways, thats it. Have a wonderful day & take it easy there!!!!

I went through that same thing. I spotted 3 days before my period was due. It was brown and then red and then stopped. It lasted for 2 days. I thought it was my period, but it was implantation bleeding. i took a test a few days later and 2 little lines popped up! :) You very well could be pregnant. Take a test! :)

There's a great saying which says "life happens while you are busy making other plans".



The same applies to trying to fall pregnant. Stressing about falling pregnant and having sex as a chore to become pregnant can actually stop you falling pregnant.



Instead why don't you sit back, relax and enjoy sex and you will be surprised how quickly the baby will come! Good luck and keep trying!

You only have about a 25% chance of conceiving in any given monthly cycle.  And that is assuming that both partners are healthy.  It's not uncommon for a healthy couple to take 6-12 months to conceive.  The best thing is to continue charting your cycles and baby dancing at the right times.  If it doesn't happen after 12 consecutive months of trying, ask your doctor for a referral to a fertility specialist.

From BabyCenter.com : Severe itchiness in the second or, more commonly, in the third trimester can be a sign of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a liver problem that affects less than 1 percent of pregnant women in the United States.



They say to call your caregiver immediately because if it continues it can cause problems for you and your baby.

I'm a little freaked out... TMI warning!?



Okay, I gave birth to my daughter 15 days ago. I've had the normal bleeding that comes after delivery, with the occasional jelly-looking blood clots, although I haven't had one in about a week or so. Then early this morning (about 4 hours ago), I went to the bathroom and there was a weird looking mass in my pad. I looked closer, and it looked like some kind of clot, but it wasn't dark red or jelly-like, like it had always been before. It was a little slimy looking, with some darker red coloring, along with streaks of pink (almost skin-colored). The part that really scares me is the fact that there was a hard piece of something in there. I'm sorry for the TMI, but I really need some advice on whether or not I should call my doctor, or if it's normal. Please please help!!



Thanks so much!

You may need to present to emergency or at least the hospital again. It could be that there are placental adhesions that need to be removed. This is as it was in my wife's case.

Yes, there is and you will unfortunately have discharge throughout your whole pregnancy.  You can have milky white discharge and you can have clear discharge.  I was warned about the white milky disharge but not the clear.  My panties were wet every day and I would look online and get paranoid, I thought I was leaking amniotic fluid.  Finally, I got over my embarassment and asked the doctor who told me yes that it was normal and to invest in pantyliners and cotton panties.

There is no way one can know that your a vigin or not wirhout you telling him.  What you should know is that if you had sex your vagina stretches the time you are having sex after that it gets to the same normal size as before even if you have sex for so many times.  What I know is only when you gave birth vagina streches but for some time it gets to the normal size again and it is normal not to bleed when ur having sex even me when it was my first time I did not bleed.  Dont worry he will not know anything.  If you can manage but vagina soap some pple use this soap.

doesnt necessarily hurt more or even cause any problems (I was inducted labor twice), just makes all the contractions happen sooner, and not so gradual as compared to going into labor on your own.  think about it, you are combining hours of labor and contractions into a smaller time frame.

<answer>



First off, why are you being induced?



Unless it is for preeclampsia or low fluid levels I would suggest you to not be induced.



Induction hurst much more because it jump starts contractions to be strong strong strong , since you haven't had time to build up to this pain level it is hardly managed without the use of an epidural.  You should be dialated to a 4 before they do this.



First of all they will insert something into your cervix to soften it and then 2 days later they will probably induce you with pitocin.



Don't worry about it, usually there arean't very many complications, a lot of women have had perfectaly healthy, safe deliveries but me myself had a bad one ending in a csection.



You should be fully informed as to why you are being induced and possible complications, you can get a list from your doctor and if there is anything you are too worried about they should be able to guide you to the right direction.  Good luck, and reguardless enjoy this special and happy time!

Well, pitocin, the chemical used to induce labor, causes very strong and harsh contractions.
So, most women I know who wanted a drug-free labor who ended up being induced opted for an epidural VERY easy on.



And yes, being induced does make it more likely for complications, and more likely that you'll need a c-section.



but really, inductions are so routine these days, doctors know what they're doing.
I wouldn't worry at all.



Good luck and congrats!

yes it does. the reason?



PITOCIN  (I call it the medicine of the devil and I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to have this the second time around).



Dont expect to go without pain meds or an epidural.  You will likely need it with being induced.  I had pitocin at the very tip end of my labor, started screaming bloody murder and didnt even know where I was.  It made me turn into a monster.  BUT I had NO meds and NO epidural.. Sorry to scare you, but if you have to do this, insist on an epidural right away.



My labor was very very regular before this, every 1-1/2 minutes like clockwork for 22 yrs, pushing took 4 hours.  The pitocin was given to me at the last hour (plus the 4 hrs of pushing) and I turned into a monster.  I even apologized to the nurses afterwards.

It does hurt more because it is not natural, your body wasn't 100% prepared to go into labor. The pitocin, the chemical that starts labor, will be injected into you causing labor and you hit the floor running. Your body didn't naturally trigger the chemical to start labor so its kind of like Whoa! whats going on? So its harder and faster.



If you have the option to do a natural birth and let nature run its course, then do it. If the Doctor recommends the induction, of course your health care professional knows whats best for you.



If you are simply having the induction to get it over with, I suggest you wait. Everything comes in due time.



Congrats and good luck

Induced labor doesn't hurt any more than regular labor. My doctor and I had this discussion, because i'm getting induced on Tuesday. I said, "Doesn't the Pitocin cause harder contractions?" and she told me that Pitocin doesn't cause abnormally hard and painful contractions, just regular ones instead of sporadic ones. She said that you can ask your nurse to ease up the Pitocin if they get too close together for you to handle and you need a break (that is, unless the baby is coming out and your body is doing it, not the pitocin)

Induced labors are more likley to end up as a C/S when compared to labor that comes on naturally. And theoretically, yes they should hurt more b/c an external source (the medicine Pitocin) is being controlled by your Nurse to increase & strengthen your contractions (they increase the dose every 20-30minutes). However, pain depends on the individual's pain tolerance.  Your concerns are normal & natural. You still have time between now & next week to go into labor on your own, so don't worry too much, just start cleaning, walking, have sex, etc LOL

I can't compare the 2 but I can tell you about my own sons birth of which I was induced.  My waters broke at 5.30am, I went to hospital at 10am with no pain, I was induced at around 11am and by 1.20pm the same day my little boy was born.  Doesn't sound like a horror story does it ?? That's because it wasn't. And this was my first baby.  From what I have heard being induced just means that the contractions come quicker and faster than normal labor so your body does not have as much time to adjust, but I honestly didn't feel any difference in the intensity of the contractions from start to finish, all I needed was the gas and I didn't use that for the pain but to take my mind off it. I rated my labor pains as a 2 out of 10.  Don't stress yourself about it hun, you are about to participate in one of the biggest miracles of life, lay back, relax and go with the feelings you have. You will be fine. NOTE: I also found that kneeling up with the bed in a sitting position and my belly into the chair easier as I was comfortable and was working with gravity. Good luck :) Bubs needs to come out and if being induced has been recommended then that is what will be best for both of you.

Well, there are risks associated with it. The doctor's don't always tell you what they are or what the differences are. I don't want you to go into labor being scared, but I want you to know that if there is no reason to induce labor... No high blood pressure or gestational diabetes and you're not overdue then you should really think about some things. I was told this all by my midwife...



*Induced labors only work 1/2 the time, the other half ending up in c-section after many hours of painful labor. They are longer, the contractions are harder and longer, so there's little break to breathe in between.*
Birth is an amazing experience and you do not need to dwell on negative experiences of others. People will tell you everything negative and it will scare you to the point where you panic during labor and you need to just block out what everyone else says. Even me if you don't like what I say. ***It's your call to say how you want your birthing experience to be!***

You can miscarry anywhere from 4-20 weeks but with every week that passes, the chances of a miscarriage are less. Most people miscarry around 4-8 weeks. Normally if you make it past 12 weeks, you're out of the danger zone. I miscarried last month at 6 weeks and miraculously I'm now 6 weeks pregnant again. I thank God everytime a week passes.

You can miscarry as soon as the egg gets fertilized, in which case you wouldn't even know you were pregnant because you wouldn't miss your period or even get a positive pregnancy test. If you miscarry after that then you would most likely have a late period but it would be heavier and you would be in more pain then a normal period, you would also pass clots but really tiny ones. If you miscarry after you already miss your period then it is even worse, you would bleed A LOT and  be in a lot of pain and probably bleed longer than a normal period. Those are usually the early miscarriage symptoms.

It's possible to miscarry anytime after conception, some women can have this happen even before they know they are pregnant.  Symptoms would be relativley the same as getting your period, bleeding (possible with clots), cramping.  If you were pregnant and miscarried even this early it would be detectable by a pregnancy test (maybe not a home one, but by bloodwork) because your body starts producing the hormones immediatly and it takes days-weeks after a miscarriage for the levels to go back to normal.

You can miscarry at any time during your first trimester and it is most common to miscarry in the first trimester.  I had a miscarriage on September 5th, I was 7 weeks pregnant.  Some signs are bad cramps, back pain, and bleeding, clotting.  Unfortunately, I learned that you don't have to have all those signs to miscarry.  I had no warning, I woke up that day went pee and there was a little blood.  I became really worried and went to ER because I never had any bleeding in my first pregnancy.  The bleeding by that time stopped and they did an ultrasound and couldn't tell because it was early and tested my HcG levels.  They told me some women bleed a little during pregnancy. I went home and later that afternoon I had more bleeding, still no cramps at all.  By Monday morning I was passing very large clots but still no cramps and my HcG levels increased.  Anyways, it was a miscarriage.  So again you can have all the symptoms or just one. If you think you are having a miscarriage, go to your doctor.

You can miscarry anytime during pregnancy, although it's more common in the first trimester.  You can miscarry before you even know you are pregnant.  And may not have any signs at first.  Or period like symptoms very early on.  My friend miscarried at 10 wks. she went in for her first apt and found that the baby had passed a week earlier.  So they did a D and C because It could take up to a month for her body to miscarry the baby.

In addition to what everyone else is saying, studies have indicated that about 50% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, most before the woman ever knew she was pregnant.  The miscarriage could happen so early that her period isn't even late, and for others, they never notice anything be a period that's a little late and MAYBE a little heavier than normal.  But unless they took an HPT and got a positive result, they have no clue they were ever pregnant.



Once pregnancies are detected after 4 to 5 weeks (basically once you've missed you period) there is statistically a 10% - 15% of miscarrige.  Of those, 90% will occur during the 1st trimester (hence the reason miscarriage odds go way down after 10 to 12 weeks).

How do you tell if she really is pregnant?



Aside from waiting to see if she has a baby of course. A girl I slept with on 10/10 w/ protection. Now says she is pregnant. On the 21st she said she had missed her period and was feeling ill. She said she went to the doctor on the 22nd and it was confirmed. On the 26th she said she had already gained 4 pounds. On the 28th she said she had her first ultrasound and was amazed at how small it was. Ok, so I wore protection so the odds are against this, but it can happen, but its pretty unlikely. And is it me or is she having the quickest pregnancy ever? Ultrasound already? Really? and already gaining weight? Cant shake the feeling something is up. Any ideas? Thanks.

how far along does she say that she is?  it sounds to me that it isn't your kid.  most doctors won't do an ultrasound until around 8 weeks and if they do one before that, you won't see anything.  I would definitely question the paternity.  ask to see the sono pics.  tell her you want to see what YOUR baby looks like at 2-3 weeks old.

I'm no doctor but I seriously think she is lieing to you no way would they do an ultrasound at this stage it's just to soon to see anything even remotely resembling a human it would just be a collection of cells just now.
But just wait a few month's and your own eye's will tell you if she is or isn't and if she is I would get a DNA test once it is born just to make sure it is yours as she is possibly just trying to pin her pregnancy on you

Seems a little fishy to me too. I'm 18.5 weeks and haven't had an ultrasound yet. a lot of doctors don't do one until 20 weeks unless they are tryin to check dates of conception or you have had previous pregnancy issues. The weight it hard to go by because everyone is different but 4 pounds within a week of finding out is pretty strange if you ask me. A lot of people don't have symptoms that early on. She could however really be pregnant. I'd had her pee on a test in front of me. and then you can only confirm that she is but not that the child is yours. That you will have to wait until the baby is born to find out. I would still stay in the picture somewhat so that if this baby is yours you won't feel like an *** for not stepping up from the beginning. I wouldn't give her any financial support until the baby is born though.

You usually get an ultra sound when you find out your pregnant its justs a little dot on the screen but usually can't see anything until at least 5-6 weeks.  So if she saw something then its probably not yours b/c she would only be 2 weeks I'd say no.

Hmm That does seem quick having the ultrasound 4 days after being confirmed by the doctor. Did she actually have an ultrasound photo to show you? She shouldn't really be gaining weight that fast early on in the pregnancy.



Ask her if you can go along with her to her next doctors appointment, see what she says. Even better, go to the drug store and buy a pregnancy test and have her take it with you there.  In my opinion though it is a little shady.

You can insist on going with her to see the scan as she cannot fake that.



Also you could buy a home pregnancy test tell her to pee on the HPT in front of you so that she cannot fake the result (positive is positive).



Other than that the only way is to wait and see if she gets a bigger stomach (and yes a pregnant stomach is different to a fat stomach).



Yes it is possible to have an ultrasound early on (I had one at 6 weeks) but you really don't see very much.

Ok, it is very possible that she is pregnant. It is also possible that it's someone else's child. The only reason she would have an ultrasound is to confirm pregnancy, and also to figure out due date. Ask for a picture from the ultrasound. They almost always give the mother a picture. Find out the due date. (If she had an ultrasound, they will have told her the estaimated due date.) Speak to an adult female, and get them to help you work out how far along she is, or if she does show you a picture, it will be written on it. It will say 3/40 for example, which is 3 weeks out of a forty week pregnancy. Hope this helps. Good luck.

She may indeed be pregnant--but most likely not with your child.  It would depend on when she last menstruated.  A strange question to ask a girl, to be sure.  It is possible, though.  Just not likely.  If she was expecting her period on, say the 21st or slightly before, then she could have been ovulating and gotten pregnant on the 10th...but if you used protection?  I guess it depends on what kind of protection you used.  Some are more effective than others.  Not even the pill is 100%, but condoms, foam, gels, etc are even less effective.



Another question would be how effectively did you use the protection?  If you were at all under the influence (maybe had a few beers, etc) you could have made a mistake in applying the protection.



I would have a serious conversation with the girl about this, and make sure she realizes how important it is that if she's pregnant she tells the correct father.  Also tell her that if she's sure the baby is yours, you'll be with her through the pregnancy, but that you are planning on getting a paternity test once the baby is born.  That way if the child is yours, you didn't make the mistake of not being part of the pregnancy and birth.



When the baby is born, you can ask for a paternity test if you are not married at the hospital, and if the test results confirm that the baby isn't yours, she would be responsible for paying for the test.  You can also sign your right to a test away.  If the baby is confirmed as yours, however, you are responsible for paying for the test.



Hope this helps.

I think she's lying. If she is pregnant, she is only around 5 weeks pregnant (they count the weeks from the date of her last period). Most doctors don't give ultrasounds until atleast 8 weeks because you can't really see anything until then. Secondly,the babies not big enough yet for her to start gaining weight. So the only way for you to know for sure is to get proof. If she had an ultrasound, they should have given her a picture, ask to see it. If she doesn't have that, then she should atleast have the paper from the doctor saying that she is pregnant. Good luck. Oh, and if she is pregnant, I'm sure you will step up and take responsibility, right?

If the protection failed, today she'd only be 3 weeks past conception (or about 5 weeks due to doctors using the first day of her last period to date the pregnancy).  I had a scan done at 8 weeks and saw what looked like a jelly bean.  It did not resemble a baby at all at that point and I was 3 weeks farther along than she claims to be!  As for the weight gain, that could be from just about anything!!  I actually lost weight for the first 13-14 weeks of my pregnancy due to morning sickness.



It sounds to me like she is either trying to pin another guy's baby on you or she is trying to trap you in a relationship that perhaps you don't want.  I doubt she is pregnant and if she is, I seriously doubt that it is yours.  If she really is pregnant, demand a paternity test when the baby is born before you agree to giving her child support.

Wow, if she is then it's probably not yours. That is just about the quickest pregnancy turn-around. At 18 days post conception (which is just over 4 weeks pregnant) an ultrasound wouldn't show a whole lot. As a matter of fact, you don't see much but the uterus, not the baby. Ask her if she heard the heart beat. If she did, she is a lot further than she would be if it was yours. You typically can't hear the heart beat until about 9-10 weeks pregnant at the earliest.

this will sound strange but with my first pregnancy the nurses always said to tell them if i had sore calves and i never asked why, now im not sure if im pregnant yet but if i am i would only be 3 weeks if that, today my calves are killing me i dont even want to walk. should i get this checked out? they have never hurt so bad, what does it mean if you get sore calves in pregnancy anyway??

i never had sore calves and i am 8 months right now,  i think you should get it checked out pregnant or not, but maybe they can do a pregnancy test while you are there good luck

About how long after you pass your mucus plug will your water break?



According to the first ultrasound we had done (@25weeks) I am 37 weeks and 2 days pregnant.  For 2 weeks now I have been at 2 cm and 50% but the doctor can feel the baby's head.  The day before yesterday, I went for a walk around our block and that night around 8pm, I passed part of my mucus plug.  Around 8 am yesterday morning, I passed the rest of it.  I was having some spotting and very intense vaginal and abdominal pains yesterday also.  My dad is an EMT and so he has been monitoring my blood pressure.  It was very elevated last night so I just took a warm shower and went to bed.  This morning, we checked it again and it is only slightly elevated but I am still having some spotting and my lower back and tailbone hurt.  At what point should I be concerned enough to go to the doctor?  Should I just wait for my water to break?  I am not having contractions that I know of but I didn't feel most of the contractions with my first son and they had to break my water with him.  Any advice would be appreciated.



</question>



<additional details>



My blood pressure has been normal throughout the entire pregnancy.  120/74 range.  It was the same with my first pregnancy.  Towards the end of my first preg. my blood pressure started to rise (133/88) so my doctor induced at two days later.  I was 38 weeks then.  I never lost my plug with my first pregnancy.  Last night my BP was 131/97.

I'm not so sure the loss of mucus plug is a sign - it can happen in bits and pieces or all at once during the pregnancy within the last few weeks. I lost one with my first after the last internal exam and with the second, I think it was just some here and there. Some women never even really form one, so it's different for everyone.



I would be more concerned about your BP and it's great that your dad can monitor you. Has your doctor been concerned about it throughout your pg? SOmetimes labor can start with contractions and no water breaking; sometimes the water just breaks and they start, and sometimes it breaks and nothing happens. Once your water does break though, you should head to the hospital at least within 24 hours due to the elevated risk of infection.

CALL THE DOCTOR NOW!!  I had back labor with both of my kids....lower back and tailbone pain.  That baby can come anytime.  I don't recall my mucus plug ever passing...but I do remember this.  My daughter was 6 weeks early.  My water broke at around midnite.  I drove myself to the hospital (convinced they'd send me home) and by the time I got there I was in full blown labor.  Oh...did I mention that the hospital for me was only about 15 minutes away?  Then they had to take me by ambulance to another hospital that could care for a preemie.  That was about 1/2 an hour.  The emt and nurse on board thought I was going to deliver in the ambulance.  K...long story short....water broke at around midnite....baby arrived at 4am.  4 hours from nothing to baby.  My son, 21 hours of labor and 3 spent pushing.  Yes....one extreme to the next.  Please CALL YER DOCTOR!

Labor varies from woman to woman.  we are all different, so call your doc please!  The plug can release at anytime near delivery date, just means that you are getting closer.



Call your doc, if you want to be sure, or go to the ER. Labor can come at any time now, and it can come faster now that you have already had a child.



Good luck! and congratulations!

It could still be a while.  I lost my plug and then went into labour about 10 days after and I had to have my water broken.  If you are concerned I could call your doctor but from what I'm reading it doesn't sound like you are going to have a baby for a bit yet.  All the best!

I am 24 years old. I am already the mother of a two year old and the pregnancy test i took with her was positive the first try. I am late on my perios and have some symptoms of pregnancy.

Well 24 weeks would be exactly at the 6 month mark. And according to your LMP (last menstrual period) you would be closer to 26 weeks.



I just did a due date ticker thing online to see how far you would be according to your period and it said 25 weeks 3 days pregnant. So according to that you would be 6 months a week and 3 days pregnant.

Either way you choose it is not going to be easy. An abortion does not just make the problem go away. It can haunt you for a long time. You will always wonder....what if. Then when you choose to have your first child you could experiance extreme feelings of guilt. I am only saying this because I read you say you were against it. And what about abortion do you disagree with? Do you disagree with people having them in general, but it is ok for you? You need to think this through. Talk to your parents, your x, and planned parenthood. But at ten weeks you dont have much time....the baby already has arms and legs. I think you might regret it seeing how you have already stated that you are against it. You can still have a good life even if you have a baby this young. Good luck on what ever you decide

Get an abortion and dont listen to these people telling you its wrong and its murder - ITS NOT!!!



Its your life and you will live it how you want. You are only 17, this baby is not just a pregnancy thing - Its for the rest of your life and you will want to give it the best up bringing you can! Your not going to do that (no offence) at 17 - Im 20 and i know i would be an awful father just now.



Bet get an abortion - You dont need to tell your ex and your boyfriend now. Dont beat yourself up about this and go on the pill - Its safer for all of you!

I got pregnant with my daughter about a month before my 17th birthday when I was a senior in high school. There was never a doubt in my mind that I was going to have her and raise her... Kennedy was born on November 4, 2005, when I was 17 1/2.



I wasn't planning on getting pregnant at 16, but it happened and I'm so glad it did... My daughter is my everything and I couldn't imagine life without my little angel!!! Sure, my life is totally different than what I had foreseen, but it is also so much better! My little girl is happy, healthy and smart and I know I am doing everything right! It's not always easy being a teen parent, but at the same time it's not easy being a parent at all...



If I were in your shoes, I would tell both the father and your new boyfriend, as well as your parents and I would keep the baby. But again, that's just me...

I would have the baby. I would let my ex and the new man know what's going on. If your ex decides to step up and take responsibility, great. If the new man decides to leave you, then it just wasn't meant to be. This situation could turn out a number of different ways. Your ex may decide he doesn't want to be a father and the new man may decide to step up and take responsibility for the child. Either way, this is not going to be easy. The longer you wait, the harder it will be for you. Please don't have an abortion. I'm not 100% against abortions because I believe that certain situations arise in a woman's life where this is the only choice, like in a case of rape or incest. But you had unprotected sex voluntarily and you knew what could happen and you decided to take that chance. At 10 weeks this baby already has a heartbeat, eyes, and ears. I had an abortion at 17 (I'm 23 and married now) then a miscarriage last month. I now realize how precious childbearing is and how blessed we are to be able to carry a baby. I'm  pregnant now again and I pray everyday that nothing goes wrong with my baby. I regret the miscarriage I had when I was young, dumb, and felt like my situation was too complicated to handle. God bless you and I hope you make the right decision.

To have an abortion would have to be entirely your decision, I don't know you but it doesn't sound like this would be a decision you would be happy with -you are already calling it your baby hon, I don't know if it'll be the right option for you it won't be easy and doing it without your partners support will be a huge strain.



Why do you think this is the best thing for the baby? Given that you are considering all options you sound mature and sensible why can't you be a mum?

Whichever path you choose, it's going to hurt, no matter how you sort it out. If I was you, I'd talk to your ex and see what his view is. I'd also talk to your new man, and see what his view is. But remember, no matter what they say or want you to do, you don't have to do it.
Also, talk to your parents or anyone else in your family that you can trust, maybe your sister,  as you're so young. Find out who would be willing to help and support you if you do decide to keep the baby.
From there on, it's your choice. Think about the current place you live in, the amount of money you have, if you'd be willing to give up Friday nights down at the club for your baby. I personally disagree with abortions, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. It depends on the conditions that the baby will be living with.
Having an abortion can haunt you for years, (not trying to put you off) but sometimes it's the best you can do. I had my youngest around your age, and she's five now, and I don't regret keeping her, but you might.
I wish you the best, don't let anyone force you into anything you don't want to do.

Don't abort, whatever you do. You are against it, you know it is a baby you are carrying....don't do it. You will regret it. What's best for your baby is not to die a grim death, hun, I promise.



You've made a mistake, and you have a chance to change and fix it. You can either step up and raise this baby and be the best mom you can be, or you can give it up for adoption to a loving couple who will care for it. But don't abort. It won't make things better.



You need to tell your new boyfriend that you're carrying your ex's baby, and then you have to tell your ex. He deserves to know - it is his child too. But first, tell your family - you will need their love and support. They may be upset at first, but give them time and they will come around.



You can do this. It's going to be hard, but you can do it!

before you resort to something as drastic as abortion, wouldn't it just be easier to tell your new boyfriend and ex (especially him).  you have obviously moved on and it's really none of your ex's business about the new man, but he does deserve the right to know you're carrying his child.



and i'm totally flabbergasted by you saying "i've got to think about whats best for my baby".  having an abortion is best for your baby?  i don't think so. that's what is best for you without any regards to the baby.

I never thought I would ever get an abortion until I fell pregnant at 15 and I knew it was something I had to do. I was really sad at first, but 2 years later, I am sooooo glad I dont have a 1 year old to that idiot of a boyfriend I use to date. My mum told me that a baby doesnt get a soul until you give birth :) I like to think of that as true. I dont beleive my baby is dead, Just on hold for a couple of years, waiting until I find the perfect person to be his/her dad and that I will be old enough to give baby the best life. :)



I hope u make the right decision. xxxx

Well, if I were in your situation, I would keep the baby, I do not believe in ending the life of any person, or animal for that matter, tell both your ex, and your current bf, it is best that they both know, you have to stick with your morals, and do what is best for you, an abortion can be very hard, both mentally and physically, it can do quite abit of dammage, now, i cannot make the decision for you, it is up to you, but, be sure that you think it out carefully, and remember, if you don't want to have an abortion, but do not want to keep the baby, there are people out there who would love to adopt him or her.  relax, and think this out, good luck, and remember, nobody can tell you what to do, it is your choice.

Well firstly, You should tell your ex & not just decide what you yourself wants to do, let him tell you about what he thinks about it aswell, talk it through with him and decide together because it is his child aswell. Tell your new man that your pregnant with your ex's child, maybe he will support you? Just get it out in the open, dont tell your family until you have talked it through with your ex, then you can tell your family your decision.



Good luck, Im sure everything will be okay, I wouldnt personally abort it because like the person above said, its not your childs fault.

You think what's best for your baby is to kill it?  Or is that what's best for you because you've found yourself in this awkward situation?



If you really want to think about what's best for your baby, why don't you give it up for adoption?  Give it a chance to live with a family who would truly want and love it.

I am 21. I am a little older than you but I am almost 19 weeks preggo. Had I gotten pregnant when I was 17 I would have definetly kept the baby and would not have thought twice about it. I am still with the father but we are not married. In life, things are going to come up and you just have to take them as they come. Babies are the most precious gift of all, even if they are by total accident. Please don't get an abortion. If you feel you are unable to care for the child there is always adoption. Think about it. I'm sure you'd be a great young mommy.

Safe dosage of tylenol during pregnancy?



I am 31 weeks pregnant. A few days ago, I suddenly developed severe lower back pain which is preventing me from doing anything (sitting, walking, going to work) without dissolving into tears. I called my doctor and she recommended ice, the belly belt, and Tylenol. When I asked her what a safe dosage would be, she said to take 2 pills 2 times per day. Here's the problem- my husband has been to several drugstores and no one sells regular Tylenol; it is all extra strength. I looked up the milligrams and regular Tylenol has 325 mg/pill while extra strength has 500 mg/pill. With the dosage she recommended, that would put me at 1300 mg/day for regular Tylenol. I'm trying to figure out if I can take 3 extra strength spread out through the day, which would put me at 1500 mg, only my doctor's office is closed today through Monday. Has anyone spoken to the doctor about this that can pass along some info? Also, anyone know how many days in a row I can take this safely? The dr. told me "only as long as you need it" but I am afraid that will be for awhile. Thank you so much.



</question>



<additional details>



To clarify, she said 2 pills 2 times per day (not 2 total.) I would much rather take nothing at all, but at this point the pain is absolutely horrific so I'm afraid I need it for the moment. Thank you for the suggestion about the generic- that is a great idea!!

extra strength is regular Tylenol and is perfectly safe during pregnancy. You can take the regular dosage it says on the bottle and you and baby will be fine. Good luck and don't worry!

So she recommended 2 325 mg pills.  That's 650mg.



Try one 500mg tablet and see if that works.  If it isn't enough, cut a 500 mg into quarters (125 mg per quarter) and take 1 500 mg and 1 of the quarters for a total of 625mg.



The absolutely safe amount?  Zero.



Tylenol is very tough on the liver, but not usually a problem at this low a dosage.



I recommend considering accupuncture for the back pain.  No drugs and very effective.

Extra strength is ok, that's what I take. But what I do is take 1 to see if it eases the pain. If not I take another in about an hour. I have taken 2 at a time before though, my doctor said it's ok.

I guess every doctor is different.  Mine has said that 5 a day (500mg each) is fine, but not to take any more than that.  I have been having extreme back pain in the middle of the night since I was 20 weeks which doesn't let me get back to sleep and he has said that the three I treat it with plus 2 Tylenol PM before bed are fine.



I manage to not do the 5 very often, if ever and many days lately have not even needed any but I think it is good to know the "safe" zone so you don't have to worry.

Well it could be from implantation or your period coming only starting off light. I would take a test today to see and if it is positive then it from pregnancy, you shouldn't worry though if it is just spotting. If it is accompanied by pain and it gets a lot heavier go to the E.R. If your test is negative then it is probably just your period only it is lighter. Good luck!!!

This could be implantation bleeding. I went through the same thing and assumed it meant I wasn't pregnant, so I was very surprised to find out that I was. What I would do if I were you is go out right away and buy a home pregnancy test. Try one of the ones that says it will detect pregnancy up to 5 days before your missed period, because I think those may be a little more sensitive to HCG, the hormone that is present when you're pregnant. Good luck!

Your baby is fine... they also say that if you're a little overweight, it could be hard to feel the baby until you're further along. 5 months, the baby is still wittle bitty =)

I have been reading a lot about this. I am about 20 weeks and felt the baby kicking a lot for a couple weeks,then yesterday I didn't feel anything. Everything says that this is normal. Until you get to the end of your 2nd trimester and in to your third, you probably won't feel consistent movement. Mention it to your dr. and make sure though.

Yes, that is normal- don't worry a thing about it =). This is my first pregnancy and I didn't feel any flutters (let alone kicks) until 22 weeks. From then on, they would happen a couple times per week, but they definitely didn't happen every day. I asked the doctor about it, and it turned out that I have an anterior placenta, meaning that the placenta is facing the front of my uterus instead of the back. The doctor said this happens in about 10% of pregnancies, and while completely harmless, will cause you to feel the baby's movements later and less strongly than moms whose placenta is located toward the back. The mom's weight is supposed to be another factor, but I am average weight and I still didn't feel it too early on. Now, at 31 weeks, she's much more regular and I can feel definite "awake" periods, although the movement is stronger some days than others. Ask your doctor, but I think she will tell you what you're experiencing is pretty normal at this point. Good luck!

Please don't worry! It could be that your placenta is on the front of your uterus, which cushions any movement. Otherwise first time mums usually feel movement later than 2nd or 3rd time mums. Maybe try having a drink of orange juice or something and lay down in bed in the quiet and just rub your belly for a while. You might get a kick or something. Sounds weird but a midwife told me to do that and it worked for me. But other than that id say in the next couple of weeks you will definitely start to feel it.

flutters are normal right now i didn't feel the real 'kicks' until are 24 weeks but i am a heavier person, the more padding there the harder to feel. you should call your doctor and ask just to be on the safe side, he may tell you to wait a week and then check in again

Those flutters that you felt were the baby. I remember with my first child I felt flutters at around 20 weeks and I didn't know that it was my baby moving.  Then with my second child I felt flutters in my 16th week and I knew it was the baby. Some people feel their baby move at different times.  My theory is that it also has to do with how big the baby is.  My first baby was born at 6'4, but my second baby was born at 8'4 and they could tell at about 8 months that I was going to have a big baby just because of where the feet were.  You are just fine!

Perfectly normal.



First pregnancy, you get the flutters between 18 and 24 weeks normally.



Subsequent pregnancies it's more 16 plus weeks, although some have reported earlier.



You're about due for you're 20 scan about now?

Absolutly.  Clearish-white thin sticky discharge is perfectly normal, sometimes in large amounts, for some women they have so much they may even wear a panty-liner.  But there should be no vaginal irritation, itchiness or foul odor, or that could mean infection!

Something weird is going on here, is this normal?



Hello.



First off I am on the pill (have been past 2 years but 3 months ago got on a new generic kind) and never missed a day. I also take calcium and potassium with it each morning, could that effect the pill?
Second, I'm on the end of the second pill week.  For a few days now my boobs have been aching and (not to be out there but) my nipples have been killing me. This morning in the shower I started bleeding that brown blood and I have all the symptoms of my period, but I had my period two weeks ago. I'm still on the pill and everything but I'm worried I may be pregnant?



I've never had a random period in 2 years while being on the pill so I'm a little nervous. Any ideas? Thank you so much!



-Also, I am old enough to have a baby, I'm just not ready to have one. In case someone wanted to yell at me for age or something.

I would either call your doctor or get an over the counter pregnancy test.  They aren't expensive, but they are effective.  It is possible to become pregnant on the pill--I did, and I took my pill like clockwork!



Switching pills may have opened a window of opportunity there, too.  I got pregnant when I went on a slightly lower dose pill, since I was having such a terrible reaction to my other higher dose pill.

the chances are very high that is the point where you are most fertile is before and after your period, but if you took the day after pill it will probably work right. just relax and wait to see what happens

If her period just finished, there is a pretty low chance that she will get pregnant because she just expelled all of the lining that the baby would implant it. Since she also took the morning after pill, it is kind of a moot point though.

Morning after pill is highly effective if used within 72 hours of unprotected sex.  Not to mention the chances of conceiving the day after her cycle would be almost impossible.....She would have to ovulate (release an egg) in order to get pregnant which usually happens around 14 days after the start of her period.  I think your in the clear.

A woman is NOT most fertile after her period---some of these responses are incorrect.



You are less likely to conceive the day after your period because a woman's body usually doesn't release an egg until days later. BUT it is possible. Sperm can live a few days and if the egg is released early....



If she took the morning-after pill then I would think it is darn near impossible.

the morning after pill will work but the fact that she had her period already she should be good
but don't always rely on the morning after.
that should only be used for extreme case's .
the other fact you need to worry about now is the condom broke
and you just open other doors.
but for now on use spermicide's and she should be on the pill
also be sure nether has STDS
good luck and next time be more careful
always have a back up.



I only had wish the morning after pill was there years ago but I love my kids.

Trying to get pregnant...rubella?



My hubby and I are thinking about trying for a baby. I went to the doctor over the summer and she said that before I even consider trying that I have to go get blood work done to see if I am immune to rubella. I know I had the shot years ago when I was a kid. Is this something everyone has to do or is this a new thing? She said that if it turns out that I am no longer immune that I will have to get the shot and then wait three months to try because it is a live vaccine. I feel like I would be more nervous about accidentally getting pregnant around the time of the shot than I would about contracting rubella. If I ignore the doctor's advice then I'm afraid she will judge me and think I'm irresponsible. Should I just do it? I'm kinda wary of doctors/pharmaceutical companies, etc.



Sorry if this posted twice but it didn't show up the first time?

This never occurred to me when I got pregnant, and my husband didn't either. I had gotten the shots as a kid!  At my first appointment after pregnancy, they tested me for the rubella vaccine, and I wasn't immune!  It was such a surprise.  They couldn't give me the vaccine as I was already pregnant.



I did receive the vaccine after I had the baby, and I was told by the OB's nurse that some people have natural resistance to the vaccine, and that I would never have to receive the shot again in the future, because now either I am immune or I am not immune because it wouldn't take and it would never take if that was the case.

Thx for all ur answers!  I don't really have a fear of docs, I just think the industry as a whole seems to push meds on ppl.  I've heard if u are resistent to the vaccine, no matter how many times they give it to u, u will always be resistant so what's the point? I'll get the test though to be safe.

I had the same problem and found out the vaccine needs to be re-administered to those who received it prior to 1980. I think mine was done in 1979. So that probably explains why so many of us had to have another shot.

First of all, go get the blood test done that tells your immunity. if you are "immune" then you don't even have to wait to TTC, but if you are not immune then you can make a decision then. Chances are that you are immune, but contracting rubella during pregnancy can cause miscarriage or severe birth defects. This test is often done at the first prenatal visit, but nothing can be done about it once pregnant except avoiding sick people (who might have it) & getting revaccinated after delivery

Well, I can't speak for you doctor, however I fell pregnant, not knowing that I too was not immune from Rubella anymore.



Little man came out A. OK, but I was lucky. I had no idea about not having immunity until I was actually pregnant.
I was told to avoid people with German measles like the plague!



If it weighs on your mind, I'd get the test! I wouldn't have risked it if I knew for sure I wasn't immune!

Your doctor is correct, that's the same information I was given.  I would just get tested for it and then take it from there.  More than likely you are FINE if you've already been vaccinated, so you won't even have to worry about it.  If, on the off chance, it turns out that you aren't immune... well, three months is not a long time to wait.  You will just have to be diligent about your birth control during that time.



Since you mentioned that you two are "thinking about trying" it sounds like you can make the most of the three months if you need to.  Have LOTS of time together - go out to dinners, take a trip, enjoy yourselves as a couple and do a few things that you've always wanted to do before having a baby.



Again, more than likely, you'll test fine.



Best of luck.

If you're going to have a baby, you're going to have to get over your fear of doctors.



Even if you use a midwife to help you deliver your baby, a midwife can't operate to reattach a broken growth plate on your child's elbow after she falls from the monkey bars, as mine did.  You'll need to trust a doctor to do that, and then again when it's time to operate to remove the wiring that kept it in place for 11 weeks.



Here are the risks:
*** If you don't have the test, and your immune system is no longer strong against rubella, and you come across it while you are newly pregnant, you could miscarry or your baby could be born deaf.



Odds of having a miscarriage?  Who knows?



Odds of having a deaf baby?  Not high.



But why take the chance on either one when you can be certain to prevent it altogether?

Why do you need to be induced only 2 days after your due date?  Most doctors will let a woman go 2 WEEKS past her due date before inducing, unless there is a pressing medical reason why the baby shouldn't stay in there longer.



You have every right to ask for, accept or refuse ay procedure.  Just know that inductions have a 40% higher rate of failing and leading to c-section than allowing your body to go into labor naturally.



If they break your water and your body isn't quite ready for labor, it most likely won't do much.  It will, however, increase your risk of infection.  It will also make the doctors watch the clock and if you don't progress within several hours, they WILL send you in for c-section because then it becomes an "emergency".



If they give you pitocin through an IV and you are not already amply effaced and dilated, you also may not progress and the same scenario will happen.  The contractions wtih pitocin are much stronger and are more likely to send your fetus into distress.



I hope that you ask these questions of your doctor - mostly 'Why do you want to induce me so soon?'



Best of luck!

What is wrong with me???? I feel like giving up?????



am pregnant with our 5th child......a little confusing but i will try to explain. I am 25 yo and my husband is 27, we have a son who is 4, well about 3 1/2 years ago we got a call from my mother that DSS took my 3 youngest brothers into foster care and she needed us to take them....we did~ they had always been back and forth with us anyway. Well my mom wont even pay any child support, wont come to see them (she lives 15 min away), but thats besides the point. I guess my question is: I feel like i am an awful parent....i am constantly snapping at the boys and i just feel like i dont even know what i am doing anymore:-( The two oldest boys are 18 and 16, they still attend high school and live here with us, latley it seems like they have been doing everything they can to "challenge" me and turn me and my husband against eachother, i try so hard b/c they have never really had some one to care for them but i am at the end of my rope. My other brother (9 yo) is a very sweet boy but i am having problems with him doing things for himself...tie shoes, clean up messes etc, not very easy for a woman who is 8 months along. I just feel like things are falling apart, this am i yelled at my 9 yo and 4 yo, they wouldnt get ready for school, and i feel like sh***t.........i am so sorry to vent, i just dont know what to do anymore, and now with a baby coming, how will i have time to deal with everything? I am so thankful for all of my boys, they are truly mine and i love them as my own, i dont want them to feel otherwise, i am just lost~~~~~Sorry so long, any comments appreciated. GOD BLESS~~~

There is nothing wrong with you.  Raising teenagers is difficult in itself.  Then add the pregnancy hormones plus a 9 yr old and a 4 yr old.  Only advice I can give you is see if there is any help you can get from the school.  Keeping the older one's engaged in something.  And most importantly a lot of prayer.  Good luck hun, I feel for you.  I'll keep you and your family in my prayers

good luck i would probably have killed them all by now.  just try to worry about you and your baby and not them stress isn't good right now and you already know that.  try to get the 18 and 16 year old to grow up and help out.  they are not kids anymore they should be doing your chores and if they have a job pay somebills.  i had a job at 17 and helped with the phone bill since i wanted my own phone line and stuff like that.  don't feel bad about yelling at the other boys, they can tell you are stressed.  maybe they can help out around there too.  the older boys may not participate but you should try a game night to get everyone back on board with family time and to help everyone get along with each other.  and maybe you should call your mother who dropped the kids off and don't visit that she needs to grow up as well and help out some.  lol

Oh, honey. First, let me say that I commend you and your husband for taking in your younger brothers. Raising teenagers isn't easy. Your brothers have probably gone through a traumatic childhood so it's going to be hard for them to adjust. All you can do is pray, try to be the best mom you can to them, and encourage them to go to college after high school. Once, they're 18, they're grown men and they should find there own way. It's not much you can do for them as far as molding them. The 9 year old, all you need to do is teach him responsibility. Make sure he understands that you won't be able to do everything for him and make him do things himself. Any quiet time you have, please spend it with your husband. .

Oh sweetie...you sound like you are doing it tough right now!!!  remember you are pregnant and your hormones are all over the place!!!  You are trying to handle pregnancy and teenage boys which is so difficult at the best of times!!!  can you reach out to any other family members, maybe an aunt or cousin that can get them out of the house every now and then and let you have some relaxing time?



you have so many kids there and you have so much pressure and it woudl be just so so hard to deal with!!!!



you really need to pick your battles though...make sure that f you feel like you are getting worked up about something with yoru little ones just stop for a minute take a breath and think to yourself if you really need to get angry at that moment!!!



i really think you need some outside help though if the older boys are not helping out!!!



i woudl have a family meeting and be firm!!!!
set some ground rules, set chores, aand of no one follows these rules then there will be concequences!!!  remind the boys that they will be split up and living with random people if your situation doesnt resolve!!!



have a weekly meeting with them all and maybe have individule meeting with each!!!  if their behaviour improves reward them with things like going ot the movies or a footy match or a treat, jsut to show them you appreciate the help!!!



it may be a good start!!!



I really feel for you, I just hop you can reach out to someone for help!  take care and good luck!

Well technically you are not responsible for the 18 year old. If he does not respect the rules in your home, he can go find someplace else to live. All 16 year olds are challenging. You need to sit down with him and explain to him that you do not have to raise him, you are doing it so he will not be sent to a home with strangers who knows where and he needs to have respect for you and your household. Cut the 9 year old some slack. You need to be patient with him. If he doesn't tie his shoes, he goes to school with his shoes untied. But don't yell at him. Just simply let him know that it is his duty to tie his shoes and you will not do it for him. Don't give him the option not to clean his messes. Make him sit down next to the mess and don't let him move until it is cleaned up. Teach your 4 year old to do the same. Don't let the kids run the household, but learn to have a little patience.

Ohh you are soo sweet. First of all, you are an angel for taking care of your brothers while pregnant.



Remember that teenage years are very difficult to deal with... I'm sorry that you feel guilty about yelling at the boys. The nine year old may feel neglected because you are turning all the atention to the older brothers and the younger one... so if the 9 year old is expected to do what he needs to do, he will be prone to be more forgetful than the other ones.



I will tell you what works for my family: for my 10 year old son (who tends to "forget" common basis personal tasks)  is to give him a Checklist. It works. I have an AM list and a PM list... he's old enough to get ready so all I have to do is to drop him off in daycare and all I have to say in the morniong is to remind him of the "checklist" The checklist includes basic tasks such as making his bed, brush his teeth, put his homework in the backpack etc.) Believe it or not, kids his age enjoy having responsabilities. PRAISE him when completing the tasks every day... this checklist has save me a lot of time and has kept me sane.



As far as your teenager brothers... my advice is for your husband to talk to him man to man. The 18 year old will be out of yoru house soon and make sure he understand that he needs to get a job, join the military etc. etc. because the free ride ends when he graduates from HS. If he decides to stay, then tell him that he will be paying rent. I know this sounds harshm but he is an adult. As far a sthe other teenager, make sure that your husband TALKS to him --- man-to-man. When I talk to my 10 year old son it seems like he is not listening to me... but my husbands talks to him like a man and he complies immedietly... my husband never screams or yells at him...he simply talks to him like an adult and my son responds instanteneoulsy. Also, it seems like your brothers are bored and are getting on your nerves to entretain themselves... may I suggest a project! can they build a fence? Join the YMCA or the Boys and Girls Club...they have age appropriate activities for teens in a positive enviroment (they have a scholarship program for families in your situation)  let them join a SPORT league, learn to play the guitar...something where they can challenge their energy and keeps their minds occupied. If they are still more than you can handle, it's ok to ask for the help of social services. Tell them that yoru two older brother will have to go temporarly or permanently while you deliver and have a newborn. I know this is harsh, but it's better than to lose yoru mind. Make sure that your brthers are calmy inform that if they do not shape up by X day, they will be going to a foster home and make them know that they will be a baby in the house and that they can choose to help or move out. Reassure them that you love them and that you really want to make things work, but that you cannot do this alone without their cooperation. I'm sure that your brothers have suffered enough too  and that treats are not working anymore. **hugs for everyone**



Good luck in your pregnancy and I hope everything goes well..

As an older sister myself, I think the issues you're having with your brothers-18 and 16- are completely normal.  They don't want to listen because you're their sister, they know how far they can push you, and they're teenagers.  I think God makes teenagers somewhat irritating so you're ready for them to leave when it's time.  lol.  If I were you, I would get the 18 and 16 year old to sit down with you and your husband and talk to them like the adults they're about to be.  Tell them what they're doing that's bothering you, how you expect them to help, etc.



As for the 9 yo, I would talk to him too, but be encouraging.  When he wants you to do something for him, remind him that he needs to be learning to do things himself.  Maybe you could even encourage him to help the 4 yo as they say "teaching is the best way to learn."



One last thing, the pregnancy hormones-whether you realize it or not-are playing a huge part in all of this.  They're making you more irritable and easily annoyed.  I've been pregnant five times myself and by the end, I'm so sure everyone is walking around doing the most annoying things just to get on my nerves. lol.  By the time you're done being pregnant and have the new baby, you'll feel so much better and things will likely calm down a bit.



Good luck with it all!  I'll be praying for you!  I hope this helped!

I have seen a similar situation in a friend's family.  They took in three nephews after their parents (the wife's sister and the sister's husband) both died.



I think that what was going on psychologically is that those boys were still unsure they would be unconditionally loved and accepted.  So they began testing to see how far this "love" and "acceptance" really went.  In other words, they had to find the breaking point where their new family would throw up their hands and say, "That's it!  We can't deal with your behavior any longer!  You're going to have to go to some other place!"  What they failed to realize was that it was their aunt and uncle who were breaking.  Their aunt really does love them and is still committed to keeping them.



But she has become ill with cancer, and their marriage has come very close to falling apart from all the stress.



The best way out of your situation, I think, would be to consult a professional psychologist specializing in issues with children and adolescents (not merely a "counselor").  He or she would be in a position to explain to all the boys, in words of one syllable, what their behavior is actually doing, and what consequences could follow.



You have the right to send your brothers into another foster care situation, if it's crucial to do so to save your health, your sanity, and your own family.  You had this problem wished on you -- you did nothing to make it happen.  You could still keep in touch with them and see them when you wished.



Certainly you love them.  They're your own brothers, after all.  But if their behavior keeps getting worse and worse, it will tear your family apart, while they get to act out all their psychological hangups.

Has anyone used/or have a Sonotrax-A Fetal Doppler?



My partner and I have just purchased one today. I think is the same as the one my midwife uses to check the babies heartbeat, it looks identical. When I last heard babies heartbeat it was a few weeks ago, I was about 13 weeks in my pregnancy and she found the heartbeat straight away.
Just wanted to know if this particular one is any good. I have read up on sites and the "Angelsounds" had fab reviews, but I fancied this as it had more features.

Condom broke during sex, a week after her period. Chances of getting pregnant?



So this is the last time I buy the thin condoms. My girlfriend started her period on the 24th (bleeding stopped 27-28th i think) and we had the condom break on the 30th. We had something similar happen a month ago and it turned out she wasn't pregnant, but just wondering how the chances are with this time frame.

too early to tell right now, you are gonna have to wait and see. but it is possible to get pregnant anytime. maybe she should go on birth control and still use condoms that way if they break you won't have to worry as much. better safe than sorry

the chances are high; the most fertile time is after the period. So my suggestion to you if your not married to her and not ready to be a daddy then don't have sex.

your girlfriends most fertile time would be 2 weeks from the day she started her period. if you have sex then, you have a 20-30% chance of her being pregnant. just try not to worry, and take a test in a couple weeks.

It is hard to say. Usually girls don't ovulate until about 14 days after the day their period starts, but that can vary - so don't count on that. Also, sperm can live in a girl for up to a week, so it is possible that she could be pregnant. There isn't a terribly high chance - even couples that are trying to get pregnant only have about a 20% chance of conceiving every month. But, there is a chance. For now, just try and relax and help her relax (stress can delay a period even if she's not pregnant). If her period is late in November, buy her a test.
Most likely she's not pregnant, but try to be more careful especially since this isn't the first time this has happened.

29 Weeks with very frequent Braxton Hicks Contractions?



How normal is it to get many braxton hicks contractions at this point in pregnancy? For the last 2 days, Ive been getting these contractions very,very often. Yesterday, they came consistantly for like an hour. Theyve been on and off ever since last night. Is this normal?

braxton hicks contractions are normal after 25 weeks until labor, but if you have them for more than 4 times and hour you need to call your doctor and make sure everything is ok, they shouldn't be too frequent.  he may give you tips on how to keep them down to a min, like walking when they come around until they go away, or relaxing in a warm bathtub ( not hot )

I've read in my books that more than 4 in an hour are cause for concern (ie: pre-term labour)



I'd check with your doc. Take it easy. What works for one woman - doesn't work for the other! I'm almost 27 weeks and CANNOT walk while I have one - I need to sit or lie down. Some women can "walk them off"
To be safe - i'd check with doc - never be afraid to check with your doc - this is your child!!! but if it's been on going for 2 days and not letting up after relaxing - I'd get checked. They'll be able to tell you in Labour and Delivery wether they are real or not - with those handy little moniters they have.
Best of luck

You are meant to get BH at this point for sure. If you get them often make sure you are not dehydrated. Drink a few cups of water, 3-6 I would say, lay on your left side and see how you feel. You should tell your doctor though. I find the water and rest makes a huge difference for me, hopefully it does for you too.



Good Luck =)

I've been having them frequently since 22 weeks. My doctor gave me a guideline. If I have 6+ an hour with increasing intensity I need to call. That was after I kept calling and going to L&D because I was having 4+ an hour (sometimes 10+ an hour). I told them I was going crazy - because each time it was a false alarm. The doctor said some women frequently get them (I was diagnosed with an irritable uterus). So, the rule for her is if they do not increase in intensity they are false contractions - not real ones. So, I've gone by that rule and it's worked out. Kept me from visiting the hospital so frequently.



But, since you are just beginning to experience this and they have not done any tests (like they did on me - I had a cervical exam, I was on a fetal monitor and had a fetal fibronectin test) I would call your doctor to be on the safe side.

I"m not sure why you think the discharge you're having would be related to pregnancy, but the other symptoms (abd pain & breast tenderness) can indicate pregnancy or pms.  Having a vaginal discharge and abdominal pains can indicate an infection as well.  Seven days from conception to actual pregnancy symptoms is stretching it a bit, it usually takes longer for that (remember conception actually takes place in the falliopian tube and it takes several days just for the ovum to reach the uterus, then longer yet to implant in the uterine wall, and the hormone changes are gradual).  I'd have the discharge checked out to make sure it's not an infection and if you miss your period & the breast tenderness continues & becomes more noticeable, you might be pregnant.  You'd have to take a test to be sure.

Most every pregnant woman has that problem in the first trimester. There's no fix for it except time because the baby has to leach your energy until the placenta develops and takes over supporting him/her around the end of the 1st.

If I take my prenatal vitamins like I am supposed to and drink lots of fluids and don't lay around an extreme amount I found that I had more energy.  I am 30 weeks now and I will have my bouts of tiredness, pregnancy is only 40-42 weeks long at least it doesn't last forever!  Good Luck!

In my first trimester I was very exhausted and spent most of the time in my bed. Not only was I exhausted, I was very sick. I had all day sickness! And so I had to keep a bucket by my bed at all times because I would seriously open my eyes and feel the need to throw up. Everything got better for me at the ending of the first trimester (12 weeks). I've felt very energetic throughout this second trimester.. I'll be going on my third in 2 weeks and a few days.

I am 24 years old. I am already the mother of a two year old and the pregnancy test i took with her was positive the first try. I am late on my perios and have some symptoms of pregnancy. I have taken two pregnancy tests which were both negative. What should I do? Could they just be false negatives?

They could very well be false negatives if your body isn't producing enough HCG yet, which I'm sure you know.  It depends how late you are.



If you're more than a week late for your period and still having negative HPTs, try again in a few days.  If the final test comes back negative, chances are you aren't pregnant.



Either way, test again in a few days to be sure.  A blood test with your doctor would be the most accurate way to find out, but since you're already a mother, I'm sure you know that too.



Best of luck, I hope your dreams come true!!

Yes it is possible for you to get a false test and still be pregnant.  Some tests are not as sensitive as others.  The early predictor tests require the least amount of HCG to come up positive.  Wait 2 more days and test first thing in the morning with an early predictor test.  I personally like First Response, but everyone has their own brand they go to.  Let us know what happens!

It's not likely they are inaccurate, but you can go to your doctor and have them do a blood test. Those are more accurate than urine tests and can pick up a smaller trace of HCG.

38 weeks pregnant... water break?



I am 38 weeks pregnant with my second child. This morning I was laying in bed and I don't know if I peed the bed or if my water broke a little. I got up and went to the bathroom.. still had to pee.. and then layed back down in bed. I had about 2 contractions in that time. Awhile after I layed back down a little more came out. Now I'm up and about, but I haven't really been having contractions. In your opinons/experiences, do you think my water may have started to break or do you think I just may have wet the bed?! Yes, I do have a pantyliner on to watch. And yes I have tried calling the nurses at my clinic, but they are so busy they took down my name & number to call me back. By the way, as of Tue. I was 1-2 cm. dilated, a little effaced (I don't remember how much), my cervix was very soft and the baby was really low. Thanks!

Sounds like it may have.  If the nurses don't call you back within a few hours, you should take your bag & head to L&D.  If your water has broken, you need to deliver within 24 hours to reduce the risk of infection.  They will test the fluid at the hospital to see if it is indeed amniotic fluid, and then they will induce you.  Good luck!

If it was your water it will continue to leak, so keep an eye on it.  I would go ahead and start preparing if you have not already done so.  Getting your bag ready, taking a shower, and getting something to eat.

It does sound like your has broken and the reason you aren't leaking when your up moving around is probably because the babies head is blocking the opening in your cervix... that's what happened to me

Your water probably did break!  Some women can go hours without having serious contractions.  However I wouldn't wait until then because if you wait too long there's a chance you will pass your window for your epidural. I would wash up and go in to the hospital.  Congrats!

yes your water broke there's no way you can pee your self go to the bathroom then pee yourself again. you should go the the hospital asap, don't wait wait for someone to call you back because you can catch an infection or end up giving birth and something could go wrong get yourself to the hospital, good luck

During my pregnancy class they talked about water breaking in two ways- one is the way you hear about a lot - the flood of fluids, etc.  The other sounds very similar to what you are describing, where you kind of spring a leak.  They said that sometimes women who this happens to don't know.  And that women wonder if it is wetting the bed or water breaking.  They said to DEFINITELY call in if you had these symptoms.



Keep an eye on when it started and what it looks like, they will ask you all of those questions.  If they don't call you back and you are uncomfortable, you may want to call/go into your hospital.  My hospital has a triage unit I can call with things like this if my drs office is busy.

My water broke the day before I was due at 5:30am with my first.  I wasn't sure that it had.  It felt like I really had to pee super bad and I almost didn't make it to the bathroom.  Throughout the day, at various times, a little more fluid would come out.  I still wasn't sure it had broken as I hadn't had any contractions at all.  At 5:30pm, I finally went to the hospital with my Mom.  Still no contractions.  ETA: Oh, and it did break that morning.



If I were you, I would definitely tell the nurse when she calls back that you think your water may have broken.  It sounds like it could have and it's definitely better to be safe than sorry as waiting too long could cause infection.



Good luck!

Congrats Girlfriend!  I believe your water has broken.  Good call with the pantyliner.  Depending on where your amniotic sac ruptured (if on top, then it is usually a little trickle at a time), then you may not get the "big gush."  If it is clear and continuing to come out, then it is most likely your water.  Also if it has a sweet smell, as opposed to an ammonia smell indicating urine, you probably broke your water.  Make sure they see you today.  You shouldn't go too long after breaking your water.  Good luck and congrats on your new addition.

have you not taken a class? lots of hospitals offer them for free I just went last night for our first one on labor, first you lose your mucous plug but you may not realize it, pains will come and go for a while but when they start to regulate that is when you start to time them and such, how long they are and how frequent they come, there should be a bloody show at some point, that is how you really know that you lost your mucous plug.  but when your water breaks you need togoto hospital, baby will come shortly.  labor can last for hours!!!!!!!

In most countries, you are protected by the law.  Businesses do not have the right to fire a woman because she's pregnant.  People understand, and will allow you to take the time off you need, after all, most people have babies at some point in their lives!



Don't worry, I'm sure it will be fine.

you don't want to know. although every situation is different, before I got pregnant, my boss got fired, and we got new boss. she was a ***** who was like 40 with no kids and didn't like kids, ( from what we could tell, if you had a child's event to attend she wouldn't be happy about you leaving work for it )  anyways needless to say I was about 3 months pregnant and decided to tell work I was.  a week later they fired me for a stupid reason.  i applied for unemployment and was granted it by the state, they said they had no good reason to fire me.  then my employers company appealed the courts decision and we had a date to go to court over it, i got a lawyer. when the company found out i hired a lawyer they dropped their case against me and let me collect my unemployment.  i was out about a month and it was nice actually b/c i had real bad morning sickness. i had a totally different job now that is better for me and my baby and this job has no stress, i can be out for my doctors appointments no problem, and can be late or leave early when i don't feel good.  I LOVE MY BOSS!  anyways, the fact is it may not affect you at all or it might for some stupid reason.  mine was very stressful but i mad it through and now i thank god, b/c i might have lost the baby with the job i had before, it was highly stressful and not very safe.  just pray!!

New management can and often do make changes in staff.  Quite a lot depends on the kind of organization in which you work, whether you have a contract, with whom, and what provisions for termination are spelled out.



It's true that they can't discriminate against you for being pregnant, but it they are laying off others, then you may not be able to make a case for being singled out.  I think you should talk about your concerns with your new boss, if that person is already there, or with your current boss, if s/he has not yet left.  Read your contract, too.  Good luck.

It depends on what your position is and if it is only needed when your old boss was there. Really no matter if you are pregnant or not, they can find a reason to let you go. I got let go when I was 5 months pregnant and there was nothing I could do about it. I even tried to apply for unemployment but they found a way to get around me getting approved. Not that that will happen to you, I found out I was working for crooked people after the fact that screwed over all employees. They ended up shutting their doors completely about a month after I was let go.



Just talk to someone and try and get a feel for what might happen so you get an idea of what to expect. Sorry and good luck!

You’re only protected from being discriminated against for being pregnant.  Basically your employer can’t let you go just because they’re pissed you’ll have to take leave in a few months.



There’s no law stopping them from letting you go if you’re just honestly not needed. In my experience, a large corporation might be reluctant to let you go if you’re expecting just for the simple fear that you would claim discrimination and sue, but if they’re letting other non-pregnant people go too, you’re really not protected.



What you can do is to bust your tail and make yourself as valuable to the company as you can. You’ll keep your job as long as you can show you’re a necessary part of the organization.



Believe me, I understand the fear. My own employer has laid off more than 200 people in the last month just in my region. It doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s a ton for a company that has never really done a mass lay-off before. I’m grateful for every day that I remain employed.

26 weeks pregnant with a pet cat.?



Ok... Im 26 weeks pregnant and I've had a pet cat this whole time. She occasionally tosses poop out of the litter box and plays with it. Gross I know lol. And she has plenty of other interesting toys to play with. She's a very unclean cat and gets litter everywhere and even plays in her water dish and then jumps in the litter box and tracks litter everywhere. My husband hasn't been very good lately with cleaning the litter box everyday. So Im annoyed about that. I am really worried about catching that parasite cats can carry which can cause brain damage, deafness, and blindness in babies. Should I be worried or maybe take the cat to a friend's house so they can take care of her for a couple months? We only had her for a year and she's my first pet cat so I'm more than likely not immune to toxoplasmosis. Anybody run into this problem?

Is that normal? should its be so watery? do u think my water broke and im just leaking?



Those of you who got this done did it help you any to start stronger contractions? did is help you start labor?

Stripping the membranes does hurt (Ouch). I had it done with my middle daughter, and went walking immediately after wards. Yes, the brown discharge is normal (at least it is what I had). I went into labor about 6 hours after having them stripped, but I am sure it was because I went walking. The more I walked the stronger the contractions got, and eventually I couldn't walk anymore! I would have died if I had to stay pregnant one more day. I was miserable.

I'm not sure about anyone else, but I was told that your waters were supposed to be clear and transparent, not dark brown.
I know my waters were clear!



It is however quite possible that you are experiencing your 'bloody show'.
If your contractions are still irregular, wait for some regularity before going off to the hospital, however it wouldn't be a bad idea to call your doc/midwife about the dark brown discharge.

It sounds like early stages of labor. My doctor stripped my membranes, or as she called it "helping me along", ay 3 pm and I went into the hospital ay 11 pm.



Since it does sound like you are leaking fluid, I would go and get it checked. They will test the fluid with a piece of paper to see if it is amniotic. You don't want to wait past 12 hrs if it is, due to an increase in infection rate.

is it still leaking?  your water can leak out in small trickles it will start and stop over and over again or it will start and seem like it's never gonna stop EVER.  When I had my membranes stripped I had menstrual like bleeding pretty heavy for the first day and spotting brown for 2 days after that.  I never had any watery discharge at all.  I would say if it is continuing go to the hospital.  if it has stopped and you are not having regular contractions Wait and see what happens.

I've personally haven't had my membranes stripped, but I think that maybe your water is leaking.  Since you are 39 weeks pregnant, contractions should probably follow. If you are worried, you should call labour and delivery or even make a trip to the hospital.



Things could start rolling for you.. Good luck!

How did you tell your man you were pregnant?



Personally, my hubby and I were trying a VERY long time to conceive so when I did pop up pregnant it definitely shocked me.



So, I kept it a secret for a little while. Long enough to get a ultrasound pic. I insisted we have a nice dinner together. While he was at work I went to have a cake made with the words "Congratulations, Daddy!" on it. When we finished our dinner, I told him to wait for dessert. I disappeared, then came back with the cake lit with candles. He looked at it and said "Are You Serious?!" I nodded then showed him the ultrasound picture.



What ways did you tell your man you were expecting?

Her hubby was at work when she found out she was pregnant.  So she kept the pregnancy test and put it in the oven, along with a bun.  When her hubby came home she asked him to check on dinner in the oven.  When he opened the oven door he just about had a heart attack, LOL!  She also had a shirt made up about a month or two prior to getting her BFP that said, "We have a bun in the oven!  Baby ____ is on the way!" with a picture of an oven and a bun.  I thought that was pretty clever!

Haha... mine and my husbands wasn't quite as sweet.



It was an accident.



I was 2 weeks late on my cycle and I knew something was up, my husband said, :"Well, lets take a test."



We took one... before I was off the toilet wiping, the test read, "Pregnant"



I cried, he was upset.  We've only been married 2 months and planned on waiting to have kids for a few more years to just enjoy each other. So we were NOT happy.



We were both pretty stressed all weekend, and then my husband said, "Lets take another test."



We took another test and again, it read, "Pregnant."



My amazing husband looked at me with his hopeful eyes and said, "Wanna have a baby?"



I just smiled and cried at the same time and said, "Ok, lets be parents."



And even though this is our first kid and we've only been married 2 months, we're both happy about it now.

I called him on his cell, he was on a service call in a loud shop and I said you need to hear this..he said ok let me call you back when I drive back to the shop. He called me back and I asked him.."So what are you doing mid January?" He says "I don't know honey, that's kinda far away". I said "OK DADDY...we'll see how busy you will be!" I laughed and laughed..he caught on quick and said "What have you and my sister planned?"



Here's the kicker..Within the next 3 weeks we found out that his other sister is expecting and well as his brother's wife too!! So we have babies due on Jan 7, Jan 14(us), Jan 28 and Feb 16..LOL 4 babies in 7 weeks!!!

You can always get pregnant no matter what - there is always a chance.  Use condoms, period or not, before/after.

Go and find one of their many hidden nuclear reactor plants. If you have sex there, you're guaranteed to either A) not have a child due to the enviornment, or B) have a child that's such a mess the government will take him/her away. Either way, a win/win!!

Easy as this.. Don't have sex until you are ready to have kids. If you aren't ready to have kids, you aren't ready to have sex. You can get pregnant on any day... it doesn't matter. I'm sure there are days that are "least likely" for you to get pregnant, but you can still get pregnant no matter what day it is.

Other than abstinence and condoms, you could try the "rhythm method". That's tracking your days of ovulation and avoiding sex during that time.

You are safest the week after your period and the week before your period. You ovulate about 14 days after your period - that is when you can get pregnant.  Sperm can live inside you for up to 5 days.

if you have a regular cycle, you can determine the days of ovulation.  go to this website, www.fertilityfriend.com and it will help you to determine when you should be ovulating.  Then, avoid having sex on those specific days.  Also remember, that sperm can live up to 3 days and if you are to ovulate in 2 days, you could still get pregnant.

There is a birth control method called Natural Family Planning.  It uses your own personal fertility signs to help YOU determine when you ovulate, and what days are safest for you to have sex with little risk of pregnancy.  Used carefully and properly, Natural Family Planning (which is NOT the same thing as the old 'rhythm method') is about as effective as most other methods.  (95-99% range.)

Sounds like labor to me.  Hopefully you aren't getting sick as well.  A lot of people have an upset stomach when labor is approaching.  Try taking hot showers and baths.  This will help with the pain- hips and cramps.  It can also relax your body into going into labor.  If you have any concerns, call your doctor.  Try ginger snaps for the nausea.



Good luck and congrats!

I packed the same things you'd always pack, just a little more.  I brought breast pads, night gowns, extra socks, slippers, robe, some magazines (I have trouble focusing on anything after a c-section for some reason), nursing bras, personal care items like deodorant, toothbrush/paste, and shampoo.  You get the idea.  I also brought some extra things for the baby like blankets and sleepers, the coming-home outfit.



I hope that helps.  Good luck!

I just packed like normal. Is this your first child? Your only really there and extra day. To be honost you probably wont be getting out of bed to much. You will be still sore. I had 2 of them. the first of course was worst than the second. The second i was home and cleaning the house. Yeah i know, my husband at that time was a pig.. You will be ok. Note: if you dont like the hospital pads they give you, you might want to bring ones that are more comfortable for you. theirs are big and bulky. You might want to bring brief underware because if you wear bikini like me you wont be able to because you c-section cut will be in that area, very uncomfortable.
Good luck and congratulations!

Congratulations! I had planned c-sections with both my children. I just took soap, shampoo, deodorant, nightgowns (some hospitals let you bring your own, if you want to), a robe, slippers, socks, maternity bras if you're going to breastfeed,  and a change of clothes for the trip home. The hospital usually provides a certain kind of underwear (for post-surgery care), pads for you, extra blankets, and everything the baby will need, diapers, wipes, formula, etc.

I packed exactly the same as I did otherwise,  it is always an unknown how long you stay in, I had a c-section and stayed in 2 days after the op,  my friend has recently come out of hospital and had a natural birth but was in for 8 days.



If you need anything extra (extra clothes,  books etc) you can always get your partenr / a friend / your relatives to bring them in.

You are most fertile between 10-14 days from the first day of your last menstrual period. If you had unprotected sex during this time frame you might be pregnant because that is when you ovulate. Do the math.

during the times you had sex you could be in your ovulation stage, which greatly raises the chances for you to get pregnant, and even if you aren't ovulating there's a chance you can still get pregnant.



here's a link with some more detailed info to help you out, i know there's a lot of "heat of the moment" but try and be careful if you don't want to get pregnant.

If your last period was Oct 12th, your most fertile days would have been 19th to 27th.  Ovulation might have occurred on the 25th.  There's a chance you might have become pregnant during that time, but you won't have symptoms for another two to three weeks.
See your doctor ASAP because you might still be able to get the morning after pill.  It works best if there has been less than 72 hours since the "event".
Always use condoms.  Pulling out or knowing when your "non fertile" days are is not an effective way of preventing pregnancy.

A pregnancy test isn't going to do you a bit of good until you are close to or miss your period. If you got pregnant one of those days your body isn't going to tell you yet. Best thing you can do is get otherwise occupied. Stress can cause you to miss a period further freaking you out. Don't have unprotected sex with a boyfriend. I had one of my children out of wedlock and it's the most stressful thing in my life. Dealing with his other family.

It's probably too late for "Plan B", which must be started within a day or so after the unprotected sex.



Looks like you'll have to sweat it out until your next period is due.  If you're late by two or three days, take a pregnancy test.  It may come out negative that early, so if your period still doesn't come in another week, take another test.  It should be accurate by then.

It depends on what she says is her period, but it could mean nothing at all. She may be trying to trap you into something.....but have her take a test and if it is positive then I suggest that you do the right thing until you can get a DNA test done. Good luck and next time think before you have sex.

If you had unprotected sex with her during her ovulation phase she could very well be pregnant.  An early period doesn't mean she's not pregnant, it might have been implantation.  She should use a pregnancy test, and you should prepare for DNA testing.  Good luck.

Waterbirth is definitely safer. (And that IS a 'natural birth .. using natural methods rather than meds to help cope with the contractions.)  Cheaper too.



I'd go for a waterbirth.  If you find that it's not enough, you can request an epidural at any time and the hospital staff will be happy to oblige you.

You can start out with a water birth and change your mind and have the epidural later on. I would keep your options open because you don't know how you will tolerate the pain.



I am on my third birth (hopefully any day) and I have had an epidural both times before, I have put down in the hospital notes that an epidural is my preferred method of pain relief. But as far as I am concerned, you will be giving birth and you need to try and do this the way you want to try and do it.

You're going to have to decide that when the time comes.  You can have your plan, but things can change!  I did a 100% all natural childbirth (even after 25 hours of labor).  There are a lot of pros for having a natural childbirth -- you're able to walk around, get in the jacuzzi, feel when you need to push (usually there's less tearing because of that), you're able to walk around after wards, no catheter, etc.  But be prepared for anything.



Water births I'm leery about.  They don't seem quite safe to me, although they seem like an amazing idea.  I started pushing in the water, and I'm sure I would have been more comfortable in there (our hospital doesn't allow water births).  But if you're in the water, and comfortable -- go for it.  My friend had an amazing water birth.



Good luck to you!  Early congrats -- cute name!!

I could see you comparing water-birth and natural . . . but an Epidural is totally at the other end of the spectrum.  If you even have that one as an option than I'm not sure you are prepared for natural childbirth.  It's not really what is better, but what you can tolerate.  A water-birth may be more calming and relaxing . . . but only for the woman who can tolerate the level of pain that comes with childbirth, especially the first.  The amount of pain will be the same, but how tolerant you are to it and ability to tune it out and focus on the outcome is the real deciding factor here.

I had my son a year ago and insisted that I was going to do it all natural. After 30 hours of labor though, I ended up getting some Demerol. It didn't take away the pain, it just took the edge of, which was exactly what I needed. My son was born about 10 hours later.



I have little to no pain tolerence, but I did it without meds for so long because I wanted what I thought was best for me and my baby. And ultimately that is what you have to decide. Unexpected things do happen in labor and delivery so don't be too set in your plan. You never know what that little boy is going to decide to do.

I had all three of my boys naturally at the hospital and I plan a natural with this one. I have never had a water birth so I can't help you there. I'm too scared of an epidural. You don't take meds all through your pregnancy to keep the baby safe. I personally just don't think it is a good idea to put a bunch of meds in your body when you are giving birth just for pain relief. It isn't natural. The pain is intense, I won't lie. I just had to keep telling myself that I would be ok, it would be over soon, and that no ones dies from the pain from childbirth. Besides the fact that more and more studies are linking pitocin and epidural meds. to autism. It makes sense too, look at all the cases of Autism nowdays and more women are having epidurals and being induced. Just about 6 months ago we had a story here where we live about a young lady that was given too much medication in her epidural and was paralyzed. Just not worth the risk for me. Everyone I know that has had an epidural now has headaches and back pain that they didn't have before. I was in the delivery room with my sister when she had her epidural. It slowed her contractions way down, she couldn't feel to push the baby out so that took forever, and when she wanted to pee they had to put in a catheter. I believe natural birth is better, baby's have been born that way since the beginning of time and if it was that horrible, women wouldn't have more than one child..lol. Once the baby is out, the pain is over.  Women that do opt for pain meds are not wimps or weak. Everyone is different and it is a personally choice. Best wishes to you and your little boy :)

that depends do you want no pain or slightly bearable pain or unbearable pain.



No pain = Epidural. i had no pain in my epidural i realise though that some people can still feel something but for me i felt nothing.



Slightly Bearable = water birth. i have not had a water birth so not sure what it is like but i do know what it feels like to have warm running water while in labour and you get some nice relief from that however you can still feel the pain.



Unbearable = All natural. the pain is horrible but i was able to do it with my second and now i am able to believe that it is acheivable( i had no choice though. I was unable to have en epidural or gas or anything because the babies head was not far down enough and they didn't know how long i was going to be in labour for).

well ultimately it is her decision whether she keeps the child or aborts it. If shes three months along, that puts her at 12 weeks, and most doctors won't perform an abortion that late. Some will, if she goes now and gets it done.

I think after your first trimester(3 months) they wont normally do an abortion. All you can do at this point is be honest with her and tell her you do not want her to have an abortion and tell her you want ot help raise the baby and be there for her even thou you all arent togehter. She is probably scared since you all are not together and feels she will be doing it on her own. All you can do let her know you want ot help and be there. Unfortunetly thou it is her body and ultimately her desicion. Good Luck!

If you are happy to have sole responsibility for the child all you can do is try and persuade her to continue with the pregnancy, however as fathers have no legal rights over their unborn child,  the choice to continue or not lies soley with the mother.

well...generally its up to her what she does, but you are more then intitled to have your say in the matter. Im afraid you can still have an abortion at 3 months, but it depends where your living..and in most places it has to special circumstances (such as health of mother or baby). I hope whatever happens its the best decision for both of you.
But 3 months is a long time to wait and then decide to have an abortion, why didnt she do it sooner?

Well at this point the only thing you can do is try and convince her to keep it. I think one can get an abortion up to about 24 weeks, I kno someone who did it. After 13weeks it's a bigger risk and a lot of money. Good Luck!!

It all depends on the state/country you are in and its laws. In all likelihood, you don't have a say in the matter. You should not pressure her if she does not want a child unless you are ready to take full responsibility for raising the child.

Three months is the limit in most states for standard abortion.
And no you have no final say. This is a topic heard by many courts and it is the woman's right to decide.
As unfair as it might seem forcing a woman to under go nine months of pregnancy is rather unenforceable.
I hope some other men realize from seeing this, every time  you have relations, this is the situation you enter. If she has a child you have to be a Dad and pay support. If she aborts a child you want, you have to suffer like the asker here.
so be careful who you decide to be with. Don't let lust rule sense.

I THINK she can have an abortion up til its due but not sure. You and her need to try and make things work for the baby. Also, try and talk her in to keeping it. Maybe if you send her a picture od what the baby looks like inside of her, she might want to keep it. Talk to her that's all you can do. I don't know what your rights are as the father as the baby. I would try talking to someone that knows a little about things like that in your town. Good Luck!

you have to ask yourself this question- if you are successful in talking her out of having the abortion- are you willing and committed and financially able to support and raise the child?  And you say she is your ex- do you want to be connected and tied to her for the rest of your life?  Having a child is a life commitment.  Ideally, she would have the baby and place it up for adoption; but if she wants an abortion there isn't much you can do unless you get an injunction to stop her; then I am pretty sure you would be raising the child yourself.

My doctor didn't talk about a weight restriction with me. He said you can continue doing what you have been doing. Therefore, if you have been lifting your child you can continue to do so. But, if you haven't lifted anything you shouldn't go around and lift 40lb objects.



If you don't feel comfortable lifting him I wouldn't. I'd also check and see what your doctor says. I know doctors often say different things on the same issue.

this is what my doc said.....(i have a 26 lb 2 year old and a 30 lb 3 year old) that i shouldnt try to to lift them often and if i do lift with legs not back, cause it will strain my muscles that are already strained, and instead sit on the couch and let them come to me, and sit on my lap....that being said, i still carry my kids, sometimes both when i need to get them where they need to be, and yes my back is aching, but sometimes you just have to.  I try to sit down and let them sit on my lap. Like you i dont want my kids to think i dont want to hold them cause i am having a new baby.  So hope this helps.

ask your doctor, if you were used to lifting him alot before it should be fine for a while but the further along you get, you could strain your back and that won't be pleasant for the rest of your pregnancy, you don't want that kind of pain, make daddy carry him around now.

It won't hurt your baby, but it might hurt your back.  I had a big talk about this when I was pregnant with my midwife.  I was an elementary special ed. teacher, and had to do a lot of lifting.  Lift with your legs, and try to avoid it if you can.

It really depends on what your comfortable with, my doctor told me no more then 25 lbs so I've been super careful not to do any heavy lifting. I guess that's what husbands are for right?
I have my nephew (32lbs) sit on my lap when he wants me to hold him, but I usually have my husband or sister lift him up to me.

A lot depends on whether he climaxed, and where he was if that occurred.  If there was seminal fluid released near your opening, sperm cells could possibly work their way up into your uterus, although that's not very likely.  Pregnancy can even happen without a climax, if some seminal fluid seeped out while he was inside you even a little.



If you miss your next period by several days, it will be time to take a pregnancy test.  The most likely outcome in this case is that you've been lucky and your period will come.  From now on, though, don't do anything intimate with your boyfriend until you have obtained reliable birth control for yourself (I'm talking about the Pill).

I agree with the first answerer. You need to be educated on sex before you try having it. and for the answer to your question, if he "comes" in or near your vagina then, yes, you do run the risk of getting pregnant. But still get educated and please, please when you decide to have sex again I would suggest using a condom.

depends on the position of the baby.  If the babys genital area wasn't that visable, it makes it harder to tell,  When he said it's probably a girl, that means he didnt see a penis, but that the position of the baby he may not be 100% sure.

it depends on your baby's position, and the boy's parts doesn't show up until later but that isn't what they look for. in my sonogram picture they know it is a girl b/c of a white area in the genital area, she said boys don't have that.  I don't know what a boy's sonogram picture looks like b/c mine is a girl... but they don't look for well, the main dish so to speak, they look medically

Most likely he should be able to tell at this stage; however, if the baby isn't positioned just right it could make a big difference.
I think the "routine' time to find out the gender is around 16 weeks and even then it's not guaranteed due to the fact your little one may not be in the mood to show his/her face :-)

If he was sure he would have told you for certain. On our level 1 ultrasound at 20 weeks the penis and testes were visible even to me. I didn't need to wait for the technician to tell me. I pointed at the screen and said: "Isn't that testicles?"



But at 16 weeks the external genitals are still forming, so even if your baby was going to sprout a penis, it might not be visible, especially with poor positioning.

I am 16 weeks pregnant too!! Yes, they usually can, but sometimes the baby's position makes it hard to tell. My sister had twins and they could tell the one was a boy at 4 months, but she likes to joke about how well endowed he was.  I had my first ultrasound done at 13 weeks, they told me they wouldn't be able to tell the sex until the next one which is at 20 weeks.  I think that's the norm for them to be sure, so wait until then before getting your mind set on ballerinas...unless of course that's what you want for a boy;  more power to ya!!;p

I was told at 16wks and 3days when I had my ultrasound, if its a boy they will give me a 100% reading because you can see the genital area. But if its a girl then they can only say 50/50 because it could be tucked. But my lil one wasn't shy, she let the dr go right between her legs. I was told its a girl 98.9% sure! Also my Dr told me just by the sound of the heartbeat it was a girl. So next time you go for a check up ask about the heartbeat, how fast ect. If its 140 and over its a female! Goodluck!

My daughters movements have REALLY slowed down. Is this something to worry about? 33 weeks?



She's still moving but not the large movements that she normally makes (the ones where my whole belly moves with her). Her movements have been very light. I am starting to wonder is she running out of room. I thought about drinking some caffeine (because I never do) and see if that gets her moving. What do you think is going on? Thanks

No, baby usually slows down bc there is less room, but if you're that worried it cant hurt to get checked out. My docs told me if you stop feeling ANY movement at all- after 1 hr., to call. Light movement is good movement!

As long as you feel 10 kicks per hour your baby should be fine.  Plus, like you said, she is quickly running out of room.  My rule of thumb is that if I'm ever worried about anything I give my doctor a phone call.  Better safe than sorry.  Congrats on the little girl!  I'm hoping for pink this time, too!! :o)

From what my Dr. told me as long as the amount of movement doesnt change and its only the type of movement, everything is fine. Baby runs out of room but still moves just as much. I had a concern and everyone told me it was normal cause she was running our of room. My Dr. was mad I didnt call them because lack of movement isnt a good thing. Now I am 35w5d and she still makes my belly shake and is hurting me so bad, but she has her back to mine.



If it doesnt feel right to your Dr. and they might have you go to hospital to have baby monitored. Just remember the amount of movement shouldnt change, baby is already on a sleep pattern you should be used to. Good luck!!

i am 33 weeks and had the same problem the doctor told me the baby is growing at a faster pace now and is running out of room, they are almost as long in inches now as when they are born.. 17inches!!  i wouldn't have any room either!!  and they gain 1/2 a lb to a 1 lb a week now, so it is only gonna get worse.  even though the tummy doesn't bounce as much anymore, you can still feel her moving inside, although it is more like pressure now than actual kicks and punches. it is normal don't worry

Don't drink caffeine, it's not good for baby. This happened to me around 33 weeks, she is running out of room to move around as she pleases. If you want to get her moving, drink a glass of orange juice and have a seat. She will probably only give you the pushes now. Where your belly sticks right out where she's moving. It's pretty cool to watch. Bring it up at your next doctor's appointment to ease your mind anyways. Good luck! Almost there.

I didn't really feel pregnant (aside from the sore boobs) until i was feeling that baby kick. Not everyone gets the crappy pregnancies with all the bells and whistles. Some of us get rediculously lucky and have a very happy healthy natural feeling pregnancy. I wouldn't worry but if you can't get it off of your mind, see you doctor to ease it!

You are almost into your second trimester, in the majority of cases, that is when morning sickness subsides...and you regain some energy. I still feel that EVERY pregnancy is different, so if for some reason you are feeling "not right"....call your doctor. Have them check you out....it may be nothing, but that would ease your mind. Trust me, they are used to pregnant women calling them for every little thing!!

Hello! I am 14 weeks pregnant, 3rd pregnancy. Honestly, pregnancies are all different or at least all mine have been. You are nearly over the first trimester so you are going to start feeling better which means the symptoms you have had will begin to subside. Everything is fine..don't worry. I was just glad that the morning sickness has gone away. I hated that part!

Sounds like you are in denial!!!  No, I am kidding.  It is normal.  The soreness is only there if your body is rapidly changing and it sounds like you are at a plateau.  The first trimester is the one that is know for the morning sickness, dizziness, nausea, and soreness.  Sounds like you are one of the lucky few that don't have the super debilitating morning sickness.  Consider yourself lucky.  Congratulations on your pregnancy.

It's a common feeling at that stage. Your body has adjusted to the new hormone levels, and you haven't yet had major changes in your body or felt the baby move yet. Of course you'll feel like you're not.

I'm 8 weeks, and haven't had any symptoms other than sore breasts, a lil nausea every once and a while and being tired as well...



From what I understand by the second trimester you start (or most women) to feel much better,  more energy less complaints, and symptoms.



So it sounds like this is normal.  When was your last OB appointment?  If you have concerns you should definatly give the dr a call.



But if your last visit was recently and there was no cause for concern, I'm sure your probably fine, it's your hormones leveling out, up until this point they've been surging (which causes all the symptoms)



Best of luck and congratulations

It took me awhile to get used to my pregnancy.  I didn't really feel pregnant until I was about 4-5 months.  You should be keeping in touch with your midwife though if you are unsure about things.  It's important.  And if you are tired then you should be eating plenty of red meat for the Iron.  It's not only for your own benefit but for baby as well.  All the nutrients you eat goes to baby.  Also if you ever feel nautious again then try eating plain crackers, they work wonders.  I'm not too sure about your dizziness though, you should get that checked out urgently it may be serious.

Its completely normal. You are approaching your second trimester and when I began my second trimester, I didnt feel pregnant at all besides the fact that I was starting to outgrow some of my clothes. Sometimes I even wondered if there was something wrong with the baby. But all my doctor's appointments went great and the sonograms that the dr will give you will reassure you.
Congratulations and Good luck with your pregnancy!!

Around 12 or 13 weeks I also didn't feel pregnant at all anymore because most of the early symptoms had gone away.  As long as there's been no bleeding or pain, I'm sure you're still pregnant.  Pretty soon they will be able to hear the heartbeat at the Doctor's.  That's a nice reassurance.

i had a really crappy start morning sickness, which lasted all day! tiredness, uncontrobable mood swings, dizziness, sore boobs, and serious amounts of pain i was signed off work for 4 weeks due to the pains and stuff so it went on for quite a while i was so ill i was losing more weight instead of putting it on!
but saying all that im coming into my 12th week now and everything seems to have disapeared about 2 weeks ago there was nothing anymore, i was really worried because at least while i was ill i knew my baby was still there and when it stopped i just didnt feel pregnant i spoke to my dr who recomended i get a heartbeat monitor and showed me how to use it... its helped me alot because in moments of doubt i can listen to ma lil'ens heartbeat and movements to put my mind at rest... although he did tell me that i might not always hear one and if i dont then try again later if i hear nothing for a few days then contact him although everyday i listen and its utterly amazing!
i got mine at 11 weeks and couldnt hear the heartbeat at first only the movements but when you do hear it utterly fantastic nothing can put your mind at ease like that!
good luck and congrats!

Stress is a baby killer also.......you need to relax.  you body will handle things the way they should be handled.  If you miscarry, then it is you body telling you that something is not right.  but I wouldn't worry about it, that will only snowball to a higher stress level.

i am sure all is well, in the first trimester it is common to have cramping and feel crappy all around....and there really isnt much a doc can do cause its a long shot to hear heart beat this early and you cant feel movement i would take it easy and relax.  Odds are everything is fine, and yes discharge is normal...i have had so much i think i am peeing my pants! ha! well hope this helps, just relax and enjoy time without baby crying! take a bath!

It doesn't sound like theres anything wrong, I think your just stressing yourself!!! please calm down and if your really really get an appointment with doctor before 2 weeks! because stress isnt going to help that little baby!



OOO by the way cramping and back pain is very common in early pregnancy! so dont worry about that..so is a little bit of blood!
so you only really have to worry if you start to bleed heavily.



I hope everything works out for you! and please stop STRESSING! :)

I wouldn't be worried if I were you since you're not bleeding.  I am 21 weeks and I still have cramping and discharge.  As some women get further along in their pregnancy they have more discharge.  The cramping is due to your body adjusting and growing due to a living little person inside you.  My back has hurt the whole time through the pregnancy.  If you really think something is wrong then you should go ahead to the doctor but I am almost positive everything is fine as long as you're not bleeding.  Every mother has their worries about having a miscarriage.  Trust me, it is always in the back of your head but you need to enjoy your pregnancy and not stress over it.  Good Luck

My advice is to just calm down. First of all, nausea, back aches, and discharge are completely normal. I don't know who told you increased discharge was a sign of miscarriage but they should be smacked for worrying you. I cramped SO badly for the first few weeks after finding out I was pregnant. The doctors said it was just stuff being stretched around to accommodate the baby. I also had bleeding and went to the ER. Turned out everything was okay and it was just some old blood. I say as long as you're not bleeding, you're fine. BUT if you just can't stop worrying, try and get to a clinic or even go to the ER if it would settle your nerves. I don't know what kind of insurance you have though, so be careful not to rack up too many bills. If you start bleeding though, I would go to the nearest clinic or emergency room. BUT stop stressing and I'm sure everything will be fine. Everyone is worried about this during their first few weeks!

Mild cramping is definitely normal at 7 weeks. Heck Im 26 weeks and still have menstrual like cramps. Just try to relax and give the doctor a call to put you at ease. They are getting paid big bucks so use them lol. Don't worry... I went through this too. As long as there's no heavy bleeding. Even a little bleeding is ok too. Hope I helped :)

Please don't worry- as long as you are not having any sort of bleeding or brown discharge, I would just take it easy, relax and enjoy your pregnancy! If you do have bleeding, it is NOT necessarily a miscarriage- there are many explanations for bleeding during pregnancy. I have a friend who bled during her entire pregnancy and had a completely healthy baby. An increase in discharge is normal as well. But just remember- all women are different and each pregnancy is different. I have been pregnant 5 times, and each and every one has been completely different. Good luck to you!

All of your symptoms are completely natural.  If you have worries, call your doctor's office.  If you have stomach pains and are bleeding, then you should call the doctors office immediately or go in to the emergency room.  The urgency status of pregnant women are elevated and so your will be seen a lot faster than normal.



Just keep in mind that the cervix becomes very fragile during pregnancy and bleeding can occur and still be normal.  Bright red blood is not always a bad sign, but it still should always be checked out by a doctor or midwife as soon as possible.  Dark blood (brownish in color) is very very normal and should be expected.  If you have a good doctor, she/he should be there to answer your questions or assuage your worries should you have any.



Good luck and remember... take those vitamins :)

Don't be scared of miscarrying! I know it's hard but don't stress. Nausea is common, back pain is not so normal but it could have been the way you slept. Cramping is probably coming from your morning sickness, and I had the same issue with the discharge, unless its like a weird amount (like a Lot!) then I wouldn't worry about it.



when I was 7 weeks, I woke up one morning and my waters had leaked...I called the doctor and he told me to come in right away and I went in and he told me to go home and relax and I would have a miscarriage any day. I was devastated but kept positive, I stayed on bed rest and tried to stay calm. When I went back to the doctor after two weeks of tests and no miscarriage, he was stunned and said he had never seen this happen, 9 out of ten women would have lost their baby in this situation and I didn't. Im now 37 weeks pregnant with a perfectly healthy baby girl.
I wish you the best of luck and just remember to stay calm.

Ok, what’s the problem? You’re more likely not to conceive than to conceive in any given month.



If it has been a year with no luck, then you should talk to your doctor about checking your fertility. Until then, relax and accept that you’re normal.

Sometimes it can take more than a year to conceive.  You need to ask yourself some questions. Are you watching your cycles so you know when you're most fertile?  Have you and your hubby had fertility tests?  Don't stress too much and be patient.
If you end up trying for more than a year and have no luck, see a fertility specialist.  Good luck.

You both may want to go and get checked to see if he's fertile and if you are. Sometimes it take people years to get pregnant. It's a hard thing to do when you actually want to have a baby. I would try to look up getting a device (dont know what it's called) but it lets you know when your the most fertile. So you have an awesome chance of being able to have a baby. I would try that and if that doesnt work try going to the doctor.

I know you dont want to hear this, lol..but that is not that long when ttc...you only have a 25 % chance each month of conceiving and that is when you are having sex on your ovulating days. It is common for it to take up to a year and the majority of couples that dont conceive after a year go on to conceive in the second, I wish you all the best and good luck!

My fiance and I were engaged for almost 2 years (our baby is due on our 2 year anniversary!) and just when we stopped thinking about it...bango- we were pregnant! 4 months is not a very long time, although it seems like forever especially when you take that test and it comes negative :(  Keep on trying and just relax about it. It will happen! Best of luck!!!!

You're actually only really fertile for a few days each month. You can get an ovulation predictor kit from a drugstore, it will tell you which days of the month you are most likely to conceive. But other than that, as most everyone is already telling you, doctors always say give it at least a year before thinking there is a problem.

There are so many hormones that surge when you get pregnant, wearing the ring or taking the pill by accident won't hurt the baby.

Help! I'm leaking all over the place!?



I'm seven months pregnant and I started lactating BEFORE I was a virgin (When I was like fifteen), and now I'm 21 and now that I'm pregnant, I keep leaking ALL over the place. Especially when I'm sleeping and it's always getting all over my husband. It doesn't bother him he just says it's cold.



I can't wear a bra in my sleep, is there a bra or something I can get that I can't really feel? I know I can get breast pads but, not while I'm asleep. I also write for a eco safe column, so I'd like something I can reuse.... I can't find anything.

I'd say a sports bra is pretty comfortable to sleep in; soft cotton-organic cotton, if you'd prefer. I think it would be less irritating to your breasts and less constricting than a regular bra, underwire or push-up. I'd just slip the nursing pads over your nipples anyway. But if you don't want to, soft cotton might be less irritating to your nipples.

When I was breast feeding I had a leak problem. At a nursing class I picked up these things called Lily Padz.  www.lilypadz.com



They were totally awesome. They stopped the leak problem and were re-usable which was great. Check them out on their site, I think it is exactly what you need. You also don't need to wear a bra over them they will stay on!



Oh and also, the most comfortable bra's I have worn are nursing bra's. I know you aren't nursing yet but maybe you might want to pick one up and try it out.



Good luck!

Have you thought about wearing a tank with a shelf bra and putting nursing pads in there?  Or getting just a wireless bra and wearing pads with that?  That way you have something comfortable to hold the pads while you sleep.

I have been on maternity leave since 24th August. I get paid on the last friday of every month so my wage at the end of August was mostly normal hours i had worked then 5 days maternity pay. My wages for Sept was Statuatory maternity pay at the basic rate. My wage this month however is exactly the same as septembers even tho October has been a 5 week month.

26 weeks pregnant with a pet cat.?



Ok... Im 26 weeks pregnant and I've had a pet cat this whole time. She occasionally tosses poop out of the litter box and plays with it. Gross I know lol. And she has plenty of other interesting toys to play with. She's a very unclean cat and gets litter everywhere and even plays in her water dish and then jumps in the litter box and tracks litter everywhere. My husband hasn't been very good lately with cleaning the litter box everyday. So Im annoyed about that. I am really worried about catching that parasite cats can carry which can cause brain damage, deafness, and blindness in babies. Should I be worried or maybe take the cat to a friend's house so they can take care of her for a couple months? We only had her for a year and she's my first pet cat so I'm more than likely not immune to toxoplasmosis. Anybody run into this problem?

my husband too isn't very good with the litter box, and all cats are messy when it comes to the litter, mine does play in her water dish but doesn't jump in tthe litter afterwards so i just get water everywhere.  one thing, is it an indoor only cat? if so you are less prone to getting that bacteria they talk about b/c it mainly comes from them eating mice and other rodents. although you should take any chances and still stay away from the litter box!  youcan wear gloves and help with the mess but don't scoop it by no means.  talk or yell at your hubby whatever it takes for him to realize that you CANNOT do this he needs to for your baby's sake, he needs to grow up and take charge of the litter box correctly, everyday i ask my husband... did you scoop it today?  it needs to be cleaned out again...( i have 3 indoor cats )  he knows i can't do it, and husbands can be childish more than they realize.  i don't think they every grow up!

Well, not exactly cause my cat is rather clean lol. You need to get on your husband, he should be as worried as you are and be wanting to take care of you and baby. My boyfriend is great and cleans litter at least once a day. sometimes he has to leave town for 2 days or so and I just cant stand the litter box not being cleaned. My Dr. said if I have to put gloves on and wash my hands I will be fine, if I have to clean it. I even had my dad come over to clean once, lol. I have learned to let it go if I have to. But if my cat played with her poop I wouldnt leave it in there.



I dont know if I would pawn that uncleanliness off on a friend though.

First of all, you really only have to worry if the cat goes outside because they get toxoplasmosis from eating mice and birds. That being said, if you're like me you're going to worry about it regardless. I have a cat that's never set foot on dirt, and I still don't touch the litter. Talk to your hubby about cleaning it better. If that doesn't work, call your  mom or a friend and see if they would mind coming over once a week to do the maintenance. And if all else fails you can do what I do...when he throws poo out of the litter box I vacuum it up. Not the best thing for the vacuum, but my baby is more important. If you must clean it yourself invest in some gloves and paper face masks. Clean it, throw the gloves and mask away, and scrub your hands in hot soapy water. Hope this helps! I'd hate for you to have to get rid of your kitty!

I would nag your husbands *** to make sure he cleans the litter box,  his child too and he should be just as concerned as you. It's the baby's health at risk.



My boyfriend never cleaned the litter box until I got pregnant, now he does it ever other day without having to be told.



If your really concerned your dr can run bloodwork to see if you are immune to toxoplasmosis, if youve had the cat a year, it could be you are.....If the cat doesn't go outside, it's also a possibility that the cat doesn't even carry the disease,  the vet can test the cat.

I can relate. One of my cats likes to bolt from the box when she’s finished going, only sometimes she’s not quite done and leave a treat on the floor. :-)



My husband was always horrible about dealing with the cat box before I was pregnant. While I’m not normally a nagger, I will bug him about the cat box as often as needed. Not only am I not touching it, I can’t stand the way it smells if dirty. Feel free to remind him when it needs to be cleaned.



I’ve learned that the vacuum cleaner is a great tool for dealing with liter box messes. It gets loose litter off the floor and the hose attachment should have no trouble picking up your cat’s nasty “toys” for you. That way, you don’t actually have to touch anything. Also wash your hands regularly after you’ve been around the box, and obviously before you eat.



One other suggestion is an electric cat box like the Littermaid. We have one. They’re not 100% maintenance-free, but they’ll scoop up most of the waste within 10 min so unless your kitty plays with fresh poo, there won’t be anything left in the box for her to mess with.



Don't get rid of your kitty though. You made a commitment to her, and there are plenty of ways to make this work.

Does your cat go outside? If not, then she almost certainly doesn't have toxoplasmosis...they get it from hunting. Also, the poop has to sit in the box for 48 hours before it becomes communicable. So if you clean the box every day (as you should...cats HATE a dirty litter box, that could be why she's tossing the poop out) you shouldn't have an issue. I clean the box for 5 cats every day, have since I became pregnant, and I am careful to wash my hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap after I'm done. Please don't give your cat away just because your husband is lazy...seriously. Tell him he HAS to do it, every single day. Or, if he's a total deadbeat and doesn't care, you'll have to do it yourself. Just be mindful of washing your hands, and keep up with the box every day, and you'll be fine.

If you must clean the litter box--wear disposable latex gloves.  Throw them away immediately afterward and wash you hands well.



Has you cat been outside of the house where it can come into contact with toxoplasmosis?  If seems that a cat would be exposed and contract toxoplasmosis while outside.

Ah.  You probably wouldn't be immune to it yet.



Not that my situation was an excuse for keeping that cats, but I've been around cats since I was 2 years old.



Now, your husband NEEDS to be cleaning the litter for you.  You shouldn't be messing and breathing in that right now.  If he doesn't start helping you out with that.  Unfortunately you may have to get rid of your cat or atleast give it to someone to take care of for a bit.

Pregnant with ex-bf baby, have new boyfriend HELP?



Ok, i am pregnant with my ex-boyfriend's baby. He wasn't really devoted to me, like he wwould put evrything infront of me, even going to hang out with his friends. I had to dump him. he was giving me too much stress. OK, so after i dump him i got a new boyfriend. i told him everything about me, even my pregnancy ( i am not showing too much) and he accept me and told me that he is always here for me and would never leave me, but now my ex, the father of the baby that i am carrying, wants me back. he calls me everyday to fine out how i am doing and just to talk to me.



the thing is i love my ex-boyfriend so much and i feel like i should go with him because i love him, and i am having his baby, but then i know that he is no good for me
My new boyfriend-- i love him also, but sometimes i am scared because he loves me too much and i am scared that one day i am going to hurt him and i don't want to hurt him. he is a good guy and he helps me soo much with everything . like yesterday i was telling him something that happen to me last week with me not having money and nothing to eat and how i managed to eat and everything went fine and he got mad at me for not coming to him for money so i can eat. while my exboyfriend wouldn't care at all.
-- don't get me wrong i work two jobs and go to college full time, i am a hard worker but sometimes i can't manage to make it work. anyways, who should i go with? i know it is obvious that i should be with my new boyfriend but in terms of the baby and our future what should i do?

You have to take a weekly blood test to test for HCG. I had a previous miscarriage in August and got pregnant 1 month later. Doctor also suggest that to me to monitor. But i didn't go for it because i feel it's a waste of money. The alternative is to take horomone pills and injections. I'm taking pills 3 times a day and injection every 3 days till I'm 12 weeks. I'm 12 weeks pregnant now and the baby is healthy but i have low laying placenta. I have stop the injection since last week but still taking the pills

the doctor needs to do this by taking blood tests, they will take 1 blood test, then another 3days later to see if your hormone levels are doubleing



or you can use regular pregnancy tests, take one the same time everyday (same brand) id just use really cheap ones like from poundland, and if the line starts to fade then its bad news 4u, but im sure it will stay the same :)

Not everyone does it.. the best way to avoid it is to have empty bowels but we can't always control when we go into labor... so the answer is NO you can't really stop it from happening.  The doctor's and nurses are used to it happening and they don't make a big deal about it. The focus is on you delivering not your bowel movements.. they do clean u up.

No, most do not. Mother Nature has ways of taking care of it...your body will most likely empty itself in the hours/day before labor begins or during early labor.
If that doesn't happen, a nurse will just wipe it away and you likely will never even know it happened.

When I first found out about it, I had the same thought. Honestly though, the more I read, the more I realized it’s incredibly common. There’s a good chance you won’t even know if you poo since you can’t exactly see what’s happening down there. The doctor or nurse will just clean it up without saying a word because they’ve seen it dozens or even hundreds of times before.



It’s no grosser to them than any other part of delivery.

I've had 2 children and did not have a BM either time. I was at the birth of my nephew before I had both my children and saw that my sister did it. So I just went every chance I could ahead of time. Both times I went into labor I felt the need to go and went in the toilet. I don't think there is any real way of avoiding it. If there is stool in your bowel when you start pushing, it's going to come out. It's not as embarrassing as it sounds. It's completely normal and all the nurses and doctors are used to it. They just clean it up and move on. My sister wasn't even aware that she did it until I told her later.
Good luck, and congrats! :)

Since you're being induced you know when you're going in, so you have a better chance to prepare for it.  Eat lightly the day before, perhaps the week or so before eat loads of fibre so that you're cleaned out for the big day.  Also I wouldn't get an enema, I heard that some liquid can be left in and then it's spray poo everywhere.  Good luck!!!!!!!!

Not everyone.  I did though.  When I was pregnant, I was really scared this would happen to me, but when it did, I didn't even care.  I mean, I was already lying on a bed half naked with people I had just met (nurses in the ward), panting and straining and in pain.  I just went to a place where I didn't even care anymore.  I could've walked naked down the hall at that point, and not given a ****.



It is funny, but for me, most of the things I worried about in the days leading up to labour didn't even bother me when it was happening.  The most upsetting thing was when I thought I was going to have to be moved into the high risk ward, where the dads are not permitted to stay overnight after baby is born.  But that didn't end up happening anyways.

I had one with both of my other labors, and trust me, when you're in the middle of delivery, that is the LAST thing on your mind!!! All you're focused on, is getting that baby OUT! Besides, when you have a bowel movement while pushing, the doctors immediately wipe it, so none will chance getting into other places. So even if you do, they take care of it so fast, people in the room might not even notice!

Yes everyone usually passes some stool with the delivery of a baby.. very normal and does not reflect on you personally.. just happens... if that thought really mortifies you though.. you can put yourself on clear liquids the day before your induction.. this is liquids that you can see through, like apple juice, broth, jello... and also enemas that evening.. this is essentially a colon prep.. allot more effort and discomfort for you in comparison to the small infraction of a poo at delivery.. i wouldn't recommend going to that extreme.. be reassured that if and when that embarrassing moment arrives for you that it will be handled in the most tactful and discreet manor possible by those persons in trusted with your care..

Babies aren't in their mother's stomach.  Babies grow in the uterus.



And sugar doesn't have any direct effect on the growing fetus.  It's only of concern if mother takes so much sugar that it leaves less room in her diet for other, healthier foods; or leads to excess weight gain which can cause problems for the pregnancy.

i can answer that question  while the baby is in utero what happens is if you are having high sugars it send the message to the unborn child pancreas to secret more insulin in which if a child is exposed for long periods of time it cause thickness in the heart and when the baby comes u\out it may suffer from real low blood sugars because it is not in your body any more its very  dangerous for you and the baby

I don't think I am pregnant but what the heck is this?



I was 4 days late for my period (it was supposed to start on Sunday the 26th). On Thursday I started spotting pinkish. It was only obvious when I wiped. Today it is brownish pinkish and not heavy at all. Usually on day 2 I am cramping like a SOB! No pains, no period...



Is this a miscarriage? Is this a funky cycle? Anyone out there with this experience? I tested on Monday with a HPT when I was 1 day late and it was negative. I haven't tested again but if this period doesn't pick up to normal today I will test again tomorrow.



I am also kind of dizzy right now. Kind of like vertigo but I am sitting upright in a chair. Weird.

hey don't take all the bashing personally your 14 you don't know any better but u cant be pregnant unless you have had sex. don't feel stupid, try talking to your mom or another adult female you trust and feel comfortable talking to about your period so you can get informed about it. Periods can be very irregular especially when your young and first get them. If you don't have an adult you feel comfortable talking to this about im sure you can get information about your period on the web. Goodluck and dont feel stupid :)

If you are 14, haven't you had any sex ed classes at school yet? If you are being truthful about still being a virgin then you are NOT pregnant !!!!  You may be experiencing an abnormal cycle  which is common in young girls your age.... where you can miss a period, you also could have a sist, if so your obgyn can help you out with this problem, also stress, your diet, anxiety,also remember you are going thru woman hood and your body chemistry constantly changing.  Also remember if you are fooling around just because your partner doesnt go inside you he does produce pre semen and if he rubs you near your vagina and pre semen and if  your hymen (cherry) has been broken which can happen with out sexual intercourse then yes you can get pregnant this way!

Stress, gaining weight, losing weight can cause your period to be off. If you are truly a virgin (oral and anal sex count, too. Anytime you fool around and semen gets ANYWHERE near your vagina, you risk getting pregnant. It's not a high chance, but the risk is still there.), then there's no way you can be pregnant.



If your period doesn't come in a few weeks, talk to your mom. As long as you're not sexually active, you should have nothing to hide from her, but you do need to talk to a doctor to rule out anything out of the ordinary.

If you did not have sex, or have a penis anywhere near your vagina opening, then you are not pregnant.



At your age it is normal to skip a month as your body is still developing.  All sorts of things can make you skip a month, have two in a month, skip a few months, have a LONG period, etc... stress is a common cause of a cycle than is running amok!

Do We Have To Answer That!!  If you haven't had sex than NO YOUR NOT Pregnant.  Do you have an adult you can talk to??  The ONLY WAY to get pregnant is to have sex with a man, or theirs the artificial way with the semen.  I would go to the doctor.  You could have something wrong with your ovaries.  My periods would change in huge amount of days every couple of months in my 20's and it turned out I had a cyst on my ovary that was the size of a basketball.  NO LIE!  I don't want to get you freaked out but just have it checked out to make sure your all fine.  Do you have stress in your life that will cause the period to fluctuate too.  Good Luck and DON'T listen to people that tell you that you can still get pregnant if your still a virgin.

If you are a virgin, then you cannot be pregnant.  Otherwise, there are other reasons for not having your period.  It could be a medical condition that you would need to see a doctor for.  Also, it could be your age.  You are still young, so you may just be irregular.  My first symptom of pregnancy, before my missed period was swollen and sore breasts.

I can't believe how rude people are. Apparently they have all known everything their entire lives & have never been a teenager w/ a changing body. Making fun of a question yet spelling their sarcastic response wrong. Anyway, like the majority of other people said, your period could be irregular. Very common. You may want to say something to your mom or dr about it though. (& if you are or do have sex, make sure you use protection & see a dr. then too!)

i agree how can you be a virgin and think you are pregnant unless you sucked sperm out of a cup using a squeeze thing and put it inside you and that is very unlikely unless you are just stupid?



so lets see the number one reason for missing your period other than pregnancy is STRESS!!!!!



you are a hormonal 14 year only baby girl i am sure you have lots of stress.

You can get pregnant without having sex.  Having a little romantic encounter in the bath tub is one example of how.  Though the likelihood is not huge, it can happen.



Given your age, don't worry about it too much unless you've been romantically involved with someone.

First of all breathe lol... And listen.
If you are a virgen there is no way to become pregnant first of all. And yes it is super normal... You are at the age that you can get irregular periods. Your period may not come back for three months and that is normal and you have nothing to worry about... I have lost mine for five before. It is normal. Just means you are growing hun. So, if anything it is a good thing not a bad one.
No worries you are fine...

You cant be pregnant if you are a virgin. Geez that silly to think you could be. Sperm is need to fertilise the egg. If you havent had sex, there is no sperm to make a baby.

alrighty then! i guess someone didn't see the "video" ok so here's the bottom line! you CANNOT be pregnant without sperm. if you had not had any sexual relations this month... then you can relax. if you did... too bad to say you MIGHT be pregnant.  ok a period rarely ever goes off track, but there is all the chance in the world that it will come late. IF U ARE A VIRGIN U ARE NOT PREGNANT!!!

I know you wrote you love him but it really sounds to me that you are questioning if you love him or not. And if you are questioning it then  Yes you care about him as a human being but you are not in love with him. I LOVE my husband I never question that. We fight sometime and at that time I know I dislike him for whatever reason but I always Know my love.



If you are having these feelings Please be very careful in this relationship. Because there is already one child that could be hurt by the separation you sure don't need another. But don't stay because of the child because If you two are fighting as bad as you say that is not good for your baby either.



Hope you figure it all out. I know it has to be hard. Good Luck!!

Personally, I cannot get the two confused. It is just not an entanglement I get into.



I do know others who can get them mixed up, and it sounds like you do. If you don't know, then you have it confused.

Why is everyone telling people they should wait to be married before they have a baby?



ok i know from experience if you are married and have children they guy can still up and leave you and the kids. been there done that there is no way u can say being married is the best way for someone to go when its really there choice when they get married. Getting married and the guy up and leaves puts more on a person then not being married and he ups and leaves. if your not married then you dont have to worry about the cost of divorce or what all he will take from u in it. Im sry but i dont believe people should be telling women its the best way for them to go is to get married before they decide on anything. It is really up to the women if they want to be married and when they get married. If they want to have a baby while they are engaged or something like that, fine have it, just like marriage there is no way to know if the father will stay.

More morning sickness, less likely to have a miscarriage? Is that true? Have you heard it?



I was browsing around online yesterday and I caught a brief snippet that said something about if you're having nausea it's a good sign b/c doctors have linked this to decrease chance of miscarriage. I had to close down the website really quick b/c my boss was coming and now I can't find the website. I searched the topic and I did get some statements stating this is true but they were from people in blogs, not any medical websites stating that. It would make sense to me though because if everything's not forming properly, hcg levels will be low, if hcg levels are low, not enough to cause sickness. I had a m/c last month and I'm pregnant again and I'm so worried about this baby but one thing I did notice is last time I had absolutely no sickness. This time, I'm sick everyday. I know sickness doesn't mean every things ok and lack of sickness doesn't mean everything's not ok. But if th ere's any truth to this theory, it will put my mind at ease.

I'm sure you are fine.  I had some morning sickness and so did my friends who are pregnant.  Some of us had it worse than others... but we are all through the "miscairrage stage".  As long as you are not going through any sharp pain in our lower abdomen or cramping you will be just fine.  Rest easy mom.

I did not have a lot of morning sickness, and I had a very healthy pregnancy.



I think people are more likely to suspect miscarriage when your pregnancy is proceeding in a way that is really different for you.  I have a friend who has been through many pregnancies and always had a lot of morning sickness.  Then she had a pregnancy that she wasn't sick at all, and she did lose that baby.  The doctors said that she probably didn't have the morning sickness because her pregnancy was not progressing normally, since morning sickness was normal for her.

So sorry to hear of your MC.
I MC in March 07 at 11 1/2 weeks. I was sicker than a dog every day. With that pregnancy, I was the sickest of the three pregnancies.
I know this doesn't help.



I just wanted to let you know that experts say that sickness is a good sign, but it's not a guarantee.



Best of luck!

I heard that and I asked my doctor. The thought is women who have morning sickness have HCG and progesterone levels high enough AND rising to support a pregnancy. I was all freaked out because I never got it. However, I had high HCG and high progesterone that was rising. Not all women react to hormones the same. He said just ONE pregnancy symptom (tender breasts, fatigue etc) indicate adequate hormone levels. But it's not a guarantee one way or the other.

Secrets on Natural Remedies for Morning Sickness



New research has found that because women with morning sickness don’t feel like eating or drinking, they may find themselves dehydrated, which could be compounding and creating the symptoms of morning sickness and impairing prenatal health. Proper hydration is critical to every system and process in your body. At the first sign of morning sickness, nausea or vomiting, increase your fluid intake of water throughout the day. Morning sickness is a thirst signal of both the mother and the baby. Be sure that you are drinking water throughout the day and evening.



The next top remedy for morning sickness is to reach for a high protein snack to eat as soon as you feel nausea coming on. Protein and water are the two top building blocks for pregnancy. Morning sickness is a signal from the body that more building materials are necessary for baby. You can have a protein snack and a glass of water before bedtime to eliminate morning nausea.

i also had a miscarriage and am now pregnant again.with my first pregnancy that lead to a miscariage i was very sick. the baby died at 8 weeks but i didn't find out until 12. i had no warning that anything was wrong.my symtoms never disappeared. this time i am sick all the time again and a 12 weeks ultrasound shows the baby is fine. I WORRY about everything with this pregnancy too,but unfortunetly there is no truth to the more morning sickness the better.when i went to the dr's i asked this question and they said it's your body that makes the hormones for the first few week not the baby,so if your body doesn't realise something is wrong with the baby (which happened to me)your body will continue to make hormones that make you sick.
try to relax im sure everything will b fine.
good luck.

Could be true. However that wasn't the case for me. With my second child I had no morning sickness at all it was a perfect pregnancy. Then a year later I got pregnant again well the morning sickness as all day sickness. It lasted 5 months and then he was born at 6 months and his weight was 1070g or 2bls 4 oz.



What an experience then a year after that I had the same issue, all day sickness, bleeding at 3 months and then she was born at 5 months 3 weeks. Her weight was 810g or 1bls 12 oz.  I also had 2 miscarriages and the morning sickness was ridiculous. I miscarried at 2 1/2 months with both.



I think every ones body is so different. I have 4 kids and each one was different the weight gain, the cravings, the heaviness, sickness, the way the belly was shaped, the size of the baby. Man some people have some HUGE babies. So to answer you question I think the only one that can really answer that question is our creator himself.



Pregnancy is always very interesting to me. I love hearing  peoples story's. Everyone is different none are exactly the same.

they say that they are linking morning sickness to the occurance of more pregnancy hormones, HCG, Progesterone etc... this generally means a healthier pregnancy, or healthier fetus, less likely to abort. thugh i have been on both ends of the spectrum with Hyperemesis and No morning sickness at all, and both are healthy as a horse... this one I have hyperemesis again...

When I was pregnant, I was very sick. I went to my doctor and complained of throwing up a lot and she said "Good. Women who throw up a lot rarely miscarry." There are never any guarantees, but I just thought I'd pass on these words she gave me. If you aren't sick, that doesn't mean you will miscarry. I've known plenty of women who felt fine and had healthy pregnancies. Best of luck!

I had twins via c-section, one came out with no tugging and the other required a lot of tugging (up under my ribs).  I was awake.  It did not hurt it just was odd.  The part that hurt the most was the spinal. Then everything was good!  I bounced back very quickly from the c-section, not a lot of pain.  Good Luck!

I was also a wake when i had my c section, yes you do feel the tugging which isn't a nice experience but it don't last for long at all.
I was only allowed 1 person to come with me when i had the section so my fiance came with me.
If you have someone to be with you, just try and keep talking to them to try and take your mind off what they are doing.
Just remember the tugging isn't for long and soon after that you will be holding your bundle of joy in your arms

I was awake for my c-section and honestly felt nothing. I was terrified and shaking. They had to tie my arms down because the medicine was making me shake. They said that's normal. I was really afraid to be awake. I was on the table for a few minutes while they were prepping me and I said "Tell me when you start." The doctor said "Congratulations- it's a boy!" I didn't even know they had started. I also heard it's common to throw up during the surgery. Luckily, I didn't. I did after it was over. I promise I felt no pain at all, but I was really scared. Good luck!

Going docs in a couple of hours, need advice first though (please read inside!)?



About 4/5 weeks ago, when I had my break from my pill, I didnt start it again because it was causing me problems. A couple of weeks after stopping it, I had unprotected sex quite a few times for a week/week and a half. I am going the doctors soon to see if she can prescribe me a different one, but how likely is it I'm pregnant already? I've not had any obvious symptoms, I've just been weeing a lot and my skin has broken out in the last week (it doesnt usually!!). Will my doc want to do a preg test before she will prescribe another pill?

It's possible. People get pregnant from just missing four pills.



I would ask the doctor to give me a pregnancy test if it was me.



And remember that when you're not on the pill, you're not protected.

Don’t assume you’ll get a test. Tell the doc you stopped your pills, had intercourse and have no idea if you’re pregnant or not. Ask for a test1



Modern formulations of pills aren't likely to cause issues for a developing baby, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

Tell the doctor all what you have told us. This is like reading my life! i am now 27 weeks pregnant, never had any spots before i fell pregnant and then just had a sudden break out, i must have only been a couple weeks gone. Then more and more signs was showing like feeling sick brests hurting ect so i did a test to find out i was 5 weeks pregnant. Good luck

They should absolutly give you a pregnancy test before prescribing new pills, and if they dont do one automatically absolutly request one......I found out I was pregnant 4 days before I missed a period,  I knew cause I was peeing a lot more and my face broke out and I had sore breasts......Anything is possible....I didnt have any really noticable signs either, still don't and I'm 8 weeks, never had morning sickness.  Best of luck to you!

you could be pregnant already however even if she prescribes you the pill you cant start taking it till your first day of your period any way, so even if you are pregnant you'll notice sooner or later if you dont have a period. when starting a new pill or starting to take the pill for the first time you still have to start it on the first day of your period, just be patient do tell the doctor just in case she wants you to do a test today xxx

Really, there's no predicting when labour will start based on dilation. Baby will come when he or she is ready. Not too much longer now. Good luck!

i had a missed miscarriage in june and needed a d&c.we had seen the heart beat at 8 weeks and it died at 8 weeks and 6 days.i didn't find out until my 12 weeks scan though.i got pregnant again in august.when i tested for this pregnancy i got the faintest positive and had to confirm it with a blood test. with my first pregnancy that miscarriage my positive was very very dark,this one was so light. it really depends on how far along you are and how much hormone is in your body,thats what determins the darkeness of the positive. with my miscarriage i felt pregnant and with this pregnancy i dont.i have all the symtoms i just dont feel pregnant. i bleed and spotted all through this pregnany which scared me so much but all my ultrasounds showed a healthy baby.i just had my 12 weeks scan and everythings fine so hopefully this pregnancy will work out.
im sure your pregnancy will to.
good luck.

Tell your parents. I know it's seems like the last thing that you want to do right now, but at this point, being so young, you ahve no choice. Depending, on your spiritual beleifs, abortion is an option; howeve,r I would seriousy reconsider that choice, as I have friends that did it young and not regret it.
Make an appointment with your general doctor. You acn do that without your parents knowing, and if it comes up on the insurance, tell them teh truth then
Good luck

Your 14 and been having sex with 2 boys and now you don't no who the dad is? If you think you are old enough to have sex then you should be old enough to use a condom or on birth control too. I'm not giving you a hard time but you are going to make the hardest decision of your life. There are so many teenage pregnancy's out there and a baby is the nicest thing you can catch, there are some really nasty STD's about. Talk to your parents, yeah they will go mad but they will help you to make the right choice for you, and for god sake use a condom next time

Talk to your parents first...



Are you financially ready for a baby?
Are you physically ready for a baby?
Will the father stick by your side and not leave you?
Are you willing to give up a little bit of your social life and lose a few friends along the way?
Are you ready to stay up all hours of the night with a screaming baby?
Will your family help support you?



If you answered yes to all those questions, then I don't see a problem keeping the baby, rasing a child is a difficult job and not as easy as it seems, sorry if those questions were bit harsh...you just really need to consider that first. Talk to your doctor about your options as soon as you can! good luck with everything :)

dang, how did you get yourself in that mess. well, now you are going to have to get yourself out of it. it is not like you could go to your boyfriends for help, because they are young and they are going to be really mad to fine out that you were sleeping with both of them. Ok, go to you parents, but good luck, not really the pregnant part but the i have two boys that i was sleeping with and i don't know the daddy part. anyways, good luck, and get insurance, and also next time keep your legs close you are too young for this.

The most important things is that you have a talk with him.

ok, well first off you shouldn't be having sex when your 14, that'scially with more than one guy that's just asking for pregnancy, STD's, etc. my advice is fess up and tell your parents tell them the whole truth, and maybe they can help you figure out a decision. If you think your old enough to be having sex, your old enough to use some kind of birth control!! now, your going to have a long road ahead of you, worrying about if your baby has everything it needs, finding your babies daddy, and a whoe lot more. by the time you have this baby and get everything you need you really will be broke, you wont even be able to buy a CONDOM WRAPPER..no joke. maybe call the maury show?? they help people who get  in big messes like this, and can't take care of themselves, let alone a baby.

The last thing you want right now is a lecture, but prepare yourself for one when you tell your parents. I was 16 when i got pregnant the first time. I know how you are feeling. I dont know what state you live in, but find out if they have a planned parenthood or another type of clinic. They are private, you can go have a formal test, be looked at buy a doctor free of charge. They do cancelling and will help you decide what would be best for you. Please note to all they give all options. If you are comfortable with your mom tell her first, if you need to go to the clinic first they will give you the support that you need to talk to your parents. Please note that no matter what you think neither one of those boys will be around to raise that child, or help with money. know from experience

First thing is first.. Why are you having sex at 14? Let alone with 2 different people???  Where are your parents? Haven't you ever been talked to about pregnancy, and protection and STD's? I would just like to know what these kids find as the cool thing to do! I didn't dare to have sex until I was 17 years old. I got pregnant at 19, and Im now 24 and have 2 kids! (I am still with the same guy that I lost my virginity to)...But anyways... the first thing you need to do is tell your parents as much as you don't want to, and then make a doctors appointment. Chances are your parents are going to make you get an abortion because for one, you don't know who the father is, and for two because your still a baby yourself. Which if you were my child, and I hope to god that my daughter does NOT do this, you should pay your consequence's and find out who the father is as well as he should pay up! Even if you have never had the "birds and bees" conversation with your parents, your 14, you should know the things that can happen. My motto is You play, you pay! Good Luck with yah!

Question on Delivery!?!?



okay i have a question on delivery, when i was 17 years old which im 20 now i got into a very bad motorcycle accident. we were going around a 20mph curve and the guy driving was going 90mph i flew 2 football fields and landed in a ditch well he died instantly and suffered plenty of broken bones. which one was my pelvic bone. well i guess my question is, since i broke it and its healed now, do you think that there is a chance that i can a vaginal delivery. this is my first baby. or do you think that they will have to a c-section. what do you think? sorry that its long. just been concerned since i have became preggo. haven't been to the doctor yet but i just thought that i would ask. thanks

If it healed properly then I see no reason that you couldn't deliver vaginally.  However, this is a question best asked of your doctor since he would know your medical history.

Its hard to say. They may just let you labor for a while and see how you progress. But I knew a lady who was in a motorcycle accident and her hips or something were broken and she had to have C-sections with her babies. But she also had a metal rod in her hips, so I dont know. But it would definetly be something you should talk to your doctor about.

I would discuss it w/ your doctor.  They can do some tests to measure your pelvis and gauge whether or not it is big enough for the baby to come through.  They also do this when baby's are breech, for women who want to attempt a vaginal delivery w/ breech presentation.



Any time there is trauma to a bone, it is always weaker than before.  So it may cause you more pain and discomfort.  But again, it would be best to talk it over w/ your doctor.  Unless the doctor feels you are at risk attempting a vaginal birth, more often than not they will let you try.



Good luck

<question>



GD & stillbirth? How common? Why?



What causes stillbirth due to Gestational Diabetes? What is the percentage that this actually happens? Wouldn't you have to have had uncontrolled blood sugars since you had it, say, in the 200s or something from day 1 of being diagnosed, or could the ending week or two do it? My sugars have been getting a tad bit higher, not too bad, but I'm still scared. I see the doctor again Monday. I have twice a week NSTs to monitor him and he's fine on those. They have not measured him via u/s at all. (Which I hear is inaccurate, anyway..) But if my sugars are up for a few days .. would this cause my baby to be stillborn? It's only Thursday, so four days until I see the doctor and they do not consider this an emergency to talk to him now.



</question>



<additional details>



Yes, I do have GDM. I was diagnosed around 29 or 30 weeks and I am now 37 as of tomorrow.



Forgot to mention, I'm 100% diet controlled, no insulin whatsoever.

My sugars were up a bit, I took a second test and waiting for the results but if you are being monitored there is nothing to really worry about. Your baby is fine, you only worry if you don't get treatment for it--IF you even have it. I'ts normal to have higher numbers, they just repeat a test.

Lots of risks with Diabetes babies.



First one is that they tend to be very large for their gestational age.  It's not unheard of for a woman to deliver a 37 week baby that weighs 9 pounds.



The big risk with stillbirth is because the placenta begins to deteriorate faster with diabetes babies.  Not sure why, but if baby isn't getting the oxygen and the nutrients it needs, it won't survive very long.  Fortunately, this doesn't happen nearly as much as it used to.



It's not unusual for you to need more insulin as your pregnancy progresses, just adjust accordingly to stay in really tight control.



Good luck to you!

Nope your baby has a gender the second sperm meets egg. If you are talking about the wives tales like what you crave for a boy or girl thats different and not 100% at all. My mom thought my sister was a boy because of all of the wives tales but she was a little girl. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. best of luck!

Nope. The only thing that determines the sex of your baby is whether the sperm that fertilized the egg has an X or a Y sex chromosome. The baby's sex is set as soon as the sperm fertilizes the egg.

No!! The sex of the baby is determined long before you even know you're pregnant, beacuse the dad determines it in his sperm. His sperm is filled with XY (female) and XX (male).. whichever gets hold on your egg is what you will have!

Yes. It's often drank more towards the end, since blue cohosh is more for uterine toning and helps labor. BUT it can also cause spontaneous miscarriage if drank early, since it causes contractions.

As far as black goes, it's said to help induce labor, so I would hold off on that... ALSO this site cautions against it.

I would check with you ob/midwife first, just to be on the safe side.  There are many herbs that you shouldn't take during pregnancy, even though it can be used for pregnancy doesn't mean it won't have some nasty side effects.  Like castor oil persay, it is considered safe, but yet can cause some babies to pass meconium in the uterus, which if they ingest can cause major health problems such as breathing problems if it gets into their lungs.  So to be safe, talk to your doctor first or at least do some heavy duty research to make sure there is no harsh side effects, or any that can potentially hurt your baby.  Best of luck!

First it tastes like a stick why would you want to and second can cause miscarriage or early birth.. no safe... try a rasberry or green tea, rasberry is a uterine toner, and helps when labor comes but wont cause labor, and green tea just tatses fantastic.

no what is wrong with you? alcohol can lead to disabilities, death, etc. in babies. based off of this question I almost wonder or not if you already have been drinking alcohol while you are pregnant and if you have..i feel sorry for your baby.

Try drinking something cold and sweet (like oj).  After about 15 minutes, lie down on your left side and see if you feel more movement.  At 24 weeks, their movements are still irregular, but you should feel them.  They just aren't as predictable as they will become after 28 weeks.  If you are in doubt and worried and the movements seem to be a marked decrease from what you are used to, call your doctor.  Better safe than sorry.



Also remember, the more active you are, the more the baby will sleep.

Yes it is totally normal, no worries
I am 32 weeks pregnant myself and he still has days when he won't move much.
Just remember, they are more active when you are still (going to bed, just waking up, kicking your feet up) when you walk around a lot you are rocking your little precious right to sleep.



Try this, I have noticed that after I eat my little guy seems to be having an arena fight in my tummy!  After you eat a meal take a few minutes to lay down for a bit and I guarantee your baby will move

This may sound weird, but here goes.  When I was PG, I use to listen to music a lot, and when I listened to faster music, and started patting my tummy softly, I would get these little movements.  At night I played quiet music and also patted tummy softly (but much slower), if movement, and asleep she would go. I found what I thought was her little bottom, but was not real sure, so softly I would pat.  When she was born, all I had to do to get her to sleep, was put on the soft slow music, pat her little bottom and asleep she would go.  So maybe some faster music would get some movement going.......



FYI - now my daughter is going to college to do Music Videos.

Drink some orange juice or something sugary and lay on your left side. If you've had a fairly active day she probably just slept most of the day or you didn't notice her kicks. I know on the days I do a lot all day long I notice by like 6PM that I hadn't felt her kick much but once I lay down she starts kicking away. Best of luck!

Get a pregnancy test done!  And the next time you have sex, USE PROTECTION!!!!  It only takes one time to get pregnant!  Be wise.  Enjoy your youth and do something with your life!

So you know you can get the test still, the stores can't stop you from getting it. That would be the best thing you can do. If you've been worrying about this since your first had sex then you could just be going through that phase where you think you are but it could be the real deal. Just go one day when you can to the local store and pick up a test.

Is this normal proceedure during pregnancy?



i have being seeing a high risk clinic in a public hospital weekly for about 7 months. this is my second child due next friday. my first baby was induced and forceps delivery, epidural and baby wouldnt breast feed.



my questions are...is it normal that i have never been weighed, vaginally examined or breast checked throughout my entire pregnancy? also i havent been asked about what sort of birth/delivery options i may be thinking about or pain relief or anything. nor have i even met with the anaethetist.



is this because it is my second child even though they are 16 years apart? or are they just really slack? i dont remember it being like this before or has it changed a lot in 16 years?

i live in adelaide south australia. every week almost i have had blood pressure taken, blood tests done, heart listened to and 5 ultra sounds. in the first pregnancy they did vaginal swabs etc checked the nipples to see if inverted or whatever. but yeah at 39 weeks no checking of dilation or anything. if i dont have bubs b4 wednesday i will be asking all these questions coz i am a bit concerned now.

That's actually ridiculous. You should be weighed every single checkup and my doctor gives me a vaginal exam every checkup and a breast exam every couple (of course I don't go weekly)....

I had a breast exam and a vaginal exam my first appointment. I've had a few vaginal exams since 28 weeks but that was due to contractions - most women have them at the first appointment and then 36 weeks to delivery. I haven't yet been asked about my delivery options by the doctor as that is asked closer to delivery at the 36 week appointment +.



I find it VERY odd you have never been weighed. I am weighed at every appointment.

You should be weighed at EVERY visit. Vaginal exams are unnecessary and may pose more harm than good. So it depends on WHY you're high risk on that one really. But normally, a PAP is done at the very beginning and many doctors start checking for dilation during the last month. Most do not discuss the other things unless YOU bring it up.



**edit**Dialtion is completely irrelevent as to when labor will begin...that's why many don't bother checking..it only introduces a risk of infection. If you have been havign regular ultrasounds, and it sounds from your added comments that you have, they can measure the length of your cervix that way as well. During my second pregnancy mine was measured that way several times. It will shorten before any real dilation takes place.

Here in the US they weigh you to watch for excessive weight gain, which could be a sign of gestational diabetes or other problems. A vaginal exam in early pregnancy determines you're pregnant and how far along, and towards the end they'll see if there's any progress. You can always refuse them, however. They also do an internal to test you for Group B strep. They normally do a breast checkup early on to check for lumps and other oddities.



I find it strange - there are many women on here from the UK and Europe who post medical questions and it sounds like they don't do anything over there. I mean, sometimes I'll agree that in the US, pregnancy is often 'medicalized' or treated like a disease, but our doctors tend to be very proactive. There is also the lawsuit issue if something should happen. Don't UK doctors do anything? Just curious.

I would assume some of this would differ depending on where you live.



I am in the UK and was weighed at my original appointment,  I have never had a vaginal examination for this or my last baby,  nor did I have my breasts checked.



Because of a previous c-section I was seen at 20 weeks by my consultant,  to discuss plans for this birth (c section or VBAC) but I believe this is not the norm.  I haven't met an anesthetist,  but didn't last time around until the morning of my c-section.

Wow actually they are suppose to do all of that! weight you and measure your tummy and ask you all sort of questions. I don't think there's anything that have to do if you haven't had a  baby since 16yrs.
Actually everything has advance you practically are going to start all over again. I'm going to be a new mommy my oldest baby is 4 yrs, old
Totally new...

No,this is not normal that they haven't done any of those things. I would ask them why.If u know that this is not normal how they are going about it. Do u not have a regular ob/gyn? if not,maybe it's about time to find one. I was high-risk with both of mine and they still did that stuff. I would speak up. Good luck!

That is not normal at all.  Maybe you should look into a delivering your baby at a different hospital.



Was your pregnancy automatically marked high risk due to advanced maternal age or were there early problems?  If you have even an inkling that there may be a problem during L&D .. please go somewhere else.  I'd hate to see the health and wellfare of you and your child rest in the hands of a place that didnt even have you weigh in.



Good luck!  Wow ..16 years apart.  My youngest and this baby will be 9 years .. and i thought that was a stretch!

Sorry this just doesnt sound right. I was weighed at each appointment and examined a couple of times. They should be examinig you more often since you do have a "high risk" pregnancy. I would definetly ask whats going on and if that doesnt seem right I would definelty change hospital before the baby is born. Doctors are supposed to ask you what youre thinking about as far as delivery option. You will not meet the Anesthesiologist until you are in labor at the hospital and you request an epideral or if you have to be induced. Please get these questions answered before you give birth. want everyone to be healthy. GOOD LUCK!

well I guess I kinda knew....there wasn't any defining symptom it was just a "feeling" I had and both times it turned out I was right.  With the last 2 pregnancies I wasn't really "trying" though....we just weren't preventing anymore because we wanted to get pregnant.  It took 6months to conceive the first time and 10months to conceive the second time (ended in mc) so both times it was a bit of a surprise that it finally happened.

I didn't know but my husband did. I couldn't remember my last period and was concerned and he was just like, "You're pregnant. Call the doctor." I hadn't even tested yet and was in total denial. Once I did test, I was shocked and cried (even though we definitely wanted three kids, I just wasn't ready now LOL). With our first I was convinced he was a girl and my husband thought it was a boy, and he was right. I think he has better intuition than I do! LOL

I dont know how I knew but I just did. I had taken a pregnanct test a week before and it came back negative. I still thought I was pregnant. My boyfriend, his friends and I went out to the bar and usually Im all for drinking but I just didnt feel like it so I just nursed a beer all night. The next morning I was feeling queezy so I took another test and sure enough! I was 'a little bit' pregnant (I say a little bit pregnant, because I was only 5 weeks along and the line was a very faint one)
I almost lost her too, at 7 weeks my waters leaked and my doctor told me I was going to lose her, so I waited and no miscarriage. I changed my doctor and I am now 37 weeks pregnant!!

With my first I didn't know before I took the test. However w/ my 2nd boy I knew & I took a Frist response the one that's suppose to tell you 5 days before your missed period. Well I took it 4 days & it sad negative but I knew that I was b/c I got so sick to my stomach one night after dinner at the movies I thought I was going to be sick & had heartburn that was unbearable not like my usual heartburn. So I took it on Fathers Day 2006 one day after my missed period & it was positive. Then with my 3rd boy I knew b/c it was three & half months after my middle son was born. I finished dinner & as soon as my last bite was swallowed I was sick to my stomach. So, I packed up the other two boys & went to the store & bought like 6 tests. They were all positive! I was surprised to say the least. It was fun telling my hubby though b/c it was very unexpected. We weren't trying at all to have another one & I definitely would've waited at least a year like I did the first time.

It is not a good idea to lay on your stomach. Go buy a body pillow and lay on your side with the pillow between your legs. It is the best way to lay when you are pregnant, plus when you lay on your side with the pillow between your legs, it takes the pressure off of your back.

It bothers some people but not others. Think for a second: that same organ (your uterus) that is going to give you a round belly later is already growing. If you lay on your belly, it’s going to put pressure on the organs behind your uterus. Of course it’s going to be bothersome at some point.

if it makes you feel this way then you shouldn't do it. The reason you feel that way when you do is because you are putting pressure on the baby and your expanding uterus. If you are concerned about this feeling, talk to your doctor, but as a mother of 3 and a health care professional it is my opinion that you should not be weight bearing on your stomach.

Yes it can be,  you will NOT crush your baby (at any stage although at this stage baby is only the size of a lime) laying on your stomach,  but if it makes you sick change position.



Also when you get bigger your baby will let you know when he / she is not happy with the position you are laying in.  I was in hospital last week and the baby was going nuts - the midwife told me it was because the baby was not happy with me in that position and just to listen to myself and the baby.



I have to sleep on my side with no leaning towards laying on tummy or baby goes nuts and wakes me up.

I don't think I am pregnant but what the heck is this?



I was 4 days late for my period (it was supposed to start on Sunday the 26th). On Thursday I started spotting pinkish. It was only obvious when I wiped. Today it is brownish pinkish and not heavy at all. Usually on day 2 I am cramping like a SOB! No pains, no period...



Is this a miscarriage? Is this a funky cycle? Anyone out there with this experience? I tested on Monday with a HPT when I was 1 day late and it was negative. I haven't tested again but if this period doesn't pick up to normal today I will test again tomorrow.



I am also kind of dizzy right now. Kind of like vertigo but I am sitting upright in a chair. Weird.

it sounds to me that you could very well be pregnant! i was 4 days late with my period and stopped really light pink for a day and it stopped and now its a week since the spotting and i have no signs of a normal period. just wait a week and test again. with my daughter i had to wait until i was 6.5-7 weeks before the test said positive. i still have a week and a half until it is 6 weeks since my last period. and im not testing again until then. good luck to you!

I would guess implantation bleeding as well but I was two days late and mine came out positive. It's supposed to help to take the test in the morning when you first empty your bladder.

I would take another test. If it turns out negative then I would make an Dr appointment to see what's going on. It could be nothing but it's better to check & make sure.

This sounds to me like it is implantation bleeding. This is not in any form a  miscarriage.



I had this experience.. a few times. You're probably testing a little bit early, test again. If you still do not have a period within the next few days or a positive test, ask the doctor for a blood test.



The good thing is the dizziness, believe it or not. It is caused by the rise in hormones from the pregnancy. (I can almost guarantee you are pregnant. I've done this before. lol)

Sounds like you're pregnant to me! This happened to me not long ago too! My period are suppose to start on 22th but it didnt! I got all these like you! After 8days of missing my period i went for a check. I was pregnant! I feel dizzy as well! as if gonna black out anytime.



You might want to check again on 5th nov? it normally takes 4-8days to know if you're pregnant! Best is to keep yourself easy, don't stress about thinking it! What will happen will happen. Good Luck and all the best! ;D

Morning sickness occurs in 50 to 80% of new mom's to be. It's unfortunate that for many, the morning sickness will strike all through the day and not just in the morning. Most cases of morning sickness start between the 4th and 6th week of pregnancy and lasts until the 14th to 16th week. An easy way to calculate this would be 5 or 6 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period.
The morning sickness can be accompanied by other signs of pregnancy like backaches, constipation, darkening of areola (breast nipple), excessive salivation, exhaustion or feeling sleepy, food cravings, frequent urination, headaches, increased sense of smell, lower abdominal cramps, and/or tender or swollen breasts



When my best friends sister got pregnant..  she didn't feel sick yet.. the first sign that she was pregnant.. she started ''spotting again'' meaning her acne came back.. she was working in a shop and an elderly gentleman said to her '' back to puberty?'' after that she went to see her doctor...and yes she was pregnant.. My mom had flu like symptoms.. and a lot more appetite than usual.. she went to the doctor.. thinking this was the flu.. her family physician could tell her .. ''if this is the flu.. you got 7 more months of it ahead of you. You are 2 months pregnant... she had cravings for certain foods and she got sick at the sight of the colour red in drinks...

Stress can cause a missed period.
No birth control is 100% effective. If you used a condom and it didnt break or fall off, you're most likely NOT pregnant.

You never mentioned how old you are, if you are still very young it is very possible that you have missed a period due to not completing puberty yet, you must expect many changes in your body if you are still going through puberty.

Mistake with social worker during pregnancy...Help.?



Yesterday me and my fiance had an appointment with the hospital and they had us meet with a social worker. He asked us questions and when it came time when he asked about me and my fiance about fighting and stuff I made a mistake and said that I have gotten mad at him and slapped him when he got under my skin and that I pushed him through a door because i thought that he swung it in my face.



that is the only time that I came off mean to them everything else I said was calm and nice. But my fiance said that they could now possibly take my baby away from me...i'm nervous because I want my baby so much and i'm not abusive at all.



Do you guys think that the social worker can take it away from me and if so what can I do to fix this? I dont need a social worker.

not all woman feel symptoms straight away i only had mild cramps and a sore left breast till i got to 7 weeks then it all hit me at once so just be thank full you don't have to much yet as it could happen over night, good you have seen the doctor are you taking your prenatals? and as for your breast hurting on the out side that's so normal as well, happy 9maths xx



edit..if your taking your pregnycare vitamins that could be the reason for constipation as well, if it gets to bad see your doctor as straining to much can cause piles

ha ha for me its goodnight!!  With both my children the first symptom even before missing a period was sore breasts especially nipples and maybe peeing a little more frequently but besides missing a period not alot else till about 6 weeks to the day both times when the nausea started - although I never got it that bad.  The worst symptom for me was the extreme tiredness but that also came after 6 weeks -  there was quite a few times especially in my first pregnancy that I felt like I must have been dreaming the whole thing and would keep checking the pregnancy test just to make sure it was actually real!!  LOL - you will probably look back at this in a week or so's time and think oh no what was I worried about in between feeling incredibly tired and sick!!  All the best with your pregnancy!

i am the same, i am 6 weeks pregnant.  my doctor said mornign sickness doesn't really kick in till 7 weeks, so maybe, like me, you might have that to look forward to!  i am the same as you, really, constipated (but last week i had the woooorst indigestion and bloating ever!  my stomach was so swollen i looked about 5 months, not weeks!)



and yes, my boobs for the first 5 weeks didn't hurt, and its only when they are touched (lol) that they are a little more sensitive, but not necessarily painful.



i think you're fiiiine, cos i am if you are lol :) but seriously, its still very early days, you've got the swollen ankles and all of that to come :)



good luck, and congratulations! x

You will be fine..Its only normal to feel all that anxiety.Trust me it doesn't leave you for the whole of the 40 weeks.No one really feels pregnant for the first 7 weeks..Because your em bro is only really 5 weeks then and it s the size of a cashew.The symptoms of pregnancy will soon take hold of you.Not everyone feels sick.Your appetite has increased which is a good sign.You must be tired to.But look out the bub will let you know its there.How bloody exciting..Are you going to find out what it is???

Your worrying way to much. Your going to be fine and your baby is going to be fine. Your just so exited and need to know more because it's your first. But to be honest about your gums bleeding I think you should go to the dentist because my mum told me that when your pregnant your teeth and gums can get bad so to always get them checked especially if you've had some signs there is something wrong with your teeth.

Good Morning, 1st thing I'd like to say is Lucky Lucky you that aren't going through all the pregnancy symptoms and if you were you'd be feeling totally drain constantly. You have no need to worry over it, you still have a long way to go aswell. I guess that it's understandable that your feeling worried all the time since this is your first but try not to sooo much, just let nature take it's course. If you worry and stress out then ur baby will pick up on that. Enjoy not having any of the symptoms while it might last coz ur still in the early stages so you might just get them later. I hope you get ur wish for a boy, I have two boys so I'm kinda hoping for a girl but as long as he/she is healthy I don't mind at all. YOU'LL BE FINE HUN! Lyn xx

Have you ever spotted during pregnancy? If you have, it might be normal for you but DEFINITELY CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY!
It could be that sex caused it, it also could be that your spotting and could have lost your mucus plug and could be labor onset. I miscarried, actually, gave pre term birth late in my pregnancy, and I was barely spotting, it wasn't lots of blood, but I knew it wasn't right for me. Insist on going in and having a sonogram, make sure there is no leak, and make sure the sonographer looks well!

I've had two live births and the bleeding after both was very different, one was light and over after only a few days the other felt like it was never going to stop. Either way, if you are worried it is always best to have a chat with your Dr or a nurse to put your mind at rest, you'll probably feel better after a little medical reassurance. Good luck and best wishes on your resent arrival.

Okay, well the pain could be your uterus going back to normal but if you're not breastfeeding, the milk should have stopped by now. This is something you should bring up with your OB.

IS IT A POSSIBILITY I AM PREGNANT?



I STARTED ORTHO TRYCYCLINE LO A MONTH AGO.  AFTER MY PERIOD CAME, I NOTICE MY PERIOD ENDED ON ON SUNDAY NIGHT OR EARLY MONDAY MORNING. SO I WAITED THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY TO START MY PILL. THE THURSDAY BEFORE SUNDAY (THE DAY I START MY PILL) I HAD UNPROTECTED SEX WITH MY B/F. I TOOK MY PILL SUNDAY LIKE I WAS SUPPOSE TO AND HAD UNPROTECTED SEX AGAIN ON MONDAY (AFTER I TOOK MY PILL SUNDAY). WHEN I WAS CONVERSATING WITH MY BEST FRIEND AND TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED. SHE TOLD ME TAKE A PILL CAN CAUSE MENTALL ILLNESS TO MY CHILD IN THE EVENT I AM PREGNANT, SO I HAVEN'T TAKEN A PILL SINCE THE SUNDAY I WAS SUPPOSE TO.  IS MY FRIEND RIGHT WITH THE MENTAL ILLNESS AND WHEN IS A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO TAKE A PRAGNANCY TEST TO SEE IN FACT, IF IM PREGNANT OR NOT?

Prescription drugs are very dangerous even fatal for a embryo in development. And also take a drug to get it in your system it takes about three days. So taking it once in awhile will not stop anything. And about the pregnancy test i would wait until your next cycle if you can not wait you can usally take it about 3 weeks about the unprotected sex. And i would bet you are not pregnant because the conceiving cycle does bot start until one to two weeks before your monthly cycle. The egg travels down you fallopian tubes into your uterus and then it waits to be fertilized and that takes about two weeks give or take and when it is done waiting that is when you period comes. So i hope that help and good luck in the future.

lady before me is right we aren't doc on here but, im pretty sure it's only for prolonged use of pill while pregnant first few months i don't imagine would hurt baby, as for doing a test there are tests you can do 5 days before your missed period meaning in 3 weeks time you could do one, otherwise to find out quicker you can go to doc and they will do blood test you can find out this way too.  Good luck hope things turn out the way you  would like.

Why do women find it scary to have a baby with Down syndrome?



Why do women find it scary or so wrong to give birth to a baby with Down syndrome? Do you think the majority of women choose to abort their baby after finding out the chances of their baby have a chromosomal defect, do it because they're superficial and selfish? I mean, I understand that anybody would be concerned after finding it out, but why not educate yourself and prepare for the arrival of the child you've been blessed with. My opinion is that they're superficial and selfish, but of course, it's just my opinion and many people would BEG to differ. But what do other people think about this? And please NO complaints about precious taxes going to poeple with down syndrome. I thinks it's money better spent rather than on some lazy people receiving government checks. I've read a lot of comments to other questions about people with DS, and comments about tax money always pops up, it's annoying.



</question>



<additional details>



Yes my son has Down syndrome. Just before I asked the question, I was reading some other questions and comments dealing with Down syndrome, and a lot of the comments were so absurb and very hurtful, that I had to ask "Why"?



I think it becomes a scary thing after you read and hear about how so many people feel about it. And doctors aren't any better either, many of them encourage terminating the pregnancy by scaring women into thinking that there's no hope for these children.



By the way, NO, just because I have a child with DOES NOT mean I think it's okay for everyone to have one. That is not part of my question...I'm asking why are people scared. It was not a biased question, it's open to any educated answer or opinion.



But, with that said, I really think it's inappropriate to post ignorant comments like that female who said it's abnormal. The comment was just uncalled for and ridiculous.

Have you had a baby with DS? or been told your baby has it?
I have 2 friends with DS babies (one who was only 18 when she had her first daughter so its not an age thing)  Her daughter was in and out of hospital with serious heart defects which were part of her condition, she didnt walk until 7 and is still haivng issues with alot of things as part of the condition, my other friends daughter is 4 and she had some serious issues as a baby, trouble feeding, and with her eyes, but shes doing very well in kindergarten and will most likely be in a public school as her condition isnt as serious



Im not sure what exactly it is you are asking. Down syndrome can be a big deal for some people, especially older couples who find out when therye 40+ that their baby has this, some DS children NEVER live on their own, or get jobs, it does depend on the severity of the condition as it can vary greatly.



I have also worked with DS adults, and most of them are just lovely, I personally have never had the worry of one of my children having DS, but I decided decades ago, when working with them, that if I ever did find out I was pg with a child with that condition, all I would do is educate myself and do the best I can



But of course that is me. and everyone is different. And if faced with it in reality Im sure most people would be shocked to say the least

I think your correct, that many couples or mothers will abort thier children that have possible defects becaue they are scared and selfish. Meaning if they know that something is going to be wrong with their child, rather then educating themselves about it, they take the easy way out and abort it. My psychology teacher was telling us the other day that she would abort the baby becaue she wouldnt want her child to go through everyday struggles with having Down Syndrome. To me I was shocked to hear her say this. My mouth literally dropped. I guess I could see her stance in this, but children with DS can get the help they need and can be treated and function like "normal"  children( I know that is politically incorrect). I would rather give my child a chance at life than aborting it because their life may be a little harder. I am a firm believer in everything that happens, usually happens for a reason. God gave you a child, a child that is yours for a reason, and you must love it not matter what the circumstances are. Meanwhile there are thousands of couples out there whom are dying to have children that are infertile, and these mothers are just aborting thier child from chromosomal defects. I know if my child were to have a choromosmal defect, I would love it no matter what and learn how to deal with and what to expect. Good Question! Has my mind thinking at 1:30 a.m. but that is good!

It is scary... because most people are dealing with an "unknown" and have their own misconceptions and have never personally been around people with DS. look at it this way...not long ago if you gave birth to a child with DS the parents were told to institutionalize them and that they would never be productive or lead "normal" lives. to bring a child home and care for them even 30 yrs ago was rare.  well those misconceptions are still visible today...not just in DS but in the way we look, what jobs we have, what religion we are....and so on. You and I both know how special our kids are, but for the "general public" they really have no clue. To some  our kids are considered less than perfect...little do they know what wonderful kids we do have. It all boils down to awareness and changing people's attitudes about something they have little information on. I could stand at the top of a mountain and yell that my son is just like everyone else...he still loves, learns, plays and enjoys life to the fullest....some may choose to listen while others may not...it is their choice. If someone is willing to abort a child because of DS...well in my mind they better make an informative decision and not one based on how it will "look"to other's to have a child with DS. Raising a child with down syndrome can be difficult at times...but it is in no way impossible and people need to see that. there are so many programs nowadays that are there to support parents and help their children become productive members of this sometimes screwed up society.

1st of all people are rude!As you said why not educate your self?Education requires work and a brain and many people are lacking those things now days.I don't know why a woman would choose to abort a child bc of a disability,why not adoption?There are SO many people who are unable to have children that would love these children exactly as they are.I had something called a "triple test"done when I was pregnant with my 2nd son they told me most likely he would be born with DS,we meant with a genealogist,had a step 2 ultra sound,and prepared for the worst.My son was born  perfectly normal.I thank god for that but either way he is still my child and I would've loved him either way.



I have 2 uncles that are DS and they both have touched the lives of any one they have came in contact with in a profound way.I think ALL people with DS are truly beautiful and are ANGELS,they are sent here for a reason.

I would imagine that alot of it has to do with how Down syndrome is portrayed in our society these days. Movies, TV everything, I have seen so many terrible jokes about people with down syndrome that it makes me sick!
Being the mother of a 7year old with Downs, I will certainly admit that when my daughter was born I was shocked and a little horrified... mostly scared for her and what her life would be like. One thing that I have learned (among the many many many) is that downs kids are the most loving and lovable.... they just shine a light... indescribable.
I had went to a class for kids with downs with my daughter several years ago when I was pregnant with my second child, there were two other mothers that were pregnant as well. They would talk about having the amniosintesis to determine if their new baby would be likely to have downs as well. I heard them refer to their lovely children as "flukes" because it was just a thing that happened. I had genetic testing done and it was found that 30% of my cells carry the extra chromosome for down syndrome, and I refused the amnio. I would have 100 more children with down syndrome.



So... in answer to your question, I blame society... get out there people, go to the Buddy walks (find one in your area), meet these people, they are amazing and can do so much more than so many people try to allow them to do.

well no one hopes to find their child with any kind of illness  BUT its better then have a healthy boy/girl that would grow up to be an alcoholic or a serial killer



and you never know where is your gift ,maybe this child that you help him/her to live well will be the pleasure later,
i know people that had a daughter with down syndrome ,they took her abroad to educate her*that time it wasn't available in my country *and they worked with her a lot ,she was sweet and she died of kidney failure when she was 45 years old
her family missed her alot specially her parents that she lived with them all her life while all the healthy children were so busy with their lives,
i m saying that because abortion is never the answer *its killing a soul that has no sin shame on us how we deal with god *,people with no kids buy cats to fill themselves so beware of god and dont use this abortion thing &lt;ITS NOT FAIR*

I would probably choose to abort the baby (i dont plan on having kids) unless i was with a supportive responsible partner who i know would stick with me and the child and i felt that i could deal with it. I dont think i would do it for superficial reasons but i dont think id be capable to caring for a healthy baby let alone a child that needed extra attention and special care.



I would be worried that if i had the child i would resent it or not give it as much love as it deserved (i have a history of depression and self abuse).



I cant say what i would do unless i was faced with that situation really but I cant say i wouldnt rule out having an abortion. I would much rather prevent any pregnancies through contraception in the first place.



I dont believe that abortion should be illegal under any circumstances but it shouldnt be used as contaception either.

It's scary to some women because they realize that the difficulty of caring for a DS child will likely be much greater than the difficulty of raising a normal child.  And they know this child is unlikely to grow up and be ready to leave home and live on his/her own in 20 years.  This child will need much extra care and work to teach basic skills as well as academic skills.  And will probably need support throughout life, never becoming totally independent.  The parenting required for a DS child is far more than that required for a normal child.



There are people willing to adopt DS babies and lovingly raise them.  From what I've seen (and I've seen hundreds of mentally handicapped kids) if you have to have a mentally handicapped child, a DS child is the best of luck.  They really are typically very loving and kind hearted.

I personally wouldn't terminate but I guess why people wouldn't want to deal with DS.....Theres other health problems like serious heart issues and weight issues dealing with a DS baby, I think that its scary for anyone whether baby is DS or not. Also people invision their kids growing up, going away to college, having successful carreers and living on their own and having their own families one day. Tho DS people are capable of having jobs and living on their own its not as early as someone with out, also their chances of having their own family are slim to none. The thought of having to care for your child day in day out without rest many times is scary, when your a parent your a parent for life but a lot of people don't realize that and don't accept that. Bless anyone who has a DS child, its not an easy road but in the end it is worth it~

I think that because of the extra needs that the child will have they get scared.  Also because the life expectency of a person with downs is much shorter and they don't want to go through the pain of losing their child.  also because of the torment that the child will get from other people.  I don't think that any of these reason are a good reason to decided that the childs life is not important.  Either way the child is your flesh, your blood.  I know a woman with downs she is 35.  She is the sweetest and most caring person that you would ever meet.  She also works ever day.  She was at a dinner with her mother and a man accross the room started choking.  every one in the room panicked except for her.  she got up from her table and gave him the himlick with out hesitation.  I know that story has nothing to do with your question but it's pretty cool that the handy cap person was the only person who could make the decision to do what needed to be done with out hesitation.

They don't want a special needs child. They don't want a child that isn't "normal" and looks and acts differently from other children. A child that in their minds is an embarrassment. Especially if they already have other children and this child was unexpected. I think most women would opt to keep the baby by the time they found out. But that's just a guess.

I agree with you.  When I went for my 17 week scan, they found white dots on my daughters heart.  The doctor told me that could mean a chromosomal defect.  He suggested to me that he does an amino so we can be sure that there is nothing wrong, but there was a chance I could miscarry.  I looked at my husband and at the same time we said no amnio.  Then the doctor told us to get the AFP test done before 20 weeks so if we wanted to terminate the pregnancy we could.  I was shocked that this doctor said that to me.  I was so upset when we left there, because one, there might be something wrong with our baby, and two the doctor was talking to me about terminating my pregnancy which made me think it was something bad.  We got in the car, and I looked at my husband and said, I'm not getting the amnio, I'm not getting the AFP, whatever our baby comes out as, we will love her regardless.  He looked at me and said, I am so happy you said that because I agree.  To me, regardless of what special needs she could have been born with or any special needs she could develop, she is still my daughter, a piece of me, we wanted her, special needs or not, we love her.  She was born 2 months ago perfectly healthy, and so far she has had no signs of any special needs.

SS If your a Mum i really feel for your child ..what a truly terrible comment to make, i was asked if i knew my son Thomas had severe autism would i have aborted him ..why ?
He is a blessing as is ANY child regardless of what their problems are you made and created a child that should and of course be loved by you and its not easy having a child with a disability BUT you cope and pray that the world will be accepting of your child as its proved here that people are either 'scared' of what they don't know OR just damn right ignorant

Because it is truly scary to have one with DS. They're scary to bear, they're scary to give birth to, scary to bring up, scary to talk and socialise with and just plain scary. DS is a defect. It's not normal. Anything that's not normal causes fear! Is that child you're holding DS? Just because you have one and you're ok with it, you cannot expect everyone else to accept a DS child. It's abnormal.

If you were obese to start your pregnancy, did you gain or lose weight?



In my first pregnancy, I started at 205 lbs and gained 30-35 lbs total. I'm 5'9. With my second pregnancy, I started at 260 but have gotten down to about 238 lbs (at 20 weeks). I had a lot of nausea the first 2-3 months. I'm just wondering how much weight I'm likely to gain by 40 weeks. Did you gain much weight? Did you just lose weight? My doctor said since I'm very healthy other than being obese, I should gain about 10-15 lbs total. So far I haven't gained any, and really hope that I don't gain much, so it'll be easier to lose afterward. Thanks!!! Please only answer if you were obese or pretty overweight before getting pregnant.

yup, i was there and still am.  please no one make fun of me for my size... but keep in mind I am 6'1 in height so i carry my weight pretty well,  or at least did lol



I started weighing at 275 when I got pregnant,  I too had bad nausea for the first 5 months!  I had only gained like 5 lbs by 5 months and felt good about that.. then the nausea got better and wasn't sick as often.  my lovely food choices and lack of exercise has caused me to gain weight quickly now that i'm not throwing up 8 times a day.  BAD NAUSEA!!!  I felt good to keep food down I wasn't watching my weight. Well I am 8 months now and weighed in at 321 on the doctors scale. :( But my baby is healthy and gaining weight too :) so that makes me feel better.  It is going to be hard for me to lose the weight but I am going to, I already have the exercise equipment ready.  my advice to you is to watch what you eat.  the nausea should ease up sometime or another and then your food will stay in your stomach.  so watch how many calories you consume so you won't turn out like me, it is too late for me now lol Good Luck

I started out at about 239 (5'7"). I gained maybe 6 pounds the first 20 weeks. I was pretty nauseated the first tri, and didn't eat a lot during the day. After the 20-week mark, weight started coming on more. I ended up gaining about 25 pounds for the whole thing.



My doc had said at the beginning that she'd like my gain to be only 10-15 pounds. When it went past that mark, I asked her about it. She said that because the weight was going on so slow, she had no concerns at all.



I ended up losing all baby weight by my 6- week post-partum checkup.

The most I gained between dr appts was 9 lbs.  then gained a total of 18 lbs throughout my whole pregnancy. Two weeks after birth I was down to 205. It has been 6 weeks since I gave birth and I have not weighed myself since the last time but I am positive I have lost some more weight. Best of luck and congrats!

Pregnancy blood testing?



Ok so i've got my doctor appointment tomorrow and they'll put me forward to see a midwife, i miscarried before and i think this time will be ok, it seems to be going better even though i'm only 6 weeks along but my fingers are definitely crossed. anyways, back to my question. i've never had my blood drawn before, i know it can't be that bad but i'm still scared of getting it done, nothing against needles just a vein phobia, when i see people getting it done i feel as though i'm gonna faint and feel sick so i was wondering do you think my midwife would allow me to get it done for the first time at my doctors surgery as i feel safer there and would prefer my first time being there? Any other tips to try and stop myself feeling as though i'm gonna die when getting it done? thanks.

Well, sweetie, you have to get used to being poked and prodded with needles since you're pregnant, people are going to have to check things often. Also, you should really let your midwife do it since you're going to be with her for these 9 months and should really get to know her, get used to her, and enjoy her company. Honestly, you're not going to die.. if you have any piercings, try to think of it as a piercing except much less painful then one.

Just concentrate on something really hard and you will hardly feel it.  I get light headed and dizzy and very very nervous every time I go in for a blood draw - but after a minute or 2, I feel ok again.  It is just the nerves that get me, not the actual poke!  You will be fine.  Just let the tech know you are nervous and they should be extra careful.  Good luck!

Do not worry about it hunny. Sorry to say..... but all during pregnancy you will be getting blood taking, and if you want any pain relief durin labour there will be more needles in awful places. I had epidural and tht went in my spine, OUCH



Do not worry, its all for the health of your baby, do not look when she is doing it and everything will be finee.

What will they do at my doctor's appointment today?



Okay so last night I bled (bright red) a little, with cramping, braxton hicks and so on.  Today I don't feel the greatest either and have been having braxton hicks on and off most of the day, but called the doctor and they want to see me.  What will they do to see what's going on?  Will they do an internal exam?

Is there any chance I could be pregnant?



Im 18 years old and had sex with my fiance over the weekend. We didn't use protection, he just pulled out as usual but straight after he put it back in again. My understanding was that once the sperm entered normal air it died. However I have woke this morning to find myself having spells of dizziness, feeling sick/nausea and bad headaches. i came off my period around two weeks ago which I have read recently that this is the most fertile time. I am unsure of whether this is true or not.



Is it possible I could be pregnant and if it is will I have to wait until my period is due to take a test and find out?



Thanks

Two weeks after your period is a very fertile time.



Yes you could be pregnant, as what was left in his penis after ejaculation is more than enough to get you pregnant.
Sperm does not die on contact with air; it survives until it dries up, or uses up its energy source (seminal fructose).
If you are sick now, then it is unrelated to your pregnancy, but it could be stress-related because you think you might be pregnant.



Serum human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) can be tested for and will be sensitive enough to pick a positive pregnancy about 5 days after conception, so if you got pregnant on Saturday, the hCG may be positive by the following Thursday. You do not need to wait till your period is due.



Good luck.



And remember-



1. Ignorance is never bliss. The more you know about something, the less accidents will occur.



2. "Hoping" is not a contraceptive technique.



3. If pregnancy occurs, it's the girl who ends up with the baby and the stretch marks.

There is always a possibility that you could be pregnant because you have had unprotected sex.



It is highly unlikely that you are experiencing early pregnancy symptoms this early though.



If you do not want to be pregnant I would suggest you get an appointment with your doctor or local family planning clinic and request the morning after pill (they will only do this a certain number of times) and discuss birth control measures with them.



Withdrawing is not regarded as a safe method of preventing pregnancy.

Although i wont offer a professional opinion on this, I am pretty sure that the nausea that you are experiencing is more than likely not at all related to whether or not you are pregnant. These things take a lot more time than you would think to kick in...

If you did get pregnant, your symptoms would not surface the next day.  You may however be worrying yourself sick.  1st, if you are concerned about getting pregnant (as you should be).  You really need to use a condom at all times.  I know its not the most romantic thing, to stop in the middle and all but it's safer and will avoid this.  Otherwise, get some birth control.  Your 18 so you can go and do this on your own.

You may have become pregnant, not after, but before he pulled out - however careful you are. However, it is unlikely, and it isn't the reason for your dizziness, nausea and bad headaches (morning sickness doesn't come into effect so quickly).  Take a pregnancy test just to be sure.

Signs of pregnancy do not come on this fast.  The sperm can live up to 5 days inside of you before fertilizing the egg or dying.  Then it takes 19 days after conception in order for an accurate test for pregnancy.  You may have low blood sugar or high blood pressure..if it persisits for more than 3-4 days you should call your doctor.  Good luck and God bless.

It can take up to 24-72 hours for sperm to die.  They dont die as soon as he realeases and then inserts again.  There is a very high chance of some still being there and going into you.  It only takes one and only one out of thousands to get where it needs to make you pregnant.  They say 14 days is when you ovulate.  If its around that time, its very likely.  Your not going to feel dizziness or morning sickness only after 4-6 days.  It still has to takes its course if so.  18 and unprotected sex and only using the pull out method is asking for unplanned pregnancy.  get on the pill or use protection all the time.  you dont test until you are at least 1- 1 1/2 weeks late from when you are to get your next period.

Because it makes me feel bad.So, we watch it together.Just now, I went through my computers history, to look for my babys growing chart.And, I found alot of porn websites.I feel so hurt, that i have been crying.I feel like he doesnt have any respect for me.
What is even the point of confronting him?.All he is gonna do is apologize...I am so frustrated.

If you are breastfeeding you could start tomorrow (though it would be VERY unlikely) or not for another 2 years ... or anything in between. (The 'average' is 9 months.)



If you are not breastfeeding, you should have a period within the next month or so.

It could be dry blood. It's called spotting. Spotting during early pregnancy is commonly happen. It needs to be treated for miscarriages precaution. I suggest you consult your gynae for further assessment & treatments.  Hope everything well f/ you.

<question>



My husband has a girfriedn while i am prego ?



Okay please if you have nothing nice don't comment on my question not really able to deal with mean people.



So I am 27 week pregos. My husband in Aug the week of the Olympics went in a business trip and meet another women. He came back and told me he is having these feelings for her and he wants to separate from me and try it with her. I explained that this is lust and it would go away but he said he has to try it. The other women lives in DC he live in Florida so is a long distance relationship they are having at this point. He goes and visit her every 2 weeks or when ever he has money to buy a ticket and talks on the phone with her every night for 3 hours. I am planning on divorcing him when I have the baby so don't worry about me doing the right thing. the fact that I am prego and he doing this means he does not respect me and I am not going to stand for that. My question is



They tell each other I love you already do you think this is real love or efatuation AKA lust talking and that he will snap out of this. He already has a kid with a women he had a one night stand and now having another one with me his wife of 3 years. This women according to him knows this and is willing to still try the relationship. I told him it will pass but he dosen't believe me he think it will work out. He say he loves me still but he dosen't feel that passion that he feeling with her. Can someone tell me can i be wrong maybe they do really love each other. He is in the navy and can't leave florida until June so they won't be able to be together until then. Can someone give me some insite b/c I am really trying to understand this madness.



</question>



<additional details>



Is not that I want to wait is that I have to. I don't have medical and at my work medical does not take affect right away. I have to stay with him to cover my medical bills if I divorce him I won't be insured. I honestly would love to ruin his navy career and tell his commanding offecer but I need him to pay child support and if he loses his job he has no degree so is not really going to benefit me either. So I making reational decisions and that why I have to saty until the baby is born.



Yes I still leave with him but once I have the baby I heading out. He say the women knows about us she does not know I am still leaving she think I left him already. All she said was that our situation throws a monkey wrech into the mix lol She sound so stupid I laugh at him b/c I can see them not ending up together. Not that it matter I will leave him anyway and he says he wants a divorce too so I guess I just have to keep strong. it upsets me but I dealing with it b/c I don't want my baby to be stress.

if he loved you he wouldnt be flying to meet her whenever he has money.  you are making a fool of yourself by staying with this loser of a man.



It doesnt matter if we think its love or infatuation girl.  Your husband SHOULD NOT be telling another woman those 3 words that he loves her.



WAKE UP, what kind of fked up affair is this?  and why are you trying to work it out with someone who cant keep his penis in his pants? nothing is worth that

I'm pretty sure it is just infatuation and that he's setting himself up for pain and misery. I'm sorry to hear this news, your husband is a selfish man who obviously does not care about you or the unborn child. I wish you the best.. just stay strong and independent.. Honestly, with good friends and family you don't need a man like that anyway. I doubt that he will ever end up getting further with this woman considering the distance as well as how they're rushing into things but let him do what he wants and just get out of the relationship. He will be the one that is sad and sorry in the end.

LEAVE HIM. Obviously he is not happy and things will just be worse if you try and force him to stay. He will always stray and that is awful he is doing this while you are pregnant. You don`t want your child  to get mixed up in this mess. He already did this once before, now he is doing it to you and he will do it to another woman. Get out now and find someone who will love you and your child.

He says he doesn't feel the passion with you as he does her...yeah, it's lust.  Maybe they do love each other, who knows.  There may be no answers for you.  We can't get inside his head, unfortunately.  The only thing I think you need to know about all this is he's a dog and is abandoning his wife and future child for some woman 1,500 miles away.  He's a selfish a**.  So, regardless of HOW he feels about her, it doesn't change the fact that he's a dirty dog.

It is definitely a lust thing, obviously.  Although I hate divorce, I think you are doing the right thing by leaving him.  I would kick him out of the house right now if I were you!  Anyway, it really doesn't matter how he feels, just leave him and move on with your life, he obviously has the "rose colored glasses" effect on, and will eventually cheat on her too.  Guys like that typically don't change so it's best to just move on and hope he will at least be a good father.

WOW! I would definitely divorce his ***. You deserve better than him. I think that he probably doesn't LOVE her, but obviously has feelings for her like you said. You should tell him that if he wants to be with her and not you, then he's never gonna get you back. Let him know that because he's prolly thinking that if he doesn't like her, he's gonna come back to you. He's playing a game. i would be pissed for sure!!!! And if he has a baby with a women from a one night stand.. that should tell you something right there. Well, goodluck with everything!

I am so sorry for you. He obviously does not respect you or your unborn child. It probably is just infatuation. When he realizes it don't take him back because if he has done it before he will more likely do it again. I don't think you should wait until the baby is born to divorce him though, you're just going to put yourself through more pain. Can I ask why you want to wait until the baby comes to get a divorce?

He is lusting for the women and that obvious b/c the only excuse he told you is b/c of it not being enough passion thats just an excuse. But he doesn't respect you and if after his desire for this women stops he's going to persue someone else he's just not a good guy for you.

So the question is can they love each other? Yes, they can. I knew I loved my husband within the first couple of weeks of our relationship. I’m sure we’d said the words by 2-3 months in.



As a personal opinion, I’m not sure your husband is actually in love for the simple fact he doesn’t seem to know what love is. He just does what feels good until he gets bored. Just don’t take this to mean he’s going to drop her and come back. He’ll find someone else to knock up in a couple of years when he gets bored with the latest future baby mamma.

I'm sorry but love is a choice and relationships are built on trust.  It's not going to work out between them because she's always going to wonder if he's with someone else since he's already doing that with her to you.



I'm sorry you're going through this and that your husband is acting like a pig.  It's ridiculous that you can't rely on him right now.



Good luck.

This may sound mean but some men have a problem with the sight of a pregnant woman and so they go looking for something else in the mean time. in your case he says he wants to leave you, I think he just may want to really leave you. He did have a one night stand, he does have another baby by another woman also, he just might be one of those guys who fall in and out love really quick and easy. You have to tak care of yourself and this baby. DO NOT STRESS OVER THIS GUY. I know you may really love him and want to work it out, but do not stress over him. I've been in the situation where a I wanted a man to love me and it didn't work. in the end, we ended up breaking up and I was heart broken but I was not pregnant though. I, MYSELF, could have gone through that but you are pregnant, take care of yourself. I cannot stress that enough.

It could be lust but then again it could be love. Men hearts work a lot differently then ours and when I say different I mean different. We love for all the right reasons and sometime men well they love for sex and or beauty.



Its hard to really understand what he is going thru or what you are going thru for that matter because like you said its madness. My thing is if this other woman "knows about you" as he says she does she would have more respect then to not call him while he is in your presence. I don't really think he has been man enough to tell her about you. Furthermore I would not wait until after the baby to get a divorce that is something I would start the process on now. Being that you have to be separated for a year or more before it can be final.



Dear this is what you said one big mess but the most important thing is you don't blame yourself which most of us would do in a situation like this. This was his mess up and for his own reason. Like it or not he has found someone else and the only way you can move past it all is to move on yourself.

Honey, I would leave this selfish bastard. He really is worthless and it sounds like he thinks he can take advantage of you because you are pregnant, so he thinks you are desperate to stay with him.



I don't see how the selfish son of a b*tch can love someone he met only 2-2 1/2 months ago. I guess maybe he's somehow insecure or going through a "mid"-life crisis and thinks talking to another woman is going to make him feel cool or something. I can only see it as infatuation though. You aren't doing anything wrong! You are pregnant; what, does he expect you to walk around in a pair of thongs and high heels?! Pregnancy is hard on a woman and when her husband is doing this, it makes it much, much harder. I cannot believe this guy is doing this to you! I wouldn't even try to understand it; I would just leave. He is NOT worth staying around for-just hearing him talk to another woman has got to be so hard for you. Don't let him put you through this! I can't see how he can be such a monster. You need support right now and he won't give it to you. I would get the hell away from him-he is not good enough to be in your life or your child's.

This is what Im thinking...When I was 18 I became very good friends with my boss who was 32, he was married and had a baby that had just been born and then he had a 2 year old with another women. I felt very safe with him because at the beggining I felt like he wasnt thinking of me in a bad way because he had a wife and had kids and all that. About 6 months had went by and he told me that he loved me and wanted to leave his wife and all that stuff. I fell for it and not only did he eventially leave me to go back to his wife that he told me was disvorced from him and really wasnt he really did break my heart and make me feel so stupid for falling for something like that. Im guessing that since they do already say I love you that this has been going on for awhile. Also I do think that he is just an asshole that neither one of you should be with...this is just him being bored with you and not wanting to "grow up and be a man". I would talk to the girl...she may have no idea that you are still together with him. GOOD LUCK...but if he is doing this to you right now he loves no one but himself my dear. Do you really want your kids to have him as a role model???

My opinion is that it's lust not love.  But the fact that he's willing to put you through this means that he doesn't love you.  So I would be kicking his butt out.  (if you still live together)  I personally wouldn't stand for that.  And even IF he realized he doesn't love her I wouldn't take him back.  You would have major trust issues.
I'm sorry that this is happening to you especially while you are pregnant. But forget him and move on with your life.  There are good men out there.
Best Wishes.

I think hes setting himself up for a big fall but you have to be strong right now. You have to look at all he has done with a one night stand, and to you and probably what he will do to this women and stand your ground on the fact that you are divorcing him. He is infactuated with her but that will soon pass and when he sees your gone maybe he wont do it anymore. I'm so sorry that you're going through this but you need someone who will love you for you not who spends all his money on plane tickets to be with his mistress. Best of luck to you and baby

You will probably never get your head round it - he is a jerk and jerks sometimes just aren't there to understand.



The passion does go after time,  I doubt many couples have the passion they had when they first met - relationships don't work like that,  they move onto different levels.



IMHO It is very early to know you are in love,  but many people do know they have found that one immediately and declare undying love within days / weeks - do I think you can love someone without actually knowing them - erm nope,  maybe love is there,  but if he is after a relationship where the passion remains he will be forever in and out of new relationships and sadly will never find that deep love and respect that long lasting relationships need.



You sound like you are still living with him - is this the case?



BTW - I really admire your strength,  you obviously deserve so much better.

if you dont have the self respect to leave this guy
for whatever reason you personally think this is ok ...
then just think of your baby

so if you are too much of an idiot to leave this guy
who doesnt respect you and never will

You need to leave him now, and prepare to ensure that his paternity is documented so you can get child support.  He obviously is not ready to be a father, even though at this point he has no choice.

yes it is, it is from the hormones changing.  Try a tylenol and a nap.  If that doesn't work or they don't go away for days call your dr.  Also, if any vision changes occur, or you get dizzy, call you dr asap

Yea its normal.  I got migraines everyday for about a month.  They went away by putting an ice pack on my head and over my eyes, tylenol didn't help me that much.  I didn't have high blood pressure either, its just common in pregnancy especially in the beginning.  They should let down though, mine went away completely it seems like.

I'm due two days after you with my fourth.  I have that same problem.  Many days, I have at least a dull headache.  Earlier this week, I had one that wouldn't go away.  It lasted all day, I went to bed that night, woke up, still had it.  It wasn't until after a nap in the afternoon that it finally let go.  It was awful.  I would just suggest more sleep, more water, less stress.  Those seem to help me.

Males, pregnancy, confusion, Oh My!?



To give you a small background, I am close to two months pregnant, yes, I am a 'young' mom I suppose if you consider 19 still young. This was an accident pregnancy and such.



I have a wonderful relationship and we are able to talk about most things, when I told him the news, I decided to tell him to his face because we do live seven hours apart. When we talked about this, he said he will stand by me no matter what, but feels we should have have an abortion, since yes, he is young like I and feels it would be unfair to bring a child into this world and not feel like he can give him or her the right home and life at first.



My question is, do men dance around this subject? We only spoke of this one time and I get so many mixed reactions. I am not sure how else to tell him because if we do chose this, we would have to do this soon, or we need to start getting ready for baby. My feelings on this is mixed as well. An abortion would just break my heart and he knows it. Since I was the oldest of four, I played Mommy #2 all the time, but he is the baby.



I am not sure what to do, I am scared, I am worried and I need help on bringing this to the table. Any advice? Any way to get daddy excited as well? Or should we abort if this is not going to be a good idea for either of us?

Stomach pain or stomachache? 30 weeks pregnant?



I really can't tell if its just at typical stomachache or if my stomach just hurts from stretching. I feel as if I'm growing so much daily and I've been in a lot of pain all day along with back pain so I thought it was just form my stomach stretching but now I feel like I'm on the verge of getting sick so I'm wondering if its normal for your stomach to ache? Its sore on the inside and out. Thanks. I'm 30 weeks pregnant. Should I just take a TUMS and see if that helps?

When you are pregnant, it is very normal and common to feel stomach aches and pain and even nausea later on in your pregnancy because there IS stretching of ligaments and your body's organs are being pressed upon a bit by your growing baby.  Still, anything that doesn't seem or feel just right to you is something worth just calling your doctor's office for.  Most of the time, if you call them with your concerns, they can tell you if your problem is something that warrants an office visit or not and if it doesn't warrant an office visit, you will often be told what signs and symptoms to watch out for to let you know when you do need to be seen by a doctor.  I hope you get to feeling better and I wish you and your baby all the best.

HAS ANYONE ELSE TRIED GOLDENSEAL TO HELP WITH LABOR?



My waters broke yesterday lunch time. About 6pm last night i started getting contractions every 20mins or so then during the night around 2am they came every 9 - 11mins. However when i woke up this morning they've been on and off all day, i went for a walk and started getting them every 10mins again. Had a dose of Goldenseal/Echinacea ( was all they had in the shop ) then went to sleep for a couple hours. When i woke up i was having contractions every 4mins only it was a pain for 40secs 4 mins later my stomach went hard for 40secs again, 4 mins later pain for 40secs etc. I'm not getting that anymore, it's more pain and hard stomach every 10mins or so again. It's so frustrating as i have had a constant back ache since yesterday - i've not had this at during my pregnancy so it's a new thing for me!



Anyway so i was wondering if anyone has tried Goldenseal and what happened with it also if it would be better if it was just Goldenseal rather than with the Echinacea extract.



I'm 40+4days preg, rang the hospital and they said to come in when the contractions come more regularly.



If you're going to tell me he'll come when he's ready or other things to try please don't, i'm sorry but i'm getting so frustrated with hearing that. I understand that he will come when he's ready and I know the other ways to induce labor. Goldenseal is what i've chosen to try.



I feel like a stroppy b**ch but for those of you who've been in or are in the same position will understand i just don't want to read what i know already!



Thankyou in advance,

I've never heard of goldenseal for contractions. it for infection. so is echinacea. it sounds like a good idea in your situation though. If you want labor than walk. you can take 2-4 oz of castor oil. by the time your digestive system is empty you should be in labor. also you should be monitoring your temp and writing it down. if it goes up  call the doc.

Your symptoms are perfectly nromal. Some people are emotional at the start and some never! Your nose running or cold like symptoms are also very normal due to your hormones! Nausia comes and goes differently in everyone and being bloated is one of the starting signs! Relax and start taking folic acid as this is very good for your baby! Please dont stree to much and enjoy your pregnancy! If you feel anymore back pain i would go to your gp just to ensure its the baby and not that you have done something else to it! I carved silly foods like pickled onions and ice-cream....together! Thats an odd symptom! good luck

I had MANY strange symptoms during the beginning of my pregnancy. I had AWEFUL cramping and it seemed to be in my hip and leg! I was worried sick because I noticed that my stomach seemed to stick out a little more on the side that I felt this cramping. NOTHING was wrong. He just really liked that side and made it stretch a little more! My temp was always high, Dr said that was normal. (I'm still HOT all the time!... I'm 39 weeks pregnant now) Its really easy to let yourself worry about things, you just cant! Talk to your Dr, God knows I called mine ALL THE TIME! You can never ask too many questions and never feel silly asking. My baby boy is totally healthy and although hes taking his time with the whole labor process... I had many of your symptoms (sinuses too!) and he is perfect. SO good luck! YOUR FINE GIRL. Enjoy every minute of it and try not to worry!!! OH btw... you can be emotional before you even know your pregnant... and it lasts till after you give birth!

the only way to tell is to buy a home pregnancy test, follow the letter of the instructions and use early morning urine.  If you have come on your period then it is unlikely that you are pregnant but be careful and use contraception next time.  The most fertile time is about 2 weeks before you are due as you will be ovulating.



Good luck

I am a bit confused by what you are saying.  If I understand correctly you said you had sex 2 weeks before your period.. then again while on your period.  So if that is the case you didn't become pregnant 2 weeks prior when you first had sex or you would have missed your period.  However even though when on your period you are technically not supposed to be fertile there is still a chance that some how it happens.  You will know by the next time you are due to have a period.  I would say chances are slim though.

Why do i have pregnancy symptoms( nausea, headaches, constipation) if 2 tests say negative and i had a period?



I and sex on Sunday October 19th, My period was due on October 27th but it came on Monday October 20th and it lasted for 3 days. Light the first day and heavy for two days. After it stopped i started feeling nauseous every day throughout the day, constipation, and i just recently started have headaches. My emotional state is out of control. My BF is noticing that I've been really weepy for about a week. I took a test on October 26th at 9pm at night and it said negative. So i took another on Tuesday October 28th and it also said negative. This test was not an early response test though. Its Thursday October 30th and i still feel all the symptoms and now i have gas too! I know i need to go see my doctor but im afraid of bad news. Did i test too early??? Could i still be pregnant after a period if i had sex one day before it came? And 2 negative test around the time my period was supposed to come?(Oct. 26-28 was my period due date) I took the test on Oct.26th and 28th) Please tell me what YOU think i can ask my doctor later...thanks

If you did become pregnant on October 19th you probably won't be able to get a positive for another week or two.  I would wait see how it goes but the heavy bleeding on the 20th is a bit confusing.  Implantation bleeding is usually light and brownish.  which I don't think you could have that till much later after the egg is fertilized.



If you still get negative tests next month and worry about symptoms go see your doc!

There is a possibility that you could be pregnant.  I would recommend going to the doctor and talking a test to make sure it is correct.  I do not however recommend taking a home test because it could give you inaccurate information.  Do not be scared about going to the doctor because all of your information is kept private.  Depending on which doctor you go to, here in NC, for some people who go in to get a pregnancy test, they tell you your results and then they do the procedure and go ahead and reveal how many weeks you are.  But if you do turn out to be pregnant, Good Luck and be healthy!

Yes you can be but also its a really hard question to answer because it can still be possible for the misscarriage to still show as a positive, the only way of finding out for sure is to go th e docs and get him to do a blood test and another a week later to see if the hormones are riseing or dropping. It can take upto 9 weeks after a miscarrage or termination for a pregnancy test to stop saying positivexx Good luck xx

Yes ma'am it is possible. After a miscarrige you get pregnant faster then anybody else. I had a miscarrige in April 08 and found out i was preg. again in June 08. The problem with that is if you get pregnant right after a miscarrige sometimes (not always dont panic) you miscarry again because its too soon. But if you take progesterone then you should be ok. As far as the tests, your body could still be producing HCG and making your test come back positive even after a D&C. But its still a large possibility that you are pregnant again. Hope everything goes fine. Hugs!

Because it makes me feel bad.So, we watch it together.Just now, I went through my computers history, to look for my babys growing chart.And, I found alot of porn websites.I feel so hurt, that i have been crying.I feel like he doesnt have any respect for me.

You're overly emotional because you're pregnant.  I don't understand why people care if their spouses view porn separately.  I don't like the same kind of things my husband does when it comes to that so he watches his and I watch mine, and we're happy.  Just talk to him about it and then let him do this thing.  It's just porn, it's not like he's cheating on you.

Just talk to him.  Tell him how you are feeling (without yelling and screaming).  Of course he's going to apologize.  What else can he really do?  I think you might be blowing this out of proportion just a little bit though.  If you watch it together, is it really that big of a surprise that he'd watch it without you as well?  I doubt he did it out of spite and it most likely doesn't have anything to do with the way he feels about you.  It was just something that he felt like doing, so he did it.  Men don't think about how it will make us feel our how it could possibly affect our relationship.  To them, its just porn.  I also don't think he was doing it "behind your back".  He obviously wasn't trying his hardest to hide it.

Well, you're right, he will apologize (or deny). If he apologizes, that's all he can do. He'll have to regain the trust by simply not watching. Unfortunately, it's something you'll either have to get over, or continue to be frustrated.

I personally don't think that occasionally looking at porn is a cause for concern. I don't mind if my fiance does. But I can understand how you feel, and ultimately it's not about the porn, but about him being sensitive to your feelings and not doing something that you don't feel comfortable with him doing. If he is telling you that he doesn't watch porn, and then going behind your back to do it anyway, I would say you have a trust issue more than a porn issue. But ultimately this is something that you and your husband need to talk about and work out with each other, because everyone else will have differing opinions, and it only really matters how you feel about the situation.

Just because he looks at it, maybe while you are asleep, doesn't mean that he is sitting there pleasing himself to it.
This may sound stupid, but maybe it's just boredom while you are asleep or maybe he's looking for things to share with you.
I understand you are upset, it's not the porn it's a matter of trust, but just step back and examine the situation first before you fly off the handle.

My question to you is why does he need to watch porn behind your back? Masturbation to a man isn't always about sex, intimacy, or security in your relationship. Sometimes it's a pure physical need that needs to be satisfied, and the release of chemicals into the brain during an orgasm really feel good. My husband has maturbated beside me, in the car on a long car ride, and sitting beside me on his computer. I dont care for porn, but i know he uses it as a mental stimulation. I'm okay for that.

Why do you feel bad if he watches porn alone?? Its great that you can watch it together. Just remember one, you're preggers and hormonal, its not a bad thing but its true. Two, he is a man and men are horn-dogs, he probably wants  to jack off in private. As long as your sexual relationship is healthy and he can watch them with you I wouldn't worry. Try not to make him feel embarrassed about it or try to find out why he does it without accusing him of anything. The answer may be very simple. My boyfriend sits at home bored and frequents the free porn. I'd rather him watch porn than cheat

Since you allow porn watching together, you've opened the door. He can't always control when he gets a little horny and if you aren't home, it's not that big of a stretch that he would look at porn by himself. I'm sorry that you feel hurt, but I really don't think that it means he doesn't respect you. If it really bothers you, sit him down to talk about it. But if you just attack him, you probably won't get anywhere.

this EXACT situation happened to me a few weeks ago and when i confronted my husband he got very offended, as if i was trying to control his life.



we talked about it.. and he explained it to me:
the amount of sex we have doesn't have anything to do him watching porn. it's not because you're not enough or anything like that.. it's just a guy thing. as amazing as you might be in bed, some guys just like the touch of their own hand every now and then.



i must admit, it still bothers me a little when i think about it.. but i don't bother him about it and i find that he does it less now that i'm not on his behind about it.



it's okay, i promise.

guys do tend to watch porn. It a fact of life. That said, its not normal for him to be watching porn EVERDAY as wellas having sex with you everyday. Talk to him, but do it in a non-confrontational way, with an open mind. Explain that you know men have tendencies to want to watch porn, but ask him to be honest with you and tell you how often he is watching it. If it starts to interfere with everyday life or your and his sex life something is wrong. Otherwise try not to worry too much. It might be hard for him having to adjust to your pregnancy and he might be feeling stressed. Men dont tend to voice thse things, so perhaps this is his way of dealing, even if he is not consciously aware of it. The main thing is to keep accusations out of it when you speak to him, although it may be hard, because getting angry will only make him clam up more. Just choose a time when you are calm and explain how and why you are feeling this way and ask him whether you should be worrying. And please, ignore that comment above about you not satisfying his needs....please! Sex should be for the both of you, if you are having a hard time because you are worried about things you are entitled to tell your guy, and he has to understand. Also, when you speak to him, tell him you are happy that he is willing to apologise, but you would prefer it if he rather tried to explain and answer your questions, because you are feeling very hormonal and this worry is making things worse for you.

Porn can become an addiction, that goes even beyond just filling emotional needs. It's like trying to fill a bucket with a big hole in the bottom, and each time you try to fill it with porn, the whole keeps getting bigger and the 'appetite' bucket will never be filled. You might have even noticed that about your own appetite for it... that the more you watch, the less satisfying it is, and you always need more.



How do YOU feel it affects your relationship, if at all? In his mind, your husband is probably confused by the double standard. Porn is ok, but it's also not ok. He probably justifies it by himself because you've said it's ok when you're there. This is probably very confusing.



It seems that it would be difficult to ask him to stop looking at it by himself, unless you also stop looking at it as a couple.



Can you see any benefits to your relationship being 'porn-free'? The two of you might need to decide what sanctity you give to sex, and explore how the porn is really effecting your emotional intimacy, beyond just pleasure in the moment of watching it together. It would seem to me that watching it together really brings a personal enjoyment of the moment more than increased emotional intimacy as a couple. What do you think? This is just my guess, forgive me if I'm off.



What if you had a special date night and re-read your marriage vows, to each other or something special like that? Is there anything in your marriage vows about "forsaking all others...", etc?



You never want to say, "You're not living up to your marriage vows..." but rather, if you are so compelled, "Honey, I feel like what I've been doing has not been keeping our marriage vows. I feel like I've been undermining my vow to "forsake all others and keep myself only for you" [for example] by encouraging us to bring porn into our sex relationship.



Hopefully you know what I'm getting at. I just think that, even if you've expressed your desire that he not watch it on his own, he has got to be VERY confused in his mind that it's OK in some circumstances but not in others. Because it is SO addictive, being linked to one of the most basic male desires.



God bless you and I hope you can be brought much closer through this trial as you share your feelings with each other. Be a safe place for each other to express their feelings without being afraid of getting 'in trouble'. Feelings are always valid.

It is really suprising to me how many couples openly watch porn together. My beliefs on it are pretty different, but I think if that if the two of you have "generally" allowed the vewing of porn to be ok between the 2 of you, then it really doesnt matter if he watches it with you or simply alone. Either way hes still watching it. I think if your worried about respect, the you probably shouldnt be watching it in the first place. That only allows him to think that its ok if he watches it without you. Theres really no difference, you still see the same thing. I was at risk of a misscarriage but wasnt advised not to have sex or anything. Just talk to him and tell you have your feeling. If he loves and cares for you then he will surely do what he needs to do to make you happy and show concern. Maybe just take one for the team and even though your tired, do something special for him, hey maybe even make your own video for him to watch when he feels the need too!

Seems like a lot of woman have different opinions and I respect them, but from a man's point of view let me tell you; we feel that we are grown and the times when our mommies found magazines between or mattress and made us feel bad and embarrassed are long gone, I don't think you have anything to worried about, yes it's nice to watch porn together but sometimes we just need time for ourselves, this does not mean we LOVE or DESIRE our partner any less. Believe it or not it’s natural for us to masturbate once in a while and we should not need permission to do so, and the man who tells you he doesn’t is lying to you.
Why are you watching porn with him, really? Because you enjoy it or because you just want to monitor what he is really watching.  Don't try to control things like that, I don't agree that he is telling you he is not watching it without you when he really is, he shouldn’t have to lie, but I guess he just didn't want you to feel bad, but I'm sure you finding out on your own was worst.



You are both at fault, he for not being honest a bout it but at the same time you need to be more open minded with him.  Like I said you should not be worried and so frustrated about it, I’m sure he loves you very much and an apology from him will make you feel better but it’s really not going to get you any where, try to relax and don’t take it so personal be more open minded when communicating with each other, let him have his personal time as long as he is honest about it.



Hope this gives you a different point of view and it helps you.

Diarrhea while pregnant?



I am 7 weeks pregnant and have been sick pretty much all day every day.  In the mornings the past few weeks I have had horrible diarrhea and Imodium is all that has ever worked for me.  I called the doctor and they said to try Kaeopectate and Maalox which I did and neither one helped my symptoms. (They slowed it down but not enough) I am a first grade teacher and can't be running out of my classroom constantly to use the restroom. Any word on whether Imodium is safe, if so how much? They told me they would rather I didn't take it but I'm running out of options here. I had to take a sick day already because the other medicines were not working. I would appreciate any advice!

Could i really be pregnant? i'm starting to believe it..?



A couple of weeks ago me and my bf were having sex and the condom slipped of inside me. Yesterday when i peed there was this pinkish reddish blood for a little bit and i haven't had anymore since. I was supposed to get my period yesterday but i havent had any cramping or anymore bleeding. i dont think i have any other signs really but i just thought that was weird. its still probably to early to take a test but maybe i'm just kinda freaking myself out! please give me some feedback about this!!
3 days ago - 4 days left to answer.

2 days ago



still haven't started today and idk if this means anything but ive been having lots of gas bubbles or something moving around lately in my abdomen and the slightest cramping
2 days ago



oh and i have to pee like all the time!
2 seconds ago

I think you should go to a doctor, they can test you there, and tell you for sure, even if its not a pregnancy, you still need to get checked because that shouldn't be happening. It might be a cyst doing this, in this case, you might need to get it removed or get medication for it. Hope this helps.

Because your not going to find much here.
If your scared to make an appointment there are tons of sites with Professionals who can answer you ques.



And DONT EVER only take one test,
When it comes to pregnancy at least take 5.
And the reason you havent thrown up yet is because its still too early.

Am I selfish for not aborting my baby?



I have been going to doctors trying to find out whether or not iam pregnant. They would only do urine tests and not blood. I finally find out im about 18 weeks along. Now i had like a fling with the father. We are no longer together but we are friends. Well once I told him he wanted me to abort it. I already had a miscarriage by him and that took me a long time to get over and hes asking me to kill our child. He is currently with another girl. Iam sorry if it seems selfish but I cant kill my baby. I told him Im keeping it and he doesnt have to participate in any way that I wont ask him for child support or anything. He tells me he will be involved even though hes told me many times he doesn't want the kid and he refuses to have it raised without its father. We were suppose to go out and talk about things but he says he cant see me or talk to me hes so upset with me since im keeping it. Texted me and told me not to text him or call him and if hes available monday we will talk. Im not suppose to be stressing with the miscarriage before but Im trying to decide whats best for my baby. Should I try to have the father involved or just say forget it and keep him out? Am I being selfish for not killing my baby?

God Bless You, first off.



Second, no, you are not selfish at all, why? Because you have noted that there is a child involved and this is what you want, to keep it. Daddy will have to pay up eventually through child support and such if he doesn't want to be involved, he will be by the law. You need to keep your head strong and smile. You are blessed and this child is what you want and if you are ready for it, then go ahead and enjoy your pregnancy.



But, I urge you to write out a list of pros and cons to having a child right now. Take in consideration of everything in your life, your money, freedom and so on. Also take in account of what if you get him for child support and such. Yes, this may seem like overwhelming information, but it is better to be safe, knowledgeable and ready for anything that comes your way.



Best of luck, keep smiling and count your blessings.

No. The voice inside your head telling you not to kill your baby is called a conscience.



Your basic instinct is telling you not to kill your own innocent flesh and blood.



It is a good thing you don't want an abortion.

Its not selfish as long as you can afford to have this child.
Will it be living like a normal kid 5 years from now? Or will it be a constant struggle just to keep it in school because you dont have anough money.
There is NO WAY you can bring a kid into this world, if you know financially, you cant support it.
If youll be the kind of parent who is never home because your always working to make ends meet, meaning the kid is left to its own devices wondering the street turning into those weener childs who graffiti and such, then that is just unfair.



BUT, if you'll be in the right position 5, 10 years down the track. Then i would say no, your not being selfish.

First off, Kudos for respecting the childs life and I wish you the best of luck with the pregnancy, and that is about as far from selfish as you can get. Children are an enormous inconvinience and alot of people would want to put them selves before their unborn child so what you are doing is Not selfish by any means.



Second, if he is behaving the way you say he probably would not be much of a father. so I would just let it go.



Lastley, if you are concerned about the child having a mother and father might consider adoption, there are plenty of people who are unable to have children who I am sure would love your child very much if you can bear to part with him/her.

What sort of quality of life will it have , will it want for anything?



can you support it , are you ready to be a mother, will the father support it  ( he has no choice really).



You can be a mum when all your friends are getting real jobs, going to uni or traveling overseas I can gaurentee you the babies daddy will be hooting it up.....or you can decide if you are ready for the biggest change in your life, what support structure you will have and how you want to look back on your life.



there are enough unwanted resented children in this world who came into it at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.



Life is about quality not quantity.  Yours and the babies....If you do not want to abort adopt it out!

You are definitely NOT being selfish! Good for you! It's the attitude of that jerk of a bf of yours that should have been aborted.



Do not talk to him personally. Get a lawyer. Get things in writing! He said / she said / we said what, doesn't cut it in court.



Hit that guy for every red cent of child support that any reasonably good lawyer can squeeze out of him. And be sure to tell his new girlfriend what she may be in for herself. That guy will just keep doing what he did to you over and over again.

Your main question seems to be about having the father involved? I think that right now, while you are pregnant, he should only be around if he is going to be supportive. If it stresses you out it won't be good for you or your baby, particularly with your (medical) history. (I am really sorry for your loss, I cannot imagine what you have gone through.)



He may need time to get used to the idea that there will be a little one out there related to him. Who knows- he may be able to wrap his head around this any time now or sometime after the birth. Either way I don't think it is something you should have to decide right at this moment. Let it be a weight of your shoulders to allow yourself to think about it later.



You said in another post that you are young to be having a baby at 20 but you had decided to 'grow up and be a mother'. You may be young in years, but this kind of decision shows maturity. It is a difficult decision to put someone before yourself, and that ultimately is what you are doing.

As for the selfish thing, I think you are, but if you're a pro life person, then keep it and get child support from the dad. He has not choice but to pay because he's the dad and is responsible for it as much as you are.



Actually, just kidding, you're not selfish, that's your baby you're carrying and I would be happy to be pregnant like you. However, I cannot right now due to no boyfriend and health problems.

Periods are pretty unusual for guys, and you have a guy's avatar. Yes, it's very normal to go over, especially with a first pregnancy. The due date is only an estimate. An estimate which no one tells babies, so they come when they're ready.

I my period July 30, on time
Had sex Aug 29
Got Period Aug 30, on time and regular.



I also had a period Oct 2 which was regular. However, assuming the off chance that I was pregnant, when would my due date be and how would my weeks along be calculated? If I go to the Aug 30 date, I would be 8 weeks at most, and that would actually be the physical day I got pregnant, but would I have to use the July date for # of weeks along? Thanks!

Males, pregnancy, confusion, Oh My!?



To give you a small background, I am close to two months pregnant, yes, I am a 'young' mom I suppose if you consider 19 still young. This was an accident pregnancy and such.



I have a wonderful relationship and we are able to talk about most things, when I told him the news, I decided to tell him to his face because we do live seven hours apart. When we talked about this, he said he will stand by me no matter what, but feels we should have have an abortion, since yes, he is young like I and feels it would be unfair to bring a child into this world and not feel like he can give him or her the right home and life at first.



My question is, do men dance around this subject? We only spoke of this one time and I get so many mixed reactions. I am not sure how else to tell him because if we do chose this, we would have to do this soon, or we need to start getting ready for baby. My feelings on this is mixed as well. An abortion would just break my heart and he knows it. Since I was the oldest of four, I played Mommy #2 all the time, but he is the baby.



I am not sure what to do, I am scared, I am worried and I need help on bringing this to the table. Any advice? Any way to get daddy excited as well? Or should we abort if this is not going to be a good idea for either of us?



</question>



<additional details>



Thank you all for your responses.



No, it is not that I am unable to, I am willing to take up the chance to raise this child and yes, we have made advances as in moving in this Dec. with each other and starting a life of our own. Maybe he is just scared and just avoids it, but it hurts me that I don't know how to say it to him and get him to just focus on it and help me as well.



Takes two to tango, truth in that statement and this our child, our lovely little mistake, but I having just a hard time getting him to focus on what is important, my health and the child's as well.  I am running out of approaching ways to talk to him. :|

I was actually talking to a guy friend about this very subject just yesterday.



We were discussing how unfair it is that men don't really get a say in determining whether or not to bring a child into this world.  I, personally, am pro-choice (just to specify for those on a soapbox, pro-choice does not mean pro-abortion, it means pro-CHOICE). So is my friend.



However, we commented on how, if a man and a woman get pregnant (it does take two people to do that, after all) then really, it ultimately comes down to the woman to make the decision to keep the fetus or abort. While the man can give an opinion, the choice isn't really is, but he has to live with the consequences either way.



If the woman aborts, he no longer has a child. Some men prefer it that way, other men may be devastated.



If the woman keeps the fetus, then he is still responsible for paying for the child for the next 18 years, whether he wanted her to abort or not.



19 is young. You can't even buy a beer, but you're going to raise a child?  I'm not criticizing your choices, I'm simply putting it into perspective. If you're not able to handle raising a child, don't do it. There are too many children in the adoption systems right now as it is, and too many children are improperly cared for by teenagers who aren't ready to be parents. There's nothing wrong with doing what will ultimately be best for everyone, if you feel it is the right choice to make. Just weigh your options and figure out WHY you'd want a child at 19 years of age. You have three more decades to have children. But you never get to relive your 20's.



However, if you decide to keep the fetus, I'd have a long talk with the father and see why he wants you to abort.  If he can't financially take care of a child or isn't ready to be a dad, then think about whether or not you want him to be involved. But talk to him. And be fair. Remember, it took two of you to get into this mess, and it should take two of you to make the decision of how to handle it.

I am also 19 and i have a 3 month old, yay for young mums.
Ok since you say that having an abortion would break your heart i can imagine that you have already thought about you holding your little baby, now think about not holding it. Maybe if you took him to a baby shop or something next time you get together? How can they resist the teeny little clothes and shoes!



Honestly if its going to break your heart to get an abortion, if you decide to get it honestly you will regret it for the rest of your life. If you do abort it, you will get to your due date and be thinking 'what if' or 'how i wish' or 'i wonder what he/she would have looked like'.

Go with your Mother instincts Abortion would not be good. Pleas do not consider that. There are hundereds of adoption agencies out there who can help you. If you end up getting to attached then you can decide to keep the baby after all.



This may have been an accident for you but fate decreed this would happen. This guy may want an abortion for you but if he says he will support you it looks like he might just be a little scared. Its hard for guys to think about haveing to support a kid at his age. It basically means his career and what he wanted to do in life is now over if u decide to keep the baby. Hopefully your family will help and support you and try and reassure him that everything will be ok. Be firm though and dont let him talk you into anything this is your choice.



Post sicological problems occur after abortion for women they get very guilty and have problems the rest of their lives. THink of the baby and what he or she will be like its going to be your baby a cute little baby girl or boy children are a joy and a blessing.

Well, he said he'll stand by your decision no matter what, so hold him to that. I don't ever think that killing a child is ever a solution to anything. I know some people who's parents almost had them aborted (but by the grace of God were not), and I can't tell you how much of an asset they've been to this world, and how much they've enjoyed life. Once example was a 15 year old mother. They planned to go to mexico and have a backyard abortionist do it (since it wasn't legal at the time), but decided not to at the last minute. You're 19, not 14. You can raise this baby. You will be able to get a decent job (if you don't already have one) and if that isn't enough then your parents should be able to help out some. If you reallly think you can't handle it financially, put the child up for adoption. Abortion is NEVER the option. But remember, this decision is yours to make, because your boyfriend said so. His opinion was no longer valid after he said he'd stick by YOUR decision (which as you said was to keep YOUR child!)



PS: I'd like to add that my grandmother (my father's mother) got pregnant when she was 19. So you're definitely not too young. My father turned out to be a wonderful man, and hey, I wouldn't be here if she decided to abort him.

Abortion shouldn't really be an option to think about. If you sincerely don't think you can handle raising a baby, there are many many adoption associations that would love to help you and educate you on your options. After all this was a choice of yours when you decided to have sex. I don't want to condemn you. I would like the best to happen for you and the baby now that he or she is in this world. Give the baby a chance to live. Of course it's best to stay together with your child, but if the responsibility is too much for you to handle, I highly recommend adoption. Look up the Liberty God Parent home and many other organizations. Abortion doesn't just kill a baby. It will affect you the rest of your life. Recent studies have shown a huge negative affect of mental and physical health of a mother that aborted her child. I hope and pray all goes well.

I found it hard to talk about this with my man and we live together. I had to bring it up every time. After I told him he talked to his sister about it before he discussed it with me. I think it is a male thing, it is a lot to get their head around. I think it is more real for us because we did the test, we have the pregnancy symptoms and we are the ones to make the final decision.



We decided to terminate and I am very happy with where my life has taken me an all the times I got to do that a child would have stopped.



Whatever decision you make, it will be the right one for you. Neither choice is easy but make sure you do it for you, not for someone else.

Went to the hospital last night because of sharp pain in my side( I'm 5 weeks pregnant) and found out it was a corpus luteum cyst which is producing the HCG for me to keep the pregnancy.
I was just wondering if anybody has had this before and if there pregnancy turned out ok..
I'm only worried because I've had a miscarriage before and this has just made me even more nervous.
Thank you for all the help  :) Baby dust to all :)

Sweetie don't worry I had the same thing happen to me. I at the time didn't know I was pregnant and went to stretch and doubled over in pain. I went to the hospital and come to find out I am pregnant and have a left ovarian cyst. When I went to the dr she said it was normal  and it does help to keep the pregnancy. It will eventually go away on its on. I found out I am pregnant when I was about 4 weeks along and I am now 10 weeks and when i went to the dr 2 weeks ago ( at 8 weeks) it is no longer there.



Good luck and I will keep you in my prayers

I think you'll do just fine without him. You'll have doctors and nurses who have done this countless times. Do you have a friend or family member you can bring? I'm sorry you're scared. I had something to add to my other answer, but you have messages blocked, so I figured I'd tell you here. If you know how many days he's planning to be back in, you can get a tall clear glass and fill it with that many marbles (or something else small and individual like candies, etc.). Let's say he's planning to be back in 90 days. You'd put in 90 marbles, and every day that passed, you would take one out. You could get a visual idea of it and that should be supportive, because your mind can see him getting closer. You'll do great!

What meds affect pregnancy?



Thank you to the people who responded to my other post with almost the same question.



For those of you who didn't see it- I suspect I am pregnant but I don't know for sure yet. On Saturday, I was in an accident where I fractured my jaw and had to get stitches. because of this, I was prescribed these meds:



Cefadroxil (1 gram)
Naproxen (500 mg)
Oxycodone (325 mg)



Will any/all of these have a bad effect on the possible baby?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I have just looked up those medications in MIMS:



Cefadroxil (I couldn't find that drug name in the Australian version of MIMS; the closest match I could find was another cephalosporin, Cefalexin):



Use in pregnancy: Category A



(Category A means "Drugs which have been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.")



Naproxen:



Use in pregnancy: Category C



(Category C means "Drugs that, owing to their pharmacological effects, have caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.")



Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and, when given during the latter part of pregnancy, may cause closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus, prolong labour and delay birth. Continuous treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the last month of pregnancy should only be given on sound indications. During the last few days before expected birth, agents with an inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis should be avoided. Aleve {a brand name for Naproxen} should, therefore, only be administered during pregnancy if the benefit justifies the potential risk.



Oxycodone:



Use in pregnancy: Category C



Reproductive toxicity studies with oxycodone in animals have not been conducted. Opioid analgesics cross the placenta. The use of oxycodone during labour may cause respiratory depression in the newborn infant. Babies born to opioid dependent mothers may be physically dependent and suffer withdrawal symptoms (convulsions, irritability, excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, sneezing and yawning).



If you suspect you're pregnant, you should tell your doctor before they prescribe anything for you.  They cannot give you adequate medical advice if you don't give them all the information and pregnancy is up there with allergic reactions in terms of doctor-need-to-knows.



Take care. =)

Gosh. Some people don't listen well do they. She doesn't KNOW if she's pregnant for sure. geesh. First of all Cefadroxil is a class B drug. They haven't done much research on its effects with pregnancy. I think it should probably be safe. Naproxen however should not be taken during pregnancy unless REALLY needed. Definitely don't take the oxycodone cause it's a category C. Which means it is harmful to unborn babies. I would call the doc and tell him you may be pregnant. If you really need painkillers, ask for Tylenol 3 with codeine. It's much safer.

When I was pregnant all I was allowed to take was paracetamol, but I never had anything as painful as a fractured jaw-ouch!  You can look up the meds on wikipedia and it will tell you more about them or  call the free number they have on the packet.  I'd just ask my doctor if I was you just to be extra safe.

Now that you know you are pregnant stop them. I'm sure your baby will be fine because it is SO early. I had the same concern with my baby only I was on HEAVY antibiotics ...3 of them and some pain pills and I was pregnant and taking them because I didn't know and I stopped immediately and my baby is 100% healthy.

I don't know the sex of this baby yet but with my daughter they guessed right, But also before the ultrasound lady told me the sex would only be an educated guess and that I shouldn't go out and buy every thing pink just in case, she said she has to say that because there have been mistakes and there have been women then trying to sue the hospital because they have gone and spent hundreds of dollars on one particular colour.....I figured they would all tell you that it is only an educated guess and to not go overboard

Get your education and a chance to start something stable. You have failed to provide something as far as structure. This is more of a want and you do not sound ready. Sorry, if that is what you are not looking for, but you have to remember, you are young, smart and strong.

Finishing high school/short courses does not prepare you for a baby.

Can you live off of the one wage while you are pregnant and unable to work some days?



Sorry, you asked for opinions, and no, this does not sounds like a good plan at all.
The intention to go to college doesn't actually mean hoo hah, unless you've finished., and are earning a decent living.

For a beginner, it is $5 an hour. $5!

Just make sure you really are ready the both of you because  I am currently in the first year of my undergraduate degree and Im going to have to take next semester off of school for our little one and Its probably not the wisest idea to be taking breaks like that in your schooling like I am so just make sure this is what you want.

You may be ready mentally for a child but remember: College is expensive, even with financial aid. It's also stressful. You don't want to be too stressed out while you're pregnant. Preparing for and having a child is also expensive. Unless you both work full time and are planning to work full time in addition to going to your college classes.. Where will you get the money to take care of a baby?



If I were you, I'd give it some time. 18-19 is still very young to be having a child. Live and grow into yourself for a few years. You have plenty of time.

You also haven't been together for very long. it may feel like you have, but you really haven't. You don't even know if you will stay together.

My best advice is to finish your school & massage therapy. If it's only a 9 month class then by all means do that first. Once you finish your education, find a really good job, save enough money for yourself & just go from there. You may think that having a baby is easy but remember... you need to be very responsible. As for your boyfriend who will be going to college? Well, he will meet a lot of girls & do you trust him completely?



It's easy to say that "you both agree to have a baby" but once the baby is there everything else changes. Are you ready for the biggest change of your life? I think you are a very smart young lady & you will choose what  is right for you & that is to finish your education first.

Not Sure if anyone is really ever ready but I still think you got a lot of living to do and its damn hard with a baby. Trust me Im a mother of four and have a seventeen year gap between the first two and the second two. The first two I was only in the relationship till the baby was one and that was hard and now Im very happy married and its still hard.Its so romantic to think of reproducing someone you love in a baby but its not all sweet or easy .I also had some really serious back problems after the third and fourth and pay every day .I love all my kids heaps but if I could do it over I would have waited til I was 25 at least. I was 16 with no.1 21 with no.2 38 with no.3 and 42 with no.4.



You could both do so much for yourselves set yourselves up with jobs and a flat and have a social life too.Please wait a little longer.

I'm a mom of 3, and will tell you that as you  are pregnant your ligaments loosen up around the hips.  Six weeks is a really achy and uncomfortable time for some.

you have probably just pulled the joint slightly, im always hurting myself but never know when iv done it. i am currently suffering with a twisted knee, no idea how it happened but it definitely did. as far as i know joint pains shouldn't be a sign of problems, speak to your doctor if you are really concerned.

How did you tell your parents you were pregnant?



I'm not pregnant....yet.  My husband and I are wanting to try though.  I've always been the kind of person who never wanted any kids and my mom has always known this and it's going to be hard for me to tell her, even though I'm 24 years old and married.  Although she was great with me and my brother, my mom seems to have stopped liking kids the older she gets and I'm not so sure she'll be happy for me when the day does come.



Anyway I just read someone's answer and they said they had everything planned out that they were going to say and when the time came to confess all they were able to do was point at their stomach and start crying.  That made me laugh a little because that's exactly what I picture myself doing.



I want everyone's stories but I'd like some funny ones if anyone has any!



Thanks!

if the pills have iron in them that's probably what is making you vomit. i would talk to your doctor and see if their is another pill that you can take that doesn't have so much iron in it. thats exactly what happend with me. good luck.

t could be the pills or it could unfortunately be morning sickness. I felt like that regardless of taking my prenatal or not. Only bread with cream cheese or peanut butter or cereal sounded good to me. I even threw up water. It was horrid. Good luck. Oh the feeling and aversion to food stopped at 14 weeks after losing 7 lbs. Still haven't gained any weight at 23 wks.

When your period is a week late you can do a urine test, before that it's really too early b/c the urine tests are not that sensitive. And if your stomach is just big overnight and your period isn't even due yet it's probably due to some other reason- not pregnancy-. usually when your pregnant you don't show until at LEAST 3 months if not 5-6 months. So you might have another medical problem going on if your stomach is really significantly bigger.. think ascites/liver failure at worst or possibly just bloating/constipation at least.

More than once on the pill?



Ok this might seem like a dumb question but this happened to a friend of mine, my girlfriend has been on the pill for a few months and we haven't had any problems with no protection. I usually come like 2 or 3 times when we have sex and sometimes we do it again the same day. I was wondering if coming inside her more than once every time we have sex will make the pill a little more likely to fail?

The pill is not affected by how much sperm is in a women's system. It is affected by certain drugs like antibiotics, having the stomach flu,  and obviously not taking it correctly.



If your girlfriend is taking it correctly then you should have no problem regardless of how much sex you have. However always bear in mind that the pill is only 99% effective so there is always a small chance of pregnancy even if she is on birth control.



Do not fear though. I was on the pill for 12 years and in the 5 years of unprotected sex with my husband I never fell pregnant until we wanted it!

The way birth control pills work is by having hormones that prevent ovulation (that's when the egg is released). If a woman doesn't ovulate, there is no egg. So it doesn't really matter how much sperm there is if there is no egg for them to fertilize.



On a side note, no birth control is absolutely perfect, so if you really really didn't want her to get pregnant you could use condoms too (I know, I know...) and make sure she follows the directions for the pills exactly (like take same time every day).

The amount of times you have sex don't affect the way birth control works. It works by stopping ovulation and preventing implantation in the uterus if a egg is released. So sperm/semen/amount of times you have sex have absolutely nothing to do with the protection birth control offers.

First. Breathe.



It is not going to be easy, it is going to be difficult and depending on your family, the reaction is going to be mixed. One of happiness, one of being scared and one of just anger as well.



You need to be calm when you tell them, perhaps catch them in a relaxed environment and speak to them on this. Tell them you tried to watch yourself and an accident happen. Surf the web, look up options and stay calm.



Best of luck.

I was in the same boat about 5 weeks ago (i'm 24 but I was still petrified!!) I'd planned exactly what I was going to say but it all went out the window when I just pointed to my belly & burst into tears!



If you know you want to keep the baby, then just sit them down & explain what happened, be as mature about it as you can, and if they know you're happy then they'll be happy too! My parents didn't know how to react because they couldn't tell if I was happy about it or not!
They were shocked but it's never an unhappy time, just give them a bit of time and I bet in no time they'll be waiting on you hand and foot (like my parents are!)



Good luck!!

i know it's scary sweetie but before you tell your parents, you have to calm yourself down. you can't do anything to change the fact that you're pregnant, all you can do right at this moment is calm down. breathe, take a bath, listen to relaxing music. once you feel like you're calm enough, sit your parents down and just say it. if your parents see you freaking out about it, they'll also freak out. but if you're calm, rational and mature about it, they will be too. i'm not saying they won't be upset or shocked, but they love you and once you tell them, you'll find that the support they can give is amazing. you'll all figure it out together, you're not alone in this! best of luck xx

Hey Anbarasi! Uncalled for you Douchebag!



Look, I know it sucks having to tell your parents something like that. I have a friend who got preganant when she was 16 and she had to tell her parents too. My suggestion is to just be straight forward and honest. Sit them down and explain what happened. You are of the "legal" age to have sex, but the birth control failed on you. I know it sucks, but you just need to breathe and I am sure they will understand.

First, take a deep breath.  Remind yourself you WILL be ok in the end.



Second, be prepared for your parents to be shocked and upset, but realize that they will give their real reaction after they have had time to consider what you've said.



Now, to tell them -- pick a quiet time to talk to them when they're not getting ready to run out of the house somewhere.  Sit them down, tell them you have something serious to tell them.  Tell them that you love them, you really need their support and love right now.  Then tell them that you're pregnant.  Be prepared for a lot of questions.  But by starting off telling them that you love them, and you need their love and support, you're likely to get it in the end.



Good luck!  Remember, there is a lot of help out there for moms to be.

I told mine seperatly my mother first because she is the more understanding one then my father just be  mature about it and depending on how your parents are there can be some harsh words said but they dont really mean  them they may only be saying those things because it may come as a shock.
But later down the rode when they are holding there grandchild in their arms they will know that the child is a blessing no matter what your age may be.

There is never an easy way to do this. If you are still with the father then maybe ask him to come along with you so that you have some support.



If not then turn to the parent you are the closest to and tell them first. Be calm about it and explain that it was unintentional and you were being responsible by taking birth control but sometimes these thing happen. Parents love their children unconditionally and I'm sure they will be there to support you.



Good luck and remember that a baby is blessing and your family will be the biggest help here.

wow.. whoever you are close too talk to them first. if you want to keep the baby tell them you were being protective but 99.9% of that chance i got pregnant. yes they make flip out and ask you lots of question if your staying with the guy who got you pregnant ..etc. sweetie i know your scared i had friends who hide it from their parents but that is bad..do not even think about that. just sit down and talk about your situation. if they get upset at you is because they care and you are too young to be having a child. you have to be patient and understandable try to be in your parents shoes when you are telling the news.. good luck best wishes

Stupid question but important.  Do you know who the father is?  If so have him there with you.  A it will show that he supports you.  B it shows to your parents that your both mature.  First go to the one your most comfortable with.  And tell them hey__.  I really need to talk to you about something important.  Me and so and so have ben seeing each other for X ammount of time know and i really love him.  We recently have been showing our love to eachother in new ways.  And to try and prevent getting pregnant i went on birth control.  Unfortunatly I dont think it helped.  I think i missed my last period, but im only a few days late.  And the pregnancy test i took says im pregnant and i dont know what i sould do.  Can you help me through this tough time for me.  I didnt mean for this to happen.  It was an accident.  I want my baby.(ps it also helps if you have tears in your eyes, to show emotion)  Then see where the conversation goes.



Good luck with everything!

do you know i had the same problem, but i just bit the bullet and came out with it because i couldn't hide it for long.My mother was against children out of wedlock.It was so hard and it scared me too.But in reality it was really mine and my partners choice to have it together,keep it and rear it. it wasn't her decision to make. First you have to make a decision as too what you want to do before you tell them, then you have to stick to it. its going to be hard as they might try to talk you out of it. but who knows they might welcome this news with open arms. and do you know if i didn't make the decision i did then i probably would never become a first time mum like you. now i cant wait to have this baby, we are very excited.my whole life has changed overnight even if it did take them a couple of weeks to come to terms with it. i also think that the words nan and pop scared them as i was still their little girl. good luck

It may not be as bad as you think but dont expect them to be all happy. I was 16 when I had my first child and my mother went mental .I decided to go through with it and she came around but I had to tell her "My body my choice". that was 28 years ago and shes still funny about her but you just have to be prepared to live with the choice you made. She may see some strength and maturity in that and you may be surprised. FYI my bf ran for the hills!!!

First of all, just calm down. It's not the end of the world my friend. You can tell your parents when you feel ready, but don't make it too long because you'll just make yourself go crazy. If I were in your shoes, I would tell my mom first. Just tell her that you took a pregnancy test & that you are pregnant. What's the worst thing she can say to you? At first she will probably be mad or shocked or speechless. But I guarantee you that she won't be any of those for long. Now once you've told her maybe you & your mom can tell your dad ( find a day when he's in a really good mood). I'm sure you're dad will either be mad or whatever but it's normal to feel like that. Anyway, I think everything will work out just fine when you tell them ASAP. Just be confident & believe in yourself that everything will be okay. Good luck!

Tell your boyfriend first. Then once he has calmed down after the shock, ask him if he wants to be there when you tell your parents. Then tell your parents, but do it before you start showing, give them time to get used to the idea. This is what happened to my moms friend. Her daughter fell pregnant and only told her parents the day she gave birth... you defiantly don't want to do that! Your parents may not like the idea at first, but they have no choice, it has happened and they have to accept it. I hope all goes well, and good luck!

I'm 25 and I got pregnant when I was 18 and still at school.  I don't wanna lye to you, your parents won't be happy about it.  Parents are over protective and they have too high expectations for their children.  Obviously they want you to finish your studies, work for yourself and get married before you can think of having a baby.  Unfortunately we cannot turn back the clock but try to overcome you obstacles and make something good out of your mistakes.  If you have a sister or maybe an adult who you are close to & whom they are close to your parents, I suggest you tell that person and ask them to tell your parents.  It becomes easier when they are told by an adult, that person can make them realize that this is not the end of the world.  They might be angry but give them sometime they will accept and recover, they love you and they won't just abandon you. Show them that you are sorry and you plan to do something with your life after the baby is born.  Remember, that child will be their grandchild, instant they will be spoiling him/her once they get used to the idea.  Take care of yourself, don't stress and good luck!



Tell your boyfriend as soon as possible, probably you might need the support from him.  But remember, he might not be ready for the baby and turn you away.  Be prepared and ready for anything, as I said take things one step at a time and what ever the outcomes be strong.  I know what I'm talking about, I have been there, I have recovered and I'm making something out of mylife.  Good Luck again.

2 scenarios: either you're one of those who bleed during pregnancy (but test shld still show postive) or you're losing the bb. See the doc now, they will do an ultrasound and try to locate the bb heartbeat.

Is there a possibility of pregnancy?



I have been using oral contraceptives for almost 3 years now, even though I sometimes don't take them at the same time.  Sometimes I will skip, but immediately when I remember I will take one.  I was on my periods a week before, but before I had my periods, I had terrible stomach cramps which were unusual & I was a day late for my periods.  Still after my periods I'm still having pains on my lower abdomen, headaches, I'm bloated and constipated, and this have been going on for a week now.  So far I haven't recognize any other symptoms, unless probably its still early or maybe I should wait a little bit longer.

the pains could jsut be from the bloating and constipation. You are probably dehydrated and need to drink ALOT of water, that will fix the headache, and bloating and constipation. If you had your period and the bleeding was normal you probably are not pregnant, but if you miss your period next month then you should test.

There's always a possibility of pregnancy, but pretty unlikely when you're on the pill.  I read something today that said only 64 out of 1000 women actually ovulate after stopping the pill for 10 days.



Constipation does cause abdominal pain.  Usually in the left side of the lower abdomen. There's no reason for you to continue to have constipation though.  There are tons and tons of things you can get that are over the counter.  Try colace (docusate sodium) or Miralax. They are the easiest to start with.  There's also bisacodyl or senokot which are a little stronger.  If your constipation is not resolved in a day or two after trying all that you should call your doctor.



Headaches are a totally different symptom.



The major worry for any woman with abdominal pain would be an ectopic pregnancy, which is life threatening, but is also really unlikely too.  And I just say that because no one is going to be able to tell you for sure what is the reason for your pain without seeing you.  Only you know what if what you are feeling is severe or really unusual for you.



Since I've been a nurse for awhile I've learned never to ignore any little nagging feelings I have.  I would probably try the laxatives first though if your pain is mild, and see if it fixes the pain in a day.

Yes, it's better to wait b/c sometimes they can't see it til 22 weeks, and for examply if they did it at 18 weeks and cannot see the sex but everything looks normal and all the anatomy scans are measuring right they may not give you another ultrasound again the entire pregnancy. So if you really want to know the sex, wait, cuz if they don't see it there's a chance you might not need another ultra sound and alot of doc's won't just write for an ultrasound just to find out the sex if there's no other indication you need one. And I didn't really gain much weight at all by the time i was 18 weeks so don't worry. I think I had gained like 5 pounds by then or something, i still looked like i was like 2 or 3 months when i was 6 months but the baby measured perfectly at my ulstrasound, it all just depends how you carry.



Source(s):



me! I had 1 ultrasound in 2nd trimester for the anatomy scans, measurements, and all that and found out the sex, and i won't have anymore until i deliver (due in 1 week) I thought for sure I would get 1 more but they said I have no health probelms, baby's not at any risk for anything so they have no reason to do another.

NO its not true, im now 19 weeks and 3 days and i found out the sex of my baby at 18 weeks and 2 days it was so obvious you could not miss the little thing. They say to be carefull in the case that the baby is in a different position, my songrapher actually told me you can find out from 14 weeks. i have only just started "showing" to the public, to me i could tell from day one (lol think its paranoia really) but its only been recently people are asking me if i changed my diet hehe, guess in one scence i did.



P.S Im pretty sure with any pregnancy you have a routine ultrasound at 18 weeks, you should be having an ultrasound now anyway.



Good luck with the baby / pregnancy



I just read the persons above me answer, i have been told i can go for an ultrasound when ever i want although its completely unnecessary, if i at any point i want to see my little man, i just go to the docs get a referral and away i go to get an ultrasound

hi i got on to a sex telling test on the internet. you use drain clean crystals. pascoes is the brand name. it used to open blocked drains. it has a very high % of getting the sex right. you place about six table spoons of this drain cleaner in a jar you add a morning mid stream sample of your urine to it. put a lid on it and shake. then sit aside for a couple of minutes.be shure to wear gloves.if the crystals turn brown or green its a girl and if they turn blue its a boy. both of my girlfriends have done this test as early as 13 weeks and it has been 100% spot on.Its safe but don't forget to get rid of it as the fumes can over bearing. good luck.

You are quite small, yes, but often that isn't much of an indication of the size of the fetus.  I was very small also with my second baby.  I wore my usual jeans right up until I was 7mths, then had to go into loser clothing.  My daughter was 8lb 15oz at birth.  Your obstetrician will let you know if there are any problems with your baby's development.

You are small compared to a lot of people, but baby is not very big yet and its normal not to show!  I didn't show with my first until 25 weeks!  You must have strong abdominal muscles, count yourself lucky.  I'm 16 weeks with my third baby and just now starting to show a tiny bit.

The only time you can request a c-section would be if you had already had a c-section with a previous birth.
I have had 3 c-sections and will say IMHO, go vaginally if you can.  The 'mommy pouch' is generally larger with a c-section and is darn near impossible to get rid of.  The recovery is longer and once you go that route, you will generally have to have c-secions every time (AMA is highly recommending the 'phasing out' of VBAC's)
There isn't anything to be afraid of... you can get pain medication and you will do just fine.  Don't opt for a major surgery just because you fear the other option.



Good Luck!!!  I hope this helped!!  :)

In most cases you can't choose. They will only c-section for various medical reasons because it is major surgery. You can always talk to your doctor though, some are better than others about "finding reasons" to c-sec. Keep in mine the recovery sucks from c-sec, and it's much easier on your body to deliver vaginally. In a c-sec they cut all the way through your abd muscles and although it will heal, often the muscles don't form back the way they were before and it's impossible to have a flat stomach again from the lack of muscle tone (even if you work out). And your at a much higher risk for bleeding loss, and complications just b/c it is surgery.
Just remember it's not the "easy way out" like some people make it seem.

The only reason you should have a c-section would be if it was medically necessary.  Major abdominal surgery for no reason isn't a good idea and a good OB would not do it.  Most won't do it unless there was a medical reason for it.  With any surgery there is risks and it shouldn't be taken lightly.

I think it depends on which country you live in and whether you have medical insurance or not. If you go to a goverment hospital they may refuse you a C-section unless it is a medical emergency because of the cost of it.



If you have private health care then you can opt for a C-section or you can have natural birth. At least this is how it works in South Africa.\



Why don't you ask your doctor about it?

Its up to the doctor, it all depends if the baby is breech, transverse, cephalic, double breech, also depends if there are any complications giving birth.

Why are you scared of vaginal birth? C-sections in the end will only hurt more.
C-section is major surgery and should only be performed when it'd medically needed.
Healing would be much harder.



A good OB wont allow you one simply because you want it. If they did, then they must be as rich as a  king and ready to pay insurances and what not if something goes wrong during the surgery.



There are many risks with c-section, you should avoid having one if it is not needed.

please do not think that c section is the easy option. i had an emergency section after 52 hours of labor. i can tell you from my own experience that walking around for 5+ weeks slightly bent over (cos of fear you'll burst open)is not the best feeling in the world. i am pregnant again now and have been offered another section. you think i said yes? no chance. i will try to have a normal delivery. i don't know what nutter out there would want to put themselves through all that lol.



on the other hand you should tell your midwife/doctor your fears from the word go. they can recommend you have a section but you will have to convince them that your fear is genuine and that you are not just too posh to push, not saying that you are but believe me there is people out there that are.



i really hope you get what you want and i haven't said these things to scare you its just that i think you should know that a section is far from the easier road. one things for sure i'm praying i wont need another. x x x x x

How did you tell your parents you were pregnant?



I'm not pregnant....yet.  My husband and I are wanting to try though.  I've always been the kind of person who never wanted any kids and my mom has always known this and it's going to be hard for me to tell her, even though I'm 24 years old and married.  Although she was great with me and my brother, my mom seems to have stopped liking kids the older she gets and I'm not so sure she'll be happy for me when the day does come.



Anyway I just read someone's answer and they said they had everything planned out that they were going to say and when the time came to confess all they were able to do was point at their stomach and start crying.  That made me laugh a little because that's exactly what I picture myself doing.



I want everyone's stories but I'd like some funny ones if anyone has any!

Just tell her, the more you build it up the harder it will be. I was more afraid of telling my Dad. When i finally plucked up the courage to tell him he revealed that he already knew. My Mum had told him, in fact every person in my family that i wanted to break the news to had already been told by my Mum. Everybody knew, my Mum had stolen my limelight.



Although your Mum doesn't like kids much anymore you will probably find that finding out about her grandchild will change that as she goes around proudly announcing your news to the world.

Scared of having a c-section ?



I am having triplets, and am going to be having a c section.  I am overweight to begin with, and my Dr said because of that there is more of a risk for infection because there is more skin to cut into, and if the epidural don't work they will have to put a tube down my throat.  I was scared to death before he told me this, and now I am petrified that something may go wrong. Any body else who is overweight and had a csection, how did everything go ?

How far pregnant are you? if your still in your early days, i would suggest gentle excercise walks etc, you will be surprised at what little difference a little weight lose can do for you. As for the c-section, it is the safest options for your little bubbas, the stress your body will be under if you give birth naturally could be far worse then the risks involved with the c-section. Remember your doctor has done more c-sections then you can imagine, ask how many and if still in doubt talk to the midwives or another doctor. Good luck and please let us know how you get on.

That is normal. Your hormones are trying to trick you into getting pregnant as a way to keep the human race going. It will pass and come back and pass and come back.

There is nothing wrong with the way you feel. The fact that you are spending lots of time around small children and liking it shows that you are very much in touch with children and interacting with them. Consider yourself lucky - many people can't work with children and are not attracted to children at all. This might be your true calling in life. Perhaps study something that involves children like education, child psychiatry etc. Your day for a baby will come and I am sure you will make a great mom!

I know exactly how you feel. I'm 19 years old, and for the past 2 years I've had this urge to be a mommy, even though I'm young, I've always been around babies and they just make me so happy.. But now I'm pregnant, and don't get me wrong, I'm so excited! But, now I'm realizing how much my life is changing and in a way I'm kinda depressed at the fact I'm losing my youth. I know that I'm guna be okay, but now I have to put my goals on hold until the baby is a little bit older. So I can't tell u what u should or shouldn't do, but if u wana take my advice, I would wait on the baby. I'm not saying u wouldn't appreciate a little one, but as young women, we still have a lot to learn and expierience before we become mommy's!! I wish u the best!

I had the same feeling for a long time. What I did is I got the Nintendo DS game "My Baby Girl" (they have "My Baby Boy" too). I felt a lot better after playing hours of it, and now I have a "baby girl" I can afford and handle at this time in my life. She's very cute, and she'll do for now.

Spotting at 5 months?



I just got off from urinating and I noticed that there's blood stain on the bowl.  When i wiped off with a tissue, truly there's blood on it.  I've travelled yesterday but it was somewhat comfortable and was not that far to and fro.  I am constipated so when I went to the toilet I was pushing but not too hard.  What do you think is happening to my baby?

The Week 13 symptons are as follows



Your Baby
By pregnancy week 13 your tiny baby may be over 3 inches long and weigh almost ¾ of an ounce! There is still plenty of growing your baby will undergo as you continue your pregnancy week by week.



Changes In Your Growing Baby
Though your baby is much larger than he was when he started 12 weeks ago, by 13 weeks pregnant your little munchkin is still pretty tiny. Despite that your baby looks fully formed, with a head, arms, legs and complete torso. Your baby's head won't look quite as disproportionate to the rest of his body by pregnancy 13 weeks. By this time your baby's liver will start producing insulin, a life saving hormone that will help your bay regulate his blood sugar as he grows and develops.



By pregnancy 13 weeks your baby's eyes will also start moving from the sides of his head to their final destination at the front of your baby's face.



Your Body's Development
By pregnancy week 13 your uterus is expanding even further. This sometimes causes some discomfort or mild cramping. Some women experience what is referred to as round ligament pain around pregnancy at 13 weeks. This pain while sometimes alarming is usually harmless. If you experience round ligament pain you may feel a short or brief sharp and stabbing pain along one side of your abdomen or the other. This usually happens when a woman is shifting positions quickly, say moving from her side to her back or getting up suddenly.



Most round ligament pain will disappear in a few minutes. If you notice pain that is accompanied by other symptoms including bleeding, omitting or cramping you should contact your health care provider immediately. This may be a sign that something more serious is occurring. Typically however round ligament pain is brief and easily relieved by simply relaxing or resting for a moment. It often serves as an important reminder for pregnant women to slow things down while pregnant.



Changes In Your Body
You deserve a huge pat on the back! You are now entering your second trimester. Pregnancy week 13 is definitely a time to cheer. By pregnancy at 13 weeks your risk for miscarriage drops significantly. Most women who carry to 13 weeks pregnant will continue to carry their baby to term.



This does not mean your risk for miscarriage is completely eliminated. There are rare instances where some women's risk of miscarriage continues through the 20th week. In some cases a condition called an incompetent cervix is to blame. Women who have an incompetent cervix are not able to carry their baby to term without medical intervention, because the cervix starts to shorten and open before 20 weeks pregnant. This causes the baby to be delivered too early.



Fortunately this is a pretty uncommon problem and once identified, a doctor can perform a procedure called a cerclage to help ensure the cervix remains closed for future pregnancies.



By 13 weeks pregnant while too small for maternity clothes, you are probably ready to move into a pair of sweat pants for a short time. Aside from your growing belly you may start noticing bumps forming on your breasts. These bumps are glands that help the breasts grow and develop during pregnancy. You may also find that your libido and energy start returning at roughly 13 weeks pregnant. Most women consider the second trimester the honeymoon phase of their pregnancy. Take advantage of your increasingly good spirits and energy level and invest in a little comfy lingerie or new bra for yourself. Many women find the increased blood flowing throughout their body heightens their sense of pleasure and ecstasy during intercourse. You might as well enjoy the experience while you can, the second trimester is only a few short months!

Name that baby whatever you want to. It's your child. So long as your husband is ok with it, who cares? She had her chance to name a baby.. and this isn't it. When it's her carrying the little one inside, then she has the right to say yes/no/eeew.



Don't sweat it. IF she's still that against the name after the baby is born, she can make a pet name for her that only she uses. That's what my sister's mother in law did.

What you choose to name your child is your personal decision. Not everyone will like the name you choose but so long as you like it that is all that matters.



Do not listen to what you mom-in-law said. If you love the name then use it! It is not her child so she has no say!



Yes if you were naming her "Exacterumoundousticia the Fourteenth" then I can agree maybe you should consider changing it but other than that it is YOUR decision! No one can force you name a child something you don't want. You are the ones who have to live with the baby calling her by her name all the time!



go back to the name you originally chose. You chose it for a reason!

Everyname i picked out i got an Ewww from both my mom and my Mom in law.. i didnt care.  My mom liked names i wouldnt name my kid in a million years!  And my MIL gave me names that seemed like they where from a third world country... so there opinion wasnt so importnant to me lol.  You will always come across people with negative opinions on the name you chose, but it shouldnt get to you.. it just means they have a mind of their own which is healthy :)  however i dont think they should make you feel like crap about it.. mom seem to think they can say exactly how they feeel though, its like their duty or something :)

There is not much you can do to relieve the soreness but wait.



They will become less sore gradually over the next few weeks until they are just tender.  Then after delivery they will feel worse than now.  The pain is caused from the hormone level change your body is experiencing from being pregnant.  Don't worry it is something most women experience while pregnant.

Four days later on my period.....BUT!?!?!?!? ?



I already took a test 2 days ago and it was negative... but should I retest? Or should I just asssume I am not pregnant? When I had my son the test was positive right away! Is every pregnancy different when it comes to testing? (Im usually never late) thanks!! (Its annoying I just want a positive result or my period!! Having neither is frustrating)

I would retest in a day or two.  Try testing first thing in the morning when your hormone levels are highest.  You might just not have a high enough level of hormones to be detected yet.

I was a week and a half late for my period this month. It usually comes perfectly. Not all periods are the same. If your routine has changed, your period could've changed. Wait it out for a few more days. Enjoy not bleeding for a bit! If you still test negative, and still no period, then you should call a doctor. But I would wait a few days to a week before getting too frustrated.

I will also suggest you like others that you should wait at least a week to retest and do not loose hope.



Some women do not get positive even after 2 weeks late.
and yes , not every pregnancy is same.
So my dear friend wait,wait wait and then retest.

every pregnancy is different. if you are it could not show up becuase your level of the hcg (the pregnancy hormone the test picks up) might not be that high yet. if you dont get your period soon then i would retest in like a week.

Sex is fine throughout pregnancy unless your doctor has advised against it. Personally i couldn't stand sex when i got pregnant and the bigger i got the more awkward it was to find a comfortable position. But everyone is different. There is however no evidence to suggest it will do your baby harm if your having a normal healthy pregnancy.

I hate being pregnant. How can I feel better about myself?



Okay so I am pregnant with twins. Only two months, but i have a nine month old daughter. I wasn't too happy when i found out i was pregnant again, but the fact that it was twins kind of made it okay. But i feel like ****. Not because of the morning sickness or anything like that. I mean i personally feel like ****. I hate getting dressed, not too mention me and my husband haven't had sex in a month. When i was pregnant with my first daughter we did all the time, until i was like eight months. I feel like the ugliest person right now. Im a stay at home mom, and that should give me plenty of time to pamper myself but i don't even want to do that any more. I have no idea what to do, I cant keep feeling like this another seven months.

It sounds like you are being affected by the pregnancy hormones in a bad way. Hormones are pretty different for everyone.  I felt tired and irritable throughout my first trimester but now I feel great!



I'm sure you will feel so much better when you enter your second trimester.



There is also something called PRE-natal depression which hits women who are pregnant so maybe bear this in mind. I am not saying you have it but it is something to look into.



Good luck!

Its not unusual for some women 'not' to bloom in pregnancy. I felt awful all the way through with my first baby. I had morning sickness all the way through and felt whale like and very depressed. I put on a vast amount of weight and felt hideous. In these early stages, your body is going through a massive change and you will no doubt be feeling exhausted. Its normal in the early stages, especially when you have another child to care for. I am not sure about the pampering, but you should speak to your doctor who may be able to suggest some relaxation techniques. As a stay at home mum with a small baby, its easy to sit indoors and not bother to go out. A friend of mine once told me, 'make an effort to go out, every day, even if its just a little walk up the road'. It gives you a reason to make an effort to get dressed and blow away the cobwebs. A little exercise is good for you too.

sit down with your husband and really share your feelings he will do anything to help you i am sure of it. if the feelings get worse and you do become depressed, or continue to have hopeless thoughts you may want to speak to your doctor. postpartum depression can kick in well before you give birth & can become much worse aafter-wards you may not have it with one child and have a severe case of it with the next one it's very random and very very very hard to deal with. it's always good to be screened for it even if you are not showing strong signs of it. i am not trying to offend but to offer all possible options. if you can't speak with your husband, or it's not a depression, try to find a friend you can vent to at least try to talk it out with someone some how. i really hope something will help....

ahh thats rough, it sounds  like you got yourself a case of postnatal blues :(



Talk with your doc about this, he/she can help and give you ways to feel better.  Also remember females let off a certain glow when we are pregnant, we may feel like giant beached whales with bad skin and frizzy hair, but the world seems to look at us totally different, like we shine in everyone elses eyes.. and my boyfriend finds me very attractive while pregnant, which im sure your hubby does too.



Make sure to get a baby sitter when you can and give your chance to get out and look pretty, go out with friends when possible.  Pregnancy is hard, as you know just as much as any of us, and at times i do get depressed too.. and in your case your preggo back to back, thats rough :(

Please anyone? surely not pregnant?



our condom broke on the morning of the 12th, the next day i took the morning after pill but also started taking antibiotics at the same time, that night i had IV antibiotics as the tablets weren't working fast enough. i know antibiotics make the morning after pill less effective.
from the 17th to the 20th i had very light bleeding (about a week before my period was due), im not sure whether it was light because of the pill or if it could have been implantation bleeding.



i started taking the contraceptive pill on the 20th and took a home pregnancy test on the 24th which came back negative.



iv been having a sore back (usual pms symptom for me) for a few days and real hungry but nothing else too obvious and i don't know if its because of the contraceptive pill or if i could possibly be pregnant

What do you think I should do?



I know that I should be consulting my doctor instead of Yahoo Answers with a problem like this, but my doctor has been absolutely no help to me so I need someone else's opinion.



I'm 39 weeks, 5 days pregnant. I woke up from a nap at 6 p.m. (it is now 6 a.m.) with steady contractions accompanied with back pain that were about 4-7 minutes apart and lasting about 50 seconds each. I tried to ride it out most of the day by taking a warm bath, drinking fluids, and laying on my side. When I went to bed for the night (around midnight), the pain was so intense that I couldn't sleep. I decided to go to the hospital. I was checked, and told that I was a fingertip dilated and to take a sleeping pill and go home (around 4 a.m.). The doctor told me "I know you're uncomfortable, but you'll KNOW when you're in real labor." I tried explaining to my doctor that what I was feeling was not discomfort at all, it was extremely severe pain. I told her I could not imagine the contractions getting worse, and she even went as far as to crack a smile at me. She shrugged me off, told me to take Tylenol and use a heating pad for my back. I came home, and my contractions have only gotten worse. They are EXCRUCIATING, to the point where I'm literally hysterically crying and screaming through them and curled into a ball. They are still strong and regular and I don't know if my back or my stomach hurts more. More than anything, I want to go to the hospital, but I really do not want to run into the same people who are going to tell me the same thing. The pain is unbearable. What should I do? I already know that once businesses open, I'm going to find a new doctor.

This sounds that you could be labouring - labour contractions. And the bb is going all the way down the birth canal. Call your gynae and you're likely to be admitting yourself soon. Have a smooth delivery. Congratulations.

It might just be pressure of the baby in the birth canal pushing on your bladder. You will need to speak to your doctor or midwife as you may have a water infection.

It sounds like your baby's head is engaging. I used to get sharp pains everytime my baby pushed his head against my cervix. Some people get it worse than others. Go to your doctor though just in case. Its always better to be on the safe side, don't ever feel like you're over-reacting.

Did anyone have high blood sugar in 32nd week of pregnancy.?



I got my glucose tolerance test done..fasting was 127 instead of 110, after 1 hour of glucose intake it was 263 and 2 hrs later it was 236. Normally it should be less than 140. What are the problems that one encounters due to such high sugar levels..

We have a different numbering system in Australia so I'm not sure how that compares. Basically, gestational diabetes sucks. There are numerous health problems that will occur if you're not controlling it. That's pretty unlikely though. You'll probably be sent to a diabetes educator, dietician and be seeing an obstetrician every week until you give birth. Start reading up on the GI index and eat the lowest GI foods you can. Also read up on serving sizes. Apparently an orange is one serve, but I can only eat half or my bloods will spike. I'm 27 weeks now, and can no longer get my carbs from grains, so I am eating a heck of a lot of legumes. I'm really getting to hate legumes. You need to spread your carb intake out during the day. I was told to divide it between breakfast, lunch and dinner. That didn't work for me. I have to have a small amount at the three meals and morning and afternoon tea, and supper. Supper is really important for maintaining your blood sugars over night. It's not just how high or low you go, but also the variation, so stable is good.
I can't tell you what happens with insulin. I managed to keep diet controlled with my first pregnancy, and so far so good this time. Anyway, as I said, it sucks, but you've got to do what you've got to do, eh? It's definately not something to be slack about. If you overload your system by not controlling it, your baby gets overloaded too, causing his/her little pancreas to work overtime. That means when bub is born, it'll take a bit of time before it realises it doesn't have to work so hard, so it'llkeep producing too much insulin, and his/her blood sugars will drop severely. That means a stay in the special care unit while they get things back to normal. Also, the bub is at risk of getting too large by laying down fat stores in unhealthy places, which is starting off behind the eightball as far as health goes. That increases your odds of having to be induced early. Now you may want to be induced early to get rid of the discomfort of pregnancy, but babies of mothers with uncontrolled diabetes tend to be born large, but a bit immature.
Good thing is, if you control it, with diet if you can or insulin, it's pretty unlikely any of that nasty stuff will happen. I kept diet controlled with my daughter, and she was absolutely fine. I did have to be induced at 40 weeks, but that's standard procedure with diabetic mothers, and for good reason. Basically, ask lots of questions about anything you don't understand, and do as you are told!

Just be honest with him, there's not much else you can do. Since you've been together 4 years you obviously have a strong bond with him, so i'm guessing he would be upset if you hid it from him. I was in this situation a few months ago, and I just told my boyfriend straight. I did it on the phone though, so he could choose whether he wanted to be left on his own to deal with it or come round my house to talk about it. He did the latter, and we are now expecting our first daughter in January :) good luck with everything xx

No birth control is perfect.  It is possible that you are pregnant.



However, it would be very early to be having symptoms, and nothing you describe is a typical symptom of pregnancy. So you probably AREN'T pregnant (if you took all your pills on schedule) but the only way to know for sure is to wait and see if your period comes at the end of the pill pack. If it doesn't, test.

If the pill is pretty new to you, it is still changing your body which can cause irregularity in your cycle.



Even if you take the pill you can still get pregnant.  You could be in that 1% of hopelessly and ridiculously fertile women.  If that is the case you should sell some eggs.



I am guessing you could also be having a urinary tract infection or a bladder infection if the blood is on the tissue only when you urinate, as opposed to spotting on your undergarments.

Any time you are sexually active, you run the risk of becoming pregnant. Regardless of your method of birth control. All contraception methods has a chance of failure.



This could be implantation bleeding. Take a pregnancy test. Either over the counter or at the doctor's office. If you need a clinic, check this listing, they are usually very helpful. http://www.optionline.org

Hi everyone!  I just want to get some reassurance re: the Nuchal Translucency # we got from the doctor.  I am 12W5D and the measurement came back at 2.1 mm.

How can I tell if i am pregnant...and how do i tell them?



how, without anyone finding out, would you be able to tell if you were pregnant or not. so this means that i can't get a test cause then my parent would find out so would everyone else. and if i am, how would i tell my boyfriend and his mom. also how would i be accepted.

How old are you? Can you drive to the store on your own and buy a test? No one would know, you just pee on the test and throw it away (outside in the "big trash" if you don't want anyone to know).



Tell your boyfriend and have him tell his mother with you. Just keep your head up and be strong and tell people you are accepting responsibility for your actions and that you are going to be mature about the whole situation and you'll be surprised how supportive people will be.



Good luck.

you could visit a planned parenthood facility or a place that helps with pregnancy decisions.
Where are you located? Maybe google it in your area and find somewhere thats private and non profit.



If you are very young, you may have a problem but just see if you miss your period and remember what the first day of your last period was so that you can calculate a due date.



I would sit down with your bf and tell them together, they might get upset, usually the Mom will get a few tears or they may be mad at first but they will be fine trust me

When it all comes down to it, pressing a magical spot on your foot will not spur labour on, if you body has not begun itself.



Reading your prior questions, I would sincerely hope you are not trying to bring labour on at your 36-37 weeks mark.
You will only exhaust yourself, and end up frustrated, and not in labour.



I visited the maternity acupressure site, google it.
It says to not try anything until you are over due.



So pressing spots on your body at 37 weeks is not only not going to work, it's going to make you look like a goon.



"Hey hun, why are you pressing your foot like that?"



"Oh. you know, trying to induce the baby before he's actually due..the usual..."

It hasnt worked for me, im one of those stupid idiots who paid money for downloading the techniques lol! Ive been trying them for two weeks, the only thing they've helped is relieve some of the water retention in my feet and legs, and helped me relax a bit more. But there are people whom it has worked for them. You can eamil me if you'd like the copy. Its pretty lengthy and descriptive. I hope to use it when i do go into labor, it says it whill help relieve the pain and discomfort and shorten delivery time. Maybe it will help me then!

Looking for advice...?



i'm trying to work out whether it would be worth doing a pregnancy test.



my period is three weeks late and while they've never been entirely regular for the past few months i have been getting them. i've had a few pains as if i were about to come on, but nothing yet. i've also been feeling really tired, nauseous, and having headaches. my breasts are a lot fuller than usual also. the last time i had sex was mid to late september, however i always use condoms.



do you think it could be worth doing a pregnancy test? under any other circumstances i would but i went for a scan thing (i dont know what its called but it's when they look at your womb and ovaries on a little screen) so i'm presuming they would've been able to see if i was pregnant from that.



what do i do?



</question>



<additional details>



the scan was on october second and was to try and see why my periods are always so painfu/long and why i often have period like/pelvic pains when i'm not on.



however these pains have improved drastically throughout the past few weeks.

Advice?..I want to keep my baby but Bf is adament he doesn't..?



My bf and I had only been together for 4 and a half months when i fell pregnant. I'm 27 and really should have known better..I already have 2 children age 2 and 5 from a previous marriage.



We had talked about what happened if i did fall pregnant and we were both ok with the fact. Then he decided he wasn't sure as we were having a few arguements..yet we still weren't taking precations. He was trying for a baby with a pevious gf for nearly 10 months..He seems to have it set in his mind he wasnt working and that was that.



I think he needs to see a counsellor as revealed to me that he had been abused as a young teenager, and ever since he has told me he has threatened suicide and all manner of things. One minute he tells me he loves me with all his heart and in the same breath he's telling he never wants to see me again..He runs away from everything and buries his head hoping it will go away..



So i'm now 9 weeks pregnant and we've only seen each other a few times since i told him. We use to be inseperable.



He keeps saying i'm not being fair on him by keeping a child he doesnt want. He can't seem to see that its my body and emotions that will go throught it all. I've already had 2 terminations and i don't want to go through anther one. Its as simple as that, but all i get is that i'm selfish etc etc..He said today if i got rid of the baby it would give us a chance to get to know each other without the stress of a baby..
I can see what he's saying but i just dont want to..
Any advice?



</question>



<additional details>



Just thought i'd add.. I had a termination at 17 and the other one was 4 months after I had my son..so at the time this was the right option for me..



I know we should have been using contraception and yes i was stupid..i'm old enough to know better and all the rest..that doesn't really help me now..



I do want this baby and there is no way I could go through adoption after giving birth.



I've been a single mother since my ex husband left me for another woman when my youngest was 5 and a half months old.



2 years on i'm doing very well..i'm not your stereotypical council estate single mother..and i never intended to be this,,(no offence to anyone) That was not how i was brought up..and dont intend it for my children..

It is your baby as much as his! If you want to keep it, keep it! Your body, your decision.



And, as for not being fair on him, well, he should have thought about it before if you were not taking precautions. Pregnancy does happen in the circumstances, too bad, I'm sure he is aware of how babies are conceived

get rid of the baby u will regret it you already know that



there is no way things will be good between you because you got rid because you will always know you killed your baby for him
its easy for him to say get rid its not him going through why after 2 abortions would you ever put urself through that again



you make the decision because of you NOT him

He sounds selfish by NOT understanding what you want - this is a two way thing,  but at the end of the day this is your body and your baby.



Personally I wouldn't want a chance with this relationship - he has issues that he needs to resolve but they should not be the reason for forcing his view on terminating on you,  I am sorry sweetie but he is trying to emotionally blackmail you into terminating,  which is obviously not what you want to do,  he has no empathy or respect for what you want.



You know in your heart that you want this baby,  he is being selfish wanting a termination and putting his views before your own,  is that a decent basis for any relationship?  He is selfish because he took the risks of having sex without using contraception and now is not willing to step up to the responsibility of that.



It is your body,  your baby,  do what you heart tells you. xx



Edit,
Just to add that I don't see this as either party being at "fault",  obviously both parties took the "risk of not using contraception",  but the huge difference is, he is the one willing to use abortion as his form of contraception the poster is not,  she is willing to stand up to her responsibilities and carry through with the pregnancy - that is the big difference.

Honestly, this is what sickens me about the whole pro-choice scheme...because people don't realize when SO many men use abortion ON women..it's not much of a choice! People are so quick to judge women, but they have no idea just HOW many men have pushed an abortion on a woman.
Tell him he flat-out disgusts you & punch him in his face. This is the least that he deserves. It disgusts me that so many men are OK with doing this to their baby and a pregnant woman. They are coniving and coerce women DAILY. Half of all the women I know, that have had abortions, were pressured intensely by their partner! So much for a woman's choice.



Don't allow him to violate your body, your baby, and your respect. I have had to go thru with an ab. before, but it was @ 6 weeks, due to medical issues....and even then..it has been the most painful (emotionally) and depressing thing in my life! I completely understand where you are coming from b/c there is no way in hell I would be able to go thru with it again. HE is being selfish. YOU are being wonderful & protective of the baby inside of you.

You are in a very interesting situation. A couple of people have stated and I agree "it is your body" but those same people are basically stating that it is his fault and in my opinion it BOTH of you that are at fault. YOU having terminated twice before AND having 2 kids should have known better. Now I am not saying it is all your fault but I am saying you might want to consider all of your options before you make a decision. If you keep this child and the father has already stated that he wants nothing to do with it, are you going to go after him for support? I don't really think that is fare. I am not saying you should abort it You could give it for adoption...

years ago, i went through the same thing.  simular story as yours.  the b/f  thought that if i terminated the pregnancy that in due time we could try to have one as he said "when the time is right"  so, i loved him and didnt want to lose him, so i sacrificed the life of my un born child for a relationship that ended 4 months later.



what it comes down to is he dosnt think your relationship is strong enough  and dosnt for see you too making it in the future, so he is trying to get you to do it his way so if by chance you two do not work out, he is not stuck paying child support..



you have to take in consideration that he did try to have a child with another women before you for 10 months. ask yourself this.. what does she have that you dont in regards of bringing a child intop the world.  honestly hun, that would burn my heart more knowing it was ok to try with another women and not with me. now that you are pregnant, i would do what you think is right, but dont  exspect your relationship to get better if you decide to terminiate again.. you said it yourself that you do not want to go down that road again.

It's a choice only you can make. Are you going to choose him, or the baby? He sounds very immature, so I don't think you can have both. You can't make him grow up, that's his decision to either do or not. If you haven't seen each other often since breaking the news, I would suggest the relationship is dying off anyway. Aborting doesn't mean it's going to work out between you anyway. He sounds like he has too much baggage to be able to be in an adult relationship.
Again, him or the baby?

It's your body and ultimately your decision but if you do decide to keep it then be prepared for the worst. Your boyfriend might not want anything to do with you or the baby and then you'll be raising 3 children alone.



Once you have come to terms with the fact that you might have to go through this alone sit your boyfriend down and have a talk. Explain to him your feelings about abortion and that when you think about the children you already have you couldn't imagine your life without them.



Ultimately your relationship won't be the same either way, whether you keep your baby or terminate it its going to have a huge impact on your relationship. And quite frankly if he was that concerned about you getting pregnant in the first place he should have worn a condom. Its his responsibility as well as yours to take precautions.

I  know exactly how you feel!



I am 6 weeks pregnant now and my bf keeps giving me this sob story about how much hard work kids are etc. We were both using protection but it still happened.



I had a termination at 17 so I really don't want to lose another child. I don't feel like I have his full support and he has always been there for be about the abortion before even though it has nothing to do with him as it was my ex that forced me into getting one before due to rape, but now he's all for me getting one! Even though he has seen everything I've gone through about it since then!



I'm 20 now and will not be forced into it. I have a job, not very well paid, but it's something. I'm moving back in with my parents due to money problems (me and my bf have been living together for a year and half and together for 2years next month). If I have to stay there to bring up my baby alone I will.



Don't let him pressure you into doing anything you don't want to. You and I both know the moral and emotional problems caused by abortion so don't take this decision lightly.



If you know you can cope and have others to support you when you may need it, then go for it and have your baby. It's your body and your baby at the end of the day. I know it's not a decision you should have to make alone, but ultimately you have to.

Trisomy 18 - Have just had results from combined 12 weeks screening and they came back as a 1:2 chance.?
Had a CVS test done today - i understand that the results from the CVS will give us a definite answer, but, how accurate is the combined screening? (blood test and ultrasound @ 12 weeks) the doctor said that the chances were extremely high being 1:2. and for future, what are the chances of this being the case in another of our pregnancies? We already have one son who is completely healthy, and we're a couple both under the age of 30! Is this a normal result?

That is high, although waiting until you other results come back may be a good idea. You dont want to worry over nothing. Of course, although the ratio does sound high, it does not mean its a defiante. Being the age you are, and not knowing about any other factors, if you are both completly healthy the chances of this happening in any subsquent pregnancies would presumably be low. Wish you the best of luck

I'm very sorry you have to go through this, but you will have the definitive results soon enough.  As I'm sure you realize, a 1:2 chance it quite high!  On the bright side, there is also a 1:2 chance that your baby does not have it, just like the chances of having a boy or a girl.  All you can do it wait for the results and keep you fingers crossed.



The chances of this happenning in another pregnancy are very low as Trisomy 18 occurs in only 1/3000 foetuses (and 1/6000 live births).  Try not to worry about it happening - chances really are slim to none.



Best of luck.

I had my membranes stripped yesterday too and i got the strong contractions, and as soon as i got on the recliner i noticed they stopped. I know you cant walk much, but i believe thats the best way to get them to go stronger. Sitting on a exercise ball can help, it helps open you pelivs a bit more and force the babys head to put pressure, try taking a warm bath, it helps the cervix to soften and dialate. These are all remedies that people have given me to help me since i cant walk much i have a horrible back, and it got worse with the pregnancy. Good luck!

I had a similar situation 21 years ago.  I went into labor, spent the night in the hospital with decreasing labor pains and was sent home the next morning to wait until my pains lasted for a certain period of time and were a specific distance apart.  This never happened - I insisted that my husband take me back to the hospital the next day.  I had an emergency c section and a beautiful baby boy who spent 3 days in the neo natal unit.
The same thing happened to my friend - they kept telling her that her due day must have been wrong (because she never went into labor).  She wasn't so lucky.  Doctors are not always right.  DEMAND that they do an ultrasound or similar test to see what is going on with the baby.  Remember, doctors are human - they make mistakes.

Should she keep the baby?



My friend is 10 weeks pregnant and although her and her boyfriend weren't trying she had always told him she would never be able to abort if it ever did happen. Now however she is pregnant and is not pressuring her to have an abortion but has made it clear that that is what he wants her to do.



Her mum however is seriously pressuring her into having abortion telling her it will completely screw up her entire life if she keeps it even tho my friend does not believe in abortion and thinks that having that Weight on her for the rest of her life would be even harder to deal with.



She has asked me what she should do as she doesn't know if it is right to bring a baby into the world when 2 of the 3 most important people in the babies life dint want it.



Can you please give her your opinion as i don't know what to say...

she needs to do what she feels is right! She has to be strong and not give in to something she doesn't want to do no matter how bad any one is treating her over it. If she feels she can't take care of the baby then adoption is the way to go and she will feel better about it, knowing the baby is cared for and has a loving home. If she want to keep the baby then I honestly think her mom and boyfriend will fall in love with the baby when it gets here.

Your family will never abandon you when you need them. Her mother is advising abortion because she thinks that is whats best. If she decides to keep the baby her mother will support her whether or not she agrees it is the right thing to do.



Her boyfriend should have taken precautions not to get pregnant. Your friend stated bluntly that she would never abort a baby, this was clearly a sign that he should be taking extra caution NOT to get pregnant. I'm sorry but i really can't stand people that think that abortion is the answer to your problem. My mums friend had so many abortions when she was younger that she made herself sterile.

Tell her to keep the baby!  She's looking to you to provide the moral support that her boyfriend and family will not.  If you side with them, she will be totally alone.  Refer her to a non-profit pregnancy clinic or social services center (here's a directory- http://www.optionline.org/advantage.asp) and offer to go with her to her appointment.  There are lots of resources available for her, but she needs your encouragement above all.

<question>



What do you think I should do?



I know that I should be consulting my doctor instead of Yahoo Answers with a problem like this, but my doctor has been absolutely no help to me so I need someone else's opinion.



I'm 39 weeks, 5 days pregnant. I woke up from a nap at 6 p.m. (it is now 6 a.m.) with steady contractions accompanied with back pain that were about 4-7 minutes apart and lasting about 50 seconds each. I tried to ride it out most of the day by taking a warm bath, drinking fluids, and laying on my side. When I went to bed for the night (around midnight), the pain was so intense that I couldn't sleep. I decided to go to the hospital. I was checked, and told that I was a fingertip dilated and to take a sleeping pill and go home (around 4 a.m.). The doctor told me "I know you're uncomfortable, but you'll KNOW when you're in real labor." I tried explaining to my doctor that what I was feeling was not discomfort at all, it was extremely severe pain. I told her I could not imagine the contractions getting worse, and she even went as far as to crack a smile at me. She shrugged me off, told me to take Tylenol and use a heating pad for my back. I came home, and my contractions have only gotten worse. They are EXCRUCIATING, to the point where I'm literally hysterically crying and screaming through them and curled into a ball. They are still strong and regular and I don't know if my back or my stomach hurts more. More than anything, I want to go to the hospital, but I really do not want to run into the same people who are going to tell me the same thing. The pain is unbearable. What should I do? I already know that once businesses open, I'm going to find a new doctor.

I do not believe in your story. If you are 39 weeks and all the situation you described -  a doctor never let you go home and take drugs. Looks like you are 14 years old and trying to make fun from "pregnancy" topic.

You cannot get pregnant 3 days before your period, because you would have ovulated about 10-12 days before, and the egg died long ago.



It IS possible to get pregnant from sex 3 days after your period, because the sperm can live in your body for up to 5 days, and so may still be there when you ovulate.



(You can only actually get pregnant WHEN you ovulate, and you ovulate about 14 days before your next period.  Sperm can live for 5 days, the egg lives less than a day.  So there is roughly a 5-6 day window each month when sex can result in pregnancy.)



EDIT: Those thumbs down folks -- do you have ANY idea how reproduction works? How is it possible to get pregnant 3 days before a period?  Even if you did ovulate that late, it would result in a luteul phase far too short to support a pregnancy! (And if you ovulated late AND had a normal luteul phase, the period woulldn't come in 3 days, so it would be '3 days before your period.)

You can fall pregnant during your period although it is very rare. Some woman ovulate more than one egg a month which means there are more than 2 days a month a woman can fall pregnant. My midwife told me for the average woman ovulating once a month there are only 2 days she can conceive.

Should I do a pregnancy test right now?



I'm on CD 33 although my last cycle was around 45 days due to coming of BC.  I'm going to a party tonight and don't want to drink If I am but if not then I would have been worrying for nothing.  I haven't really any symptoms exept heartburn and a bit moody.  I've just had a cold and sore throat and woke up this morning covered in coldsores which I'm sure has nothing to do with pregnancy but thought I'd just add for sympathy lol.  I have had creamy lotion type cm which I some people say is a symptom?  Anyway I have a tesco test in my bag now (I'm at work) and need a wee soon - so what do you think?

a do-it-yourself pregnancy test, like clear blue, first response, etc. can give you accurate results, but going to the doctor and getting a blood test or seeing your gyno is always going to give you the 100% correct result. my cousin took a pregnancy test once, and it came out negative. she got another one about 3 days later and tried again, and still came out negative. she still didn't believe that she was not pregnant, so she visited her doctor, and it turns out - she was. lol, so in my opinion, i wouldn't go based off of one of those. even if it comes out positive.. still see your doctor. good luck!

It means they did an examination of you or did some tests on a pregnancy you now have that is normal.  But it also means you have had some medical problems in the past or might have had trouble with a past pregnancy. What it means is "there were issues in the past, but this pregnancy is normal"

i think it means normal subsequent pregnancy , because your second pregnancy soon after the first one. there is not much gap. and there is nothing like lose of a child because of the word normal.

Was it the labelling of the test results?



If so all it means is that the tests taken were for supervising a normal, second, pregnancy.



Hope that helps

It means that your current pregnancy is progressing normally and that they are going to keep a close eye on you because of your previous miscarriage, i had this written on my notes in my pregnancy after my loss everything went fine she is now 4 months old

You need to be patient when your little one wants to come.



Here are some of the most common methods women try to induce labor naturally
Sexual intercourse - This works in two ways to induce labor. First, female orgasm can bring on contractions. Second, semen contains prostaglandins. Prostaglandins work to help ripe and soften the cervix.



Nipple stimulation - Stimulating the nipples triggers the production of natural oxytocin. Oxytocin contracts the uterus.



Accupressure - Accupressure may be helpful in inducing labor. Some pressure points you can try are the roof of your mouth, the webbing of your fingers between your pointer finger and thumb, and above the ankle about four fingerspaces above is a pressure point.



Stripping the membranes - This can only be done by a health care provider. Your doctor or midwife will seperate the bag of waters from your cervix and this is thought to help encourage labor to start.



Raspberry Leaf Tea - Rasberry leaf tea is not actually known for it's labor inducing properties, but it is believed to be helpful in toning the uterus and helping with labor.



Cinnamin stick tea - Take cinnamin sticks and boil them into a tea and drink. It actually tastes good so even if it doesn't bring on labor it may help you to relax.



Evening primrose oil - Evening primrose oil comes in small capsules similar to vitamin E. It is believed to help soften and ripen the cervix.



Walking - Walking may help to get baby to drop into proper position.



Visualization/relaxation - Relaxation can help with labor induction. Try doing relaxation exercisers. They are also good practice for when labor actually begins.



Pineapple, cumin tea, eggplant parmesan, and spicy foods - are another thing you can try.



Other methods we do not recommend for inducing labor
Castor oil - Castor oil is also used for inducing labor. It tastes horrible! It is likely to make you feel sick and it probably won't work.



Herbs - There are other herbs you can use to induce labor. Without consulting your doctor or midwife we do not recommend the use of herbs.

well, technically, nothing is proven to 100% work... but here are some ideas that women say have worked for them:
Walking/light exersise
Sex
Spicy Foods



Don't use castor oil... it's not good for you or the baby.



Also, just know that your baby will come into the world when she's ready... you don't want to stress her or your body by pushing for things before the baby is ready.

OK if you know what you're doing and want to take any precaution you would know that the emergency contraceptive pill is not a good form of contraception especially not for days of continuous sex.



It should be taken once after normal contraception failed, not used as a method on its own and definitely not more than once. It is far less effective than using a condom any time or getting on the regular pill (about 85% compared to 99%).



I suggest you ask for a prescription for birth control pills (and make sure you have been on them long enough to be effective before you rely on them) and in the meantime use a condom every time you have sex.

what is ipill? If this is the emergency pill then you are not supposed to take it more than 3 times in one cycle or it just doesn't work effectively. If its the normal contraceptive pill then don't you just take one a day. Go to your doctor or family planning clinic to discuss contraception options.

Do not worry, there is still hope for the pregnancy.  They usually can't see much/anything until your levels are over 1000.  Just get another hCG in a few days, you should be able to see your bean on a transvaginal ultrasound by then too.  Good luck!

Yes it is normal, regardless of your size. However, it may be bloating. Also, no one else likely notices, unless you are slim. But slim or curvy, it is normal, as everyone is different and some show earlier than others.
I panicked when I started showing at 10 weeks as I am curvy and everyone says that only slim people show early. I thought I was carrying twins or something. But I am not.
Other than me and my husband, no one could tell that my stomach had grown. Others will start noticing around 20 weeks.

Try not to compare your pregnancy to other peoples, you will only end up worrying when yours doesn't go exactly the same. Remember every pregnancy is different and whats normal for you won't be the same for another. If your really slim you might just be noticing your belly getting bigger earlier because you don't have much fat around your stomach normally.

Hi , yes it is normal, particularly if your stomach was very flat before.
Before my pregnancy I wore fitted clothes, by 12 weeks I had gained 4 inches around the waist and stomach. I was in maternity clothes at 13 weeks and felt silly but my normal clothes just didn't fit. I  was carrying a lot of amniotic fluid so maybe this had something to do with it.



All the best for your pregnancy and baby.

You're not pregnant.  There is no natural way to become pregnant without having intercourse.  It's probably just the stress.

Getting the urge to have an drink!?



Personally i don't agree with drinking while pregnant, the way i see it 9 months is not a long time to go without.
Even when im not pregnant i only have the occasional drink.



Im 21w+6d #2 and for some strange reason i keep getting the urge that i want to have a drink!
Has this happened to anyone else?
Has anyone drunk throughout their pregnancy, was your baby fine?

cravings are your bodies way of telling you that you are missing something.  maybe by craving booze your body actually means that it wants you to drink more fluids, water, juice, milk.  Is there a specific drink you are craving.  Cuz if you were craving like a cosmopolitan maybe you just really want the cranberry juice, not the vodka.

Craving is natural in pregnancy, you're just having the misfortune of craving something you can't drink. Try alcohol free beer. It might help you. Or are you craving hard liquor? I have alcohol free scotch at my house- weird as it might seem- try to find one of those- mine I bought in Spain. Are you sure you're not just craving a nice ice cold beverage? Give it a try, maybe a ice cold sprite will help.

I was pretty sick with ms so I couldn't even imagine having a drink, the mere thought made me nauseous!  Until.....my husband and I went for dinner at a nice restaurant and I really wanted a glass of white wine.  But I didn't, it's probably safe and I know a lot of women have the occasional drink, I just couldn't do it myself.  Plus my husband would kill me!
Especially in a restaurant though, I also didn't want to deal with strangers giving me the Evil Eye :P

I'd get those cravings and i agree its probably because you want what you can't have. I'd allow myself a glass of wine but found that after a sip i couldn't stand to drink the rest I completely couldn't stand the taste of alcohol. Supposedly theres no harm in a glass of wine with a meal every now and then. If you can cope without it then stick with it, you're more than half way there.



Oh and for the record despite the occasional glass of wine my baby was born fit and healthy. You could also try a white wine spritzer for a low alcoholic drink.

First of all, I think you need to tell someone else at least your mom or your best friend. Guys dont really know what to do when there having a baby on the way. They get stupid. maybe its outta fear. If you want to have this baby, you need to be strong and show him that you are strong and maybe he will be more mature about the situation. Tell him its time to grow up and having a new baby is no joke. But your really need to tell someone if you dont you are going to feel alone. you need someone there when he is not able to be there.

Helle dearie,



Welcome on board, I am nearly 4mths gone. Every day I ask God to give me the strength to make the right decision and keep my baby healthy. Sometimes I wake up feeling like crap and just want to get rid of the preg.



Calm day and take each day as it comes. make a list of your baby needs and join an ante-natal class. Are you married? If yes talk to your husband about how you feel and if you are alone like I am, I pray for strength for you and the baby. I have heard alll sorts like its not gonna be easy, Life ain't easy for some people anyway but we learn to live by God's grace. Make a plan because like i have heard, Your life will take a differnt turn and children are the best gift you can ever ask for. (Ask anyone who's childless). My friends have been wonderful and I hope they will be there all the way.



Find your inner strength and use it for you and your baby.



God bless you and loads of love. (I'll pray for you both).



and my story has taken a turn.

Pregnant due new years day, dont want to host xmas.?



I am pregnant, due new years day, have already decided not to go to any inlaws for xmas, staying put at home. However I know the question is going to come up of at least his set coming to us on xmas day. I don't think I could bear all the extra work.



We have a 21/2 year old who they will obviously want to see and give gifts to but the effort of xmas dinner, evening buffet, then drinks/ games all night and staying over night is just not what I want.(both like a drink and would feel awful asking them to drive back home on the same day as its 50 miles) My other half would probably do quite a lot to help, but there's all the stuff to do that a man just doesn't even think about, (sorry men) which i would have to do. I feel really guilty as inlaws didn't see granchild last xmas day as we were at my house 250 miles away, so feel this year it is their turn but don't want all the hassle. I now its going to end in a big argument. Any ideas? On top of this I have had a difficult pregnancy and am shattered all the time. help? how do I say things diplomatically and not offend??

Maybe get everyone to pitch in and bring something.  Tell them that you would LOVE to have them all over but being on your feet for that long to prepare the feast will just be too much this late in your pregnancy.  Have a potluck christmas!  Have different people bring all the fixings, put someone else in charge of the games and stuff.  You are due anyday, if you feel that you can't do something, chances are you shouldn't.  This way, no one is dissappointed and you won't be run ragged.

Can your hubby take your child to visit them on Christmas Eve or Boxing Day? Then your mother in law could do the hosting, and your husband and child could come back home that same evening. The 2 year old is small anyhow and so a visit that lasts from 11 am until 4 in the afternoon would be ample. Your husband and child could spend time with them and celebrate, while you could stay at home and rest.



Talk to your husband about this, and he can explain the situation to his parents.

Yes, I like the potluck idea. You don't have to put on a show-stopping holiday event. Christmas is about family being together, not hosting the perfect party.  Just do whatever you can to make it easy on yourself - many grocery stores and restaurants make holiday meals for pick-up, or you could do something out of the norm and funky, like have a Chinese take-out feast. It's all about having some family time, not how the table is set or cooking a lot of fancy dishes. If you explain all this to your husband perhaps he'll help come up with some ways to be able to have everyone over without stressing you out.  Being nine months pregnant with a toddler is a totally understandable condition, no one would fault you for having a "low-key" dinner this year.

my advice is just tell them how you feel ahead of time. offer to bring the family to their house if that is possible, just for the day and go back home that night. or if you house is the only option just tell you mother-in-law that you really dont feel like you will e up to playing hostess and that they are more then welcome to come but if she could cook dinner you would feel more comfortable just helping out and being able to relax when you need to and knot having the weight on your shoulders. and maybe make it an earlier thing , do present in the morning and have a christmas lunch instead (you and your other half could prepare most of the food the day before) and then you in laws could drink  and visit and still leave in the evning as long as you cut off drinks (or accidently run out!!) a few hours before.
good luck and congrats

first off, you cannot have sex without penetration, that is what sex is...do you mean, you had sex without ejaculation? because there is sperm in pre-ejaculate, which def. can get you pregnant. you dont need to have sypmtoms to be pregnant, either...alot women dont realize they are pregnant for this reason...if you are late and concerned about being pregnant, you need to take a pregnancy test. if it comes out negative and still no period, then you need to goto the doctor to find out what is going on. it is possible you are stressing yourself out, making yourself late, which is really easy to do to yourself.

i think unless it's genetic he'd have to give it to the mother for the baby to get infected.  Definately something worth asking a dr though.

It's really down to the woman carrying the baby, from what I understand.



When a pregnant woman is a carrier of MRSA bacteria without an infection, there is no risk to her unborn baby at all.



If a pregnant woman becomes infected with MRSA, as with all infections, there is a very small chance that it could pass to the unborn baby. However, this is extremely rare.

MRSA (Methecillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) is a bacteria, not a virus, so no It will not transfer to your unborn baby, but if your partner still carries the bacteria, he will possibly infect the newborn after birth.



If he is going to be present at the birth, the medical staff will need to know to protect the staff and other babies on the ward.



It would also be advisable to be tested to see if you also are a carrier.



Good luck!

Yes, I have experienced this and still do. It is normal and the only thing that I did to alleviate the pain was get in a warm bath with a bath pillow and soak (letting the baby move around and possibly get out of that area). I also try relaxing in a recliner so I can stretch my body out hoping my lil one will move out of my side. Not much else can be done unfortunately as your baby has less room to move around and can just camp out wherever he/she wants. Good luck and congrats on your baby to come!

Before implanting the first woman's eggs into the second woman, they have to be furtilized by a male's sperm. Then, once incubation has begun, it is then implanted into the second woman. The second woman's eggs are never used for the procedure.... Just her uterus to carry the baby.



Think of it this way... I mix bread dough in my kitchen (with ALL the ingredients) and then take it to my neighbor's house to put it in the oven.



As far as your question about two women (lesbians), this may be what some of them could do to make both women feel closer to their child, but only one would be related via DNA, and the other would be the one to carry the child to term... using a 3rd person (male) for the sperm.



Hope that made it a little clearer.

no because its the sperm and the egg that make the baby, not the uterus that carries it. thats like baking a cake, it doesnt change the cake if you cook it in a different oven. its the ingredients that make the cake...so it the sperm and egg would be the ingredients, the body (uterus) is the oven.

It felt like a couple spider bites at first, but there is no visual sign of anything like that - and it has spread to now almost my elbows.

I had the depo shot, then had sex... very concerned.....Ill pick a BEST ANSWER.?



Ok so last tuesday I had my first depo shot. I had sex on saturday morning, saturday night, and on sunday with my bf. He didnt c*m inside me, (yes I know its still a huge risk.) We would have sex then put a condom on for a while before he came.



So Im wondering when I should expect to bleed next. In a month? A week? I just want to be sure I am not prego now. The doc told me to wait a week to be on the Safe Side...I pretty much waited about 4-5 days.



Oh and I got the shot the 2nd to last day of my period.

You probably wont have a period, i took the shot and havent had one in 2 years when it is time for your period again just take a test to be sure if you are concerned

Your cycle is going to be so unpredictable now that you got the shot.  Some women never get a period, some bleed every day for weeks or months on end.  Others get surprised when they get random bleeding for a few days.  You will not have regular periods.  You can get pregnant in the early part of getting the depo shot (like your doctor said, the first week or so).  The only thing you really can do is wait and test when you should technically be getting your period, or maybe even wait a few weeks later than that.



My friend did that very thing you described, and she ended up pregnant, and didn't even know because her doctor said she would have very irregular periods.  She didn't suspect anything until she had gained quite a bit of weight and she was 5 months pregnant!
