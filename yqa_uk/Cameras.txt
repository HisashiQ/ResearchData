Unless you registered your camera with the camera company, and then the person that finds it tries to register the camera, then maybe (some companies don't do this but some do) they will let you know that this person has your camera. But just try to put up signs, and usually that would work best specially if you put a reward. But really it is most likely gone. Now on the sign you could just simply put that at least to return the memory card even if it doesn't have the pictures it had, and then you could restore the pictures later. Most of the times, people would return the pictures, but they would keep the camera. good luck! ;)

Here in the USA. it doesn't go on sale very often. And if it does the price reduction is only by a few dollars($10-$30). 
But I have noticed the price has dropped quite a bit over the last year. Consumer reports says the best time to buy a camera is after the first of the year. Buy last years production model, when they are introducing the new years model. Also maybe around Christmas when stores are trying to generate sales. Maybe check E-Bay. 
I have a Nikon D70 dslr. And I love it! It was one of the first dslr models that Nikon came out with. It is comparable to the D40-D80.
I bought it from a friend who thought it was to big of a camera for her. She wanted a pocket sized digital. Her lose, My gain!

Time Value = Shutter speed priority
Aperture Value = Aperture priority 
P = Program (like all point and shoots)

There is a Auto depth-of-field setting so my guess is what the "A-dep" = is where depth of field is preselected (a refinement on Av)

Your Instruction Manual will show you exactly what these functions are for, so I suggest you read it, but...

TV (Time Value/Shutter Priority) allows you to set the shutter speed.
AV (Aperture Value/Priority) allows you to select your Aperture.
P (Program) is just like Auto, but allows you to make adjustments such as exposure, white balance, metering, ISO etc...whereas using Auto alone, does not allow you to change anything because the camera has complete control.
A-dep (Automatic Depth of Field) sets the depth of field automatically.

I suggest you turn to page 65 of your Instruction Manual (More Advanced Tecniques) for information on all of the above.
If you don't have the manual, you can download it in the link below...

Into the more flexible, creative modes :)

Tv = shutter priority. Basically, you choose the shutter speed you want (for instance, freezing fast-moving subjects), and the camera will try to match it with the best aperture.

Av = aperture priority. Like Tv, except you choose the aperture and the camera matches it with a shutter speed. Great if you desire a narrower depth of field (blurrier background around subjects).

P = Program. The camera decides what is the best aperture and shutter speed to shoot at. It's all right in a pinch, but the camera often gets confused by other elements in the image. Good for starting out with.

A-Dep = Auto Depth of Field. The camera takes in the image before you and determines the approximate distance of subjects. Using that calculation, it tries to aim its focus on multiple objects along the same distance from the camera. Especially useful for group photos, but it may require a steady hand/tripod/non-moving surface. It likes to choose slower shutter speeds.

Happy shooting!

The following information should give you some options to consider.  One big thing is cleaning battery and camera electrical contacts.



Consider this battery tale of woe. The camera reports battery low and cuts off ... it's really bad electrical contacts.  The battery goes into a 16 hour non automatic charger, but the battery is not really low.  The battery may now be severely damaged by overcharging.

Many of the new cameras come with only an LCD display. Would suggest that you find one that has an optical view finder because the LCD is almost impossible to see in bright sun.

Higher mega pixels may not really be the best thing to look for.  It is more expensive, takes longer to process, and may not be needed unless you are making a really large picture or blowing up a small part of a picture.

Check the second source link for a camera that may be just what you are looking for.



This is a digital video and single-lens reflex cameras that can show the finish line action in a video so it does not rely on the fast click of the shutter to catch the winner.

Via the built-in USB port, the device can be connected to any normal computer, using the power supply from the USB bus to enable continuous operation. The DV-5000G can therefore be used as a full PC and web cam with VGA resolution (640 x 480) at 30 fps. http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d... ...

The information about my camera is just to show that you don't need the biggest and best.

My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices. Ask what cameras they own. Once you select a camera read all about it in the owner's manual.

Check this camera.  FUJIFILM - FinePix 10.0-Megapixel Digital. This is more camera for the money.
Wide-angle shooting, a 12x optical zoom and picture stabilization mode combine in this camera for exceptional shooting performance, even at a distance. Plentiful scene modes, autofocus and automatic white balance controls make this camera a snap to operate. Life time Warranty (Parts & Labor)
You may be able to find it on the Internet for a lower price.
http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?... ...

This could be the best slim line camera.
http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber... ...

The last source link will show you most of the old and new cameras available today.

The first source link will help you clean camera and battery electrical contacts.  Digital Cameras require lots of power.  If the contacts are not really good, it can cause lots of problems.

Sony DSC-W90 Camera memory card question.?



So, my girlfriend has a sony camera, the DSC-W90, but we need a memory card for it relatively quick. So it is up to me to find a good cheap memory card, but I don't really know what kind it takes, any help would be greatly appreciated.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The Sony W90 uses either a Memory Stick Duo or a Memory Stick PRO Duo.

You should buy the Memory Stick PRO Duo as it's faster and allows you to record high quality movies (VX, Fine). You cannot record high quality movies if you only have the Memory Stick Duo.

You don't have to buy a Sony branded Memory Stick...any good brand will do. Sandisk is an excellent brand.
A 2GB Memory Stick will allow...
up to 620 high quality images or up to...
25 minutes of high quality movies.

Don't forget to Format the Memory Stick before you use it (this is done in your camera's Menu). It's also a good idea to format it regularly (only do this AFTER you have first uploaded all images to your computer because formatting deletes all files from the card/stick).

Check your user manual...

Anway, should I get a digital SLR or a normal digital camera?? and what is so different about SLR cameras? xxxthnks!

I like Samsung (owned by Pentax) and I own a GX 1L DSLR and more recently an L210.
Since I bought the compact I haven't used the SLR. The L210 does everything I need -Very well.
Pro photographers may need a little more. 
I like the light weight plus features on the smaller camera.

That's a great price for a D40! Does it, however, come with a kit lens? If not, then it's at normal price.

Don't forget to check the retailer! If it's online, background check them at ressellerratings.com. There are a lot of camera scammers out there, and you wouldn't want to lose that much money for nothing.

Good luck!

i agree with Andrew... if its online...check them out with consumer review websites.  The trick is to lure you into the purchase with a low-ball price.  Then after you place the order you get a call from a sales rep trying to sell you all kinds of accessories (camera bag, memory card, lens, cleaning kits, etc) at regular retail price.  Say "no thank you" and then you get lame excuses of "your camera is out-of-stock, waiting on shipment, yada yada" or it doesn't come on delivery date.  Amazon.com currently has it for $444.00 with free ship and no tax for majority of states.

Canon EOS 400D, Should I buy it?



I am a student about to pass into 6th Form for my A-Levels. My price limit is perhaps £350 and no more than £400.

I know that this is a great camera, although it falls just short of the Nikon D80's specs. I just cannot afford £800 worth of D80.

I guess my question really is, is there any other camera in my price range that should stop me from buying the 400D?

Any help, tips or comments is really appreciated.

Thanks in advance. :)

Pictures look good because many things are automatic like focus and compensation for light and red eye. You can make the pictures even better by knowing all there is to know about your camera and taking pictures under optimal conditions.

My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but it impress everyone with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices. Ask what cameras they own. Once you select a camera read all about it in the owner's manual.



Many of the new cameras come with only an LCD display. Would suggest that you find one that has an optical view finder because the LCD is almost impossible to see in bright sun.

This could be the best slim line!

try the canon Ixy for around that and it is an awesome little camera.

anywhere from £20..30 on up
reasonable point and shoot cameras start around 80.100 and go upto £200.. 250

digital SLR's start around £300.. £350 and go one up to mulit thousands

depends what you want
depends how much you are prepared to pay
depends on what you want to use it for
depends on waht features you want

the nore you pay for the camera, the more buttons, programs and stuff there is to play with and learn.

someone settng themselves up as a professional phtographer coverign say football probably has in excess of £10,000 of cameras and lenses, someone going out on the razz with their mates (or soon to be ex mates once the photos are realeased on facebook) may have a camera thats less than £50..... they are both digital cameras

The last source link will show you most of the old and new cameras available today with prices.

http://dcviews.com/press/Agfa-DV-5000G.h... ...
Check this link for a camera that may be just what you are looking for. This is a digital video and single-lens reflex cameras that can show the finish line action in a video so it does not rely on the fast click of the shutter to catch the winner.

Via the built-in USB port, the device can be connected to any normal computer, using the power supply from the USB bus to enable continuous operation. The DV-5000G can therefore be used as a full PC and web cam with VGA resolution (640 x 480) at 30 fps. http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d... ...

Digital cameras require lots of power so NiMH rechargeable batteries are a must.  The first source link will help you make them really work well in your camera.

The following information should give you some options to consider.  One big thing is cleaning battery and camera electrical contacts.



Consider this battery tale of woe. The camera reports battery low and cuts off ... it's really bad electrical contacts.  The battery goes into a 16 hour non automatic charger, but the battery is not really low.  The battery may now be severely damaged by overcharging.

Many of the new cameras come with only an LCD display. Would suggest that you find one that has an optical view finder because the LCD is almost impossible to see in bright sun.

Higher mega pixels may not really be the best thing to look for.  It is more expensive, takes longer to process, and may not be needed unless you are making a really large picture or blowing up a small part of a picture.

The information about my camera is just to show that you don't need the biggest and best.

My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7x digital zoom.

Reinstall the driver using the cd that came with the camera, or better yet  get a newer driver from the Labtec website.  If that doesn't work, wiggle the cable near the jacks and see if that helps. Webcams (and most monitors) work using  information collected in the RGB format, (Red Green Blue).  I could be one of the wires is broken inside the cable controlling the blue or green, thus making the red most prominent.

What is this camera connection?



Hi, I'm buying a DVR system shortly and I'm gonna need some conversion cables to convert RCA cameras to whatever the connections are on the back of DVRs.



Does anyone know what these connection sockets are called?

Putting videos from my camera on the computer...?



Well, it seems I am having a little trouble with my camera. I am currently using a Digital Camera to film a skate team, but here is the problem. When I connect it to my computer, it only lets me import pictures. If I import the video, it will not open the mov file. This computer's Windows Movie Maker does not work, but I can easily switch computers if that is the case. My camera model is a Kodak EasyShare C763, so if anyone needs further details please contact me on here or mopar_god@hotmail.com

It may be your computer doesn't have a program that can open the movies that the camera records in.



There should be conversion/player software on the disc that came with the camera. If not there are plenty of free ones on the net.



Right click on the video file you downloaded and go to Properties, that will tell you the format (file type). Go to Control Panel and open Folder Options, click on the File Types tab and see if any program is associated with the file type from the video file, if there is you can use that program to play the video, if theres not you need to install the codec for that file type into Windows Media Player (from the Microsoft site). Once Media Player can play the video Movie Maker will too (Movie Maker uses Media Player behind the scenes).

<answer>



Reinstall the driver using the cd that came with the camera, or better yet  get a newer driver from the Labtec website.  If that doesn't work, wiggle the cable near the jacks and see if that helps. Webcams (and most monitors) work using  information collected in the RGB format, (Red Green Blue).  It could be one of the wires is broken inside the cable controlling the blue or green, thus making the red most prominent.

Will Olympus be releasing any new underwater cameras capable of going deeper than 10 metres?



Currently there's the 1030 SW and 770 SW that are capable of a depth of 10 metres but since I go scuba diving deeper than that, I'm curious if there's a new one on the way that beats both the cameras above. You see, I want to avoid buying an underwater casing as much as I can.

Not that I know of. Why not get an underwater casing? A new Olympus camera will cost more than a casing for your old camera.

CAUTION



Do not overcharge ... batteries can be severely damaged.  Get this automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with safety timer, temperature monitor and trickle charge technology for ($9.76) at Walmart.



The best batteries for long life seem to be around 2000 to 2300 mAh.  For longer life, batteries should be charged often and kept in active use.  To preserve battery charge, use the view finder and not the LCD screen when possible.



Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts?  Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.



Digital cameras require lots of power.  Bad electrical contacts can cause lots of problems so battery and camera contacts must be cleaned properly.  Batteries may be fully charged, but will be viewed as low if contacts are not really good.  The LCD screen is a low steady load, but when lens extension, optical zoom, focus, and flash charging are added in the capture mode; the load is very heavy.  Bad contacts make cameras do strange things like making bad pictures or shutting off with the lens out.



NiMH are the same type batteries used in the Toyota Prius and most hybrid of electric vehicles and should last many years. NiMH batteries will discharge in two weeks when not used.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide near normal service if used immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs that can no longer be used in cameras may work well in flashlights.



Check this camera.  FUJIFILM - FinePix 10.0-Megapixel Digital. This is more camera for the money.
Wide-angle shooting, a 12x optical zoom and picture stabilization mode combine in this camera for exceptional shooting performance, even at a distance. Plentiful scene modes, autofocus and automatic white balance controls make this camera a snap to operate. Life time Warranty (Parts & Labor).You may be able to find it on the Internet for a lower price ($144), but be careful of the vendor.

http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber... ...



Many of the new cameras come with only an LCD screen. Would suggest that you find one that also has an optical view finder because the LCD screen is almost impossible to see in bright sun.



Higher mega pixels may not really be the best thing to look for.  It is more expensive, takes longer to process, and may not be needed unless you are making a really large picture or blowing up a small part of a picture.



The information about my camera is just to show that you don't need the biggest and best.  Just know how to use the one you have.



My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.



Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices. Ask what cameras they own. Once you select a camera read all about it in the owner's manual.



The source links will show most of the cameras out there with prices and help make your digital cameras work better.

Touch screens are relatively new for cameras, so Im not too sure about those ones. I used to have a Polaroid (unsure of make/model) that took great pictures. Good Quality Pictures are usually a result of a higher megapixel, like 7.5 or 8.0 or higher, is good. Some other things to consider is convienience... like I know there are digital cameras with  a flip-out USB port instead of keeping track of a cable.

I've owned several Digital cameras.



I currently own a Nikon D90 DLSR, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7, and a Nikon CoolPix S210.
My favorite point and shoot is the Lumix, it has a great lens and give me that bridge between a DLSR and the little coolpix.  So it really depends on what you want to do with it.  I like the new Lumix FZ50, it gives you the ability to go full manual, nice Leica lens with focus ring swivel LCD.

Yes, in fact that is the second kit-lens in the D40 double-lens kit.



I wouldn't particularly recommend that one though, since the price difference between that and the same lens with VR is typically very small.

The best compact digital camera for a PRO photojournalist?



I´m a professional photojournalist working in a big wire agency, I have the best cameras and lenses (Nikon D3, everything f2.8, supplied by the agency of course!), but I need a small compact camera with manual controls (at least some) and excellent HI ISO resolution, for making a very difficult story about software piracy in a south american country. PLEASE help me with some advice, I´m leaving in a couple of weeks and I know NOTHING about compact cameras. Is there a favorite compact among professional photographers??



Thanks a lot, you´ll save my story!!

Like any other venue, it depends on the event.
In some cases you won't be able to bring in a camera period, nevermind using a flash. In other cases they'll let you use a compact point and shoot with flash but nothing more than that.
Read the back of your ticket, the fine print is usually very specific about cameras and how you're allowed to use one.
Concerts at Staples are persnickety, usually they won't let you bring in any type of recording equipment (I was told to take my Sandisk back to my car or it would be confiscated).  On the other hand you're OK bringing in a small camera to a hockey game (they probably would have paid me if the camera came with a Pronger or Niedermayer:)

Hmm, that's tough.  Stay away from Kodaks- they have poor flashes and do not deal well with low light. Nikons are OK, don't know about Fujifilm or Olympus...Canons seem to do very well in low light.



Hope this helps!

Check this camera.  FUJIFILM - FinePix 10.0-Megapixel Digital. This is more camera for the money.
Wide-angle shooting, a 12x optical zoom and picture stabilization mode combine in this camera for exceptional shooting performance, even at a distance. Plentiful scene modes, autofocus and automatic white balance controls make this camera a snap to operate. Life time Warranty (Parts & Labor).You may be able to find it on the Internet for a lower price ($144), but be careful of the vendor.

Many of the new cameras come with only an LCD screen. Would suggest that you find one that also has an optical view finder because the LCD screen is almost impossible to see in bright sun.



Higher mega pixels may not really be the best thing to look for.  It is more expensive, takes longer to process, and may not be needed unless you are making a really large picture or blowing up a small part of a picture.  http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...



The information about my camera is just to show that you don't need the biggest and best.  Just know how to use the one you have.



My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.



Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices. Ask what cameras they own. Once you select a camera read all about it in the owner's manual.



The source links will show most of the cameras out there with prices and help make your digital cameras work better.

There really isn't one. Digicams are handicapped by a slow lens, small sensor and poor performance at high ISO settings. The flash on a digicam is good for about 12 to 15 feet.



Low-light, non-flash photography requires a fast lens (f1.4, f1.7) and good performance at higher ISO settings. Only a DSLR can give you this type of performance. Its very unlikely that you'll be allowed to take a DSLR into a concert unless you have a Press Pass or other written permission.



Go to the concert, enjoy the music and buy the DVD.

<question>



Canon Rebel XS??? And question about pixel density?



First of all I have a doubt how pixel density (MP/cm^2) affects image quality. Both Rebel XS and XSI have same sensor (22.2 x 14.8 mm) but as XSI having 12 MP (oppose to 10 on XS), have higher pixel density. Does this mean that XS image quality will be better than XSI?? Because I have heard that crowding of pixels introduce noise.



Nikon competitors (D40,D60) also Pentax K200D have a little larger sensor (23.6 x 15.8 mm). But its altogether different sensor, we cant compare them with canon just by pixel density. But how about XS and XSI??? and the 3 Nikons??



For my needs 8MP is more than sufficient, 12 MP is unnecessary. Also why XS is cheaper than XTI??? Its a new camera, DIGIC III as opposed to DIGIC II, having live view mode (but fewer AF points)???



Which Camera would you suggest amongst all the 3 brands I mentioned? Speed is not an issue for me as I don't do sports photography; just indoor, family and night photography.



Thanks in advance.

Actually you have it a little confused



Read this



http://kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm



Actually the larger the pixel the lower the noise is at high ISO's or the fewer the number of pixels are jammed into the sensor, the less chance of diffraction and amplification noise there is



That is why the Nikon D3 can shoot at 6400 ISO with about the same noise as a Canon 450D has at 400 ISO



Take a memory card with you to a camera store and test both cameras at various ISO's and then look at the results on your computers monitor.  That will answer your questions the best.



Don't get caught in the measurebation trap ... how the image looks is much more important than any marketing claims or interesting specifications.

I have a Nikon D90.  Its my first DLSR (I had several P&S digitals and Film SLR's prior to this)
Your question of pixel density is a good one.  Honestly I have not seen side by side shot with the XS or XSi.  But i'm inclined to agree with your assessment that more pixels = more noise.  However that's not always the case.  Personally, since DLSR bodies have an obsolescence life cycle of a couple of years, I'd spend less on the body and more on lenses.  Good optics are good optics. And the life cycle in lenses are decades.  I can still mount a 20 year old lens on my Nikon and it works great (in full manual of course)

try setting the camera to 'bestshot' in the menu.  Also, turn the unit on to open the camera lens, and check to make sure the lens is not dirty.  If it is, use a dry q-tip or shammy to clean it.

Does my Canon Rebel XTI have a defect?



Everything is fine it seems. But there seems to be one problem, I'm new to cameras so I'm not sure if this is normal. But if I try to change the aperture or fstop turnin the dial to the right...it works fine and the numbers change quickly. But if I turn it to the left, the numbers don't change...I have to turn it and be a bit slow when I change the numbers as I turn the dial to the left.



Is that normal? I have a 2 year warranty on the camera.

AF lenses will fit, but won't Autofocus. They will still meter, and be used in the Auto mode, but you'll have to focus the lens manually.



AF-S lenses are fully functional. They will Autofocus.



The 55-200mm lens will Fit, and Autofocus on your Nikon D40. The 28-80mm lens is Compatible- but won't Autofocus, because it's AF- and depends on an AF motor in the camera. The D40 doesn't have that motor, it depends on lenses with their own motors.

Have a look at the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ50. It's a very good little cam. Has enough zoom on it (not as much as a 15-20x superzoom like the DMC-FZ50,  Sony Cybershot DSC-H50 or Olympus SP-570 UZ , but than again you can't bring the latter to a concert or sports event).

What Sony SLR Camera Would you buy?



I see that the A200 is $500 & the A300 is $600...whats the diff between these 2 cameras? Same MP, same zoom, what warrants the $100 more?



And would you spend $800 for the A350, will the extra 4 MP over the A200 & A300 be woth the extra cost?

I hope the above link works.  You'll see there's not a wholelotta difference. The three cameras are nearly identical. The A300 and 350 add live view and a tilt LCD screen really handy for composing and shooting in inconspicuous mode :).  If that's a feature you care about, the A300 might be your cam. The 350 has more MPs. If you're not looking to crop alot or print large, those extra pixels mean nothing.

Olympus TCON-1.7x Telephoto Converter Lens no screw threads at end of lens?



Hi,
I was wanting to know, does the TCON-1.7x Telephoto Converter Lens have screw threads (filter threads) at the end of the lens?
To screw filters onto the end of it, like a polarising or neutral density filter.



I've read that it doesn't have them, which is silly...

That's odd, I've never seen one of those before. Why not use a regular teleconverter that fits in between your camera and lens? They may have different uses to which I'm unaware, but they seem more logical to me.

My Kodak Easy Share camera has a video feature but when I put something on it and try to upload it to Kodak software, Picasa, Windows Movie Maker, etc., it doesn't understand it.  Kodak says I need something from apple.com (I have a PC so that doesn't make sense) and the Microsoft software says I'm retarded for trying. Lol. Any suggestions?

well i assume the format your camera is using is a Quicktime format (*.mov probably). If you have Quicktime player ( http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/ ), I think it should be alright, try opening it with it. You can also try Quicktime Alternative (must by an advanced user to try that).



If it doest work, then probably my assumption about the format was wrong. Try posting what is it.

Life is a lot easier with QuickTime installed. I'm not sure, but Winamp may also play QuickTime movies, and I believe VLC Media Player. Are you actually downloading it to the computer? If not, you have a totally different problem. I took it that you meant you cannot play it.

Well since there is no 46 mm camera in existence, the answer is you cannot.



If on the other hand you are looking for a camera with a 46 mm lens (I have never seen one but what do I know ... only 40 years in the business).



That leaves a lens with a 46 mm filter.  Look for sellers of Hoya, B&W and Tiffen filters and see what they have.



What camera do you have with this specification?

Get a 46-52mm step up ring from the same site and you can use standard 52mm filters.



You can get 46mm filters directly, but they often cost more than the more common 52/55/58mm ones and if you need multiple filters (circular polarizer and ND4 are two of the common ones in many camera bags) using step-up rings becomes a clear cost savings.  For instance, many pros shooting Nikon gear only buy 77mm filters (the largest size Nikon uses on non-exotic lenses) and buy step-up rings for their smaller lenses.

Pretty much anywhere, 46mm is a standard filter thread size, you can try just doing a search in eBay which will get some returns, my old Olympus C2000Z used this size on their filter adapter.

The best quality is always Digital SLR, but not for £120 sorry to say. best way would be to find a camera specialist in your area, go and see them and explain what you want, there are loads and loads of makes and models in that price range all offering very similar options and picture quality, just get the highest pixels you can afford and try and avoid high digital zooms but stick with actuall zoom this will mean you have a better lens and the better the lens the better the quality of finished printed pics.,
Good luck and happy snapping.

i dont' go by pounds, but check out the olympus range on the net, they have the best range and really good prices. take into account the megapixels but more importantly, the optical zoom- the higher the optical zoom, the better your picture!! ie dont get less than 4x optical zoom otherwise you won't have good quality pictures like you're after!



personally, im buying the olympus 'Mju 1010' its 10.1 megapixels and 7x optical zoom at a really good price, but i dont know it in ur currency sorry

Why did you do that?  For not much more money ($450 total for D40 and 18-55 mm lens) you could have had one of the best inexpensive lenses made.



http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/18-55-i...



See if you can find that lens or the 18-55 mm VR lens at a store near you.  Hopefully it will not cost you more than if you had purchased the two together

They have both great picture quality and unless you are going to print the pictures taken to the size of the wall you will not see the difference.



so go and buy the cheapest among them

I have the Powershot S5 IS and love it. I'm guessing it is similar by the name? 1 MP isn't going to make much of a difference so unless they are closely related in price, I would go for the cheaper one. I will say the only downfall in mine is the size. It is sort of a pain to lug around.

You will not notice the difference between an 8MP and a 9MP camera. You certainly won't notice it if you only ever display your photos on a computer either and even if you get them printed you'd need to go to an abnormally large sized print to see the difference and even then it would be difficult.



What may make a noticeable difference is the smaller imager size on the SX110. It's squeezing even more unnecessary pixels onto a smaller imager so will have more image noise to contend with. This is a simple physical fact and means that the 9MP model may well have an inferior image quality to the 8MP model.



What you need to bear in mind is that manufacturers are in a race for the highest MP count and it's only because the largely ignorant consumers think more=better. Without the larger sensors used on D-SLR cameras this is a complete fallacy.



In practice, the real-life differences between the cameras you mention is very small. Buy the cheaper one and spend the difference on an extra battery or better quality memory card, or even on the best accessory for sharp photos: a tripod.

Will a 90's era Canon lens work on my 350D?



I really want to buy a lens, however i don't have cash for a new one. i was offered a 28-135mm canon lens but the seller said it was 90's era. will this fit the mount on my 350d? And if there are, are there Sigma or Tamron lenses that are 28-135mm? please include links if you can...thank you!

It's my understanding that that's the great thing about Canon -- all lenses will always fit.



I'd double check with the Canon site though to be sure.

When Canon introduced the EOS autofocus 35mm SLR camera line in 1987 they changed their lens mount. Canon SLR cameras prior to 1987 used the FD mount. If the lens you've been offered was used on an EOS camera then it will work with your Canon 350D.

Not all Canon lenses will work on eachother.



If it were made before Canon came out with the EOS line, then it will be fully functional. If it came out before, than It's an FD mount, and will be compatible. the 28-135mm lens will fit,.

Camera memory card not working?



I have an Olympus 1G xD camera memory card and last night when I put it inside my card reader, I cannot open the photos. I changed it to thumbnails view and double clicked, it said "No preview available".
Tonight I tried using the camera cord to transfer photos instead of sticking in the memory card and it told me to format my card! When I double click the removable drive icon it tells me to format the card.



Can anyone tell me what is the problem and how can this be solved?... if there is a way...
