Try some reading. Ask a parent to pick up some magazines and books for you. You can also try Suduko, a Jigsaw Puzzle or Solitaire.

First and foremost try to get back to school as soon as possible.  There is no reason to take two weeks off because of a broken toe.  Get back to hanging with your friends and learning.

i havent heard of any cheats or anything to do that.
and im a pretty big fanatic of Sims 2.
Try looking at www.gamewinners.com
they have TOns of cheats for LOTS of games.
you just have to pick which kind of game you have (PS, gamecube, Wii, ect.) then they will list the games for it in alphabetical order, and click SIMS 2



hope you find something!

blue are on the grass, water, cave
the red that blinks are the pokemons that can only be caught on a honey tree, the yellow ones (go to a tree, press A to put a honey on it, leave for a few days, and when you get back, check if it is shaking, it means there's a pokemon there, press A to battle)

What is this club?!?!?



Whats the mile high club?
and how can i become a member?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The mile high club (or MHC) is a slang term collectively applied to individuals who have engaged in sexual activity while on board an aircraft in flight at least 1 mile (5,280 ft/1,609 m AGL) above the Earth. There is no known formally constituted club so named. However, since "membership" of the "club" is really a matter of an individual asserting they have qualified, the qualifications for membership are open to some interpretation.[1]



Some people attribute the allure of the club to the lower atmospheric pressure in the flight cabin, which they claim increases the intensity of orgasms.[citation needed] Another explanation is the vibration of the airplane, which may make arousal easier.[2] Others say they have fantasies about pilots or flight attendants, or a fetish about planes themselves.[3] For many others, perhaps the majority, the appeal of joining the MHC is the thrill of doing something taboo and the thrill of the risk of being discovered.[4]



To become member, go to thi site www.milehighclub.com

I'm trying to figure out this game, Japenko I think it's called?



I think it's called Japenko (spelling is probably wrong.)
I think I'm definitely spelling it wrong because I googled it 4 different ways and nothing comes up.
It's sort of like a rock, paper, scissors game except after someone wins, there's two things (like rolled magazines or something) and a flat object in the middle. Where the person who wins has to pick up one of the rolled up magazines and the loser picks up the flat object so as to block the winner from hitting the loser on the head.



Anyone know what I'm talking about??

try this game: mix no. from 1to 5 on 4 columns; ask one friend to name (without knowing the no. mix) 5 names of boys and 5 names of girls you all know, 5 activities (the weirder the better) and 5 places (any the can imagine e.g. in a car's truck etc.). You note them in the order your friend says them, e.g. the first in one column can be no.5 or whatever no. according to the mix, then make the matches: girl 5 with boy 5 do activity 5 in place 5 etc.



what matters is to get the most funny combinations, no offences to anyone, just for laugh...

No one has too much money.



Rich people earned it and less rich are trying to do better.
Making money comes in all sorts of forms and shapes; Begging is a business, sealing is a business and work is a business. I guess you fall under the Begging business lady or gentleman.

Yes, here is your answer.



While in gameplay of The Sims 2, click on the three dots for a little menu.
Then click on 'Camera Options', usually there is an image of this white camera.
If you click on it you can choose the settings.
For YouTube, I would recommend putting medium size and high quality.

Don't worry, any PS3 remote control that you buy to work with the PS3 will control the DVDs as well as the blu rays discs.



The cheapest PS3 remote I have found (and bought) cost £9.99 from Game and is specifically for the PS3.



Don't be conned in to buying the OFFICIAL Sony remote that can cost up to £25.

I am playing pokemon diamond?



when i do wi-fi battle and then i choose say miya or whatever and she has a pokemon that i dont have. when she uses that pokemon how come it wont get added to my pokedex.



And how can I get more pokemon added to my pokedex that i dont have.
I dont want to send anyone but the people i noe my friend code and name. So dont bother sending your name and friend code unless you want people to battle you the r reading this right now as you read it.

<answer>



As far as I know, Trading is the only way to add to your pokedex when you are on WiFi.  Battling is for fun you don't even get experience points.

Go to Dawn's house and talk to her little brother and one day he might say a bunch of Slakoth are swarming in Eterna Forest. You have to of defeated the Elite 4 and obtained the National Poke Dex to get one though.



If you have Ruby, Sapphire or Emerald you can mirgrate them on to your Pokemon Diamond. They're found at Petalburg Woods.

it has Wifi, music, videos, photos, touch screen, contacts, notes, google maps, email, on screen keyboard, calculator, clock, weather, YOUTUBE



but if you jailbreak it (easy), you can have games, a dictionary, wallpaper, background, and tons of other 3rd party apps. don't worry, no viruses at all

Fastest way to level is to train in the E4.. Once you beat them 20 times, I hear that your rival will have lvl 70 pokemon so train on that... As for shinies, its completely random... there is a 1/8200(something close to that) chance of finding one....You can always hack but that takes the fun out of everything...



That, or if you have emerald, you can take advantage of the cloning glitch and clone a lot of rare candies....

First off you gotta set up the wireless router which has to have WEP  security or weaker. WPA security won't allow DS's.  But  then start your game, have it at the main menu where you can select new game, current game and then it will say Wifi connection. Click that and set it up. Then you will have to have Pal pad in your key items. You will have to have a friend with a DS and pokemon and to connect to them, or do it  over wifi. Then you have to give your FC (friend code) to the person, and vice verse, so you can both see eachother online. Then you would have to set up a designated time to meet people online to battle, trade, etc.



but to add someone, its pretty obvioius
pal pad
register friend code
enter name
enter friend code

go into the hotel were the women behind the desk says
"sorry you have no reservation. you can rest though"
when you find her, go through the top exit door and yu will be outside. use your poke item which finds hidden items and use it. it will show an item. dont stand ontop of the item stay a square away. then press A on were the item is located and you shall pick it up. Fyi when you find the key, give it to her and she will enter the suite, follow her and she gives you a lava cookie. all this item does is get rid of status effects on one pokemon so its basically useless.

Those fossils can be revived into pokemon depending on what pokemon you dug up from underground.

I forgot which place you gotta go but i think its a museum and town where you met brawly near the mines.

There should a professor who ask you which pokemon you have that is a fossil the museum is not far from the mine.

The fossils can be brought to the oreburg city mining museum to be revived into a fossil pokemon.  All you have to do is give it to the scientist at the counter and come back with an open space in your party.  The claw fossil becomes anorith, the helix fossil becomes omanyte, the old amber becomes aerodactyl, the root fossil becomes lileep, the dome fossil becomes kabuto, the skull fossil (only in diamond) becomes cranidos, and the other fossil (exclusive to pearl) becomes shieldon.  You need to train for sheildon.

kanto and hoen are places on other games ruby/sapphire/emareld and fire red/leafgreen.
 to enter catching shows you put one of those games in the gba slot in ur ds and when you fire up diamond/pearl it says migrate from (whatever game u have in the gba slot) underneath "start new game" and then you can enter a show to catch 6 pokemon out of ur other game
(great for transfering ur legends off other games) thats how i got my kyogre! Good Luck!!!!!!!!!

You can get around it though by trading the pokemon (over Wifi with the PalPad) with someone who has it, then trading back. That gets you the listing and info.

Rayquasa is found at the top of the sky pillar at lvl. 70. The sky pillar is east of pacifidlog town. Surf east and keep to the upper part of the route and there will be an opening in the route. Take it and you reach the sky pillar. You also need the mach bike as there are collapsing tiles in this tower.
