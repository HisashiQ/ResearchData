What direction should the global warming/climate change faith base take?



It is almost impossible to find a scientist who will say it is possible for humans to effect our climate, and even less possible to find one that will say humans are definitely the cause. That coupled with the complete lack of evidence the climate is doing anything out of the ordinary. What can the globalwarming/climate change cult do to convince people that socialism is the only fix for mother earth.

You obviously don't know any scientists.  Every scientist I know believes that humans can affect (not effect) the climate, and virtually all of them believe we are currently altering it.



I believe you're intentionally lying for effect, but I suppose it's possible that you only know pseudo-scientists.

Well lets see...so far they've told us that polar bears aren't basically marine animals and can't swim well and are dying off, that raising cattle is a bad thing, using energy works against us, that global warming is the main cause of grafitti - heck...yeah what's next?  They'd love it if we all went back to the cave days and froze in the dark and ate raw meat for survival.  It's a wild guess as to what direction they'll invent for the future.  Nothing they say has ever made any sense.

The assumptions behind your question are so false as to make your question nonsensical and thus unanswerable. It is along the lines of "where are all the giant space mice to eat the moon as it is made of cheese?"

You say it is "almost impossible to find a scientist... etc".
Obviously you don't look very hard - it took me all of 3 minutes to pull up a list of some 1500 scientists, not just one, who all say that humans are responsible for current and future changes in the climate. And there are many more....

No, what's actually almost impossible is finding a scientist who will say it's not possible for humans to have an effect our climate.

It's also very hard to find scientists who will say that it can't be shown that humans are the cause of global warming (if CO2 from fossil fuels can cause the temperature increase while nothing natural can then that's pretty good proof we're responsible).

"That coupled with the complete lack of evidence the climate is doing anything out of the ordinary."
So you can account for what the climate has been doing using the orbit of the Earth and solar variability?  No? didn't think so.

People much smarter than you have found that the recent temperature changes can not be due to the Earth's orbit or the sun's energy output.

As for fixing the problem, some people who do accept that global warming is happening are standing in the way of doing so since the only viable solution to the emissions from electricity production we have is nuclear power and it may also be necessary to give us a solution to the transportation problem.

Hallelujah!  The state of California found a few trustworthy scientists and the link below will inform you as to the direction the state is taking to mitigate and adapt.  It's a work in progress, but church is in session. Gov. Schwarzenegger is also working closely with other elected officials as part of the Western Climate Initiative.  It's a marriage of science and politics that should produce some wonderful offspring.

What the state is doing now will ensure that future generations won't be left holding the bag, I mean plate.

What a ridiculous question. Either you are: a: not being serious



b: not very intelligent

'What can the globalwarming/climate change cult do to convince people that socialism is the only fix for mother earth.'

Here is the important point, this impotent and constructed fear of 'socialism,' of someone coming to take something away from you, of big government, somebody 'out there' come to take your liberties, the United Nations...scary stuff...

This is what global warming/climate change deniers point to in their half witted, illogical, selfish and idiotic attempts to believe that the earth has the natural carrying capacity to support the lives that we live in the way that we do and that any change which may occur is just a natural phenomenon (like the rest of human history which contained many periods in which 6 and a half odd billion people lived on the planet) (sarcasm)

Of course the answer to this is that I probably want to 'live in a cave back in the stone ages' or 'live under socialism' which are probable responses based on what I've seen in people's opinions and are too idiotic and space to short to dignify with a response.

We cannot keep living the way that we do! Sadly it looks as though change will be forced upon us in the coming years and decades by the climate and the natural systems that support all life and the degredation, destruction of these will the most bitter legacy to pass on to our children and our future selves.

We would think so, wouldn't we?  I believe that all this fuss about the climate (whatever they call it now) is a smokescreen to stop us all noticing how many major things are going wrong. Whilst governments can harp on about global warming, etc., they are not answering the public's questions about the really important issues of the day.  It also is giving all the Jobsworth idiots a chance to assert their 'authority' over, for instance, a waste bin that's wrongly loaded.  I have lived a lot of years  and I am despairing of my country and the mess the politicians are making of it.

I am putting up only one hand half heartily and with disappointment.  My tomatoes have blight again.  I was looking forward to some pleasant global warming this summer. The type of warming we are experiencing is more intermittent than in past summers. Climate Change it is now, and we know the English are famous for talking about our changeable weather.  This rain plus increased carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has caused an impressive growth of vegetation.  The road signs have become obscured by overhanging branches, so we have to buy satnavs to find our way around.  I wonder what next!

I listened to all the talk about how wonderful it would be for the uk, and thought .....Wait a minute!!!...we are a little piece of land surrounded by an awful lot of water.  If this global warming is for real, the seas will heat up as well and cause more cloud that than heat from our little bit of land could deal with.  All we will get is cloud, rain and rising humidity.  Tropical rain forest weather with all the bugs that go along with that (shudder)

Then I listened to a scientist on National Geo.  Who thought it might be possible that the cloud cover could become so great it would actually drive us into another ice age.



Then other scientists said global warming had stopped and we were all being scammed, by government and commerce.

Then I decided no-one knew what they were talking about.



It is all scientific theory that no one knew the answer to.

One of the problems with the Anthropogenic global warming hypothesis (AGW) is that its believers claim that if it gets warmer, colder, wetter or drier, it is still consistent with their beliefs. 
For an idea to be considered as scientific, it must at least allow the possibility of being shown to be wrong, since this cannot happen with AGW, it cannot be considered scientific, and is more of a political or religious belief.

The computer models used to predict catastrophic scenarios in 20 to 50 years, also predict that we would have hotter drier summers. We had a hot dry summer in 2005 followed by the coldest wettest summer in 30 years and so far a cool wet summer this year. This is the kind of variability that we are used to in UK, no need for hysterical doomsday predictions.

If these models cannot map the present or recent past, how can they be trusted to get it right for 20 - 50 years time

I do, I'm sure you people have seen the electronic air purifiers advertisements. Im not talking about the velcro, sponge material air filtering dust gathering cheap knock offs niether. I'm talking about electronic magnetic shifting polution air PURIFIERS. All the people need to do is pitch in and build a huge bunches of air PURIFIERS like the energy fans you see on those long drives threw the desert or mountains, you know some their some here & presto, ice is freezing again, the sun might not burn so much, trees will grow back, but the problem now is cleaning the oceans. Trash is from the dirt you came to the dirt you will go, but not water, chemicals are making the beaches green, fishes are evolving and adapting, humans are slow at that. What do we do to clean water? I got advice in the right direction, but I want your answer to help. I love clear blue water.

And where are you going to get the energy to run the air purifiers?

Its like saying we should just build giant air conditioners to combat global warming when it was over-consumption of energy that got us into trouble in the first place.  Even in an advanced country like the US, a lot of electricity is still being generated by burning coal (and burning coal is not very efficient - that is, it creates a lot of the pollution that causes global warming)  Its a vicious circle.

The real answer is to reduce, reduce and reduce (our consumption of energy that is) and that includes cars, heating and air-conditioning.

Its more important to think about what we don't do instead of what we do do.  (nature doesn't need our help, its just needs us to stop monkeying with it and destroying it)

The solution to global warming is global cooling. And yet it's beyond the capability of seemingly intelligent people to comprehend. Throughout millions of years, the earth has changed.  And yet, Human beings still think themselves powerful enough to have seriously altered the earths natural cycles, because it is simply carrying on with it, despite it's inconvenience to us.

Human bodies produce greenhouse gases (I'm assuming you mean by breathing, etc., not driving, etc.) The carbon mostly comes from food you eat; the carbon from that comes ultimately from plants, who get it from the atmosphere. Net effect, close to zero.

None of these (CO2, NH4, etc.) affect the ozone layer. The deteriation of the ozone layer is from a breakdown of floro-chloro-carbons that used to be used in cleaning, arosol cans, air conditioners, refriduators, etc. Ultraviolet breaks these down in the upper atmosphere to radicals that act as a catalyst that converts O3 (ozone) to O2 (regular oxygen).

Your question shows just how weak many peoples knowledge of these issues is, Ozone depletion is caused by CFC's which come/came from things like the coolant in air-con units and spray cans - CFC's are now banned.

Humans don't produce CFC's

Humans do produce some greenhouse gases co2 and some methane and there are 6.6 billion of use so there would be some additional effect on top of the massive amount produced by power stations and cars.

Dear Friend,

We do produce greenhouse gas(CO2), but the percentage is very small compared to industrial and transportation industries.

Further CO2 donot depleate /destroy the Ozone layer. CFC from industrial activities does. we donot generate anything near to CFC.

The CO2 of course plays a role in global worming by blocking the Reverse radiations out of the globe. But human produced CO2 share is minimal.

You can very easily compensate for CO2 generated by you by planting and growing a Tree (like mango, teak, banyan, or any other trees that grows higher than you and lives longer than you). You will be doing a great service to mankind by doing that.



In any case, no one needs to be killed.

So please do not worry and make marry.

We do breathe out co2 but most of it is absorbed by the trees and turned into oxygen. We could do without the co2 made by cars, factories, planes etc. So animal breathing co2 doesn't help global climate change much.

Because they buy in to the theory that helping the environment hurts the economy. Who cares if we doom the planet, as long as businesses don't have to spend money on cleaning up their factories.



Because people absolutely need their SUVs in their suburban lives for toting their children and groceries. And, of course, it's worth paying the extra money in gas because SUVs are "safer" than small, efficient cars. Completely untrue, but that's not the issue here.



Also because caring about the environment is seen as "hippie" or somehow even "communist." People still see environmentalism as alternative and foreign and they don't want to be associated with it. And it's most likely that the most vocal contributors here on YA represent an adamant minority and that the people who seriously want to protect the planet aren't spending their time squabbling about it here.



And, lastly, because Americans want to feel like the entire planet belongs to us to do with as we see fit. Never mind that the ozone hole we created is causing record numbers of skin cancer cases in South America... or that the rising sea levels will submerge millions of people who live their entire lives within a few yards of the ocean. To admit that we have damaged the environment is to admit that we care what other countries think... essentially, to admit defeat.

Jello goes one further and blocks people like myself who give rational responses to his questions. In this way he manages to perpetuate micro-environments of like-minded ostriches.

Anyone who denies freedom of speech by blocking legitimate answers is obviously scared of the truth. Ironically, people such as jello are the first ones to talk about defending civil liberties and protecting freedoms while exercising a degree of censorship normally associated with the worst totalitarian states...

Long preamble to answering your question but I then ask myself why is jello scared of me, of dissent, of alternative opinion, of truth?
The answer to this is the answer to your question.

Obviously, I cannot get into the head of all people like jello but I suspect the reasons revolve around:
- Fear (of change, of personal responsibility)
- Shame (being shown to be ignorant or lacking the capacity for reasonable thought and argument)
- Ignorant hatred (of anything or anyone different - same sort of thing that drives racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc)

but probably the main reason is:
- Selfishness/A complete lack of morality, humanity or empathy. An unwillingness to do anything to help others if it means even the slightest inconvenience to their own personal comfort or way of life. In its worst manifestations it is tantamount to sociopathy.
Recognising AGW means recognising personal responsibility - even in a tiny amount - which in turn leads to a recognition of a moral obligation to do something even if it is as small as leaving the laz-y-boy to turn off a lamp not in use.

I think your assessment is wrong.  People here are not against the environment.  Some us including Jello don't believe global warming is caused by man or that global warming is necessarily a bad thing.  I am decidedly not against the environment, and I haven't met anyone who is against the environment.  I am against alarmism, reducing our personal freedoms, control of our government by the UN, living in poverty, reducing my standard of living, and providing false information to forward a political movement disguised as environmentalism.

I love nature- I spent time this summer in Glaciar NP, Yellowstone NP, and Zion NP.  I climbed a mountain in Montana.  I just don't believe in global warming.

The sun keeps the world warm.  The earth's atmosphere is transparent to visible light (where most of the sunlight is found), hits the ground and is absorbed, warming things up.

The earth re emits the energy as heat in the infrared, and the earth's atmosphere is not completely transparent in the infared, so the earth has to warm up about 30C more to keep incoming energy = outgoing energy.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes "most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas concentrations"[1] via an enhanced greenhouse effect. Natural phenomena such as solar variation combined with volcanoes probably had a small warming effect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward.

These basic conclusions have been endorsed by at least 30 scientific societies and academies of science,[4] including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries.[5][6][7] While individual scientists have voiced disagreement with some findings of the IPCC,[8] the overwhelming majority of scientists working on climate change agree with the IPCC's main conclusions.

This may not be as simple an answer as you were hoping, but there is ample evidence that the majority of global warming is caused by our use of fossil fuels.  This is not to say (as some seem to claim) that the planets environment is in any way static or unchanging, our climate is constantly changing and adapting to external changes that can affect it.  The big problem we face at the moment is that we are changing it so much, and so fast and in so many ways that we are throwing it off balance, a situation that has lead to the predicament we find ourselves in now.  I am not sure if you are aware of the theory of 'the greenhouse effect', and please don't be put off by the word theory, it is a widely held theory that is easy to demonstrate, and covers the multitude of changes that have become evident since the industrial revolution.  The greenhouse effect is simply saying that the 'greenhouse gases', carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor to mention some, have increased to such an extent that they trap extra heat from the sun in our atmosphere.  This does not, in any way say that any of these things are bad, they are all natural gases that have existed in our atmosphere for a long time, what is bad, and what is causing the problems, is that they have and are increasing so much that they are causing the global temperature to increase, and their effects will continue to increase as their concentration increases in the atmosphere.  This is also having adverse affects in other areas as well, as the polar ice caps melt, they are also increasing the heat absorbed by earth, this is simply because snow and ice reflect heat, whereas water does not.  There are lots of cross related subjects and I will just mention a few.
The term 'global warming' is not used as much as it was, it seems to be replaced more and more with the term 'climate change', at least here in Australia.  I think, (and I am not an expert), that this is to clarify that many areas will not 'get hotter'.  Parts of Europe are actually expected to cool significantly, and other areas may or may not experience a hotter environment, but something that will affect everyone is climate changes, the climate is changing everywhere, and the changes are increasing in frequency (happening more often) and scale (the changes themselves are getting bigger).  And because the environment and climate is such a complex large system, it's very hard to predict how each location will be changed.  Please don't think this diminishes the science itself, put simply, just because I don't know how many bubbles I will get in my saucepan, doesn't mean I can't say it will boil if I put it in a fire. 
There is only one other thing I want to add.  Among scientists who actually study climate, there is really no question among them of two things, one is its happening, and two is we are doing it.  There is discussion on the likely outcomes, or how much effect it will have.  There are 'other' scientists who disagree, the thing they all seem to have in common is that they don't study climate.  They study maths, or geography etc, but among those who study climate, there really is no-one who disagrees, and there hasn't been for some time now.

Well my way of looking at it is coal puts money in the pockets of the oil companies. Wind, solar and nuclear do not. Switching to nuclear with hydro for our main electrical generation is the smart way to go for now. Wind, geo thermal solar and others can supplement them providing the power to switch from gasoline to another form or power for transportation. Then we need to consider building orbital solar stations for the long term.

Just remember that the energy crisis of today was planned, organized and put in motion 30 years ago with several presidential decrees paid for up front by the oil companies.

A "compact coal station"?  Aren't you forgetting something?  Like the mountains that have to be excavated to get the coal, the trains used to transport it, and the smoke billowing out of them? And even ignoring Global Warming, then there's the known health effects of those living nearby plants and the workers in the mines.

I'd say coal power is much more unsightly than wind. In fact, I'd prefer anything over more coal (including: nuclear, hydro, wind, tidal, solar, geothermal, natural gas, etc.).

There is no question that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Thats not the issue. The issue is whether the CO2 from fossil fuels will cause bad things , good things, or not affect much at all.

I believe there are many simple though unconventional solutions to greenhouse gases and global warming.. First and foremost is that the true believers should stop driving cars, heating and cooling their houses, stop flying their jets and using their boats, stop heating their water, and become vegetarians. If they all did this it really would make a difference. Why don't they JUST DO IT?

Second, we coiuld blow up a volcano periodically. This is proven to cause cooling plus by doing it in a planned way we can save lives by preparing in advance.

Thirdly, we know that methane is a very bad greenhouse gas. We should start feeding cows BEANO immediately.

I think the analogy with alchamy is quite good.

Much depends on the ingredients used as to the result of the spell cast.

Coal powered power stations are also closet incinerators. Easier to gain planning permission for coal than rubbish in the first instance and easy to change use due to necessity later.

Wind power is a supplement source. If you are talking about weather pattern changes it is about as reliable as a sun dial in an eclipse. "Sorry you can't boil your kettle for the next three days as we need all the reserve energy for street lighting and it is too windy to make any more at the moment."

CO2 = 1 atom of carbon binding 2 atoms of oxygen, thus depleting atmosphere and lowering the ozone layer, (it's a greenhouse gas).

Hydro power? How soon people forget hosepipe bans and though the motion of the ocean is pretty reliable the scale and reliability of technology makes it unrealistic as a lynch pin power source.

Nuclear power is widely seen as the saviour and if you are going to invest in nuclear why waste money on alternative sources. Not much point in a nuclear power station running at half capacity because the wind is favourable.

Solar power? There might be some potential in converting deserts into sun harvesters, but it's not going to make an impact on Britain in winter.

Politicians know  nothing more than Joe Bloggs in the street, their informed judgement is formed by advisors/scientists and they are working within the constraints of what we the tax payer provide. So it is a witches cauldron.

just depends were you site them
i was a coal miner until the strike when the conservatives closed the pits the reason for this was because they owned shell and the shipping to import coal
wind turbines should be used in conjunction with coal we should reopen the pits so the younger generation have jobs
and we can stop importing coal we have always been selfsuficint until the fat cats started robin us
we are just starting to see the amounts they get for there second homes and they keep giveing themselfs massive pay rises then tell the woring person to take pay cuts
they all crap in the same pot and its us that pay

For decades, environmentalism has been the Left's best excuse for increasing government control over our actions in ways both large and small. It's for Mother Earth! It's for the children! It's for the whales!

But until now, the doomsday-scenario environmental scares they've trumped up haven't been large enough to give the sinister prize they want most of all: total control of American politics, economic activity, and even individual behavior.

With global warming, however, greenhouse gasbags can argue that auto emissions in Ohio threaten people in Paris, and that only global government can tackle such problems.

National sovereignty? Democracy?

Forget it: global warming has now brought the Left closer to global government, statism, and the eradication of individual rights than it has ever been before.

Watch this show on the History channel tonight on Carbon?



I don't think many people understand how fossil fuels have benefited human beings. For goodness sake, the world's societies are considering taxing the very air we exhale. Try to grasp that, and see that this issue is much deeper and fundamental than our earth heating up a few degrees. I encourage you to watch, at 7 eastern. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. Don't buy into the biggest scam every perpetuated on man-kind. I guess this helps me understand how so many people were able to follow guys like Hitler.



</question>



<additional details>



What percentage of the world lives in poverty. Fossil fuels the driving force of industialization, without question have brought populations out of poverty. Look at China. 300 million have in the last few decades of risen out of dispair, disease, and starvation. It is the largest economic movement in human history. Look around you. Look at the state and standard of living of countries who have not industrialized. For God's sake, look at history. It wasn't too long ago millions in Europe died from disease and famine. Man's use of fossil fuels was and still is the best utilization of resources we have ever accomplished. To not be able to comprehend this is just plain beligerence. No offense.



Everybody seems to object to Nazi references. I use it only to demonstrate that people are once again being duped into believing in something so fundementally untrue, ( carbon is bad) =( Blonde haired blue-eyed people are superior to all other races)

The biggest problem with global warming is that, carbon dioxide is not a poisonous, permanently insulating gas as is being taught.  Environmentalists are not pro-Earth so much as anti-human.  They would sooner see people die to save the Earth than to allow gas-fired electric generators for tribes in Africa, for people who have to burn elephant poop for heating and cooking.



Edit:  Yes, thumbs down, but when I heard about this, that's what turned me off about accepting global warming.  I realized how big of a lie it really was and is.

There's no doubt that over the past 200 -300 years, the exploitation of fossil fuels has made possible IMMENSE changes for the better in human living standards.



The burning of coal, oil and natural gas really has helped to lift countless people out of poverty.

But does the fact that fossil fuels have been "good" in raising living standards keep them from being "bad" in terms of producing destructive climate change?

I don't think so.  That's a totally different question.



And according to most of the climate scientists who have looked into this question, the continuing use of fossil fuels by human civilization is going to trigger major changes in world climate conditions that could bring disaster on our heads within the next 30 years or so.

So you're right when you celebrate the wealth and the improvements in human life that fossil fuels have made possible, and even the Greenest environmentalist needs to recognize that.  Maybe we should celebrate the great energy pioneers of western history as heroes.

But I think you're wrong if you then conclude that it makes sense to keep burning fossil fuels, even when the climate scientists are warning us how destructive to human society and natural ecosystems they will be.

It's time to celebrate the fossil fuel age, but to move on, to a greener and more sustainable way of handling energy.

Interesting rant... (adding a question mark at the end of a statement doesn't make it a question). But to try and answer this non-question: No, I won't. Simply because "tonight" has already passed for me and that the History channel is not available in my country without a satellite dish.

Now, for the rest:
Please cite a source for your ludicruous claim that "the world's societies are considering taxing the very air we exhale": This looks suspiciously like the typical denier falsehood that they hope will stick in the minds of the gullible and naive - it actually has more in common with Goebbel's hate propoganda than anything AGW proponents do (to carry on your distasteful Nazi analogy).

Many people have benefited from fossil fuel use but many more have benefited much less. Many people benefited from slavery, blood diamonds, encouraging war, corruption, crime, etc. Doesn't make any of these things right. You show your own nazi-like leanings yourself with this "the ends justify the means" logic.

No one says that fossil fuels weren't useful (we wouldn't have developed such a dependence upon them if they weren't) but lead pipes were useful to Roman plumbers - it killed them.

It is time that we, as civilised societies, recognised the harm our actions have. especially to others who don't share the benefits to the same degree as us. It is also time that we recognised that fossil fuels are a finite resource and that the planet only has a limited capacity to absorb our excesses before the balance is disrupted.

This attitude is not belligerent nor unthinking. Instead it demonstrates maturity, a realistic and intelligent assessment of the situation, high moral and a good ethical sense.

P.S. I really cannot understand why you say "look at history" to bolster your argument. When I look at history, I see untold misery and destruction brought about by the use of fossil fuels. Nevermind that mechanised warfare (killing millions) would not have been possible without fossil fuels, the desire to control fossil fuels have caused more misery and destruction than any other cause (excepting, perhaps, religion) and it continues to this day - Iraq, anyone?

Global warming? a simple mistake, or a reality?



so ive been believing for a while now that co2 (produced by humans) will cause global warming, but ive just watched a documentry on youtube that contradicts that using scientific methods.

it sounds right and it makes sense to me.

argument is that weve been going through lots of ice ages, and rising and lowering of climates, and humans arent playing much of a role in encreasing temperature.



one guy was saying that some places were just too cold to be affected by only co2, and that in fact co2 would increase the ice in east antarctica because it would create more humidity and make it snow more.

have these new theories been refuted by more respectable scientists?
because it seems the conclusion these people are coming to arent the same as... everyone elses conclusion

The same data being used now to predict global warming was the same data that was being used in the 1970's to predict another ice age.

The fact of the matter is the temperature is most effected by solar activity and not by the burning of fossil fuels as it has been since we started measuring. Global Warming is a scam.

Previous climate changes, including ice ages, have been due to natural causes. This particular climate change that we're in right now is caused by human beings.

CO2 is called a "forcing agent" because it stays in the air a long time, long enough to force climate change. In addition to forcing agents, there are also "feedbacks" in the climate system that either add to or subtract from forcing effects. Currently the feedbacks are positive, which means that the warming effect we're seeing now is greater than what we would see from CO2 alone. All this is well known.

So when that guy says some places are too cold to be affected by just CO2, he's right. But totally misleading at the same time, because nobody's saying that CO2 is the only thing happening in the climate. It's just the forcing agent, while there are a lot of feedbacks too.

Water vapor is one of those feedbacks. Warm air holds more water vapor than cold air. So as CO2 warms the air, it is able to hold more water vapor. But water vapor is a greenhouse gas too, so that enhances the effect of CO2. It also means that some places may get more precipitation, and some places may get more snow. There are a few places in central Antarctica and Greenland where this is happening, for example. But on the edges of Antarctica and Greenland, more and more ice is falling into the sea from melting, a lot more than the extra snow that's falling. So the net effect is melting.

Kieth talks like he thinks he knows.  He does not.  Those that don't know what they don't know know the least IMO.  CO2 has not caused climate change in the past and has not been shown to cause any recent changes.  It is more about computer models and wishful thinking and an unwillingness to admit what they don't know.

A little bit of all in different ways. First most of these scientists have little  to none historical background and they massively misinterpreted what they were seeing. We went from a little ice age to levels similar to current temperatures in about 70 years from 1850 to 1920. This was a radical change in such a short period and science was unable to comprehend this and so several anti industrial groups formed up and began trying to destroy any form of major industry. Then the temps climbed through the 1930s crating the mid west dust bowl of 1935. By the late 40s temps had moderated somewhat and It was fairly cool through the 50s and warmed for a couple of years in the 60s and then plunged through the 70s and early 80s where they were promoting the coming of another ice age. Now through the 90s it warmed up again almost to where it was in the 30sand now it has either leveled off or maybe cooling again.

Some of the same scientists who advocate global warming have now said we need to prepare for a cooling period like the 70s but maybe more severe, others say it is going to get so hot there will be no winter and Now I hear of major snow storms in Colorado the weekend to compound the problems. Heating, cooling well no one knows for sure, when they can accurately forecast the weather for a month in advance then I might listen to the modelers. But until then I will follow the old farmers almanac and it say prepare for a cool winter so I am going ahead with some more insulation work and looking at water heating the crawl space with solar to cut down on gas heating this winter.

I hope you're not referring to 'The Great Global Warming Swindle'.  The Swindle is basically just a propaganda film.  You can google 'Great Global Warming Swindle debunk' and find dozens of pages devoted to correcting all the errors and flat-out lies in that film.

Nobody is saying humans are the only cause of climate change.  That's just ridiculous.  Of course the climate has changed naturally in the past, but that doesn't really tell us anything.  I mean, forest fires were only caused by natural forces in the past, so does that mean humans can't cause forest fires?  If so, Smokey the Bear is out of a job.

What it boils down to is that we have a good idea what caused previous climate changes, and those forcings cannot explain the current warming.  The only thing that can explain it is human CO2 emissions accumulating in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect, and thus causing global warming.

That's a very good question!

I am a scientist, and working and reading material in this field, and to 
be honest the concrete scientific facts you are talking about can 
easily be interpreted differently by different documentaries. They can 
all easily persuade many people of their point of view. Most scientists
agree that there is global warming, and a lot will go as far as to say 
that it is LARGELY (but not whole-y) man made.

The truth of the matter is, and all self respecting scientists will agree 
on this, that we simply cannot be sure. The weather system(s) on 
earth are so complex that it is very very difficult to predict. For 
example, no one knows if the UK, where i live, will warm up or cool
down if the rest of the world heats up. There are so many complex
weather systems, that it is difficult to work out. We can only make 
simulations and speculate. But, note, most of the climate models
(90%) agree the earth is warming due to human interference.

Remember that only in the last 10 years have we really been studying 
the matter in any detail, and with the backing of technology and 
monetary investment. What is certain, is that the earth is warming.
And the good thing is that finally we have many scientists working 
on it.

I don't know either, the question is,
are you willing to risk it?

It makes more sense to me to make our 
economies more sustainable anyway,
even if GW never happens, and we get the
extra benefit of fewer wars just thrown in.

climate change is reality. Change is a constant, nothing stays the same. Humans are here because the climate changed into an environment in which we could flourish. We cannot stop this change, to try is like shutting the door after the horse has bolted or banging your head against a wall. the best we can hope for is to survive the change and slowly learn.

&lt;&lt;The Answer to Global Warming:  The Genesis Flood

Many people today are caught up in the media hype about global warming.

Where do you stand?

What former Vice President Al Gore and other global warming crusaders fail to realize (or report) is that the trigger required for the kind of dire consequences they warn about is not man’s carbon exhausts or “footprints,” but a catastrophic agent.&gt;&gt;

http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologe...
http://www.reasons.org/resources/in_the_...

&lt;&lt;Global warming is real. But its causes -- and therefore its solutions -- are more complex than most people seem to realize.

So says astronomer Hugh Ross, founder and president of the premiere science-faith think tank Reasons To Believe ( http://www.reasons.org ). "We tend to think Earth's climate will always be optimal for human civilization if we just take better care of it. But nothing could be further from the truth," states Ross. "When we put emotion and politics aside and take a rational look at our planet's history, we actually see something quite different."&gt;&gt;

btw, the Ross guy wrote the site and much of the material.
interesting how he refers to himself in the 3rd person.

If you mean creationist and global warming denialist, then yes.  As a matter of fact, one of the few 'skeptical' climate scientists, Roy Spencer, is an avid proponent of intelligent design.

I would consider myself an evolutionist and an AGW skeptic (different than a denialist).

"And his cohort, John Christy, used to be a missionary"

This does not mean he does not believe in evolution.

"Both types of people tend to be very religious and/or have no understanding of or respect for the scientific process."

So, those who believe in evolution are very religious and have no understanding of, or respect for, the scientific process? Hmmm....

I believe in evolution and I am a skeptic of man-made global warming.  It's only natural:  Evolution is the result of genetic mutation, natural selection, and adaptation to an ever-changing world.  If all life exists with such a complex mechanism (and it all does on this planet), you can rest assured the environment has made it a necessity.  Kind of silly to insist man's fart in the wind is throwing off the whole planet's "balance", especially when this slight warming trend perfectly coincides with the greatest level of solar activity seen in over a thousand years.

Those who believe in evolution and man-made global warming simply believe what ever they're told to believe.

I believe that the neo-Darwinian synthesis (the combination of natural selection and Mendle's genetics) is the best explanation of how life on earth came to be as it is, and I am a sceptic about the man made global warming hypothesis. As to my religious beliefs, I am agnostic.
Evolutions has a mass of hard evidence to back it, while man made global warming is a political/ religious doctrine hyped up by people such as Al Gore who is making a fortune as a carbon credits trader.

Would the proponents of the global warming cult support an all natural fuel?



If we could find an all natural fuel that is maybe naturally produced by our planet, maybe from waist or possibly animals that have died. And then this fuel could be extracted simply by drilling a hole in the ground and pumping it out. Then this naturally produced substance could be very simple to refine by simply heating it, and every part of this fuel could be used, such as part of it for fuel and part of it for lubrication. and even part of it could be used to make roads or even tires for the cars that are being fueled.

There is a nugget of truth to the sentiment described during the opening tracking shots in "The Gods Must Be Crazy."

A nugget.

But while some of us sometimes feel that way, it's not a rationale to impose a "back to nature" lifestyle on everyone else.

But imposing that "back to nature" lifestyle is what these groups want to do.

They're fond of arguing "if you don't like abortion, don't have one."

They should then be happy with "if you don't like burning coal and oil, don't."

But they're not happy with it.

Their motto is "live and let live - as long as you live the way we want you to live."

Turning oil into suitable fuels for cars is quite a complicated process, I would not call it simple.

Whilst there may be some idiots who believe global warming is happening just because they follow the herd those of us who base our decisions on evidence aren't so easy to fool into thinking of fossil fuels as good.

Remember, just because something is natural does not make it good (only idiots believe that), arsenic is natural and it isn't very good for you.

What a silly question, tryng to trick people like that... What is an 'all natural' fuel as opposed to a 'part natural' or 'wholly unnatural/synthetic' fuel... If you actually believe that the stuff that you put into your car is 'all natural' and you only have to simply heat it to refine it then this might be even more idiotic than the premise of your question... or the fact that you cannot tell the difference between waste and waist!!

I actually agree with Dana on this on.  A journalist is supposed to report, not to form opinions although that tenant of journalism is largely gone.  I don't believe in AWG, but I do believe in the right of others to speak about their beliefs.  Opening up the phone lines to skeptics would be non-productive.  An hour long show is hardly long enough to talk about all the science behind both sides of global warming.  NPR is extremely liberal.  If you don't like their content, don't listen.  I know I don't.

I have to agree with Dana here, if you believe its nonsence, don't watch it.  It only encourages the media to push that kind of thing if people tune into it.

There doesn't seem to be any balanced coverage in the conventional sense.  Either a media organisation believes in catastrophic AGW or they believe it's science fiction.  There doesn't seem to be any middle ground at all.

Certainly not.



The taxes have all gone to pay for government waste. None of the taxes have been in any way good for the environment.  For example the government taxes green energy and fossil fuels equally.  That is except for the worst offender, aviation fuel. Because many corrupt Labour M.P.'s are being funded by aviation, avation fuel continues to get a tax holiday and new runways are being approved which will massively breach European safe emissions standards.

If you starve householders and industry of money, then they won't be able to invest in cleaner technology.



The best way to tackle climate change is through education and investment in new technology.

It is the best way to make you poorer and some other person that likes to scare people about Global warning, richer. Mostly because the poor wouldn't have to pay nor would poor countries and before you know it, only the evil USA would have to pay anything to the New World order for our sins.

Our biggest unnecessary fuel waste is from our autos, why aren't our leaders talking speed limit reduction? A carbon tax would reduce waste, but instead the plan is "cap & trade"? Wouldn't that result in a huge new bureaurocracy, and part of the proceeds going to carbon credit speculators (like algore) ?



They are trying to do this in a way that maximizes government control, while still allowing the wealthy full use of fuel.

that it happens all through time, and that there is very little we can do about it. I was just reading this very interesting piece about how sailors, some famous like James Cook, Admiral Lord Nelson who  logged weather charts, and this item goes back some 400 years and from those records they have found that there has been a huge variance in weather patterns, and that this is likely to continue.



There are things we can do though to aid us all, stop the deforestation and coal burning, that is causing pollution throughout the world, i only have to look at what London was like not so long ago when most people had coal fires and the pollution was horrendous. They used to call the fogs pea soupers because you couldn't see through them. Now that most coal fires at least in London are no longer in use, that has cleared the air considerably. Cars can be made more cleaner and that i think benefits the air quality so we can do things to help ourselves.

I bet you believe the president is the smartest man in the world too. I bet you don't fish or spend any time out doors to notice the water, air and earth around you are so different from when you were a child. I bet you haven't watched anything on the Discovery channel or even the Learning Channel that show again and again the changes in our planet due to global warming. My God, do the math. There are a hundred reasons for sub-categories on this topic because there is so much to say and so much to learn. All of us must pitch in in the smallest of ways to assure our children and grandchildren have our beautiful waters and skies. Do you really think that if we were conscious of all the pollution and stupid things we do daily in our throwaway world that it would actually hurt anything? There is too much scientific evidence for global warming. Please don't stick your head in the sand, do some research. Yeah, you might have to take a little longer in your day to recycle or to go as green as your household can, but it is so worth it. It's time to stop thinking in the singular terms in this life and think of the generations of humans we are imposing this selfishness on. They will be the ones to pay. 
Come out of the box you live in and take a good look around you. Where are all the glaciers? Why are all of the bumblebees disappearing? Why are all of the fish changing colors and disappearing, full of mercury. Wake up before you regret it as will all of the people who are too lazy and selfish to give a little. Still driving your SUV complaining about the price of gas? Come on. Wake up!

The direct answer to your question is because people are interested in the topic (you posted here didn't you?). Since when did Y!A have to take a stance on what is "acceptable" to discuss? Are you advocating a Stalinist, anti-freedom-of-speech society?

And there are many other categories that don't deal with "fact" (as you see it) - mythology, beauty & style, politics - plus, of course the real "biggest lie ever told" - religion.

I would ask some questions in return:
Why are you so interested in censorship?
Why do you not believe in freedom of speech?
Are you advocating that society should try to move to a "1984 Big Brother" style of governance?

Censorship and denial of freedom of speech is normally implemented when people are scared of what might be said mainly because people might say the truth, might discuss reality and thus disturb their comfortable status quo at the top of the pecking order.

What are you so scared of?
The truth?

You got me thinking for a moment what the "biggest lie ever told might be."  There's a question to post, but it wouldn't be in this category.

This category exists because scientists have established a link between human activities and changes occurring in global climate patterns throughout the planet.



This category exists because the issue is complex, and there was/is a lot of misinformation out there, and by offering a section in Yahoo people can ask and answer questions, do some research, and possibly reflect on the information generated.

I've got sites I can share with you that showcase the work being done at the university level, by governments throughout the United States and the world, by non-profits and think tanks, by corporations who want to protect their future revenue.  I'll gladly share them with you if you like.  If it's fairy tales you're looking for, check out the link below.  Some of those tales were pretty scary too, as I recall.

Within 500 years we are likely to see the start of an ice age that will undo most global warming. so if you plan to live that long you will want to avoid living in Canada.

In the mean time you may want to avoid areas that are likely to become inhospitable deserts, which is to say most of western USA.

Any area likely to have drought today will be more likely. Areas prone to flooding are likely to see floods. Plan to be able to evacuate any low lying area.

If you build a wind turbine, plan that it must survive winds twice as great as any previously seen. Likewise your house and any other structure. Do not try to drive through deep water on the road.

Global warming question?



I was watching inconvenient truth the other day and theres the bit where it shows the sea level rising really high and flooding most of the world. Well i live near the sea, and don’t want to drown, so i got to thinking. Maybe if we lower the sea level a bit, when the water level rises then it won’t rise high enough to flood.

Anyway, heres the plan. Everyone who can should take a bucket of sea water and pour it down the sink. If lots of people put the effort in, we could lower the sea level substantially and create a better world for our children to live.

Your plan really wouldn't work all the water goes straight back to sea and the difference would be minicule even if every human did it - the oceans are that vast. The only way to prevent global warming to to stop burning fossil fuels and cutting down trees. Do your bit and reduce the energy you use. If everyone did this then we really would make a difference.

The sea level was higher in the 1840s than it is today.

All water is connected. All water on Earth is still here, in different places or forms, but all accounted for. Pouring water down the drain goes back to where it came from. We would have to ship water off the planet, store it on the moon or somewhere. Then we can ship it back if the sea level gets too low.

There are 9 known lies in that movie and several more half-truths and opinions. It should not be used as scientific proof of anything.

The process of global warming is true. As is a process of global cooling. There is no catastrophic end of the world looming ahead due to a human caused global warming.

that depends on what is done. switching over to "green" energy is going to cost money due to replacing the current infrastructure, to the tune of many trillions of dollars.



another thing is that the cost of complying with government regulation gets expensive, as companies are forced to change many things. one hotel i worked at it cost 1 million dollars to replace the asbestos insulation because the government required that it be replaced when renovating a building, even if the asbestos was not being touched. and this was a small hotel.

there are things that can be done though that dont cost money, like when you change your cars oil, you take the used oil to the local parts store or recycling center, or when you are finished with aluminum cans, newspapers, etc, you take them to the recycling center as well.

The cost people are usually referring to when they say it will cost to save the planet, is the cost to do things differently.  If our use of cars fueled by oil and gas damages the planet, we must replace those cars with some other means of transportation.  So the cost to buy an electric car would be one of the cost of saving the planet.  Whenever you hear of something that needs changing, that change will cost money.  Even recycling which actually can save money, cost some money to begin. The real question is saving the planet worth the cost.

Because major corporations are banking major bucks on marketing everything as "green." It's all the same stuff, just with a different name. It's the same as saying something is "lite" - it made people think they were eating healthier or smoking less harmful cigarettes, when lite isn't even a real word. It's a marketing ploy preying on the granola generation.

because we are adding on to that percentage which is making the earth warm up. the facts are all there, global warming is real. the big  question is, what will the temperature be in the future?

the belief that global warming being a scam is the actual scam

you think about it, alot of people don't want global warming to be real. it'll make a big change to our lifestyles and company's will go out of business. people will take any excuss to rule out global warming

global warming is real, people just need to accept that and take action

Ok you really need to get your facts straight. If the atmosphere was 78% carbon dioxide we'd all be dead. Global warming is fact all the scientists agree.

Earth's atmosphere contains roughly 78.08% NITROGEN, 20.95% oxygen, a variable amount (average around 1%) water vapor, 0.93% argon, 0.038% CARBON DIOXIDE as well as traces of hydrogen, helium, and other "noble" gases.

There is currently no evidence that man has made any significant contribution to climate change.

Some interesting facts.
1. During most of the past 2,000 years, the temp has been about the same or higher. Currently, we are barely over the average for the last 2,000 years.
http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index....

2. During the medieval warm period (820 – 1040 AD), Greenland supported farming. Those areas previously farmed are now covered in glaciers. Obviously the melting and reformation of glaciers is a cyclical occurrence.

3. The earth experienced a little ice age which ended around the late 1860's or so. This is about the time man started recording temperatures. This would be like measuring a lake depth after a severe drought, then worrying about it flooding as it rose to normal levels.

4. The earth has been warming for the last 18,000 years, since the last major glacier time period. During this time frame, the glaciers have been melting at a fairly consistent rate. Also, for most of the last 1 billion years, the earth had NO glaciers or ice coverage.
http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/i...

5. The AGW theory states that CO2 is the primary driver of temperature. They arrived at this idea because they did not know of anything else which could cause it. But during the 70's and during the current decade, temperatures dropped while CO2 continued to rise. This means that natural occurrences are driving temp, not CO2.

6. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and sun spots provides a much better correlation to earths' temperature than CO2 levels ever have.
http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/200...
http://strata-sphere.com/blog/index.php/...

7. Polar Bears are experiencing a population boom. Coke sales in the arctics are through the roof. Polar Bears have been around for thousands of years, and remember, we are only at the average for the last 2,000 years. They lived through all the previously warmer climates. The original picture of 2 bears on a floating ice block was a complete scam. The photographer explained that the bears were in no danger and close to shore. The picture was lifted from a public PC by another passenger and sent around the world.



8. Many glaciers are expanding. Even Antarctica is growing on 98% of is land mass. Only 2% is melting.
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1...



9. There is no consensus on AGW. This was a lie that has been propagated by the media.
http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckt...

10. Yes we emit CO2 into the atmosphere and it is a greenhouse gas, but, we only contribute about .28% of all the greenhouse effect. Water vapor makes up about 95% of the greenhouse effect. CO2 and other trace gases round out the greenhouse gases at about 5% for all of them. Of that 5%, only 3% is CO2, and most of that is natural. Again, our contribution to the greenhouse effect is a paltry .28%
http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenh...

11. The spread of disease is not attributed mainly to temperature. If this were the case, Florida would be a giant festering disease ridden cesspool. Economic standing is the primary determining factor in the spread of disease. Poor cultures can not fight the disease or eradicate the pests like more successful nations.
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12077886...

12. Natural climate disasters (hurricanes, cyclones, etc) have never been scientifically linked to global warming (whether natural or man made).

Yes, the CO2 (along with deforestation) is teh cause of global warming.

Look, I understand the confusion--there are a lot of deliberate propagandists trying to fool people (Exxon alone is known to spend nearly $40 million a year issuing false information

Specifically--there ares several natural warming cycles. They all take centuries to play out--at a minimum. Most take thousands or tens of thousands of years. The CURRENT global warming is occurring 10-1000 times the speed as any natural cycle--and is more severe already.



If you are going to research this--stick to websites with a .edu or .gov extension--those are university or government science sites and can be relied on.  And many have links to other sites (even commercial ones) that are also reliable.  The problem you are having is you are reading the fakes/liars as if they were legitimate sites. Learn the difference.

Solar influence and Bonded Events go hand in hand. Ice rifting,tidal spikes,and droughts all have been linked to causes other then CO2. Most studies have been hampered by the lack of records not the physical processes.

Firstly many of the stories of drought, flooding etc... are just scare mongering, if they told us warming is good no one would do anything so they have to exagerate the effects. We have these effects now and always have, at worst they will just move to other areas.



Climate scientist Stephen Schneider, who was promoting the global cooling scare scenario in the 1970s, made himself notorious by telling Discover magazine in 1989: “To capture the public imagination, we have to offer up some scary scenarios, make simplified dramatic
statements and little mention of any doubts one might have. Each of us has to decide the right balance between being
effective, and being honest.” Schneider has been one of the most
visible and voluble scientist-lobbyists for global warming, testifying to Congress, playing a prominent role in the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC), and setting the standards by which it presents its opinions to the public without any hint of uncertainty.

Many studies have found net benefits to warming, here are some of them (assuming only a few degrees warming):

Reduced death from the cold (outweights death from heat)

Reduced flu & colds (less time sat in doors with windows closed)

Increased plant growth rate (reduced stomata due to increased co2)

Plants more resistant to drought, poor soils or saline soils (allowing desert to become fertile again, as during Eygption times) increasing land for food production.

Reduction of permafrost and ice cover, increasing land for food growth, forest plantation

Extended growing seasons due to warmer weather and warmer soils

Increased timber growth

Benefits to the enconomy from increased food yeilds and timber production resulting in lower food costs, which directly benefits the poor, the third world and thus reduces disease and death rate further

Increased wealth due to lower food costs and boosted economy.

Increased animal numbers due to more abunded food supply

Less large scale flooding due to changes in nature of rainfall (shorter sharper, less saturated soils)

There is no empirical evidence of more extreme weather with warming, in many areas extreme weather has remained the same or less. Meteological principles explain that a reducedtemperature gradient (as would occur with global warming) results in less extreme weather.

As we have been through warmer periods in the past we know polar bears, coral and frogs will be fine (infact evidence shows that corals thrived during pevious warm periods).

Economists have shown a net benefit to society even up to 5-6 degrees of warming.

Sea rise rose 150mm over the last centuary, slower than the average rate of 180mm/100 years over the last 10,000 years and the remnants of the iceage retreat. Expect a similar rise over the next 100 years.

There a few disadvantages projected other than a small rise in sea level, more localised or flash flooding, and less rainfall in some areas requireing better management of water resources.



I do not count model projections as they fail to even recreate el nino effects or model rainfall or cloud cover and are 0% accurate. By the IPCC's own definition can not be used as predictions of the future.

Geological, archeological and historical data shows periods of warmer weather have brought great wealth to humanity, and colder periods like the little iceage brought hardship and disease.

Warmer weather does not increase disease, poverty does. Moquitos live all over the world and seem to prefer cooler weather so dont worry about malaria spreading around the world.

Possibly.

In the end we will have a higher global mean temperature and might end up with more biomass than we do now (the ice ages had more land but also less life than now).

Although the process of transition won't be very nice (we'll need to evacuate a lot of people from land that will be flooded, not to mention move a lot of food production around).

Even then it's not guaranteed that we'll end up better off with higher temperatures.

Minor global warming would have some positive affects in crop seasons, less cold-related illnesses, etc but we've already passed that point and there is absolutely zero reason to think that 'minor' is all we're going to get...

So, theoretically, there may be some positive consequences (for humans), practically, the ramifications are all negative (which explains why you haven't heard much about the positives!)

yes, there are positive effects of global warming, but now it has reached a point where the negative outweighs the positive.
Man-made global warming has been around ever since we started burning down forests to plant crops. In fact, the start of the warming trend prevented the onset of another ice age which would have made the rise of agriculture and livestock impossible.
But with the massive amounts of pollutants and greenhouse gasses from industries and cars, the changes in overall temperature can disrupt the natural movement of water and air currents, resulting in larger storms. Etc. etc. etc.

I'm not saying that global warming is good but the warmer environment can promote the growth of plants. Global warming is melting ice in ice-filled Greenland, which enables the people there to grow crops that were impossible to grow in their weather, and also raise cattle, goats, sheep, etc. with the emergence of green pastures.

3. Better sales for suntan lotion.
4. More summer days and even more fun under the sun.
5. Pool parties are going to be in
6. Increase supply of seafoods. more fish are available for hunt due to melting of our polar ice caps.
7. No more gathering and burning of wood during winter
8. No more ice mounds cus well be having summertime during winter
9. better prices for land properties as more lands are lost to sea.
10. Increase workways during winter.
11. Faster travel . As polar ice caps gone, shipping boats no longer have to travel south in order get to other side by sea.

Either that or what had in mind but saving the earth to me  is best way to be.

I just heard on the "Planet Green Network" (Channel 194 Chicago Dish Network) that Cows product 20% (TWENTY PERCENT, no typos here!) of the WORLD'S green house gasses.

Now, I'm not parroting something I got from some nut-job, "anti for the sake of being anti" organization... I'm doing a direct quote from episode 2 of "Stuff Happens", Green Planet Network, air date 09-16-2008, approximately 3 min's in to the episode.

Yeah...

Humans = 3%
Cows = 20%

And one small volcano erupting sets back the healing of the Ozone Hole by 3 years...

I'm not saying humans don't have an impact on the environment but HOW ON EARTH can it be said that Humans are THE ONE AND ONLY PROBLEM when NATURE ITSELF seems to be doing a LOT more "Damage" to itself then humans ever could?

Then you take in to account how NOW they are saying that "Global Dimming" is an even greater threat to the planet, how can we justify the political movement that "Environmentalism" has turned in to?

ESPECIALLY considering how the "Spokesman" for Global Warming, Al Gore, has been shown to OWN the "Carbon Credit" company that he purchases 'Carbon Credits' from? He set up the company TWO YEARS before he started his "quest" to warn mankind of the dangers of Global Warming!

It might be plausible to plant a Hardy red winter variety during the summer months. I have no clue what the soil horizon would be, especially after plucking or Alluvial deposits. Nor have I bothered to try a second guess of what really lays beneath ~80-84% of ice coverage. I believe the substrata would be mostly Andosol, while the surface would be oxidic? Me, myself and I, would have a fishing or hunting retreat.

There's already quite a bit of land that is ice free (has been since the time of the vikings) in the SW of Greenland. Even if the ice did melt you have several problems, it will still be very cold -10 to -20 with an increase of 3-5 deg for GW is still -7 to -17 in winter. Another small problem the center is 300m below sea level because of the weight of the ice.

If all Greenland's ice were to melt (which would takes 100s of years) sea levels would rise 23ft and Greenland would become a group of islands.
While the growing season is short GW will increase it a little which would make it possible to grow a few more exotic things like strawberries this would be more than offset by the world wide sea rise.

Here in my area-central U.S.-an acre of very good farmland will produce 200+ bushels of corn an acre and land like that has been going for as high as $6,000 an acre.  That's on the very high end, most of it around here is closer to $3,000.  Farmers I know use a figure of around $950 per acre to plant and harvest corn, so you can see that commodity prices will determine the value of the land and what it will bring in rent; $4.00 corn makes it hard to justify an investment in land at $3,000 an acre; $6.00 corn makes it look a lot better. In other areas of the world where arable land is at an even higher premium, I know that an acre of ground can bring as high as $25,000 U.S. But you have to have long-term stability in the weather and world-wide commodity markets to sustain prices at their present levels...think about the return over decades you'd have to have to warrant paying $25,000 per acre for farmland.



The same principles apply when calculating the ROI on wheat, barley or rye, and the unknown is at the heart of your question.



Needless to say, if these climactic shifts predicted by global warming come true-if a large swath of Europe becomes far less temperate and the grain belt of the U.S. becomes arid or falls victim to increasingly unstable weather patterns and production drops way off-as it inevitably will if you got drought here, flooding there, and crop destroying winds here and there, an acre of productive farmland not as subject to those vagaries of weather in latitudes farther north will be very valuable indeed.  One of the major reasons for the spike in prices around here has been that the most valuable land is in a small area where the weather has remained very stable the last ten years; the $6,000 land is producing more and more because the growing season has lengthened appreciably, rainfall has remained consistent and extreme weather events relatively rare.  Rents have jumped from $110 an acre to as high as $300.  If a person owns 500 acres, that ain't bad rental income.

Of course, at that point Canada and Greenland will probably be trying to deal with the same issues of immigration that the U.S. is wrangling with now.  Haw.  Very interesting question-provokes thought about some of the real consequences of climate changes that we don't consider while we are surfing the net in the comfort of our climate-controlled urban homes, able to just go to the kitchen to get whatever we want to eat from a smorgasbord of products grown in parts of the world we never see or know anything about.  Here in the U.S. it is very easy to lose sight of the real reasons for the concern over shifting weather patterns and the causes behind them, as well as why so much research is going into it.

If Greenland were completely ice free which has not happened in almost a million years including several extended warm periods that lasted from 600 to 1000 years each it would probably raise sea levels less than an inch world wide. This is because of something known as geologic rebound where as the weight was released from ice melt surrounding areas that are currently under water would get deeper under water and yes the coastal regions would subside as the interior regions rose under the release of weight. What those who faithful follow keep forgetting is just how much water was tied up in continental ice masses at the Last Glacial maximum. It took that much ice melting in less than 200 years to raise sea levels 400 or so feet. On the whole face of the earth there is not even .1 percent of that ice mass to melt and it is in regions that have not melted in a million years or more. It absolutely amazes my the mass of very bad information that is so easily proven bad the AGW promoters are dispensing to the public they have so carefully kept from getting a decent education.



I think Linlyons needs to review just how much ice there was on the face of the earth at the last glacial maximum. Remember this ice when it melted in three stages over a period of 300 or so years raised seal levels about 400 feet. And this ice stood over a mile thick where New York City is today and was probably thicker closer to the pole. All the glacial ice on earth is not even .2 percent of that which melted 11,000 years ago and inundated the ice age civilization and providing the basis for all the flood myths of early history.

there are many points to consider.
my first thought was, how warm would it get, and for how long.

"wheat normally requires between 110 and 130 days between planting and harvest"

i think that unlikely to happen, although w/o the huge ice cube that is Greenland, the climate could be considerably warmer than g/w estimates at the moment.

as several point out, the center of Greenland is depressed, and would be under water.  salt water, in fact.  so that even when it does rebound, and become dry (questionable within a reasonable time)  the soil will be so salt saturated that it would not be farmable, probably for some centuries.

james contention that when the center rebounds, some other areas will subside is likely correct, although not nearly to the 0.1" change in sea level he dreams about.  also, his comment about the length of time is also appropriate.  while glaciers around the edge are melting, there's likely little change in the 2 mile thickness in the center of the island.  thus, while there may be an ice-free fringe, the center is not likely to be so in the foreseeable future.

all-in-all, i'd not be planning on doing any farming in the center of Greenland in this millennium.

Reading the questions though, it sounds like your teacher already has her mind made up, despite the fact that a large portion of the scientific communnity has not.  I guess that's what happens when Al Gore invents things though.

These links contain well documented materials that will answer your question with facts. People need to learn the truth and lose the panic because until we learn to control the output of the sun it will warm and cool on earth as the sun does. The major problem many people have is the bad information about Co2 in the media and the deliberate misinformation put out by AGW believers on co2. Co2 in the first place cannot cause warming per se, at the most it can slow down how cold it gets at night when skies are clear and humidity is low. Also high co2 levels trail warming because of one simple and non-refutable basic fact, cold water as in the oceans hold more Co2 in solution than do warm waters. So as oceans warm whether from solar activity (sunspots) or geologic activities such as volcanoes they release Co2 into the air because it will no longer remain in solution. Caused by man is a simplistic political answer for people who have a religious belief that man is evil by nature and technological man with modern industry is even more evil.

I think its simply cultural.  Most people like me who identify with the environmental/peace culture of the late 60s and 70s (we will call 'left' for lack of a better term)  don't trust highly technical, opionated mostly republican-type people(we will call 'right' for lack of better)  who worked for the defense industry or the nuclear industry in general.  And the two NEED to meet on this.  People like yourself (I am guessing) need to reach out to the Sierra Club, WWF and the 'left' and really explain with humility and honesty your case. Their is tremendous dis-trust.  And the environmentalist need to roll us their sleeves and really try to understand the numbers and the whole picture of the Fast-Breeder Reactor. Unless I am missing something I think it is just a question of culture.

There is a lot of confusion and hype surrounding global warming, made worse due to political agendas, conspiracy theories and media input. There is a belief that scientists who research global warming or believe it is happening/ that humans are responsible are cynically motivated or just plain wrong. As one of these people researching global warming I find that slightly insulting, but there you go. It's true that CO2 emissions alone are not responsible for global warming. It's also true that we may be in an interglacial cycle, and that sunspot activities (see previous poster) may have an effect. However, theories that greenhouse gases such as CO2 cannot cause warming are simply wishful thinking and ill founded. There are many contributing factors to the warming trend we are observing, and humans are certainly one of them!



To write an essay on this subject you could look at the debate - is it really happening, what could be causing it, could it just be a natural process or are humans a factor too? Do your own research and come to your own conclusions, don't just listen to other's opinions. Remember that many sources, especially internet ones, are biased and have an agenda to put forward. This applies to both sides of the argument. Many people don't want to damage the economy by cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and as such they will present the evidence as if it's all a big scam. On the other hand, environmentalists, conservationists and /some/ scientists may twist evidence to make it look like global warming is more dramatic than it is. There is probably no such thing as a neutral source, though peer-reviewed journal articles, textbooks, and possibly reports from scientific foundations where there's a huge bunch of scientists working together (therefore in theory eliminating personal bias) might come close.



Some things to look at:



The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
The big authority on what's happening. Read the latest report, it addresses issues of natural cycles, sunspots etc
http://www.ipcc.ch/



Sunspot cycles
No doubt an influence, though if they were the only factor we would expect cooling, not warming.
http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/Sunspo...



NERC - the climate change debate
Ok, this one's probably biased but it gives a good idea of the kind of questions skeptics are asking and how scientists try to answer them.
http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/consult/deba...



CO2 and Climate in the past
An extract from the well-respected university text Plate Tectonics and Crustal Evolution, explaining a bit about the effect CO2 may have had on climate in the past.

Well let us start from the top and that is the base question is the current climate optimum unusual in any way from those historically recorded ones that have preceded this one. Yes this one is unusual in several ways.



First it is much colder than the average historical climate optimum.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Wa...



Second it might be a drawn out spike like the 1400 and 1600 ones that were very short lived and not a true optimum at all. Currently our highest leveled temperature or climate max is well below all previous optimums and below the 1400 spike and about at the peak of the 1600 spike. Now there was also a colder spike about 1800 between the Maunder minimum and the Dalton minimum that was noticeably colder than the currently period.

How do you stay warm while you're smoking?



It's starting to get cold outside.  Unfortunately, outside is the only place I am able to smoke (damn smoking bans).  When you're out there for a couple hours smoking a cigar, you realize just how cold 40 degrees really is.



So how do you stay warm out there?  Tonight, I was wearing a sweater, sweatpants, jeans, and a jacket, and I was STILL cold.



I can live with it for now, but when winter really starts to hit, it's going to be a royal pain.



So, any suggestions?

Smoking cigars is not a contributor to any disease (your disease is associated with inhaling cigarette smoke, not tasting cigar smoke).  And if I wanted to stop smoking, I'd have asked for advice on that.  As it is, I'm relatively new to smoking - I find it quite enjoyable.

I am a former smoker, so I'm not going to criticize you but cigar smoking can still harm you. You may lessen your risks of lung cancer, but instead are upping risks for mouth cancer. Anyways, I'd like to know where you live! Where I am, it was 90 degrees today; no sign of a cold front in sight.

Can't really tell you if or when the North pole will melt,
But I can tell you that South Pole WILL NOT melt because it lies on the continent of  Antarctica and continents don't usually melt.



The North Pole lies on the Arctic Ocean (frozen), so it could perhaps melt, but actually it's refreezing as you can see in this image:

In 2002, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted most ice would be gone by 2100. However, due to emissions increasing faster than IPCC anticipated, the panel now thinks all ice may be completely gone by then, if not sooner.



And the ice will be "greatly diminish[ed]... by 2050."



Not sure about the countries that will be flooded.

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way.



A warmer climate is not equal to increased food output.



It wouldn't matter even if it was, because worldwide we already produce an excess of food.  The distribution is not equal, and it likely never will be.

There is no such thing as a magic tipping point as claimed by the political hacks promoting the AGW hypotheses. Global warming and cooling happen because our sun is a variable output star with several radiance cycles ranging from 11 years to several hundred years. No one yet really knows what causes these solar fluctuations but they seem to be based on sunspots and radiations that are out of the visible band from the experts I have read. Because the believers only refer to the output readings on the visible bands and the changes in output are not very large they tend to discount the sun as a major player when it is the #1 player. They also tend to discount geologic and hydrological events that have thousands of times more effect on temperature than Co2 does. See below for some validated by scientific method research.

most companies won't tell you how bad they are, so this information won't be very available. but you should take in different factors in their process, such as the pollution from the bulldozers and trucks, the procession of wood and it shipping, and the CO2 that is released upon the death of the tree.



be sure to include many other examples beside Boise Cascade to show that all deforestation companies are bad. You should also briefly tell us in the beginning of the essay that trees naturally exchange CO2 for oxygen in order to solidified the CO2 releasing on death of the trees.

The biggest problem is the deforestation of the Amazon rainforests.  Boise Cascade is not involved there (not that I know of anyhow)



"It is estimated that 1/3 to 1/5 of carbon dioxide pollution comes from tropical rainforest destruction"



"Scientists agree that the world’s rainforests are the best natural defense against climate change because they store vast amounts of carbon. For example, Indonesian old-growth rainforests store almost 750 tons of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of 620 flights between New York and London – per acre. When cleared, rainforests release that carbon into the atmosphere, furthering global warming rather than curbing it."

Actually if you believe the Global warming excrement, then Boise Cascade REDUCES global warming.



They cut down older, slower growing trees ( big huge carbon collections ) then replace those trees with younger faster growing trees that absorb more carbon. The trees that have been cut down are turned into homes, baseball bats, pianos, tables and books, thus sequestering that carbon for a long time.



Cool huh?



And really, the way you've begun with your conclusion, then gone and looked for information to back up your conclusion is precisely backwards. You would be wiser to ask a question, then go to find out what the answer actually is.

Wow, there is a lot of misinformation in this thread.



Trees not only sequester carbon dioxide but when they are chopped down or burned carbon dioxide in the soil and tree is released.



Even ignoring greenhouse gases, deforestation has devastating effects on biodiversity and natural water cycles while contributing to desertification (research Haiti vs. the Dominican Republic).



You will not be able to get solid numbers for the detrimental effects the company may be causing. Just focus on the general ideas.

**this is from an essay I wrote Freshman Year of high school
lawl cant believe I still had that.



Global warming is an increase in the average temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans, especially that observed in recent decades and its projected continuation. (www.wikipedia.com)  People have taken our planet for granted.



Global warming has always been a concern, but because people have been so careless about the environment, it has grown worse.  Global warming could be prevented by less dependence on cars and more use of car pooling and public transportation.  However, the best way to minimize global warming is by walking instead of relying on cars and other methods of transportation. The facts that people constantly use their cars as a method of transportation and do not recycle leads to global warming.



Driving a car can be the single most polluting thing that we can do.  Motor vehicles emit millions of tons of pollutants into the air each year.  Cars also emit several pollutants classified as toxics, which cause as many as 1,500 cases of cancer in the country each year. Auto emissions also contribute to the environmental problems of acid rain and global warning. (www.nsc.org)  Right now cars are controlling our lives and that is a fact.  It seems like it is impossible to get to work without driving there.  Cars and trucks pollute the environment and are leading to global warming.  The constant need to re-fill cars with gas does not help with finding the solution of a healthier and cleaner environment.



Recycling is the reprocessing of materials into new products. (www.wikipedia.com)  Many people today do not even think about recycling.  When recycling does not occur, it wastes energy and material resources, and takes up space.  One huge example of a wasted material is aluminum.  Every day millions of people throw away aluminum cans that could have been recycled.  Over the past 20 years Americans
have burned or buried 11 million tons of aluminum cans worth over
$12 billion. (www.greenyes.grrn.org)



The process of global warming is accelerated when individuals do not pay attention to what is going on in the world around them.  By not recycling and driving gas guzzling cars with bad emission levels, our planet is doomed to disaster.  Walking or bicycling and using hybrid vehicles that use alternative forms of energy all slow down the process of global warming.



Every day thousands of cars are being used to get to places.  People do not even know about the harm they are doing to their planet even when they turn on the ignition.  The least that could be done is to recycle once and a while.  However, this is hardly being done.  Not many people care about our environment and if no one acts now, our planet will be in great danger.

Who believes in Global Warming?



I want websites that are verified (I accept Wikis) and I do not want people just saying things like "It is warming/cooling", I want numbers and graphs showing -when- it is warming/cooling.  Also, information on storm "increase" would be nice.  And do not tell me to watch an Inconvenient Truth, I have seen it.

Go to the Hadley Centre.  The link below is their "big picture" page and I think it's exactly what you are looking for.  It gives their "facts" and myths.  Clicking on a Fact link will give you the explanation and graphs.

Look at the source for the Herald Sun graphs:  It's the Hadley Centre!!!  If the paper trusts the Hadley Centre for the data, why does it not trust it for the conclusion.  The Hadley Centre has noted the cooling trend and attibutes it to a strong La Nina effect.  Go to the source.

"Global warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the next century, but -- regardless of whether it is or isn't -- we won't do much about it. We will (I am sure) argue ferociously over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed. Little will be done. . . . Global warming promises to become a gushing source of national hypocrisy.''

Where Is GLOBAL WARMING?



I ask this for one simple reason. Right now in Australia it is spring and soon it will be summer. Right now it is pouring with rain, temperatures down to 9oC and it is even snowing in some parts of New South Wales, which is where i am. You hear experts talkin bout the fact that the ice caps are melting and all the rest, if u ask me they can just take a quick trip up here to Australia and borrow some ice to replace it. One fact i know is that more than 2/3rds of the worlds leading scientists don't even believe that global warming is happening. So if you think you can explain it then go ahead but i think that right now the only thing warming up is about 200,000 cups of tea & coffee to help warm the people of Australia.

Heat causes water (lakes etc) to evaporate up into the air, collecting in the colder atmosphere as a cloud. When the weight of the evaporated water becomes too much for the cloud, it falls down as rain (or snow depending on the time of year). So, an increase of heat causes an increase of evaporation (and more droughts in other areas) and more rain.



Tornadoes and hurricanes are caused by fronts of cold and warmed atmosphere coming together. There is a lot more to it, but that is the simplistic definition of it.



By the way, global warming is not at all real. Over this summer, the glaciers in Alaska GREW... yes GREW.. read my attached link. That is not the only evidence, but just proves nonetheless that global warming is not real, or at least as severe as some say.

Growing Number of Scientists Convert to Skeptics After Reviewing New Research



http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?F...



Here's part of one profile:



Mathematician & engineer Dr. David Evans, who did carbon accounting for the Australian Government, recently detailed his conversion to a skeptic. “I devoted six years to carbon accounting, building models for the Australian government to estimate carbon emissions from land use change and forestry. When I started that job in 1999 the evidence that carbon emissions caused global warming seemed pretty conclusive, but since then new evidence has weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause. I am now skeptical...after 2000 the evidence for carbon emissions gradually got weaker -- better temperature data for the last century, more detailed ice core data, then laboratory evidence that cosmic rays precipitate low clouds,” Evans wrote.  ... Evans noted how he benefited from climate fears as a scientist. “And the political realm in turn fed money back into the scientific community. By the late 1990's, lots of jobs depended on the idea that carbon emissions caused global warming. Many of them were bureaucratic, but there were a lot of science jobs created too. I was on that gravy train, making a high wage in a science job that would not have existed if we didn't believe carbon emissions caused global warming. And so were lots of people around me; and there were international conferences full of such people. And we had political support, the ear of government, big budgets, and we felt fairly important and useful (well, I did anyway). It was great. We were working to save the planet!  But starting in about 2000, the last three of the four pieces of evidence outlined above fell away or reversed....

There is no consensus that global warming will increase storms.  Global warming is real, there is little doubt of that.  But scientists have not yet determined what affect they will have on storms and there is no evidence that the recent increase is caused by GW.



Some models have shown the number will increase, and others have shown they will decrease.  I think you probably don't want to talk about storms in your paper.

There not increasing, in fact if Global Warming was actually still happening it would have a moderating effect,  which would cause fewer storms. When you have extremes in temperatures and these warm and cold fronts combine then you get lots of storms.

First, sea level isn't going to rise 26 feet, 20 feet, 2.6 feet, or 2.0 feet by 2028. It probably won't rise at all. You need to find a real scientist (NOT that idiot Gore or his grant-funded "documentary" flunkies) and ask them how much sea level would rise if every bit of ice on the planet somehow melted. Note that sea level won't change at all if the Arctic ice all melts and stays that way.



Second, if somehow sea levels did rise that much New Orleans would be a minor consideration.



In any event, New Orleans is not optional. History, architecture, culture, and the fact the city is home to many people are usually mentioned when the topic of the city’s future is discussed.  However, those factors (while significant) are NOT why NOLA is important to the rest of the United States.



New Orleans is a metro area of almost 1.4 million people – not some small town that could be easily relocated somewhere else.



More than 35% of America's energy is either produced in Southeast Louisiana or imported through here, and the infrastructure is focused on New Orleans. What may be the largest oil field on earth was discovered offshore of Louisiana in 2006, and it will be exploited via New Orleans.



The Port of New Orleans is the largest or second largest port in North America each year (tons of cargo) and one of the top ports in the world each year. The Port of New Orleans is not replaceable.



More than 25% of America's petroleum refining capacity is in the New Orleans area. That percentage will increase due to a new refinery already under construction and the planned expansion of existing refineries.



A large percentage of America's non-petroleum chemical industry is here.



New Orleans is one of only three principal east-west transportation points for the USA, and the resulting convergence of water, rail, pipeline, electricity, and highway links is not replaceable.



A large percentage of America's ship building & repair industry is in New Orleans.



NASA builds essential parts for the space shuttle in New Orleans, and will build components for the next generation of spacecraft here. Other manufacturers (ex. Bell-Textron) have factories in New Orleans.



A large percentage of America's seafood comes from SE Louisiana, and the distribution network is focused on New Orleans.



And so on….



It is theoretically possible to move the industry and the population, but only at horrific cost. The Mississippi river, Gulf of Mexico, and the oil fields cannot be moved. To even attempt to replace New Orleans would cost Trillions of Dollars and the attempt would fail.



In contrast, New Orleans can be protected from future hurricanes with the expenditure of about $15 Billion (that should have been spent before Katrina) spread out over a period of a decade.



In case $15 Billion sounds like a lot, the federal government spent that much for a 3-mile tunnel under Boston harbor for commuters.



Note that New Orleans is NOT "prone" to hurricanes or being flooded. The last one to hit before Katrina was in 1965 and before that was in 1947. Neither of those flooded the city proper like Katrina, which was the strongest storm ever recorded to strike North America (size + surge).  Gustav was a near-miss but did test the levee system.



There is a widespread myth that New Orleans is "built below sea level”, but that is not true.



Realize that nowhere is without risk. NYC and Miami are at more risk from hurricanes than New Orleans. Los Angeles and San Francisco are at risk from earthquakes and fires. Seattle is threatened by volcanoes and Tsunamis. The Midwest is hit by tornadoes every year and floods much more often than New Orleans. However, I don’t hear anyone claiming New York, Florida, California, Kansas/Iowa, or Washington (state) be abandoned, or even not rebuilt after the next disaster.



However, people routinely claim New Orleans should be abandoned, or that we somehow don’t deserve help after Katrina.



Why is that?

We here in Louisiana buy flood insurance, and New Orleans one of the highest if not the highest percentages of buildings covered by FI in the USA at the time Katrina struck.  However, flood insurance is a national/federal program and has severe limitations.

new orleans has been BELOW sea level for more than a hundred years. some of it is 14 feet below sea level now & all of the city continues sinking lower every year as the mud its built on subsides.
every drop of water that falls in the city has to be pumped uphill  to the Mississippi or the gulf.
sooner or later we're just going to have to face reality & let nature take its course or bankrupt the rest of the country so the resident's can continue to live on the bottom of the ocean at taxpayers expense.

That's a good question, but I don't believe anyone would suggest that, just as no-one would "abandon" Bangladesh... The costs of abandoning a city would be enormous for a start, not to mention the ethical and logistical problems. Instead isn't it more productive to try to curb the warming trend before it's too late (if it's not too late already), and invest in mitigation measures such as improved flood barriers etc?

First time I have ever agreed with Dana, the neighborhoods that are below sea level should be filled in to be reasonably above before being rebuilt. Same goes for towns built on flood planes on the rivers or sand bars off shore. Yes NO is a critical city but the sections below sea level should not be supported by the nation. If they want to buy and pay for a solution that is their business not ours. I still think they could make it pay for itself by using them as a land fill for solids and using the dumping fees to pay for rebuilding the area!

The sea level is not going to rise 1 foot let alone 26 in the next 20 years.  That's not what 'An Inconvenient Truth' said.



Nevertheless, if it were up to me, I would not have rebuilt New Orleans after Katrina.  It's just a matter of time before it gets leveled by another big hurricane.  While it's not certain how global warming will effect the frequency of hurricanes, it does appear to be making them stronger.

Since we're already rebuilding New Orleans, there's no point in abandoning it.  But when it gets leveled by another hurricane, again I if it were up to me I wouldn't rebuild it.

no we all in this world together so why abandon New Orleans when we can help in make a difference. most people have money to pay so why waist money on things you can never get satisfied with and help out with the Global Warming and other Countries. Yes its expensive but we need to have a healthy Globe one country is flooded what will happen to the other countries nearby. What l mean is don't abandon New Orleans when they is something we can do about it starting with our surroundings

Unles we are willing to put as much money as the Dutch do into dikes, then yes!



The place is under sea level, so its gotta have lots of money poured into it to keep it up.



No reason to just rebuild it every few years and hope that nothing happens to it.

Will the record cold we're having cause some to lose their faith in Global Warming? Seeing how soon many have forgotten their American Values in politics I'm wondering if the Global Warming Mission should be intensified to strengthen the cause? Even tho I hear  daily the warning that Global Warming is here and doing great harm should we do more?

We just tell everyone to ignore that the Sun is going through a calm period, and reinforce the idea that they are guilty of causing the worst environmental disaster in all times!  Then we'll get famous people like Prince Charles to tell us that we only have 6 months left before we get to some "tipping point".

I'm tired of people like the first answerer stating weather and climate isn't the same thing. Do they not realize that all of this started due to the fact that the global average temperature was increasing? So yes record cold days especially a lot of them, all over the globe, will cause the global average temperature to go down.

In many ways. In some parts of the world  the climate is becoming much hotter, in other parts much colder. The arctic poles are melting,  and many animals are becoming endangered such as polar bears.  The ocean's levels are rising, New York and Japan are sinking. The sun's rays are getting much more harmful, and many more people are getting skin cancer, from being tanned.

Increased temperatures will mean a shift in where crops can be grown. Desertification will use up valuable land, whereas previous land that was too cold to grow one type of crop will now be able to grow another type.



Less drinking water and water for irrigation will also put pressure on populations. Low lying land will be swamped more often by the sea, with some areas disappearing completely. Warmer areas will increase breeding zones for malarial mosquitoes.

Well let us start from the top and that is the base question is the current climate optimum unusual in any way from those historically recorded ones that have preceded this one. Yes this one is unusual in several ways.



First it is much colder than the average historical climate optimum.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Wa...



Second it might be a drawn out spike like the 1400 and 1600 ones that were very short lived and not a true optimum at all. Currently our highest leveled temperature or climate max is well below all previous optimums and below the 1400 spike and about at the peak of the 1600 spike. Now there was also a colder spike about 1800 between the Maunder minimum and the Dalton minimum that was noticeably colder than the currently period.

People need to learn the truth and lose the panic because until we learn to control the output of the sun it will warm and cool on earth as the sun does. The major problem many people have is the bad information about Co2 in the media and the deliberate misinformation put out by AGW believers on co2. Co2 in the first place cannot cause warming per se, at the most it can slow down how cold it gets at night when skies are clear and humidity is low. Also high co2 levels trail warming because of one simple and non-refutable basic fact, cold water as in the oceans hold more Co2 in solution than do warm waters. So as oceans warm whether from solar activity (sunspots) or geologic activities such as volcanoes they release Co2 into the air because it will no longer remain in solution. Caused by man is a simplistic political answer for people who have a religious belief that man is evil by nature and technological man with modern industry is even more evil.

Nope, mainly because Global Warming, while not proved entirely is probably not a lie. While the planet has indeed been warmer in the past, with no ice caps at all the problem lies in the fact that the cycle has sped up. We shouldn't be at the point where we are now for another several million years. All that aside though, do you not think that perhaps us pumping all these gases and building everywhere might be a bad idea? As for the save the planet T shirts why not? Just because people are willing to open their eyes to the problem that exists doesn't mean you should dismiss them as "Damn Smelly Hippies"



P.S. Palin doesn't have a clue what her job details even are... good sign?? I'm not so sure



P.P.S Looking purely at the history of the earth and all it's changes doesnt really help us because it doesn't add in one major factor, us. The earth was around a long time before we were and it had it's own pattern of heating and cooling but we have made a marked difference to it so there must be some effect.

it is people like you that the next generation is going to despise and hate. you are just loading all of the current issues onto the future generations because you don't want to change anything. i am less concerned with the future of the human race than the future of the earth. why do we have the right to kill the planet, when other organisms have been living on it far longer than we have?? It is people like you that are responsible for global warming, because you refuse to stop your arrogant lifestyles, and LOOK AT THE FACTS. where is the proof that global warming is not happening, NOWHERE. where is the proof that it is? EVERYWHERE. take a look around.



do you really think that trashing the planet for the last 100 years will have no affect on it's well being? Pumping billions of tons of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere every YEAR is going to have an effect, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 100 YEARS. why why why?? because we are lazy, greedy, and arrogant.



This reminds me of back a long long time ago when mankind was CERTAIN that  all the planets and the sun revolved around the earth. suddenly, someone provided SCIENTIFIC PROOF that the earth was revolving around the sun, and what do people do? The refuse to accept it, and throw the scientist in jail. they refused because they were afraid of change, and thought that they were the center of everything, they thought they were special because everything revolved around them. Well, the scientist was right, and thankfully it didn't have any impact whatsoever on the environment cause it didn't even concern it, but it seems as if all you conservatives think the same way. Change is coming, you better accept it, or let it roll right on  top of you and be ready to take full responsibility for that. temperatures are rising, THE ARCTIC IS M.E.L.T.I.N.G. How is that not proof? I am asking you HOW IS THAT NOT PROOF??? what more proof do you want???? seriously! my god.

Well let us start from the top and that is the base question is the current climate optimum unusual in any way from those historically recorded ones that have preceded this one. Yes this one is unusual in several ways.



First it is much colder than the average historical climate optimum.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Wa...



Second it might be a drawn out spike like the 1400 and 1600 ones that were very short lived and not a true optimum at all. Currently our highest leveled temperature or climate max is well below all previous optimums and below the 1400 spike and about at the peak of the 1600 spike. Now there was also a colder spike about 1800 between the Maunder minimum and the Dalton minimum that was noticeably colder than the currently period.



http://www.stsci.edu/stsci/meetings/lisa...



People need to learn the truth and lose the panic because until we learn to control the output of the sun it will warm and cool on earth as the sun does. The major problem many people have is the bad information about Co2 in the media and the deliberate misinformation put out by AGW believers on co2. Co2 in the first place cannot cause warming per se, at the most it can slow down how cold it gets at night when skies are clear and humidity is low. Also high co2 levels trail warming because of one simple and non-refutable basic fact, cold water as in the oceans hold more Co2 in solution than do warm waters. So as oceans warm whether from solar activity (sunspots) or geologic activities such as volcanoes they release Co2 into the air because it will no longer remain in solution. Caused by man is a simplistic political answer for people who have a religious belief that man is evil by nature and technological man with modern industry is even more evil.

I enjoy driving my truck that gets 13 mpg...so that must offset at least one hybrid out there. I also waste water and burn garbage in the back yard. Is it really that wrong of me to not want to change and to keep doing what I've always done? The more people say to "Go green" the more I don't want to. TAKE THAT BONO!

The world has been much warmer in our recent past!  The polar bears did not die off, humans continued to thrive!



Slight increases in temperature or decreases in temperature is a normal occurrence that has been going on for millions of years - no big deal!



Bits and pieces have been falling off of Antarctica for 10,000 years, center ice mass is increasing!



The Arctic was at one time in our recent past so warm that humans could migrate from Asia to North America using boats.



These things are normal to our Earth!



So, any change in temperature is normal and unless the sun crashes into the earth or vice versa (most likely) we will again survive like we have in our past!

"So as oceans warm whether from solar activity (sunspots) or geologic activities such as volcanoes they release Co2 into the air because it will no longer remain in solution."



Unfortunately, burning oil and coal (and therefore suddenly releasing carbon that has been trapped for millions of years) pumps CO2 into our atmosphere. This new source source of CO2 adds an extra 25 BILLION tonnes of CO2 to our atmosphere EVERY YEAR.



This extra CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere, raising the planet's temperature. This releases even more CO2 from the ocean, raises its temperature further, etc etc and is known as a positive feedback loop.



This is the reason it is getting warmer, quicker, than ever before.

Do you realize that in the 1990's we fiquired out that water doesn't freeze at exactly 32 F?  this means that all the temperature measurements prior to that time can be off by ,5 F

it may seem pretty insignificant-but if u take the long run in a 100 yrs the temp will be 250 deg higher!

Has the Arctic Ice Mass continued Growing at Fastest Rate Ever.?



This question was asked last week
http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...
Halfway to the two weeks suggested in that question has the prediction by Dr Jello come even close to being correct, No.
The mean line is still at the mid-point between the average and the 2007 record low, so much for that theory!

Yes and it almost made it back to the same level it was in 1979 for October 30:

Edit: I still say we are on track for my three week prediction.



Edit: Pegimer I'm not mathmatically illiterate. And what you fail to realize is we are talking about the ice in the Arctic reaching the 1979 average, which it has a good chance of doing this year. So who's the illiterate one? I thnk it's you, since you appear to have a hard time with reading comprehension.



And it has refrozen a lot faster then it did last year which had a greater ice melt:

As mathematically illiterate people like the top answerer don't seem to understand, the easiest way to have something grow very rapidly is to have it start from record low levels.  If it had started from record high levels it obviously would not have grown fast at all. I have pointed out several times that the gelatinous one either lies or is intentionally misleading in his questions and answers, which is why he has tried to stop me from answering his questions...no one likes to have their delusions threatened.

One point no one has addressed here is has geologic activity slowed down on the Gakkel Ridge easing the geothermal heating of the Arctic Ocean.  If activity there has reduced as we get further away from the recent conjunction this alone might be enough to enhance cooling and more rapid ice formation as its increased activity before and during the conjunction enhanced the melt off of the ice.

I don't know, but it is likely to grow significantly in the next 30 years due to the shift in the PDO to it's cool phase. It appears, that for the last century the PDO has been a major player in the up and downward temperature trends we see on the actual graphs. This, along with low sun spot activity might very well send us into a dangerous cooling trend that will not only hurt human progress, but on a much brighter note, once and for all prove just how silly the claims of the so-called climate alarmists have been.

Doomsday according to the Honorable Dr Hansen, is the last one of that list.



On his defense however, I must highlight his prediction was 10 years, plus or minus 85 years, so we are still within that narrow gap.



..edit..
If he admits he was wrong, very unlikely, but if he does, then all the politicians supporting his theory would be in serious trouble, so they would silence Hansen before he attempts to do it. That's what I think.

There is no better proof that someone is a political hack than when they give idiot ultimatums such as this one.  I remember Ted Dansen (Hansen seems to be a mental equivilent) said in 10 years we were going to lose the oceans unless we cleaned up our act.  That was about 15 years ago I think and last I looked, the ocean is still there.  I have been around long enough to have heard the 10 year warning over and over again.  I really wonder if the left understands how ridiculous they sound when they make those predictions.

Ah, the armchair scientists have all come together. It's nice to see all the deniers in one place preaching to their choir. At least you have somewhere to go where you are not a danger to the rest of the population. Hint - most of the planet isn't worried about your opinion. The population tends to rely on real scientists, like those from the National Academies. So go on and believe you're making an impact with your amateur opinions. If that makes you feel good about yourself, well, ignorance is bliss.

He didn't say the world is going to end in 10 years, he said that is the point by which even if we were to freeze CO2 emissions, the positive feedback mechanisms would take over and there would be no way to prevent multi-degree warming. This warming would take much longer than 10 years, of course.



And yeah, he is not 100% sure, but no one can be 100% sure. No one knows how exactly the earth will react to temperature rises. No one knows for sure how effective the feedback mechanisms, positive or negative, will be at controlling this change.

Get real, more information that has been hidden on back pages and obscure publications is now reveling where the extra heat came from and that it is natural from geologic activity generated through plate tectonics excited by the recent planetary conjunction. As were the earthquakes and earthquake generated tsunamis of the last few years. Planetary conjunctions can be devastating geologic events.

It probably doesn't, though it might.  Global warming is more than just warming (which is why it's usually called climate change); it affects many meteorological phenomena.  Increased rain is a potential consequence.  However, a heavy rain for two days is not terribly unusual, and may be completely unrelated to climate change.

Is the Manmade Global Warming argument over now (finally)?



We are seeing record cold temperatures, and it is only October. Will Al Gore now start the manmade global cooling movement?

Sadly, it's not over, they claim that these record cold temperatures are only weather and have no effect on the global warming scenario. When in fact they do, since this all came about due to the global average temperature increasing after we came out of the little ice age. So enough record cold days would cause the global average temperature to start go down and if it happens from one year to the next that will definitely start showing the upward trend has stopped and that we are in a cooling phase.

No, far from over, more education is needed.



In brief it's Global Warming, not Local Warming. Many people hear Global Warming and think "Well why is it colder here?" when that's a local climate effect. The biggest thing about Global Warming that you may have noticed is more extreme weather of all kinds and climate change globally.

Unfortunately, it won't be over for a while.  The Warmers are going to milk this cash cow for as long as they can and rest assured that Al Gore and the "I wanna be somebody" so-called scientists (like Hansen) will find any excuse.... even in the face of global cooling... to perpetuate the hoax.  I guess they are almost forced to.... for to admit that they were wrong would trash their reputations.

A similar question was just asked a few days ago with the same Gore reference.  Just because it's cold at your house means virtually nothing to the argument for or against GLOBAL warming.  I put global in caps because you seem to think that whatever you're seeing is happening all over the world--it is not.  Where I live there has been record HOT temperatures over the past week, with temperatures in the high 90's and even exceeding 100 F sometimes.  Does that prove global warming?  Nope, and neither does whatever "record cold temperatures" you're talking about.



How many times does the difference between weather and climate need to be explained?  AGW is a theory concerning long term trends, not any one particular weather phenomenon.

Senator John McCain is making environmental news headlines again for taking a stance on climate change and distancing himself from the Bush Administration. In recent days, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate has campaigned in the Pacific Northwest touting his pro-environment commitment and agenda. McCain's commitment to fight global warming differs from current Administration policy and from many other standard-bearing Republican Party agendas.



For McCain, the cornerstone of his environmental plan mandates a "cap and trade" system. McCain argues that establishing a cap on carbon emissions and setting a national goal to reduce overall carbon emissions to 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 is a realistic, and effective way to tackle climate change. (In contrast, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have said they would set a goal to reduce overall carbon emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by mid-century.)



In McCain's analysis, establishing a national standard for tradable carbon emission permits will allow the so called "good carbon emitters" to offset the "bad" ones. Furthermore, a nationwide cap and trade system would provide the necessary incentives to promote growth of solar, wind, and other renewable energy industries. McCain does not offer specific policy or market tools for solar or wind technologies because he is confident that a cap and trade system would sufficiently bolster those and other similar renewable energy markets. Nor has McCain outlined a more detailed plan on how his cap and trade system would work or what industries and activities would be targeted.



For McCain, alternative energy means energy independence. As we've mentioned in previous posts, of the three current presidential front runners, John McCain most vocally favors reinvesting in nuclear power. He views nuclear energy as the most viable technology to meet the nation's electricity demands. In his speech he made in Oregon (and posted on his website), McCain views the nexus among energy, the environment, and national security as one of the most important issues facing our nation.



McCain's voting record, however, leaves critics dubious about his intentions and commitment toward the environment. The League of Conservation Voters who created a National Environmental Scorecard gives McCain a lifetime rating of 24 percent for his previous voting record regarding the environment. For this year's legislative session, McCain gets a Zero; thus far he's been absent for any of the environmentally related bills that have come up for a vote.



Critics point to inconsistencies in McCain's voting record. As an article in Monday's Washington Post points out, McCain has embraced some environmental provisions, yet shunted others not so seemingly different from the ones he supports.



Supporters contend that McCain, as a political maverick, has consistently distinguished himself from conventional Republicans. They cite that McCain was one of the first in Congress to acknowledge climate change and introduce legislation addressing the issue.



He's certainly savvy when it comes to renewable energy photo-ops. In February McCain stood in front of a solar photovoltaic manufacturer when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his endorsement for the Senator. On Monday, McCain restated his environmental policy at a wind power company in Oregon. Time may reveal whether these press events truly signify McCain's intentions toward renewable energy.

Obama and McCain very very similar stands.  The problem is that Obama can't stop lying so how can we trust him to keep is stand.  He's changed his tax reduction policy from people making $300,000 or more not get hit with taxes down to $150,000 in most cases and in a limited number of those making $200,000 or less not getting hit.  So now instead of 95% of the people not getting more taxes, only 75% will not get new taxes.



BTW, GW will be the biggest tax hit ever to hit US citizens.  We will pay more in taxes for GW than has ever been collect through the IRS.

The good news is that he believes that humans are causing global warming.



The bad news is that he doesn't seem to want to do much about it.



He's backed off his support of a mandatory carbon cap and now seems to oppose the idea.  He chose a VP runningmate who doesn't even believe humans are causing global warming.  He also says now that he won't enforce the Supreme's Court decision that CO2 is a pollutant that must be regulated.

The same reason why you might perhaps have asked this question:



- a lack of understanding of what the word "global" means
- a poor understanding of statistics.



Global warming DOES NOT mean the end of temperature variation. It just means an increase on the long term in the worldwide average mean temperature.

Because the media is run by wealthy liberals who believe in global warming. You haven'tt heard them say a word about how the earth is in a cooling phase now. Al Gore is the global warming pimp that has a lot of money invested in "CARBON OFFSET". He wont even admit that the earth'stemperaturess move up and down in cycles. I mean what did the cave men have SUV's when all the ice melted from the ice age? So yes there is global warming and cooling. But my Expeditiondidn'tt cause it.

Because they are trying to keep the idea alive and a lot of cold days would ruin that. I remember warm days at the end of October as a kid growing up in Minneapolis Minnesota where I was able to wear my Halloween Costume without having to bundle up. Then in later years it started to get so cold on Halloween night that we had to wear coats in 1991 we had a blizzard on Halloween.

Global warming is no longer a discussion. It is real. Climate trends show an accelaration in warming sometime after the start of the industrial revolution. These rises in temperature correspond directly to the increase in levels of C02 in the atmosphere. Yes the ice sheets did retreat after the last ice age but it took thousands of years.



With our calous burning of fossil fuels, we have caused a jump in global temperatures, whether this recent trend overlies a natural cooling or warming cycle, is yet to be seen.



I think most news papers are wrong to jump on bandwagons but in this case global warming needs all the publicity it can get.

Birdog is right, melting glaciers are not unprecedented.



For chrissake archaeologists are finding artefacts in the wake of melting glaciers.

The media has been promoting the theory of Man Made Global Warming because alarmist news sell more and because of their political agendas, among other reasons.
They have been covering up all the facts that could threaten that false theory and they're trying to hold on to anything (like a hot day) to avoid admitting the obviousness of the truth: that MAN MADE GLOBAL WARMING is just not true.

That figure you quoted is achievable with solar but it would be so very expensive.



If you estimate 100 Watts per square metre, thats 100 mega Watts per square kilometer - 1000 GW is still achievable.



This would be expensive, if you estimate $2000 per square metre cost to build this solar power station - it will cost $20 trillion dollars.  That's about $100,000 per person in the US.  The government would have to raise a lot of energy taxes to pay for that.



As much as we'd like to solve all the problems associate with using oil - who would be willing to pay 10 times as much for energy.

If wind and solar were economically viable, they would be happening today.. without governmental pump priming.  The advocates seem to assume that some technological breakthrough is out there that just needs to be discovered.  And if we throw enough research money at it, it will be found.

I think any one source of energy could do it all, but in America, it is about market share.  So each source gets to do a percentage of the total.  I read recently that nuclear plant construction in USA will commence again in 2012 or so and 2 or 3 plants per year until 2020 will be required for the nuclear industry to maintain it's alloted share.  Probably some will be closed so I don't even know if this will represent an actual gain in the number of plants or not.



I think it will be this way for at least another 100 years maybe more.  We have used about a trillion barrels of oil which is around 42 cubic miles.  There is at least that still in the ground, most likely a great deal more.  I think right now we use about one cubic mile per year.  They have caught the oil producers not telling the truth about how much they actually have many times.



I wouldn't spend much time worrying about it as I used to, just have some fun each day, play with the kids, grandkids  etc

We need a balance of nuclear here on earth and solar in space where it works better. it has been said that our current solar cells would produce 10 times the efficiency in space as they do here and making the cells in orbiting plants would eliminate the pollution making them on earth creates. but democrats like obama have prevented sensible energy solutions for over 30 years to enhance the profits of the energy companies that put them in office.

These two links to online books illustrating the real long term solution to the worlds energy and resource problems should be common knowledge to all but because those who would rule like Obama want to stay with coal or oil fired generators will not come to pass very soon it looks like. What fries me is that these solutions along with all the other non fossil ones would have been active in the early 90s except for the key leadership of the democratic party that is in the pay of the energy companies.

Wind and solar are fine when the wind is blowing and the sun is out.  I am sure you can't say one thing you love about Obama but change.  I am not so sure change toward Cuba or France is what we need.  What we need is change away from those failures.  What we need is an educated populace that doesn't vote for people on false premises.

Just a question:  are you swallowing James E's claim that we'd need an ADDITIONAL 1000 GW of new generators to run the country on electric cars?  I ask because your question is ambiguous, and his position is flat wrong.



Several years ago I calculated that all road transport fuel could be replaced using only 180 GW of average power, and that did not include any benefits from more efficient systems.  PNL found that 70% of the US vehicle fleet could be converted to PHEV using no new generators at all, just running them more of the day so the vehicles could charge at night.

I don't know about renewables.  The generating capacity is already in place.  electric cars can easily be powered at night when people are sleeping and power use is very low.  There is lots of spare capacity at that time.



Ethanol is a sham.  Coal is very polluting.  Nuclear is the way to go to generate large scale electricity with no air pollution.  Solar and wind are nice, but don't make economic sense yet on a wide scale.

wind facts.  That darling of wind energy, the Netherlands has been doing wind power for 100's of years.  It has 16 million people and it is roughly the size Maryland. soo the US is 200 times bigger but only has only 25 times more people.  Back to the Dutch. In 2005, the Dutch generated 93% of their power from BURNING fuel and their 1709 windmills only made 1.7%.



The Dutch only consume 824 watts per person but in the US we consume 11,300 watts.  Calm down.  The Dutch do not have a big manufacturing industry so thier consumption is small, where as the US has factories and industry that consume such huge quanities of energy.  If we cut back to 824 watts, the unemployment rate would exceed 35%



1000 gigawatts, wow.  a giant wind mill is rated at 3 Mw with a net of .5 Mw.  so that means you'll need 1,000,000/.5 = 2,000,000 wind miles.  you can put 20 wind mills per squar mile, so thats 100,000 square miles of land taken up.  thats the state of Oregon.



Solar:  1000 gigawatts. to get 1000 GW you will have to install 7,000 GW of PV panels. At $3/watt, thats $21 trillion dollars for the panels, the batteries to cover the lack of sunshine will cost $10 trillion, the inverter/charges  $2.5 Trillion and you will have to buy 50,000 square miles of land at $20,000/acre or another $1 trillion dollars  $33 trillion dollars or $90,000 per person (close enough to the other posters to prove him up too!)

Nuclear and space based solar are the only practical long term answers for electricity in the near and far future. By staying with coal and oil the democrats are condemning future generation to buying their power from other nations just like they have for gas and oil the last 50 years. This was the whole point of shutting down nuclear recycling so the oil and coal companies could manage the market and cheap power would never come until coal was gone and then they could market foreign power to the US just as they do foreign oil now! Got to watch these sneaky democrats very carefully or they will run off with your wallet and everything it contains.

Florida has approved plans for two new nuclear reactors, to be built at a cost of 24 Billion (with likelyhood of at least 50% cost increase) and taking at least 6 years to build.



36 billion of tax payer money, not including the decommissioning costs, to build something years away that will produce 4GW of power.

When you consider how fast the world's population and energy usage is rising, it's very difficult to see how either wind or biofuels could possibly generate what will be needed--it's something on the order of another 30 terawatts (1 terawatt = 1000 gigawatts) by 2050.  There are not nearly enough prime wind areas to generate that sort of power, and trying to do it with biofuels would require most of the world's agricultural production be diverted for that purpose.  There is enough sunlight available if solar power projects are undertaken on a massive scale. Nuclear is a doubtful solution for a couple of reasons: first, there is a limited supply of fissionable uranium, so we'd need to move to breeder reactors which encourage nuclear proliferations; and second, if each nuclear power plant were 2 GW then we'd need to build 15,000 nuclear power plants worldwide to keep up with demand.  That's about one a day, and that doesn't seem at all plausible to me.  Even your 1 terawatt requires an increase in US capacity of about 10 times what we have presently--you're just not going to be able to build them that fast.

If we captured the wind power in just 3 states located in America's "wind corridor" it would power the whole country. Now imagine every house and business in America with solar panels on their roofs. There is also geothermal, and wave power. Not only is it possible, it is essential to the SURVIVAL of everything on earth.



Nuclear power is very expensive and produces radioactive waste. Currently all spent fuel rods are stored at the facility where they were consumed, and there is no place to put it even though by law it was supposed to be out of the plants a decade ago.

Studies have shown that we could charge millions of electric cars and plug-in hybrids with no new power plants whatsoever, if we charge them mostly during off-peak hours (generally overnight).



http://gas2.org/2008/03/14/plug-in-hybri...



One way to help accomplish this is to set up a smart grid system where your charging equipment can communicate with the electrical utility to determine when those off-peak hours are, and charge up automatically during that time.  Some utilities and cities are already working on this infrastructure and putting it in place.



So the premise of your question is faulty - there's no reason why we would need an additional 1000 GW of power for EVs.



And for the record, regardless of what McCain claims, Obama does not oppose nuclear power.  He opposes refining the spent fuel, and for good reason.  For one thing this process makes nuclear power even more expensive than it already is (more expensive than some renewables like wind energy), and it also produces materials that can be used in nuclear weapons.  But in general, Obama supports nuclear power.

It was very inhabitable.... that could also be that most of the settlers were just randomly shipped there because the English royalty wanted their land.

It is good to not use as much fossil fuels for several reasons.  I doubt that CO2 in the atmosphere is even a negative.  Warmer nights, longer growing seasons and increased efficiency of photosynthesis are all very positive.  You have to distort the life cycle of a polar bear to come up with a negative unless you are neck deep in the ocean.  Then you might have a legitimate concern that the water will rise a small amount.  The doomsday cultists just sound completely stupid with unfounded predictions of doom so that isn't a valid reason to worry.

Reducing greenhouse emissions will be a consequence of developing renewable energy resources. The current energy economy is rife with problematic transfers of wealth. When energy becomes more readily available to all people, it will free mankind to move forward to our next level of achievement. Although this sounds "new agey", it is limitations in the current fossil fuel energy economy that are at the root of limiting the advance of societies. The more energy one has the higher their productivity, thus the higher their standard of living. Renewable and sustainable energy could potentially unleash the productivity limitations of billions of people (and may also increase their resource demands, and the environmental pressures associated with meeting them), and reduce the demand for costly fossil fuel energy. Reduced fossil fuel energy equates to reduced greenhouse gasses as the secondary consequence. By targeting the by-product of current energy production, greenhouse gasses, we could loose trillions of investment dollars simply fighting to keep the status quo. Our goal has to aim at WHY we emit these products and not just the gasses themselves. CO2 is not a pollutant, it is a by-product, you exhale it, your dog exhales it, your compost pile emits it, and your car emits it. Do we outlaw them all or do we address the reasons we emit them?
I believe it to be an excellent idea to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by granting billions of people access to energy and improving their lives.
Good Luck!

You are incorrect.  Global warming and climate change are two different things.



Humans are causing global warming by increasing the greenhouse effect.  Global warming causes climate change by doing things like altering precipitation patterns.



Since humans cause global warming which causes climate change, the two terms are basically interchangeable.  What we really care about is climate change, because that's what effects us the most.  But we directly cause global warming and indirectly cause climate change.

Where did this come from? Seriously, why are people saying the name has changed all of a sudden? Who changed it? When? As far as I can remember they have always used interchangeably.



There is a small difference, and that is that "climate change" is more broad--it encompasses not only rising temperatures, but all of the effects to the climate that this entails.



It is NOT because scientists were worried about cooling trends and just wanted to have a safety net by saying "oh well we didn't say it would get warmer, just that it would change." Scientists don't use playground semantics--if this were true then they would have changed the name to "temperature change."



Every one of them says it will get warmer, not cooler.

Assuming that we are causing global warming, our approach to reducing that effect would be to limit the availablility to our citizens or residents of fossil fuels. This would logically involve restricting importation and extraction of fossil fuels.



Now this means that we would have prices for fossil fuels or taxes on those fuels to rise to the point that people reduce their consumption, or some form of rationing would have to be used to limit consumption. The rationing might be very cumbersome for those who provide services that require fuels, such as the transportation industry. It might reasonably be expected to curb some use of transportation.



People might sell their rations, or  keep them to pass them to  someone growing their food, transporting their goods.



But mostly, if we have the fuel available to burn, we will cut our consumption just a little bit before prices fall and we resume consumption levels.



Exporting countries can do most, by restricting the  amount of fosil fuels they export. Reducing exports in tons of course may not reduce the dollar value of exports. So the net effect is that this will be almost painless to exporting countries.

There are so many answers to this question! For a start, if this is the USA we're talking about, ratifying the Kyoto protocol might help. Governmental policies to cut emissions, it's really not that hard as plenty of other countries have managed it just fine.... investing in sustainable, clean technology (better in the long run even if global warming isn't caused by CO2 - at least they won't run out).... measures to counter the effects of fossil fuel burning, such as carbon capture, afforestation, etc. Oh and finally, most importantly, trying to reduce your own environmental impact. Energy saving appliances, buying local produce, energy efficient vehicles - all of these things save money too.



The list is practically endless. Putting it into practice seems to be the hard part.

I assume you're talking about his idea of a massive and abrupt sea level rise.



The ice there is sufficient volume for a 30 foot rise in sea level, you cannot argue with that. And the simple truth is we have very little understanding of how these glaciers work.



It is possible...not based on computer models or abstract ice core data, just basic physics, that this ice could collapse into the sea. Not all at once of course, but possibly over the course of a few years.



Currently the ice is melting on the surface in certain places. When this happens it forms small rivers, which flow into cracks in the ice. This water then goes underneath the glacier, creating a lubricant between the glacier and the rock below. This accelerates the glacier's movement.



Now, imagine such a flowing glacier (yes, they do flow, just slower than water) that is impeded by stationary ice immediately in front of it. The pressure can build and build, until eventually it becomes so great (or the ice dam becomes so weakened by warming) that it collapses. This happens every day on a small scale, it could happen on a larger one.



Do I think it is likely all of Greenland will melt in a very short time? Not very. Do I think it would be the single most destructive event in all of humanity if it did happen? Absolutely. People complain about the costs of reducing GHG emissions, I wonder how those numbers would compare to rebuilding giant coastal cities like New York, Miami, Shanghai, Sydney, etc etc.

Most of us don't expel nearly as much as we breath out.  There are about 1/3 of people who emit methane which has much greater absorbency of IR but the short half life pretty much makes it equivalent to CO2.  All of the output of humans will only raise the temperature less than a degree.  I suppose that human flatulence might account for about .001 degrees if you consider that to be contributing.

it was part of the CO2 that the plant took in to create the plant material.



the "global warming CO2" is the co2 that's now in the atmosphere, but has not been for millions of years.  plants today are not adjusted to absorbing that extra amount of CO2, so it stays in the atmosphere and warms the planet.

Dangit. Bravo got to it before I did, but, yes, our gas makes up a negligible amount of greenhouse gases being produced, and is dwarfed by the amount that cattle and other livestock put out.

The issue around global warming is the adding of co2 to the atmosphere from underground reserves of co2 that had been stored underground. Breathing out co2 or farting does not "add" additional co2 or methane to the atmosphere, it merely recycles it, part of a natural process.

Current Global Cooling trend: who is tired of hearing "there is a difference between weather and climate"?



Every evidence of decreasing temperatures is followed by that comment: "you don't get the difference between weather and climate".



NASA says:
"Some scientists define climate as the average weather for a particular region and time period, usually taken over 30-years. It's really an average pattern of weather for a particular region."
http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/noaa-n...



Does that mean we need to wait 30 years until they officially admit that there is a Global Cooling trend ?



Does that also imply what they could get away with that alleged "Man Man Global Warming" theory for 30 more years?

Climate does not equal local weather.  We can have wacky weather in my neighborhood for a decade:  that will neither prove nor disprove global warming.  Understanding climate change requires looking at everything that is happening.  For example, the past two years we have had a strong La Nina effect which causes cold sea water to be stirred to the surface and cools the atmosphere, thus explaining the cooling trend within a larger scenario of warming.  What that means is that the ocean has warmed more while the atmosphere has cooled.  When we get an El Nino we will see increased warming of the atmosphere.

when the local weather in the arctic area warms up a little & melts some ice that's called proof of global warming.(were all gonna die & we deserve it)
but when during the same time period the antarctic gets colder  & the permanent land ice gets thicker causing more ice to be pushed into the ocean where large  large floating chunks break off that's called just local weather.
when the average temperature of the whole earth stays the same for 5 or 10 years that's called climate change.(were all gonna die & we deserve it)
whether it warms,cools or stays the same it's all bad & its all your fault.
the only solution is for you to shut down all industry & personal transportation, grow your own food, turn off your lights & heating system then sit around & shiver in the dark until you die.
or you could invent a time machine so you can go back & vote al gore in as president. then all these normal weather variations would be considered just routine weather  instead of global calamities.

If you deniers would learn the difference then you wouldn't have to keep hearing about it.



Seriously, when somebody says "here in Podunk, Alabama we just had a record cold day, so global warming is bunk" what do you expect us to say?  "Oh yeah a cold day, I guess you're right, global warming has stopped"?



If you want to argue that global warming has stopped, you have to prove it statistically.  With global climate data, not random local weather.  For example, if there are 2 years in the blue area before there are 2 years in the pink.

It must be man, its not like the poles have ever melted before naturally is it! Does man now control the ocean currents and the wind? Do we cause the antarctics growing ice mass and cooling?



I am sorry but what evidence do they present? They used computer models, they do not count as evidence in science, especially when they are un-validated. All they did is create a graph that roughly fits the temperature record based on a load of assumptions and fudge factors, I could do that with a pack of crayons for half the cost.



So humans caused the record ice levels in the antarctic and its continued cooling and also the recent speedy recovery of the arctic this winter? I thought man was suposed to cause warming



This study contradicts data showing warm ocean water being pushed into the arctic and wind changes and the fact the ice melted from below seems to be ignored (Polyakov, 2006, 2007, 2008, IARC, Akansofu, 2008), and then there are the peer reviewed papers that state it was a natural effect and lets not forget that the same melting event occured in the 1930's but at a faster rate (Chylekm et al., 2007, Akansofu, 2008). Oh and the sea is cooling in that area, as is most the antarctic.



Also see Stroeve et. al., 2007 and DeWeaver, 2007 for a demonstration that warming from co2 predicted by GCM's alone can not acount for the low ice in the arctic in 2007.



See the relevent peer reviewed papers below which contradict the above study or highlight the issues associated with the accuracy of GCM's.



This is evidence of nothing, only an alternative theory based on a less scientific approach.

you are right about the global warming being caused by human activity, man are the only one smart enough to build factories that gives out too much carbon dioxide so now we end up with a hotter and soon it will be really hard to live without intense heat and some species dying to dead. Global warming/ Climate Crisis effects started on the late 1990's when the temperature started going up and up and up over the years. Scientist are realizing this and telling the world what will happen if we keep this up soon, there won't be a world to live in.

Does anyone understand what this means?



The Sun’s affect on global warming can mostly be attributed to variations in the near-infrared and visible wavelengths of solar radiation. As previously stated, these types of radiation are absorbed by the lower atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. UV radiation, on the other hand, interacts strongly with the ozone layer and the upper atmosphere. Though UV solar radiation makes up a much smaller portion of the TSI than infrared or visible radiation, UV solar radiation tends to change much more dramatically over the course of solar cycles.

where did you read it?  what's the context?



there are 2 things here.



1.  during the sun's 11 year cycle, there change in output is higher at UV frequency than at visible and infrared frequency.  that is, when there are lots of sun spots, UV output increases more than visible or infrared output.



2.  UV radiation interacts with the upper atmosphere more than visible and infrared radiation does.  visible and infrared interact more with the surface of the earth, and with the lower atmosphere than UV does.



the implication is that the relative heating that's associated with the sun's cycle should affect the upper atmosphere more, to some degree, than the surface of the earth.

Infrared and ultra violet rays bring most of the heat (energy) from the sun.
The Ultra violet is not visible to us but can blind us and animals.
The Infrared heats up the surface of the earth including the oceans.
There is nothing that can be done to stop the heat from coming.
The Earth also emits heat, depending on its temperature, in the desert you feel heat from the ground.
The problem is that we now have gases in the atmosphere that reflect the radiation FROM the Earth back to the earth and that is the source of Global Warming.
The gases that keep the earth temperature increasing include Carbon Dioxide CO2, produced by burning Carbon fuel in Oxygen from the atmosphere.



Our present Global Warming is not like that in the beginning of time when the earth was all molten lava. The recent Global Warming started in 1850 with the Industrial Revolution with Coal burning and later by Oil and Natural gas burning.



At first the ocean and vegetation, including forests, absorbed most of the CO2 but in 2006 the oceans reached the maximum capacity to hold CO2, they were "CO2 saturated".



More recently, the vegatation that absorbed CO2, buried the Carbon and emitted the Oxygen back into the air no longer does as much.
The increased temperature makes land dry and fires more likely which make land drier and fires even more likely, and so on.
In a few years, according to some, due to increaing forest fires, vegetation will also be a net producer of CO2, instead of burying the Carbon in the ground (that was how coal and oil fields were made).
After that, we are in a %

The total solar irradiance (TSI) consists of all light emitted by the sun. The light from the sun that affects heating is mostly restricted to visible light and some infrared light that is close in frequency to visible light.  The light varies far more in higher energy UV light but that gets largely absorbed by the ozone layer and doesn't affect global temperatures.



The reason light and near IR light affect temperature is because it penetrates the atmosphere and is emitted as thermal IR or heat.  Some bands of that radiation are absorbed by CO2 and other much more prominent greenhouse gases like water.  UV fortunately doesn't get through as well or we would all have much darker skin or more skin cancer.

We can speculate how the sun's cycles cause warming...



During times of significant sunspots the energy reflected back to the earth can be measured. Ask any radio guy about short-wave signals and sunspots.



The amount of radio-wave energy reflected back to earth is VERY predictable, and there are computer programs out there where you can enter the sunspot number, the time of day, where you are, and where you wish to communicate to, and the program will recommend a frequency range to use for that communication.



Here's a list of propagation prediction software packages:



http://www.dxzone.com/catalog/Software/P...



Another thing suggested by a LACK of sunspots is that cosmic rays (yeah, I know it sounds far-fetched) have a lot to do with cloud formation. The theory goes that when there are a lot of sunspots, there is a lot of "solar wind" which prevents cosmic rays from entering the earth's atmosphere in the same amount they usually would, meaning fewer low clouds, and more heat on the surface of the earth.



How well do these theories work?  We don't really know, because we haven't had sophisticated measuring technology around for enough solar cycles to figure it out.



As  the sun appears to be entering a relatively dormant phase for sunspots, we'll see if the predictions of those who link global temperatures to sunspots are correct. If they are correct, the earth will get considerably colder very soon. If the sunspot cycle picks up, we'll have to wait to test the theory.



We do have information on numbers of sunspots, and general climate information, and for big moves, the sunspots and temperature relationship is not deniable.

I think some of the people on here forget that this is about Global Average temperatures so the more cold days we have in places that are usually warm will cause the global mean temperature to drop. This year will be significantly colder than last year and from other indicators this is only the beginning of a cooling trend.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Good answers all, but I think this one is best because it does the best job of answering the question... When the new cooler temperatures are averaged in, lower temperatures over all will indicate a cooling trend.

I KNOW it's record cold in Florida. It was FREEZING today, and it's not even Halloween. This is usually how cold it is in the winter, but it's not even the middle of fall and we have our winter weather?



It's only been this cold in Florida a couple of times that I could remember.



Global warming needs to hurry up, because I'm tired of wearing three longsleeved shirts, jeans, and a big puffy winter jacket.

You didn't get the memo?



Any climate change is now man's fault, not just global warming.  They started renaming it "Climate Change" instead of global warming a couple of years ago when they realized the earth wasn't warming any longer.



All of what you mention will now be blamed on man made "Climate Change."



To DANA1981 - You are what's wrong with the movement.  First, you demonize the opposition, and then you fail to see what the science is telling you.  Look at the chart you linked to.  The world stopped warming as of 1998!  Besides which, whenever we used to get a blistery hot day, or any single weather event like Katrina, you guys were the ones always blaming these weather events on global warming.  Now it's our turn!

You forgot to add the recent warming trend attributed to man actually mirrors the Modern Maximum (a level of high solar activity unseen in over a thousand years) and how the abnormally cold weather today matches what appears to be the end of the Modern Maximum.  Who would've figured the Sun warms the planet??

Makes you wish that the theory of global warming were true.  It is comforting to know that humans can control climate.  If this is the start of another little ice age due to low sun activity, then we are due for some hard times, and there is nothing we can do about it.



Edit:  From NOAA.  Yesterday 86 new cold records were set and 33 were tied.

Global warming is a load of crap! and consider people like you and me dangerous to their THEORIES(thats right THEORIES NOT FACT). Take a stand and let them know that they can't tell us to change our life styles because of some kind of anthropogenic sudden reversable apocalypse they pulled out of nowhere!

They want you to believe one tiny tidbit of circumstantial evidence of warming - the 1 degree F increase in temperature over more than a century - despite zero evidence of human causation of that blip, but not the evidence you cite.

It does not appear that this winter will rescue 2008 globally averaged temperatures from being alarmingly below average. If anything they will add to the reality that the planet is well into in a natural cooling cycle, but the consensus will continue to label it as weather.

This winter it snowed 4 times were I live, it had only snowed here twice before over the last 50 years, so it has been colder then usual, we also had record snows in the mountains.



I went camping in the mountains the other day and it was 2 degrees and snowing on saturday, which is very odd for this time of year. But it has also been 26 degrees in between the recent cold snaps!



I went mountaineering on Sunday and it was 2 degrees c and snowing at the start (around 10pm), by 3pm the skies were clear and even at 2400m sat on a glacier it was roasting, I ended up sunburnt as I wasnt expecting it! The weather has definetly been random lately.



They had snow in London the other day aswell which is very rare, especially this time of year.



However, you need to remember that single events or a single cool year do not prove or disprove the thoery of AGW. It merely highlights that the climate changes and it is chaotic in nature.



Climate scientists have explained the recent un-seasonal and random weather here as the result of a natural transition between a La Nina and El Nino phase. I will have to take their word for it.

I agree, it's cold as ice here in Gainesville. But a .8 degree increase doesn't quite mean it is impossible to be cold, does it?



It is just a cold front people. If it is extremely cold in the North, then extremely cold + 0.8 degrees = still extremely cold. If air masses get sent south to the southern US, then it will be extremely cold there too.



Global warming doesn't mean we are all going to be boiling hot. Cold places are still cold.

You're joking, right?  Please tell me you're joking.



Are deniers ever going to learn the difference between weather and climate?



I don't care how many cities you pick out that had cold days.  It's still weather!



You know how much evidence it takes to prove global warming has stopped?  It takes just one piece - for the average global temperature trend to stop increasing!
