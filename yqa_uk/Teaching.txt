Graduatorie III fascia 07/08?



sono inserita nelle graduatorie di 3 fascia x l'a.s. 07/08 ma delle 20 scuole solo una ha pubblicato la graduatoria su internet, vorrei sapere se esiste un modo per vedere le graduatorie delle varie scuole, sul sito dell'istruzione posso vedere la mia posizione ma non i nomi di chi mi precede, cosa dovrei fare? chiamare le scuole e farmeli leggere, mi sembra un po' eccessivo...altri modi...?



</question>



<additional details>



x tatta19: x inserirti nelle grauatorie devi aspettare l'anno prossimo, se vuoi sapere il perchè guarda su answer trovi la risposta. le fascie 1 e 2 non ho ancora capito come funzionano

Purtroppo se vuoi sapere la tua posizione nella graduatoria d'istituto di ogni scuola ti tocca fare il giro delle 7 chiese e recarti in ogni scuola per vedere la graduatoria di presenza!

L'unico modo per visualizzare le graduatorie purtroppo è recarsi presso le singole scuole.

Per Tatta 19: la prima fascia comprende gli abilitati inclusi nelle graduatorie ad esaurimento, la seconda gli abilitati non inseriti nelle graduatorie ad esaurimento, la terza i non abilitati.

Ciao!

per visualizzare la tua posizione non serve fare il giro delle scuole, basta andare su istruzione.it &gt; indice &gt; G &gt; graduatorie di istituto &gt; visualizzazione posizione.

E' necessario iscriversi immettendo il codice fiscale, ti verrà poi assegnata una password per usufruire del servizio.

Per chi non lo sapesse, le graduatorie di I fascia sono riservate agli abilitati.

In bocca al lupo!

PS: se vuoi avere più chances aggiungi la disponibilità al sostegno, ormai anche la terza fascia non da più lavoro a nessuno.

Ciao a tutti...allora vorrei essere più specifica riguardo le domande sia come colalboratore scolastico sia come assistente amministrativo per l'inserimnto nella 3 fascia. la 3 fascia comprende tutte quell epersone che hanno o un titolo di studio(diploma di scuola media superiore) o chi ha effettuato almeno 30 giorni di servizio anche saltuari.
quindi possono farla solo persone con questi requisiti. Per quanto riguarda la 1 fascia, comprende tutte le persone che hanno almeno 24 mesi di servizio. Le domande scadono il 31 luglio sono un pò complicate da compilare, non si dovrebbe sbagliare neanche una virgola, altrimenti vengono depennate cmq vi do il sito dove potete trovare sia il bando, che è costituito da 12 pagine, sia i codici scolastici da dover inserire nella domanda per ogni provincia. saluti a tutti spero di esservi stata utile. copiate questo lik e troverete il basso evidenziato il blu MODELLO D PER LA PRESENTAZIONE DELLA DOMANDA, scaricate l'allegato PS il sito per vedere le graduatorie è www.pubblica.istruzione.it ci si deve registrare con il C.F. ma a e non fa entrare...bha...vedete un pò voi

Yep-my music teacher. He just took a dislike to me and i never knew why.

During an instrument lesson the bell for lunch went, I went to pack up as my lesson had ended and he said I couldnt go till I had done more scales and then he said i was "****"! So I stormed out the room and told my head of year.

Later in the month I was in a group lesson and he stepped out the room-i went to piano to grab another blank score sheet-he came in room adn shouted at me-i was standing next to his diary and he accused me of reading his private book and sent me out the room! I never even noticed the thing was there.

I complained again-few weeks later he left to teach at another school much to my relief--but i stopped enjoying music after that!

All dialects of English are equally good. Socially the other dialects are stegmatised and thought of as 'bad' . what psychological effects does that have on children with different background dialects ? then is it fair to grade them solely on thier grammar rather than the ideas ?

TEFL stands for Teaching English as a Foreign Language and it would take me to various places around the world to teach either adults or children English. A TEFL Qualification is an Internationally recognised and serious qualification.

I heard that there was a free TEFL course in Cambridge. 
I am a CELTA qualified EFL teacher and I paid for the course myself, as did every other teacher I have met, so it may not be that easy I'm afraid.
A good course should cost between £800-1100. You could ask the college about any payment plans they might have.
Avoid online tefl courses at all costs. they are a complete waste of time. employers want evidence of classroom experience, which you can only get with a proper course.

Thank you all for your advice and help. I'm currently in Telford, Shropshire, UK and have applied to attend a College in Chichester, West Sussex UK. I'm going to give this the best shot I can but it all depends on if I get accepted onto the course. Have a good day everyone :-)

Not sure of your location. I can inform you of one fact; if you are located  in the UK you may be entitled to concessionary fees on a CELTA course. You may want to look into that area.

It's highly unlikely you'd receive funding for a TEFL course unfortunately.  I had to scrimp and save for my course which I ended up doing at a language school in Barcelona.  If you can't get any funding though, do take the course because it is really rewarding; you'll meet some really interesting people and gain some invaluable experience of both teaching and different cultures.

Just make sure your proffessional but not boring.

Also make sure whomever your speaking understands that you know that you are capable of the job.

This may sound unneeded, but when your talking to them, look them dead in the eye, and be aware of your body language and image.

“Than” is the word you want when doing comparisons. But if you are talking about time, choose “then“: “First you separate the eggs; then you beat the whites.” Alexis is smarter than I, not “then I."



examples:
than:
~He is taller than I am.
~Other than the interest on a small inheritance, he had no income.
~Today's students certainly do seem to read less than students in previous generations did.
~We learned more on the playground than we did in the classroom.
~Despite their lack of flavor, the hothouse tomatoes cost far more than those from the farmers' market.

then: 
~I took all of the exams in the morning, and then I spent the rest of the day catching up on sleep.
~Back then we knew what was expected of us.
~I bought apples from this orchard last summer, but I seem to remember paying more for them then.
~Look over the study guide first, and then if you still have questions bring them up in class.

"then" relates to the order of events, as in:

First we'll get on the bus, THEN we will ride the bus to the train station.

Mary thought she'd lost her bus token, but THEN she found it when I reminded her it that it was in her pocket.



"than" compares between two things:

The bus ride to the train station will be much shorter THAN the train ride to San Diego.

I'd rather ride the train THAN drive there in my car.

Then means, "at that time".  It can be used for time sequences ("I went to the store, and then I baked a cake.") or to refer to a specific time, ("I want to visit her, but I can't go then.").

Than is used to make comparisons.  Some examples might be:
"This book is longer than that one."
"Joe is taller than Steve."
"I would rather have Ms. Sanchez as a teacher because I find her easier to understand than Ms. Jones."

Where can I find help with Further Maths A Level?



I'm stuck on the mechanics part already, and have looked on BBC Bitesize for revision notes but they don't have any for A Level. I've also looked on other revision sites, but can't find a further maths section. Does anyone know where I can find help?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



As a fellow further mathematician, I would say the best way to improve your Mechanics work is to keep doing questions and practice papers.

When we first started Mechanics, I didn't have a clue what was going on. But once I got my head around the basic principles and did LOADS of exercises, I became really good at it!

I've been through this - teachers do like to pick on people just to see if they really are paying attention, or you could be right in thinking that he asks you because he knows you know the answer. If you feel he's picking on you diliberatley, why not have a quiet word with him in private and tell him you feel a bit intimidated by the fact he's always picking you?

How do you get over the bureaucracy?



I just experienced a transfer to another school in my district, where my curriculum, materials, and resources are drastically fewer than at my first site. I don't have a classroom (I did at my first site).

I'm having a hard time adjusting. It's only been a few days but I don't want my unhappiness about the situation affect my new students. I can't help but feel sorry for myself, especially since traveling makes me feel like a student teacher and that's not a fun feeling.

How do you get over the random acts of DO? How long does it take?

It really depends what the intervention is about - phonics, sentence structure, speed of reading/writing etc and that would obviously dictate what tests you use.

Normally you do the same test at the beginning and end of the intervention.  In our school you select the children by testing them first - to see if the intervention is right for them...if you havent got a testing system to begin with...how do you know you have selected the right children for the intervention?  I know this bits not really an answer but it might be something that'll help.

I would suggest using one of the standardised tests (SATs) for the relevant year group. This would enable you to look at overall performance increase (as a National Curriculum Level). In addition, when you mark the papers, you give marks for handwriting, composition, spelling, sentence structure, and different comprehension skills (e.g. reading information, summarising, deducting, inferring etc).

This would enable you to compare the different interventions as in do some interventions help with spelling, but not the rest? Do some interventions lead to children's reading improving but not their writing?



Don't forget you would need a comparison group who receive no particular intervention in order to determine how much progress is made just through normal teaching and the children maturing.

You just read it from the board, that generally makes it seem unprofessional and poor. The board is meant to summarise what you're saying.

on the board just put key words and maybe a picture to keep their attention, then you have on your card what you want to say. or better yet u also have key words so you talk more freely than just reading off a card.

i made the same mistake on my 1st presentation! but dont worry, everything you did wrong this time, dont do the next, and already, by your second presentation you will already look way better!

atleast now the only way is up!

The most important lesson I have ever learned is that life can be very short. If we spend too much time dwelling on the past, whether it be mistakes, regrets, death, etc. We lose precious time in the present and future. Live everyday to its fullest potential. Appreciate even the smallest gestures.

I guess meetings with parents. It is particularly aggravating when you have to face a parent who comes up to you with a know-it-all attitude and more or less assumes the right to judge you as a teacher, often lacking the necessary information about you. I also hate when parents trust what their kids tell them about what is going on in class rather than us teachers. Sure we make mistakes but it is really disappointing when faced with a mother who had no idea what was going in class because she was a working mother for most of the day and she thought that her children were doing fine til she saw their grades. Last but not least, students who put zero effort in class work and individual work and are pretty much absent in most of your classes. I really feel bad for them when I have to meet with their parents. I actually feel guilty towards these parents and I really should not be.

I teach high school Technology Education.  The most stressful part of my job is when students begin using machines.  Until months of using the machines have passed and I know the students are using them safely, it is very stressful.  The machines can cause serious injury if students arent doing what they are supposed to.  The stress of watching them learn is almost enough to drive someone crazy.  Think about 14-18 year olds using equipment with no room for error.

Uncontrollable laughter--what will my teacher think?



I've been feeling really dull and bored lately. Dead sort of. But today, when my philosophy teacher was talking about the Buddha, I started laughing out loud. And no one else did. And I sit in the front row. I don't think he intended to be funny, but I was just so damn giggly. What do you think he thought of this? And why did this occur, especially since I feel so dead?
It's like I couldn't stop, and I had to really try hard not to laugh.

Sometimes you just have to.  I've had urges to laugh at weird moments too, downright insensitive moments even.  I don't know.... I go like 7 months without laughing much, and suddenly something that's not even that funny, but mildly funny will happen, and I'll crack up like Jesus himself cracked a joke.  It's weird.  But it happens.

It depends on whether you were sitting alone or with friends.  If you were with friends, perhaps he thought one of you had made a joke and only you were unable to control your laughter.  If you were alone, he probably either thought you were extremely rude and laughing at him, or that you were crazy.

well not many people in my class enjoy re but lots of lessons outside make them a lot nicer and resposible actually.
and activities that are fun and dont always require work, although you do have to give them work  :)
and they really enjoy singing and learning about hymns, i think becuase it doesnt requie much work on their behalf and it is fun but it does work a lot better than trying to get them to work when its last period and their all tired and dont listen to whatever you saying!

Does anybody know of a Geoffrey Heath, last known to live in Blackpool and is a retired teacher. Now aged 78. ?



Sister called Barbara nee Heath (dont know married name). Anyone who may know anything regarding their whereabouts, I would appreciate your help. I am trying to find them for a friend. He is their cousin living in australia is 77 (Russell Heath) and would love to regain contact

</answer from>



<answer>



Have you tried www.192.com to see if he has a listed phone number?
There isn't a Geoffrey Heath on the Blackpool Electoral Roll, although I've found 47 around the UK, with varying second initials.
The other possibility for your search would be a letter to the Blackpool local newspaper, addressed to The Readers' Letters Column asking the same question above.  Our local rag has similar letters on a regular basis and they appear to be very successful judging by the "thank-you" responses a couple of weeks later.
Just Google "Blackpool newspaper" for address details.
If his cousin has Geoffrey's last known address, he could try sending letters to other numbers in that road.  I'm still in touch (birthdays and Christmas time) with several people who lived locally and have now moved away.

I think that to achieve what they have needs tremendous dedication. They have got to enjoy it, or they would not achieve what they do with these kids. They truly do seem to love my son and I beleive them. Im sure they dread some days at work dont we all they are human after all. But these kids are lovely kids no different from any other kids really and ALL kids can be difficult at times. But not so difficult as adults. Im sure their colleagues (and some parents) cause more problems than the kids.

I only teach kids with learning difficulties and usually enjoy it very much. It's very difficult lately, but over the past several years I've enjoyed it immensely. Some are incredibly endearing personalities that are entitled to the same chances as everyone else. Some can be awful and the same goes for any classroom in every school.



If you're worried that your teachers aren't enjoying teaching you, please don't worry! If they seem a little less enthusiastic some days it's only because they have ups and downs like you too. If you say something nice to a teacher you like, watch their face light up.

I work with primary children with autisim, delayed development and also some with major behaviour problems. Yes these children can be difficult and some days you just want to scream but the satisfaction that you get when you watch a childs face when they have finally achieved something that they have taken ages to master can never be replaced and somehow makes it worth all the tantrums and dodging the missiles on the the way to the end result. I have worked with adults/children with learning disabilities for the last 15 years and couldn't see myself doing anything else. Its hard work but very rewarding.

Teaching young people is very rewarding in every way. I have been teaching for a long time now and I can confidently tell you that every child is unique in behavior and character. A 'real' teacher is out there to help, support and direct young people in their care irrespective of their behavior. However, there are some difficulties in teaching ADHD students but on the other hand, there is a creativity skills in these students, a creativity that needs and awaits nurturing. So rather than getting frustrated, try to focus on the creativity side of these students. For more information on nurturing creativity in our young stars, visit www.lifetimedesire.com

You can do a degree in French, that would probably be your best option actually.

After your degree,you will need to do a primary PGCE, which lasts 1 year, this enables you to become a primary teacher as it gives you QTS (qualified teaching status).

You could also look into doing a BEd, this is a 4 year course. 
However, it isn't recommended unless you are 10000% you want to go into teaching.

you need to do a primary BEd with QTS or a undergrad degree and a one year PGCE after that

im studying to become a teacher, and trust me, unike the 1st poster seems to think, you need more than a GCSE in english!

good luck!

Oh my god...it's comments like this that can/will get the teacher in trouble. Please stop being vain and think of how this can effect other people.

Your teacher doesn't fancie you. They are teaching and watching the class work....like they're meant to as they are the authoritative figure in that room and have to do their job. Stop being silly and concentrate on your work!

You may not think you're pretty, but he might. Everyone has different views of beauty. Have any of your friends noticed him looking at you a lot? It could be that you're a bit worried about him so imagining it's happening more than it really is. Try to ignore it, and if he starts acting innapropriate tell someone straight away.

I am a teacher and I try to look at all my students...but ---and I remember this as a student for a few (way too many) years that it is possible that you remind that teacher of someone he knew along time ago.

I had a student that worried me-so very introverted that I tried to give them special attention-probably not what they wanted, but I probably focused on them more.

I have had students ask me "why are you looking at me?" and I say...it's what I do".



But who really knows unless you tell him it makes you uncomfortable (does it make you uncomfortable?)



I reminded my 5th grade teacher of her granddaughter and she always gave me extra attention because of it.

maybe you had something on your face?  =D 
Im not being funny but its highly unlikely he would fancy you, hes just being a teacher maybe theres a reason why hes observing you - to see your progress in the class perhaps, or to see if your understanding the work hes probably just looking out for you. i doubt he fancies you.
anyways just dont worry about it. im sure hes not perving or anything.

show you know about the children you are wanting to teach- what tests they have done, what kind of level they will be at any knowledge of the curriculum will help.
treat it like any job interview find out as much about it as you can.
 i dont know about america but england is really big on phonetics at the minute and treating each child as an individual.

example questions: why do you want the job- put in curriculam knowledge aswell as saying you like kids i.e. i love kids and want to help them make the most of their potentiel in the blah blah blah tests.

what qualities do you bring to the job?- i have had experience yada yada this has taught me to be yada yada

what is the most important quality in a teacher?
i think patience becuase yada yada

can you think of a time you have had to keep a situation under control?

have you ever had to organise a lot of people?

how will you cope with a class full of children?

i dont know if its the same in america

You would need to have a degree in the subject area if your teaching at a secondary school and then you would need to have done a PGCE which will make u a qualified teacher. If you want to teach primary school kids i belive you have to do teaching degree of soem sort and a PGCE

Hi
You need to have GCSE English and Maths C or above.  Then you need a degree.  Post degree you can do a PGCE, or many places now offer GTP - a graduate teacher programme - where you work in schools while qualifying as a teacher.  You don't need a B Ed. to teach, go to Uni and get a degree in something you are interested in, then progress into a teaching qualificatin.
Good Luck

How to become a teacher? (UK)?



I'm about to start a degree in Law and Sociology. I want to teach Law. But at a college and then progress onto university lecturing. What do I need to do? What should I expect to earn? How do I get to become a uni lecturer? Do I have to teach at college beforehand?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You can teach in Colleges with a good degree. To be a Uni lecturer requires at least a Masters and usually a Doctorate. Salaries vary and are reliant on research you seek to carry out whilst employed by them. Lecturers are academics and continually releasing papers on their topic of expertise.

Why not wait a while and get advice from your School Office at Uni? If you ask one of your lecturers I'm sure they'll give much better/accurate advice than any number of Y!A guys (including me). When I was at Uni, Law was incredibly difficult, time consuming and had a high drop-out rate. Good luck!
