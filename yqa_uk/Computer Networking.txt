Network engineers or Network administrators ...?



hi all,



Is anyone out there who is a network admin or network engineer who only works with networking like routers, switches, firewalls, accesspoint, protocols, lan, wan connections??? Is it fun working with them everyday??? what is the daily responsibilites like? i am only talking about cisco networking side, not microsoft where we have to work with servers like exchange, print, file and all that. please answer. thank u.

<answer>



It can be fun, and it can be hours or days of wondering why you didn't go to chef's school instead. It really depends on your role in the network world. Are you behind the scenes working in a lab, mocking up scenarios to prove that they work, or are you a phone jockey forced to listen to customers complain about the same thing day after day?



Chances are most people will start out in the second category, but as you progress you get more latitude to do the more interesting things, such as figuring out why your customer's BGP route isn't being advertised to your upstream provider, or why FTP fails only through certain paths.



Yes, it can be a lot of fun, but don't snub the server side of things completely. The better you understand how the popular server applications work, the more useful you will be as a network admin.

What is a good wlan card that works with Ubuntu 8.04?



Ideally, the card should already support the latest WLAN protocol (N?). It should work out of the box without ndiswrapper and support WPA2 encryption. PCI would be preferred, but USB would be OK, too.

Who do you have as an internet provider? I have AT&T and they have a help center that allow an automatic cleanup/out of system to speed up internet and browser. I called them b4 I downloaded the help center for future use. The put me to the tools box and cleaned out a build up of information that slowed my computer down. They told me that over time (which this computer has only been running on internet for 5 months) from webmail and surfing that your computer picks up programs and stores them automatically. They said this will slow your internet and browser down.

Change MAC address on MacBook Pro 10.5.4 or 10.5.5?



I would like to know how to change my MAC address on my MacBook Pro. Please, no comments about how you can't do it; it's possible. Things I've tried:
1) Terminal (sudo ifconfig en1 ether/lladdr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, etc. tried EVERYTHING)
2)A Couple programs, but they seem to be outdated. I seem to be missing the AppleAirport2.Kext file that these programs used.
Any links to programs or advice would be much appreciated.



</question>



<additional details>



I know about the built in address. The software address used by the nic drivers is a different story. The problem with what I'm doing at the moment is that the command will run properly in terminal but the mac address always shows the same when I do an ifconfig  -a. Super annoying.

Ways of sending digital signals over some sort of medium.  A way of representing 1's and 0's electrically, optically, or through RF waves.  Computers use this to communicate on the most basic physical layer.

Completely agree with LrT, but just in case you were looking for something else:  Digital signaling is to be compared with analog signaling. You could compare the gasoline guage on a car. In one car the guage is a needle that is positioned somewhere between Full and Empty (analog). In another, you might see a series of lights - say 5 lights means full, and 0 lights means empty. As the tank gets emptier, a light goes off, and another and another, until all of the lights are off to indicate an empty tank (digital).



Electricity, light, sound, and radio waves are all analog by nature. Since computers talk to each other through 0s and 1s, there has to be a way to translate the analog signal into a digital signal.



Going back to the gas tank analogy, the gas tank itself hasn't changed. Neither has the gasoline in it. The only thing that has changed is the way the car designer chose to represent the amount of gas in the tank.



So when a computer talks to another computer over a copper wire, the computer sends a 1 or a 0 from it's memory bank to a translator device that changes the 0 or 1 into a pulse of electricity. At the receiving end, the other computer receives this pulse, runs it through its own translator, and changes it back into a 0 or 1.

If you are using internet explorer, try clicking the tools tab on the right corner of your browser and click internet options.  Go to the security tab and click Custom Level.  Scroll down to Run ActiveX controls and Plugins and click enable.



If this doesn't work try reinstalling IE, or try installing Safari which is a Mac browser but it will work on your PC (Assuming that you have a PC).  If you're using firefox, you may have to download something for these controls but it should prompt you to do so.

Internet with my USB modem is so sloooow?



I've recently got a  new laptop and a USB modem stick to go with it (on 3) as I'll be living in a young people's hostel for the next few months. The internet is so slow with it!  For example, it will bring up something like google really quickly but takes ages for the YA home page to load.



Is there anything I can do to improve this? Does my location make a difference.  Any info would be much appreciated!

It sounds like you have a modem using the cell phone network. Check that where youre using it, your not getting 3G signal and susequently going down to dialup speeds, about 64 k. Try it in a known good area and see if the speed is better.

The web site will also affect the speed. Some web site like Y/A are very busy when many people sign in. So the speed will become very slow. However, if other web site is OK, it mean that your USB modem and internet connection do not have any problem.



The signal of the wireless connection will also affect the internet speed.
That is why it is better to use fixed line when you are in door.

Ip config error message..why?!?



Hi.
I built a computer from scratch.
Yesterday I contracted a virus somewhere along the interweb. Because I have sensitive info on my computer, I was afraid to try and clean it. So I just went ahead and formatted.



So, now I do not have internet. (I am on a friend's laptop)
My internet was not working so I contacted my ISP. We went through the steps (that I had done already)



Then she asked me to try ipconfig, nothing but the message



"Windows IP Configuration"



appears on the screen.



So after a few more things, the lady said that I do not have an IP address for my computer. She told me to contact Microsoft. (but I don't know.. this is a shared copy of windows in my family that we bought to install on all the computers. I think that is illegal.)



So, I read on a forum that the drivers for NIC didn't get reinstalled. I checked on my computer &gt; manage, and nothing is flagged (except for things like my printer, my tablet, etc)



SO! How do I go about solving my lovely problems? Do you have any idea? How do I get the drivers I need? How do I know which drivers I need?



PLEASE help me if you can.



Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



Hey you guys, thank you.
I had forgotten all about the disc that came with my mobo. (however, I don't have it with me anyway.)
I was able to find the drivers on nVidia and download them. Now I have internet access!!



Thank you!!!

I've never seen that message on ipconfig so I can't help you there but as far as which drivers you need, if your ethernet port is built into your mobo, just go to the manufacturer's web site and download the drivers for your model mobo. If it's a PCI card pull the card and try to find distinguishing numbers like a model number and do a google search on it to find the drivers.



And, you're right, It is illegal to install a single copy of Windows on more than one computer. Didn't use to be but now it is in the quest for the almighty $$$



MicroSoft isn't going to be much help. They're just going to tell you to contact the computer manufacturer because most of the people you can get on the phone barely speak English much less know anything about troubleshooting a PC. IMHO, MS is worse than Dell in that department.



Sorry for the rant and best of luck

If you built the computer you have a CD with the driver for your Ethernet or wireless card.  It has the driver on it.  Install it.  (It doesn't get installed with Windows - it gets installed from the CD or by downloading it from the NIC manufacturer's web site.)

<question>



How does World of Warcraft (WoW) support the connection of all their players?



I imagine that every player uploads and downloads a fairly large amount of data on a consistent stream and with the hundreds of thousands (possibly millions?) of players on at any given time, I dont think a pipe exists that is large enough to support the high level up upload/download streams, even with all the money in the world to buy one. So how do they do it? Or does a pipe exist that large? Or is the upload/download streams per player very small? If so, how small?



</question>



<additional details>



2MB per hour is a lot when you factor in that it's 2MB per hour PER PLAYER. I'm talking about the point of view from the server and not the client. 2MB per hour comes out to about 57kb per second, multiply that by 10.9 million subscribers, that comes out to 592.52 gigabyte per second total upload rate for all the servers. I counted WoW having 329 realms or servers, so dividing by that, assuming each server has it's own connection to the internet, each server on average would need a 1.8gb pipe, which I don't believe exists yet.  Some servers are fuller than others too, so I expect the need to be even higher than 1.8gb. A T3 connection is a mere 100mbps upload rate at max speeds which comes nothing near 1.8gbps.



YouTube is different. YouTube can host their videos on an infinite amount of servers if they wanted to, where as WoW needs to have each realm or world be self-contained in it's own server.

You'll have to set up your router first.  Refer to the manual.  Make sure it is a 802.11g router also.  When setting it up, make sure you do NOT leave it unsecured.  Use WPA encryption at the least, WPA2 is best.  Do NOT use WEP if you don't want any Tom, Dick or Harry sniffing your data or hacking your network.  WEP can be cracked with tools avail online in 3 min.  Unsecure means anyone can log onto your router and surf your internet and also sniff what you're doing on there as well.  Use a strong passphrase also.  I haven't set up vista with wifi yet, but I'm sure there is a wizard for it.  Name your router something you'll know, not the default LINKSYS or whatever.  After your laptop is connected and everything works, you can go into the router setup again, and disable SSID broadcasting, and MAC filtering to only let your laptop in if you want a bit more security.  These steps will keep a nosy neighbor from even finding your network, but an elite hacker can get by these.  WPA2 is best for keeping them out.

<answer>



You need to install active directory server and dhcp server on your 2003 enterprise computer and create a domain controller.  From here you will save network settings to a disk (cd, floppy, usb device etc.) and copy these settings to each host on your network.  You can create users on your domain controller account by going to the start tab and active directory users and groups.  You can also set domain policies such as complex password requirements from here.



I need more information.  Do you have all of your network equiptment and is it set up yet?  Are you set up on a switch, a wireless router, something else?  Do you need to meet any security requirements?

"Browse"?  Well there were no websites and certainly no web, so there was no browsing in the modern sense.



If you wanted to get something from MIT, early on your part of the network would have to know where MIT was (domain services were handled locally).  You'd get to MIT, log into one of their systems (all text-based), and then get whatever it is you wanted as if it were at the university you work at (no private Internet access yet).



Telnet to m-net.arbornet.org and log in as newuser if you want to get a better understanding of the experience.  This is a BBS (much closer to modern websites), but it's good enough.

During the early days of the internet people did not "surf" the internet. The reason to this is that there was not standard in Web pages (e.g. html, java or flash). Computers merely connected to each other and people had to use special software to transmit data between them.



Also, arpanet is not the internet. It was a cold-war network that was employed to provide fast communication in case of a nuclear attack.

Cyberspace has been used loosely as a term for the Internet.



The term is often used to refer to objects and identities that exist largely within the communication network itself, so that a web site, for example, might be metaphorically said to "exist in cyberspace." According to this interpretation, events taking place on the Internet are not therefore happening in the countries where the participants or the servers are physically located, but "in cyberspace".

i am not so sure if these would work; but they're free; am just not into macs; but they work fine with pc's
- access microsoft's foldershare.com, it shares 2 computers, each connected to the internet; it's like gotopc or logmein
- still coming soon for macs, use microsoft's mesh.com to connect all devices. with this you can sync folders like outlook, share files

You don't use any software to connect computers on a network. Both Windows and Mac OS X are perfectly capable of connecting to a LAN, sharing files and other resources natively.

In short yes, the network layer is where the IP address is.
There is also a TCP/IP model.
1. Network Access (OSI 1 & 2)
2. Internet (OSI 3)
3. Transport (OSI 4)
4. Application (OSI 5, 6 & 7)

I recently installed windows again, and my local area connection is gone. How do i get it back?



I have a toshiba a105 and I downloaded what i thought was the driver off of the internet. Problem is I still do not see the area connection when i try to connect the modem to my computer. How do I fix this? I can get wireless connection very well, but my modem won't connect to my computer. Am i still missing a driver? I went into system hardware and it does have a problem symbol by the internet driver, but i have downloaded it 3 times now, and still no luck. Any ideas, or answers?

Sharing printer with Vista laptop on wireless router?



When I shared my printer on my main computer with my laptop, and then tried printing something on the laptop, the pages are sent to the printer, but the printer won't print it out automatically unless I load the pages manually.. However, when I print on my main computer, the pages load automatically and print automatically.



How do I set it up so that my printer will also automatically load/print the pages for the laptop?

If you have a wireless router, yes.  Otherwise you'd need a wireless card in your pc and then you might be able to set up internet connection sharing and an ad hoc network to access it.  Easier to get a wireless router.

short answer, yes.
pc XP wired connection, is it working properly? if it is, then first try wired connection for laptop vista before attempting a wireless connection. you can disconnect pc XP and temporarily use it's wired connection for your pc vista. you should not have any problem connecting after you have made sure that wireless pc vista does work with wired connection unless outer is NOT wireless capable. for pc vista wireless connection you will need a passkey which you assigned or was generated while setting up router.

RDP is not typically run unencrypted over the Internet.  Check with you sysadmins.  Does your company provide remote access VPN service for employees?  If so, get an account, then you can logon to the VPN and get right to your remote desktop, and it's secure by way of the VPN.

yes any wireless router will work fine with a wired pc and a wireless pc.  a wireless router has 4 wired ethernet ports on the back, so you could have any combination of wired and wireless devices connected to the same router.  unless you need a very high speed network for your wireless pc, wireless N is overkill in my opinion.  you can get a very nice wireless-g router for alot less than a similarly configured wireless-n router.  good luck

You cannot put a password on regular hubs. The best way to stop this is by limiting the number of users on your network and manually assigning an ip address to your pc.

Because it is wired, there shouldn't be an issue, except if someone was to break into your computer and plug themselves in!

I would still recommend adding a different password to the main router configuration page (Normally 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 - you'd have been on that page before)

MSN Accounts, you can either email abuse@msn.com, or leave them.
Most of them will automatically go if they are left.

Yahoo accounts automatically get deleted if you do not sign into them for 3 months.

Bebo can be deleted by just clicking, Facebook is perhaps similar, in the options settings there is a button for deleting the account permanently, but you need to know the Password for it.

Make an exception for tiscali in your firewall.  In other words, add tiscali (not sure what that is) to the allowed sites list/approved list in your firewall software.



It's hard to say how to do this without knowing what firewall software you use, but it usually isn't too hard.

If your fire wall is ZONE ALARM, just look thru the list of programs and see if you can find "Tiscali" or some related file, and allow it to connect.



I have a similar problem trying to connect wireless. I think I will have to disable my firewall. Wired, my internet works fine, but when I try wireless, no way! I wish NORTON FIREWALL had a list I could look thru. It doesn't!

if you have a wireless/wired router it will use NAT (Network address translation) and will have its own hardware firewall. If so you can disable all other firewalls as you shouldn't have 2 running anyway

What is the highest speed you can possibly transfer with 54Mbps wireless router?



I know you can never get 54Mbps - but what can you really get as a maximum. Please think about what I am asking...NOT internet speeds - not your wireless speed is limited by your internet speed silly talk. 
Say the router can share files and you want to download a file off the router itself, and If you are right next to the router (100% signal), there is no "interference" in your house, only 1 pc connecting to the router, the absolutely best possible conditions EVER - you would still not get 54Mbps - but what would you get? 40Mbps, 30, 20 even??

With VNC how do you connect to a computer that isnt on your local network?

any ideas?

<answer>



I assume you will need a VPN (virtual private network setup) to do this.

The other way is to use logmein.



At work log in to www.logmein.com 
Setup your work computer as directed and setup an account with logmein.com. Leave your work computer runnning and then log in to logmein from home, you will see the account you set up previously. Log in to that and you will have control of your work computer. I use it all the time and its brilliant. It is fully encrypted and free!.

The link below is to a Belkin F5D7230-4 router.  You can either try to research this error on the specific model you have or you can reset to factory defaults and configure it again.  Whichever you are most comfortable with.

Can you give us the specific router that you have?  We can give you more specific instruction for your error situation.

Should I change my broadband provider.



I should be receiving up to 8mb.In the past few months I am either not being connected or it is running painfully slow. Occasionally it works fine but not for long. .
If the problem is due to the local exchange being busy (this has been sited as the likely cause) then by changing to another ADSL provider wont the problem still be the same. Who owns or controls the local exchange? . Does each ADSL provider have their own exchange? As you can tell I don't know enough about the subject to make an informed decision.

It really all depends on how far away from the exchange you are, the further you are the less speed, the closer the bigger speeds.



Exchanges will have many ADSL companies going trough it, so it's not nessecarly going to be that.

I had this exact same issue and it was my ZoneAlarm firewall blocking the internet. For a short time, disable your firewall and give it a try. If it works, then you need to configure it to allow access. If it doesn't work then you have to try other things, but I'm pretty sure it's your firewall.

And don't forget to turn it back on!

you may need a crossover ethernet cable if you are connecting 1 switch to another or alternatively if the first switch has an uplink port you should use that instead to connect to the second switch

It then wouldn't let me connect. So I found the original one, now named 'name 2' but it won't connect either. Somehow I cloned the connection? Is there any way to fix this? Thanks!

seeding means uploading ( giving peace's of the torrent to other users ) , for better ration allow torrent to reach at least 1.5 upload ration before quieting , do not download or upload multiple file ( stick with 5 up and 5 down unless you have really good ISP , like 20MB/s download and 10MB/s upload speed ) . Join torrent share site which requires registration and have internal rating system ( they have good torrents and will encourage you to upload more then you download ) .

The DS only works with WEP or WPA encryption/security. Make sure your Airport is set up to work with this type of security and not something like WPA-PSK. As for the lag with the Wii, check the signal strength in the set up menu of your Wii.

Can you setup a normal .exe to start without logon following a server restart?



There is a program that is a .exe and must be running on a server at all times.  Currently it is being started from the Startup menu and runs without problems once started.  But, if the server is rebooted and no one logs on to it following the restart, the program is not started.  Can the .exe program be setup as a service or in any other way be made to automatically start without anyone logging on?  And, if so, how?

if you terminated a process in task manager by mistake and a program was affected, all you had to do was to run the program that was affected again or if you are not sure which program was affected to just restart your computer.



you did not mention whether the system restore was successfull and i'm assuming it was, you may need to reinstall terminal services again and on administrative tool, services, terminal services and check that it's started then try again.

Ubuntu doesn't come with telnet installed.

I'd suggest that instead you use ssh.  To do this, download putty for windows and set it to use ssh on port 22, and set it to the IP address of your ubuntu vmware image.

Then, to start ssh on ubuntu, type:

sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start



You can get putty here:

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtat...

You want putty.exe and you can put it in c:\windows

then go to your run prompt and type putty and press enter.

Make sure also the telnet service is installed and started, I' using another distro but the package name should be telnet-server.

Then be sure that you have the telnet service under /etc/services

Using a cable to raise the antenna higher in relation to the ground plane will improve the operation.
You can also purchase higher gain antennas that will improve performance
The last resort is to buy a repeater to improve the signal strength in a "dead zone"

If the router has a antenna socket then you should be able to fix a better aerial, also make sure your using the best frequency. Ideally you want "N" (but this is fairly new so might not be compatible) failing that you are looking for a mixture of "b" and "g", in my experience you want to avoid "a"

Put your wireless router as high up as you can and as far from electrical and metal things as you can, that'll give you the best coverage.  Try to put it in the middle of where you expect to be (usually the middle of the house).  If you have 2.4GHz cordless phones you may want to replace them with 5.8GHz, 900MHz, or the new DECT6.0 phones that won't cause interference.  Also, wireless video senders, or wireless cameras that run on 2.4GHz should be set to the farthest channel from your router (e.g. set video sender to 1 or A and put the router on channel 11).  Channels 1, 6, and 11 are preferable because they don't "overlap" with each other.

If you really need more range after positioning your router as best you can, some companies sell "WiFi Repeaters" that re-transmit the information stronger to boost the signal.  If you can run wires, get an "Access Point" or a router that can be configured as an access point (a second router would cause problems) and set it to the same SSID (name) and Encryption key (security) - then computers will pick whichever is strongest.

I suppose you could always try making one of these, it will decrease the range on one side but increase range wherever it's pointed.  I was able to get from 40-60% up to 85-95% in my basement.  For free (well ok, a sheet of cooking foil, some glue, and cardstock or photopaper), it's worth a try!

An alternative is to use powerline adapters - these use mains wiring instead of a long ethernet cable. You plug a powerline adapter into one of the ethernet ports on the router and into a local mains socket and another adapter into your computer ethernet port and a nearby mains socket
Speeds are better than wifi and signals can be encrypted so your neighbour cannot hack in if they have powerline adapters.

Buying an antenna is a good idea - try getting one from www.maplin.co.uk

I find that the DG834PN has a much better range than the other range, though. Try buying that - only around £65

If there is a danger is there a way for the owner to know if you're connected and can they see any of your personal information (address). Also, if it is illegal how can the public know are there any warnings or do the police just come to your house and arrest you?

It's your neighbor's wireless network you are connecting to.

There is no real danger - they can't really see you unless they are looking when you are connected.  Worst case, they will set a filter to boot you off.

It's illegal, but you are probabably OK.  Stop being a cheapscate and get your own broadband network connection.

Hope this helps

Firstly, you need to ensure that your company allows you to swap any files between 2 computers. If they do (and you don't have a tech to do it) then the best way is to copy whatever file you want to share into the shared folder.

Go to my documents, choose the folder/file you want to share and then just drag it over to the shared folder.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Because it is ridiculously expensive.  The United States has some of the oldest telecommunications infrastructure in the world.



One of the most frequent arguments made for the lack of fibre optic lines in the United States is the size of the nation. 
This is ludicrous, however. Look at Russia.  Russia has a landmass even larger than the United States, yet private, residential areas have FTTH available to them for relatively low cost.

The truth is, as I suggested, that the U.S. would have to scrap much of it's existing telecommunications infrastructure to accomplish this. Many insist that nations such as Japan and South Korea have high fibre availability because they were able to develop their telecommunications infrastructure in a methodical way due to the fact that it was constructed more recently than in the U.S.  This is probably very close to the truth.  If you look at cities like New York City, the lines underground date back from the turn of the century (circa 1900).  It would be the most massive and expensive construction project the city has seen in years to tear all of this up and lay out fibre.



As to why the federal government does not institute fibre as a public telecommunications utility, that's simple.  Americans are still scared stiff of Communists.  If the federal government effectively OWNED the means of telecommunications, this would be a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press.  Furthermore, telecommunications is one of the most competitive businesses in the United States today.  If we revisit the case of New York City, it has been a major source of conflict in the last ~15 years over who owns the cable underground.  Up until recently, it has been clear that the entity that lays the copper, owns it.  This has allowed a certain company that I shall not mention by name to run a monopoly in the city for over a decade.  It was only recently that negotiations between this particular telecom and certain of it's competitors (including a certain nationwide telecom with a fibre network) have allowed for other telecoms to have leased access to the cable underground.  This is an ongoing issue, however, not only in New York City, but in cities all around the country.

Note that I realize this may some kind of homework question for you.

EDIT: Also note that in recent years, Cisco systems has been in compliance with United States government internet wiretapping practices. Americans are already outraged by this invasion of privacy, and would not stand for government ownership of the means of telecommunications.

Capitalism is like Christianity. It is a beautiful idea in theory but the devil is in the details. In the telecom business, as with any big business, when an institution gains a competitive advantage in the marketplace they seek to maintain their monopoly by the cheapest and most efficient means possible. They send lobbyists to Washington with boatloads of cash to bribe politicians. They get legislation passed to outlaw the competition and inoculate themselves from the vagaries of the free market. There is an incestuous marriage between big telecoms and the federal government. The American public is the abused child of this unholy matrimony.

Right click My Computer, click Manage.

Go to Event Viewer on the left, then click System.

You'll see a long list of events.  If you know roughly what time it was, click the one that is:

Type - Information, Source - Event Log (you can sort them by type at the top of the list)

It will say that the event was stopped, and at what exact time. This is when your computer was turned off.

You would need to make a specific event before closing down, eg;
going to your home page, you could then check the last time of access
using the history icon, or internet tools on the browser. Alternatively
windows keeps a record of all file modifications, so you could check
on this, if you knew which file or folder you had last used. Youcould go back to it at startup and check when last modified.

If you're using your Employer's connection to the Internet, then they're 100% able to track it. Why don't you clear all your cookies after using it. Well, this way doesn't mean that your employer can't track it but I suppose it's better while you're not using your own laptop.

If your (ISP) knows what sites we look at, then your company canand are, looking at stuff you been doing, their is software out their that can log network traffic, which dose give details of web sites visited and how often so as you connect to your commpanys domain, it will log your ip address and other details and they will be able to monitor such traffic in and out of thier network, if they really want to they can if such ports are open on your machine, send data from thier server or network computers to implant a bit of software in which it will return data to them about your computer or what you do on it what time it was on what time it gose of, and im not kidding this is no sicence fiction it can and will be done, but they must be very carefull as a company/or individual person, if they are doing such things as they can infringe on peoples rights!! have a look at wikipedia regarding KEYSTROKE LOGGING!!
2) Remote Access software Keyloggers – Are local software keyloggers programmed with an added feature to transmit recorded data out of the target computer and make the data available to the monitor at a remote location. Remote communication is facilitated by one of four methods:
(1)Data is uploaded to a website or an ftp account. 
(2)Data is periodically emailed to a pre-defined email address. 
(3)Data is wirelessly transmitted by means of an attached hardware system. 
(4)It allows the monitor to log into the local machine via the internet or ethernet and view the logs stored on the target machine itself.

How to set up a wireless connection?



Basically I need to know how to use a wireless dongle with my desktop computer. We have a netgear wireless router set up downstairs for the laptop, now for my desktop computer, when I put a dongle in ( same as the laptop) would it work just the same? or would I have to make a workgroup connection? All I want is to install the dongle to my pc so I can pick up any network, not just the netgear. It is only for the internet nothing more. 
Hope somebody can help :)

the new dongle should recognise the network straight away after you install it on your desktop. Just enter your username and password.  It will be like using the internet in coffee shops.

go to start menu, and click control panel.
then click system
then go to the modem icon and click disable. I think you right click it the select disable.  This will disable your dialup modem.  If that doesnt work...

go to start menu
the select the run
then in the run type in " msconfig"
then go to start up
look for anything that might be used to access your modem and disable it from start up.  this doesnot remove the program just keeps it from loading automatically, so if you need it you can always just click on the icon.  good luck

Open the network and sharing centre in Vista, click "Manage Network Connections". Select both the wireless and LAN connection at once and right click &gt; "Bridge Connections".

Then plug the 360 into the laptop using an ethernet cable and you're away :)

No such device exists. You can, however, unplug the modem from the power source for a couple of hours, (about twelve, maybe?), and get a new IP.

If there was then your internet wouldn't work... 
The IP address is the identification of your connection to the network and to participate in the network, the IP address has to fall within a narrow range of permitted numbers. If you scramble that, you have no connection.

A broadband router does this, kind of, because it assigns an internal network IP to your computer (192.168.0.15 for example) and then translates that to the external WAN IP address your ISP provides.
But that doesn't help you much, because the ISP's address is still constant.

Wireless Router problems.?



I have a Linksys WRT150N Wireless N router, and it always randomly loses it's wireless connection. I have 1 laptop connected straight to the router with an ethernet cord, and a laptop and my Wii connected wirelessly. The wireless connections always drop every few hours, but the wired connection never gets dropped even if my wireless connections are dropped. If I reset the router everything works fine for a few hours. I live in an apartment, so range isn't an issue, and there is nothing that is  physically or wirelessly blocking the router (I think) that could possibly be interfering with the router. It's not a modem issue, because again the wired connection never drops, I have connected the modem straight to the laptop and it never drops, and this is the 2nd modem this is happening on. Any help?

Hi,



The problem is because of the interference with your wireless signals, make sure the antenna is placed verticaly towards the ceiling, dont place the router above or below the modem or computer. Make sure that the firmware in the router is updated, if you are familiar with the router configuration goahead and upgrade the firmware, otherwise call linksys @ 1-800-LINKSYS.

Its obviously in the radio broadcasting/receiving part.



So try different channels.



If that doesn't work, look for a device closeby that is switching on and off like a fridge (would be my best guess). They can interfere with the signal. If it is that, go to your local electronics store for a device to filter ac signal,
Also changing the location of your router may work.

I have the same problem with a NET GEAR 38 from Brighthouse Cable.  I am so frustrated, I had to put it aside for a couple days.  Will look forward to your answers and try again then.  I had just reinstalled Windows XP and lost the internal wireless connection.  I went online to Compaq with the live chat and they were very helpful.  At least I got to the point you are at.  Then this new dropping connection problem started.  Mine only lasts for about 10 minutes, though..  Also, I have tried the hard wire to the laptopwith the same succes as you, have another laptop Sony Vaio wireless laptop that works perfect and a desktop that is the main one  hard wired to the router, also.  So now I have 2 of 3 working.  Good luck and you are not alone!



PS I just found this..hope it helps you!

multiple access in networking is typically done using a router. A router uses "Network Address Translation" to allow multiple users to access a higher level network (the internet) using a common IP address

Multiplexing  is where multiple data sources are time sliced and send "chunk by chunk" over one data channel.

If you are looking for a relationship, maybe you can say multiplexing allows multiple access to a server.
Before broadband speeds, people used dumb terminals to connect to a mainframe server. Each connection used serial connections that were commonly 9600bps. All these serial lines all joined to a device called a multiplexer that joined all the  lines into a fat 64k line that went into the server, so in essence, that multiplexer allowed multiple users to access the same server. Hope this helps.

I need to write Remote Access Tool in C++. What are the requirements? Sockets, LinkedLists, Recurrsions, etc?!?



I'm looking forward to make my own project for practicing & educational purposes. I have good background about Networks. I have not programmed any network application before.

I got a simple project want to do it.

About: Client-Server Application

Idea:



1. Client (Software) that creates a small file (Server)

2. Take the created server & send it to one of my other desktops remotely,such as by email.

3. I click the server on the new desktop.

4. My client gives me an alert that it connected to the server in the other desktop.

Input of my client will be a 'message alert' that tells me, you are connected to xxxx-desktop.

My Question:

This kind of program what are the key points that has to be implemented in the source code? I mean does the source code should have data structure concepts? If yes, can you please tell me the data structure that should be implemented in such program?

This project is to improve myself in programming into more complex client-server development.

I hope you can give a quick advice! I know there are professional out there!

Help with DSL (filter required?)?



I was helping my parents set up their AT&T DSL internet at their house and ran into something interesting. They had a DSL filter, but whenever it was plugged in, the phone line wouldn't work. It might be broken, but I'm not sure. Anyways, I removed the DSL filter and used an ordinary splitter to connect one line to the phone and the other with a DSL cable (for internet modem).



Surprisingly, it worked. The internet works and so does the phone line. Now what was the deal with the DSL filter? Is it necessary? Also, do I have to worry about anything?

They have the high speed DSL internet and not dial-up, so I'm surprised it worked w/o the DSL filter.

A Comms port is a very old connection like LPT1 (replaced by USB these days for printers) you could get Comm port mice a long time ago, devices that use them these days include label printers, PDQ machines and such like.



Also Comm ports are commonly known as serial ports which are used for connecting and configuring devices to a PC like firewalls/switches etc.

--Edit---
You can only put one type of cable into the comms port but you can get a convertor to change sizes/types etc i.e Parallel to Serial etc

There are 2 common types - 9 pin and 25 pin.  The 9 pins are a subset of the 25 and adapters are available.  They usually communicate with an "RS232" protocol signal set.  Sometimes its a full set of signals, but usually its 9 or less pins in use.

This type of connector is often called a "D" type connector because of its shape.



There 3 main signals used are GND - a common ground voltage,  TXD - transmitted data, and RXD - received data. Other lines are used for establishing the link, like CTS (clear to send) and RTS (ready to send.  These are hardware handshaking lines and commonly used tio signal to modems, but not always.

Very occasionally, other connectors are used for  similar connectioins but with reduced pin counts.



Nowadays most laptops do not bother to use this comms device, but desktop PCs usually have a single port("COM1").  There are special cables available which containa  chip and plug into the USB ports to give, for example,a  D9 connector, from which you could connect to a modem or other serial device.

I'm assuming that this is part of BT's scheme - BT Fon service:

"BT has backed a global wireless sharing service called Fon, billing it as the "world's largest wi-fi community".



The firm's three million broadband customers will be able to share their wi-fi with others in the Fon community.



BT's scheme with Spanish firm Fon will boost the 500,000-strong community of users around the world and add to the existing 190,000 Fon hotspots.



The BT Fon service lets people share a "small portion" of their home broadband connection by opening up a separate secure channel on their wireless router.



Fon users can access broadband when in range of another community member's hotspot.



Gavin Patterson, BT Group's managing director, said the plan was to create "the people's network of wi-fi, that could one day cover every street in Britain".



Free access



Joining the BT Fon scheme is free of charge and community members will also have free access to existing BT hotspots in its Openzone network.



"If they are prepared to securely share a little of their broadband, they can share the broadband at hundreds of thousands of Fon and BT Openzone hotspots today, without paying a penny," added Mr Patterson."

Are you likely to want to use the WiFi exchange offered above ?

If not, don't enable it if you're not using it.

There's no point unless you have a wireless device to use it with.

It will just use energy on the transmitter for no purpose.  BT home hub comes with security already set up, so there's no problem there- but it's not hard to turn it on later, so I wouldn't do it now.

Why would you want to turn it on if you can't make use of it?  If it's to give others internet access for free, it would be a violation of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, section 1.  BT can authorize themselves to do it, you can't.

Is my version of XP too old to run my wireless?



Okay so I got a new laptop about 3 days ago, its all fine except that the wireless doesn't work.
I have Windows XP 2002 on here and I downloaded service pack 2 separately (because it didn't come with the version of windows I had)
My wireless says its connected (excellent connection) but I cant run any web based programs.
Some helpline I rang up said I should download service pack 3 because that has alot of stuff to do with wireless on it, but it wont let me install it. It says 'the expected version of this product was not found on your system'
Does this mean I need to buy and install a brand new version of window? Is 2002 just too old for wireless?
Thank you

No XP is XP regardless of what year it was made. XP SP3 does have a lot to do with networking so I'd say go to http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai... and download the network install package yourself and not rely on the updater in XP because its useless. Try that and see if it works. If it doesn,t, try using the updater to get all the small little updates as one of these might be holding you back.

there is no problem with PC XP SP2 version 2002, i should know since i am using one now to answer your question.  do setup wired connection first to check if it does work before attempting a wireless connection. also, verify that modem is wireless capable or if you have a router that it is wireless capable and that laptop does have a wireless interface card.



i find it easier to setup computers by naming workgroup for all computers identical. you can change it back later after everything is working properly.

How do I close an open port on Windows Vista?



I opened a specific TCP port on Windows Vista via the 'Windows Firewall Settings' -&gt; 'Add Port'.



It seems that it only allows me to add a port, which I did, but it did not have an option/way to close the opened ports! I need to know how to close ports I've previously opened.



Any ideas?

Under the exceptions tab in Windows Firewall Settings, there is a list of all the ports and programs allowed to go through. Just click on the one you want to close, and press delete, or untick the box if you want to disallow it but not remove the rule.

It would be very helpful if you examined what you wrote and then clarified what you wrote so those who can help are able to understand what you are saying.  In fact your exhibited spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax, and composition skills do not meet that of the fourth grade.  In light of this I will attempt to decipher what you have supplied and try to help but if what I write is off target it is because of the vague description you have given.



Apparently you were told (not tolled) to update the firmware on your D Link router.



I do not know if this is a wired or wireless router.  However, you must always use a wired connection whenever you access the router for firmware upgrade and / or for configuration.  If you used a wireless link, the firmware was only partly loaded when connection failed and now you have a firmware mess that can ONLY be fixed by a factory reset of the router.  In this case check the D Link web site or the manual to see how to do a factory reset and start over.  Your statement suggests that the firmware upgrade started but failed during the process which further supports my guess that you used a wireless link to upgrade firmware.  However, sometimes this also fails with a wired link but this is far less common.  If you used a wired link, perhaps you have the wrong firmware for your unit.  Be very careful to select the proper router including make, model and sometimes version and  serial number because this can make a major difference.



Most low end home grade routers, and the D Link you have falls into this class, will reset all configurations back to factory default with a firmware upgrade.  Therefore if you changed the IP address, subnet, subnet mask, DHCP range, etc from factory default in your local configuration, it was reset to factory default.  Perhaps this is your problem.



Use of Vista basic or premium has little to no effect on the firmware upgrade so this is not likely the issue.



Apparently you believe that the factory default setting for the router is 10.1.1.1 but you cannot access the configuration page with this IP address.  This suggests to me that the router has a different IP address.  I assume your wired network interface port of your pc is set to obtain IP address automatically.  If not change this to do so by right clicking on Network Connections, click on Properties, highlight Internet Connections (TCP/IP) and click on properties button and set the link to obtain IP address and DNS automatically and then click ok and exit this.  Next open Command Prompt (start, run - type in cmd and hit enter).  At the &gt; prompt in Command prompt type in ipconfig and hit enter; you will be given your IP address, subnet mask, default gateway address.  The default gateway address is the router's ip address and you should use this to access router configuration pages.  If you do not have an IP address from ipconfig or if the IP address starts with 169.xxx.yyy.zzz, again in command prompt, type in ipconfig /release and at the next command prompt prompt type in ipconfig /renew to see if you get a different starting IP address (typically starts with 192.168.x.y or 10.x.y.z).  If none of this works, do another factory restart of the router and see if you can get it to work with the original firmware first.



There are other things to do but first do these things.  Write again if there are problems but write more carefully and accurately telling exactly what you did so we can help.  Again, write accurately, carefully, completely, and properly so people can help.

The Windows XP default desktop view and Start menu are different from the Windows Classic View (e.g., in Windows 2000). Therefore, navigating to certain items can be different. In the interest of broad applicability, most Knowledge Base instructions assume you are using Classic View. For information about switching your Windows XP default view to Classic View, see In Windows XP, how do I switch to the Windows Classic View, Classic theme, or Classic Control Panel?



Windows NT, 2000, XP, and Vista
To see what IP address your computer is using:



Click Start, and then select All Programs (XP and Vista) or Programs (NT and 2000).



Select Accessories, and then Command Prompt (2000, XP, and Vista), or Command Prompt (NT).



At the command prompt, enter:



ipconfig



The IP address (or IPv4 address is you are using Windows Vista) will be a series of numbers following the pattern xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, for example, 156.56.27.32.



To close the command prompt, enter:



exit



Windows XP, without using the command prompt
Alternatively, in Windows XP, to find your IP address using the graphic user interface:



Right-click the My Network Places icon, and then select Properties.



Double-click the Local Area Connection icon. Occasionally, there will be a number on the end (e.g., Local Area Connection 2), depending on your computer's configuration. If you are looking for the IP address for a wireless adapter, the icon will normally be named Wireless Network Connection.



Click the Support tab.

It can be called a couple of things...



LAN port
Ethernet jack
Network socket
RJ45 Plug



Pretty much any combination of LAN, Ethernet, Network, and RJ45 with any combination of  jack, port, socket, or plug.



But I wouldn't just call it a LAN
A LAN is a local area network -- it is both the hardware, and the cables which allow multiple computers to be interconnected and share data.  Each part of the LAN has its own name (or names in this case) So referring to the ethernet port as simply "LAN" would be vague and imprecise.  -- you could do it.. and in a very general way the port is part of the LAN..so you wouldn't be completely wrong..but calling everything simply LAN would be confusing to your coworkers or to your tech support person. (or whomever you are talking to)



I prefer to call them ethernet ports or ethernet jacks.  Since they look like a telephone jack... I often times call them an Ethernet or Network jack.



::EDIT::



If there are 3 on the wall.. and you need to identify them.. try to look at them closely,  often times there are numbers on the jack itself to identify each one.  If not, the general concensus is to read top to bottom, left to right, so the one in the upper left would be #1 and the lower right would be #3.
Some wall plates have up to 6 jacks on them.  If you need to tell the landlord which jack you want to activate... check to see if they are 'assigned' a number, as they probably are.

An ethernet cable uses what is called a RJ-45 connector. One end of this plugs into the network interface card (NIC) on your computer. The other end can plug into a RJ-45 wall jack, if you are in an office or business setting where the cabling is ran through the walls or ceilings. At home, they will usually connect to a modem which has it's own coaxial cable running to a coaxial port on the wall somewhere.



If you are in a residence, you most likely won't have a RJ-45 wall jack. RJ-11 is the type of connector that works with phone jacks. These are slightly smaller and only use 2 wires. RJ-45 is larger and uses 8 wires.



Using a typical RJ-11 phone cable would mean that you are using a dial-up modem instead of a NIC.



LAN...is a Local Area Network. This is the type of network that you would find in a school or office building. At home, I believe you would connect to a WAN (Wide Area Network).

How to connect Router-A to Router-B's WAN?



I am trying to connect two routers using Router A's LAN port to Router B's WAN port, although file-sharing works but internet is unsuccessful in Router B only. Here's the scenario...



Router A = Linksys WRT600N v1.1
Firmware = Official 1.01.35 build 5_20080115



Operating Mode = Gateway
Local IP = 192.168.1.2
Sub. Mask = 255.255.255.0
Gateway = (default (i.e. not assigned by me)
WAN IP :  81.97.227.7
Sub. Mask = 255.255.252.0
Default Gateway = 81.97.220.1
Internet Connection Type : Automatic Configuration DHCP



Router B = Buffalo WHR-HP-G54
Firmware = DD-WRT v24-sp1 (07/27/08) std
Operating Mode = Router
Local IP = 192.168.1.2
Sub. Mask = 255.255.255.0
Gateway = (default (i.e. not assigned by me)
WAN IP : 0.0.0.0
Internet Connection Type : Automatic Configuration DHCP



Now... I want to connect Router A (via LAN port) with Router B (via WAN PORT). I want both Routers to operate their own DHCP seperately coz I wanna keep Router A for home use and Router B for internet sharing in my neighborhood.



[P.S.] I already tried connecting both routers via LAN ports and it works fine, but Router B is using Router A's DHCP. I want to setup my network in such a way that Router A is connected to Router B and both work seperately with their own DHCP.



Can anyone please help me with this? I would greatly appreciate that!



</question>



<additional details>



sorry... Router A's IP was 192.168.1.1



I mistakenly typed 192.168.1.2



sorry... but my Router-B is for sharing networking and gaming purposes ... like counter strike, etc.



I'm not taking money from my friends. and it's like an apartments with my friends living around me and we share the same network. Now, I want to share the work load like this.



and I want to experiment on Router B with IPv6. That's the reason I want both to work with their own DHCP seperately!



Yey!!! It worked!!!!



Thanks everyone



and thanks Ashley for resolving this issue!

Operating Mode = Gateway
Local IP = 192.168.1.1
Sub. Mask = 255.255.255.0
Gateway = (default (i.e. not assigned by me)
WAN IP : 81.97.227.7 (auto assigned by ISP)
Sub. Mask = 255.255.252.0 (auto assigned by ISP)
Default Gateway = 81.97.220.1 (auto assigned by ISP)
Internet Connection Type : Automatic Configuration DHCP



Router B = Buffalo WHR-HP-G54
Firmware = DD-WRT v24-sp1 ( 07/27/08 ) std
Operating Mode = Gateway
Local IP = 192.168.10.1
Sub. Mask = 255.255.255.0
Gateway = (default (i.e. not assigned by me)
WAN IP : 192.168.1.107
Internet Connection Type : Automatic Configuration DHCP



Router A (via LAN) is connected to Router B (via WAN)



!!!PLEASE NOTE!!!
Although file sharing is bit of a problem since both routers have their own internet DHCP working seperately. Router-A's DHCP can do file sharing within its DHCP whereas Router-B's DHCP file sharing can do in its own. So, to have file sharing in between Router A and B... you need to do some Virtual LAN. Google it for solutions!

You can't do what you want the way you want.  You need to set up virtual LANs, and you can't do that by using 2 routers.



The easiest way is to buy 2 IP addresses, connect a switch to the modem and feed each router from one switch port, each router set to get one of the addresses.  But for a single external address, you just can't do it with 2 routers.

First of all, you have both routers set with 192.168.1.2 so right there you have an IP conflict.



Secondly, what you are attempting is not going to work. I'm pretty sure you would need some kind of smart managed switch in between the routers.

ok you can't do that WAN is your external IP so that is in bound from your ISP and honestly even if you have them both hooked up and running DHCP there is going to be issues only one should be running DHCP.  Just be warned your dabling in a big grey area here with the law, since you own it you should be allowed to do this but then again it would be like sharing your cable T.V.. Just a warning though. To do what you want your probably going to want to set up a static routing table on your one router then a DHCP service on the one for the wireless broadcast. basically use the subnet mask 255.255.0.0 and make one set of address in the 192.168.1.0-254 and the other set in 192.168.2.0-254 and have the default gateway the same for both along with same DNS server. you might have better luck with a router, and an access point. sorry but this is about as much help as i can be have never tried to split up a network special on residental hardware

Ofcourse, all you need to do is to get a Wireless Accesspoint, which can receive the wireless signal, I believe Linksys Makes such product, but before purchasing it please know about the product, because the access points from Netgear or Prosafe doesnt do that job. Just walk into Nearest BestBuy, they can guide to buy the best product.

you can, however you have to set your router to "router" where usually it is "gateway" this might save you some hassles, if your wireless router even allows for using it as a bridge/repeater.



better idea is maybe buy a wireless bridge/repeater/signal amplifier.

No, you just need a router or a dongle. If you have AOL it is notoriously difficult to set up, but any other network it very straight forward.  Don't forget to make sure you secure your connection against hackers.

to farther answer with better detail than the predecessor here.  no you will not have to upgrade your internet, unless you are on dial up, then you will have to get a broadband internet connection... just connect your broadband modem into your router with the already present Ethernet cord, thats the fatter phone jack lookin one, and then you must configure your wireless adapter to access your wifi router. it should be a rather easy task, unless you need some specific features.  but, your SSID is what your routers name is, its what your computer will connect to when connecting... make sure your wifi is on too.  in total it should look something like this when your done, its not that good of a example lol.

-Ethernet cable
-Wifi enabled Router
-wireless communication
-Wifi enabled adapter

U dont have to buy additional plan for wireless! Get the router that comes as wired and wireless (Linksys) wud work fine. connect your wireless router with your provider's hub or or router whatever you have before and thats it. U done.



In order to secure it so no one can connect to your wireless connection, you have to set up a password on it. Once you connect it, open your internet explorer and type 192.168.0.1 and a window will open up that will ask you for ur username and password. type admin as a password and leave username blank and set up there.



But I think you are not familiar with computers, so I would just say to call customer service and they will help you with it.



Good luck.

The best thing you can do is to get a wireless router. But make sure you the router you are buying support your provided. Is some provided used ADSL while some uses DSL. If you don’t know which one to buy, just explain to the seller your network or internet provider and they will give you the best of router which will work with your internet.



But if you don’t have a laptop or a second pc, why do you need to go wireless?

The connection to the router should use a standard network patch cable (cat-5)



Once connected you should be able to access the router from Internet Explorer by entering the router's IP address (something like 192.168.1.0)  User "admin" password blank



Once in you can perform the configuration.

Cisco products with a console port usually implement a serial protocol. You would need a rollover cable not a crossover cable. You also need an rj45 to DB9 or DB25 connector(adaptor).  Cisco sells the complete cable for about $18 if memory serves me correctly. Quite often devices can be telneted into or accessed by a web browser.  I would attempt one of the later two methods first unless your underlying problem is a lost password which would require the console method.

Agree with half_life. The ethernet port on your computer and the console port on the router both take an RJ45 connector, but they are NOT the same pinout or layer 2 protocol. You need to use the Cisco rollover (flat) cable and connect it to a serial port on your computer. Alternatively, you can get a serial-to-USB adapter (I/O Gear makes a good one) if you don't have a serial port on your computer.

Is replacing a router a hassle?



Hello all,



My current router is preventing me from availing of the full functions the PS3 online service has to offer. For those who own a PS3, I have a NAT type 3 connection as opposed to the superior NAT type 2 connection, meaning I cannot play some games online and cannot use voice chat.



I've tried port forwarding and setting up a static IP, but to no avail. I'm now sick and tired of reconfiguring my router and just want a quick fix — even if it means shelling out for a new router.



I've found a router that gave people an instant NAT type 2 connection: the Netgear DG834gt.



My question is: how hard is it to replace a router.



My network's quite large; I've several computers connected to the router, as well as a switch and an Apple Airport Extreme. If I switched off all my computers (and PS3), plugged in my new router and switched them all on again, would that work?

Your problem isn't the router, it's the configuration.  I'm betting that your modem is also doing address translation, so you can't forward the port in the router (it's blocked in the modem).  Read http://www.webdingers.com/router.html.  (You don't need to understand the theory if you don't want to go through it, just follow the directions.)  Then port forward in your modem and you should be good.



There's no "quick fix" - routing blocks all incoming ports, by the nature of how routing works.  You have to forward the port(s) you need from the internet connection itself (phone line or cable) all the way through to the computer handling those ports.  There's no other way for incoming connections to get to the computer.

<answer>



Any task can be simple or complex, easy or difficult.  It really depends upon whether you remain focused on your task.



I suggest first that you see if your existing router can be upgraded to a newer firmware.  The newer firmware may be all you need.  Log onto your router's configuration page and determine the firmware you now have.  Go to maker's web site and see if newer is availalble.  Caution - make sure it is for your router make, model, version, and serial # as this can be critical.  If so, follow the directions to download it and then to upgrade.



Always use a wired link, never a wireless link to the router when changing configuraiton or upgrading firmware.



You will likely lose all of your current configuration when upgrading firmware on the low end home grade routers.  Write down the current configurations of each aspect of the router so you can recreate it.  (Some people will open Word and do screen shots of each router page and past into Word so they have documentation recorded - not a bad idea.  Should you replace the router, this info is also needed so no mattter what recording the info is valueable to you.)



Finally if there is no newer firmware or if the latest firmware is not helpful contact the tech support of the router maker and see if they have a firmware upgrade being developed that will address your need.  If that is the case, it may be worth waiting for it.



Remember firmware upgrades cost nothing but your time.



Finally if firmware upgrade will not or does not help, a new router may be requried.  Carefully select one that meets your need.  Usually the cheaper they are, the poorer the performance and the less likely they will be stable and meet your needs.  Ask other users what they have and their experience - don't believe the store clerk as he will tell you what you wish to hear to get the sale.



Configuring the new router is not particularly difficult.  I would make sure I used the same subnet that is on the current one (e.g. if you are using 192.168.1.0/24 [all LAN IP addresses are 192.168.1.x where x runs from 1 - 254 and subnet mask is 255.255.255.0] I would make sure the new router is also using that subnet even if I had to change the setting in configuration; use the same DHCP range of the old one; do the LAN side configuration with only ONE pc connected to a LAN port of the router first; be sure to save the config of the router;  then remove old router and connect new router to modem and only to your pc that you used to config the router; power down modem, router, pc and after at least 0.5 min turn on modem, wait at least 0.5 minutes and turn on router and wait at least 0.5 min and turn on pc.  You should be able to both log onto the router config page and to the Internet - and if not check the WAN or Internet side of the router config to make sure it accepts IP address dynamically.  After all works here, power down all other LAN equipment, switches, wirless access points, etc.  Connect network switch and your configuring pc to switch and power up switch and pc.  Check for access to Internet and router config and if successful, power up each LAN pc or device, one at a time and your back in business.

no, the only hassle will be getting your modem to re register to it... usually it does, but if you have Comcast, then you might have an issue, but overall if everything goes according to plan the hardest thing will be unplugging all the ethernet cords from your router lol.  OH, now that i read everything, your router is fine, dont get a new one only if your ports are opened properly, and you still have the issue, i suggest you go to http://www.portforward.com to find out your port setup... follow the link to the routers list/section then find your EXACT router, and then look up PS3 NAT types 3-2 it looks just like that they are all alphabetically organized so just search the P section for the PS3 thing, then follow the instructions to set up your ports,,, you still will run ps3 nat 3 because either your internet provider is firewalling your ports or your ps3 is connected wirelessly, but i have noticed nat 3 doesnt mean that your connection is bad, its just the way it uses the Network Address Translation with the router, btw all ethernet systems are plug and play, meaning you can have it running WHILE ITS ON.

Get a network router. You can then connect your router to your internet modem (unless you have a device that is both modem and router at the same time) and make sure you connect all your computers to that router. If you have laptop, you should make sure you buy a wireless router. Then you set up your network and such. (Usually when you buy your router, there is a disc with software that you need to install on all connected computers. Contact customer support if you're lost)



Next connect your printer to your router. You can do this only if you have a network-capable printer. If you just have a normal printer, then you can plug it into one computer and make it a shared printer. I'm not sure if you can do this in XP, since I have Vista. A shared printer means that as long as the computer that the printer is connected to is turned on, then people on the network (people connected to your router) can use the printer through the computer.



If you're not sure as to whether your printer is network-enabled or not, then you should contact the manufacturer's customer support and give them the printer model that you have, and they should be able to tell you.

In the XP PC, go to the printer's Sharing tab and click Share this printer.  In the laptop install a new printer.  It'll be a network printer.  Browse for it.  Install it.  You're done.  (Vista is a little slow accessing shared printers, so don't panic the first time you try to print - just wait for it.  It could take around 60 seconds to pop up the printer box, then another 30 to start printing once you tell it to.)

on your xp pc, go to the printer in the printer and fax settings and right click the printer and find the sharing tab and share it with all computers.



On you laptop, add the printer by searching for it through the directories of the network.



While you do this, your xp computer has to be on at all times.  On top of that, whenever you want to print with the laptop, your xp pc will have to be on since your xp pc is acting as the print server.



If you want to be able to print without having the xp pc on, you'll need to get another pc, preferrably an old one and use that as the print server.  Kind of like imitating the xp pc.
