What does this say about our prime minister and our society?



two comedians at the very least show bad taste in a supposed joke on the radio, this led to thousands of complaints ( many who never actually heard the original broadcast) members of parliament getting involved , people getting sacked and the two presenters getting crucified by the press. This week our own prime minister on a jolly to a country with known terrorist sympathies, openly shakes hands with three suspected  terrorists that our own allies considered dangerous men , and nothing no uproar no sackings no nothing our prime minister gives a publicity coup to the terrorists and as i say nothing have we lost the plot in this country or what?



</question>



<additional details>



but why no uproar by the public on the more serious issue of what our prime minister is doing , if the public can galvanise itself against two comedians why not gordon brown, surely the more serious issue of possible terrorism and our p.m being with terrorist's should shock society a lot more than the hurt feelings of an old man , i worry where our priorities as a society are.

As to the two comedians, I believe it wasn't necessary to hear the whole broadcast. The fact that they left messages for an elderly respected actor concerning his granddaughters sexual activity, was enough.



How far do we have to push the boundaries of comedy before we give in to good taste/manners?



As to the PM, nothing this inept and corrupt individual does surprises me.



The first issue I hope, says much about our society. The second says nothing about it as the PM does what the heck he likes.
It is not "we" who have lost the plot, but our rulers, it is they who determine society via legislation, unlike a true democracy where the electorate (society) determines the legislation.

Everyone knows that Gordon is full of shi t, but until there is an election, maybe in the Spring, then we can't do a lot. The problem with the two "so called" comedians is really a much wider problem with our society. There is a lack or respect, a lack of common decency and manners. The fact that some people don't get what all the fuss was about simply illustrates the point that our society is becoming more bad mannered and self centred, and the BBC is leading the way. Russell Brand said in his apology " I'm sorry that I embarrassed the man's grand daughter", but the point was he didn't embarrass her, he insulted her and her grand father, but Brand was too thick and self centred to know the difference.

Well, I despise Brown and Blair, but if you honestly think Cameron and his mob of scented old Etonians are going to be any better you're stupider than even I think you are.  The point is this country is dominated by an elite of the super rich, which would have been unthinkable thirty years ago, and those two hooligans fall into this category.  The fact that the girlie dances aroud covered in blood is less important than the amount of money those clowns are paid.



Lineker on £1.5M for presenting Match of the Day?  And I just hear that the Chief Executive of the East Riding has voted himself a ten per cent pay rise on top of the £150,000 he is getting.  I am living on a small pension, but my taxes have to support these bums. Ahe same time they are trying to cut disability benefit and talk about making people work as the economy goes belly-up.



And people like you are wailing on about Brown meeting prisoners.  Get a life, or failing that, get a book.  Start educatng yourself and stop letting your thoughts be influenced by the public school morons who write the tabloids you read.

I don't really know what benefits you're talking about. There's enough money for our petty social programs in our country. How do less rich countries in Europe do it? They don't waste their money on military-related spending like we do, that's how. Stop worrying about the scraps left in taxe monies for the public, worry about war and "defense" build up and how profitable it is for corporations.

In denmark (I think) people are allowed to opt out of looking for work.



They get their benefits cut, but not stopped completely; they still get minimal housing and health care.

The benefit to the country is that all the money which is wasted on training people for jobs they will never do, and forcing them to go for interviews for jobs they will never take can be put towards helping people who genuinely want to work.

it would be nice if our so-called socialist government didn't spend so much time attacking the poor and the sick. Even if mentally ill people want to work, they are discriminated against at every point.

I do not think that they should be stopped as I think that there are people that would genuinely rely on that little help, however I do think that the number of people who receive them and the reasons for receiving them need to be seriously reviewed.



Maybe the introduction of a task force, that would identify and persecute frauds would be a good deterrent to reduce those who take advantage.  Sort of like bounty hunters but their job would be to provide evidence of fraud for prosecution.

A long term solution to the dependency culture would be only to pay child benefit to the unemployed on production of a certificate of sterilisation. This would ensure that instead of expanding, the pool of unemployable people contracted as those women dependent upon hand outs were effectively limited to one child.

While there are doubtless many genuine incapacity benefit claimants, there are many who swing the lead. Many mental problems are no more than a lack of will power, contributed to by the massive expansion of the psychiatric industry in the last fifty years. Psychiatrists have a personal interest in maximising the amount of diagnoses as this creates demand for their witchcraft. The traditional solution of 'Pull yourself together and snap out of it' would often be more beneficial to patients than convincing them that bad periods in their lives are chronic medical conditions.

I don't think they should be stopped, but I think things like unemployment benefit should be cut to like a month, and if you haven't got a job in that time, they stop. A month is plenty of time to get a job, even if it's just an interim one at tescos or something. 
Then again, we do have a huge problem of benefit cheats. And it's not because you can't tell who is ill and who isn't, it's because people get their doctors to sign them off as ill, when they aren't. And it's not impossible to tell when someone is mentally ill, they have tests and psychiatrists etc. for that. What we need is an independent board made up of doctors etc. who will decide whether the person is actually ill.
And people on benefits should be told that if they have children (not children they all ready had when they applied, just give birth to new kids)  they will be taken into care. It is totally irresponsible to have children when you are not financially able to look after them without the state stepping in.

we voted for a welfare state because of the amount of people in the UK living is abject poverty in a first world nation. Are you really suggesting we return to that level of human degradation.

The belief that the United States government (Bush in particular) was intelligent enough to engineer the destruction of the Twin Towers, but too stupid to plant WMDs in the Iraqi desert over a period of several years.

It's silly.

Best way to deal with conspiracy theories you hear about:
1) Go read the actual documents available on-line about it put out by the group actually in charge (the government in this case).
2) Go read the ANTI-Conspiracy group responses to the conspiracy theory (to see why what you are about to read is nonsense, if it is).
3) Read the conspiracy sites.

Always read all sides of things, but for goodness sake, inoculate yourself by having the necessary facts, first.

Van Dahnikkan (writer of Chariots of the Gods) sucked in a whole generation with nonsense, selectively chose, with implications given, connections made, and absolutely minimal context to avoid any other conclusion.

Basically it is those people who believe the designers of the towers who state that they will stand up to aircraft impact.



My reason for disbelieving the US government statements is that the two towers both fell neatly into their basements, with minimal damage to the surrounding buildings and infrastructure. A purely random fall, which would have been created by the damage caused by the collision, would have had both buildings fall in different directions and across over 1000 feet of New York.

The British Lion roars no more?



So this is how it ends: not with a roar, but a wimper.



“The most senior judge in England has declared that Islamic legal principles in Sharia law may be 
within the Muslim communities in Britain to settle marital arguments and regulate finance.



Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips said, ‘Those entering into a contractual agreement can agree that 
the agreement shall be governed by a law other than English law.’ And so the English who gave us the 
Magna Carta in 1215, William Blackstone and the foundation of American law are slowly succumbing to 
the dictates of intolerant Islam and sowing seeds of their own destruction.  It is impossible to 
reconcile this antiquated “law” with English law, so what could Lord Phillips mean when he says that 
Sharia law can be used in Muslin communities as long as such laws comply with English law?



This will mean English law must become subordinate to Sharia law” (Denton Record-Chronicle, July 14, 2008).



God warned Israel and her descendents that in the latter times He would give her “leaders” over to 
morally unprincipled and depraved minds. “And even as they did not like [or think it worthwhile] to 
retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are 
not fitting” (Romans 1:28).  British Muslims’ real objective appears to be the domination of England, 
not assimilation.  If Lord Phillips’ opinion becomes the law of England, he may have signed the death
 warrant for his nation.  It’s one thing to fight a war and lose it.  It’s quite another to willingly 
surrender without a struggle.”—Gary Stein, Dan Bennett and Scott Winnail

Get over it. He is only stating facts. Before these so called laws, humans have operated by means of "sharia" for thousands of years. Just because Muslims incorporated it into their system and called it Sharia does not mean it is alien or new.

What happens is, if in the stone ages, you stole someones cow, you were called on to make amends. A suitable compensation is set and paid to every ones satisfaction.

The chief Justice knows this stuff. Not everyone wants their family member sent to jail for some domestic "crime". In fact, sharia law is more user friendly.

This decline of the United States and Great Britain and her former colonies is going to rapidly accelerate in the near future.  The plain truth of Biblical prophecy properly understood should be evident to all who seriously study the following links.  There are so many prophecies coming to pass about these nations that the truth shown here is undeniable!

Prophecy is being fulfilled so quickly now that it's nearly impossible to keep up with every day's events.  I have no doubt that Great Britain will submit to this mockery of justice called sharia law and the U.S. will follow suit very soon.  There are more dhimmi's in both countries than there are Muslims and the dhimmi's are so afraid of the beast that they're willing to feed it everyone around them in order to prevent their own worthless necks from being stricken for a little while longer.

Oh my oh my! The nutters are out in force tonight.

Some of YOUR OWN QUOTES:

"Sharia law may be (used?) within the Muslim communities in Britain to settle marital arguments and regulate finance"

"Sharia law can be used in Muslin communities as long as such laws comply with English law"

So, rather than trouble the English courts with some civil matters, Muslims can go to the elders at the mosque and ask them to mediate.

Where's your problem? We all settle civil disputes outside the courts by any manner of means, and all churches have the facility to ask senior members to mediate.

But if we give Muslims that right, then it's the end of civilisation as we know it?

And where do you get your information?
Denton Record-Chronicle, the Bible (what happened to "love thy enemy as thyself" - why do people citing the bible want to forget that one?) and who else?

Gary Stein - is that the Trustee of the Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City?
Dan Bennett - comedian and juggler??
Scott Winnail - the church elder in Wyoming?

This is what happens when you have the people in power pandering to the minorities. We have a system for sorting out marital arguments etc. it's called going to a marriage counsellor or getting a divorce.
But you obviously don't understand what he meant - English law would supersede any sharia law - the measures he suggests would just be a way of sorting out arguments as is done in their religion, it will not mean they can have special islamic divorces, or that what goes on will not be subject to english law as it stands.

Yes people should try to adapt to our culture when they come here, but we also have to be tolerant. There is a difference between culture and religion. I know plenty of people who are muslim, but apart from their religion are totally integrated into British society. Perhaps this sort of thing will encourage people to be more tolerent.

I know a person where i live that  hasnt worked for 7 years cos he has been diagnosed as a manic depressant..... yet he can go and do everything else that everyone else can do! he uses his condition as an excuse for being lazy!
i know other people who have the same illness and can hold down a perfectly good job, people play the system and THAT  needs to change!

I personally would prefer this system than just a massive increase in road tax.

I only drive about 4000 miles a year but under the present proposal I would be paying £440 road tax for my Jag. OK so I make some CO2 but not as much as someone who drives a 1.6 car for 20K miles a year.

So for me paying tax on the fuel you use would be better!

This is about the only thing I agreed with GB on. Generally speaking I think this government is billy biz.

Why, why, why don't the Government put all motoring taxes on fuel

No evasion of road tax,no enforcement costs, wasted police resource.
Road users pay proportionate to road usage and loads carried.
Polluters pay proportionate to pollution created.
No introduction costs.
No capital costs.
No additional civil servants.
No collection costs.
Credit card companies get even richer and banks even richer again(This will swing it for Gordon).
Could be introduced tomorrow.

If Gordon Brown wants to rob the motorist blind at least he could do it fairly.

Why do politicians turn their back on this simple, incorruptible and fair system, rather than opt for the
Most expensive.
Most complicated.

How many more stupid rules and regulations are this pathetic hated government going to bring in before we get rid of them.
The Labour Government was once the working mans party now they are just a joke.
Why the hell should we motorists have to again shell out massive costs when the roads themselves are in a terrible state,and to have to pay on the mileage you do is madness,its alright for those in Government who get travel expenses.Why don't they just ban cars from the roads and get it over with.
This is not doing them any favours for the coming election and,it does seem that they are on a self destruct course,so let them get on with it.
You know this is all to pay for the cost of keeping the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,as well as sending aid to everyone who wants it.

As American politics and choice of president does affect the UK, many of us are terrified at the thought of a McCain/Palin win.  We see it as more of the same - agressive illegal policies against other countries which will drag us into more war which we do not want and cannot afford.



Palin terrifies me!  A woman who believes in creationism and is actively trying to stop evolution being taught in schools.  A woman who things she has the right to censor people's reading, wants independance for Alaska.  She's a nutter!  McCain is very old and there is a chance he won't see out the presidency - that would mean this mad woman being in charge of a country with too much power in the world!

I don't know alot about Obama's policies but they have got to be better than carrying on with Bush's mayhem and worse which will happen if McCann gets in.

Does government help people?



Or does it force some people to help other people?



And isn't the main reason why most people who need help need it simply the fact that they have no money because the government took their money to help everyone else?

Is "shared responsibility" a self-fulfilling phenomenon?



If you need the government to pay for some of your stuff, isn't that mainly because of the money the government has taken from you over the years to pay for everyone else's stuff?

You've got a good point there.

Government agencies touted to help the people are not created for that reason. They are created to garner more assets and freedoms from the people while making them more dependent on the government.

The premise that these social programs are done to help the down-trodden is just a front.  The sooner the general public realizes this fact, the sooner these people become more independent and free.

The government does not tax those with lower incomes as heavily as those with higher incomes, but even those with lower incomes must help fund the vast government programs and benefits that everyone enjoys - e.g. the military, police, fire stations, emergency medical coverage, etc.

It is rare that people abuse the system- but it does happen.  Nor does the government take away all of someones money.



Government can't help and solve all our problems.  As US citizens- who claim to be patriotic- we should help out our neighbors and communities- as best we know how.  It can be as simple as running in the charity 5K fun runs in your city, donating a few dollars to a local charity, volunteering time at a local charity, mentoring students, big brothers/sisters...stuff like that.
Example- if you want to help Hurricane Ike victims- log onto www.houstonfoodbank.org and donate. 
As a society, we need to live together and work together.  Do depend or complain about government doing too much or not enough- and take action.

The government does help people when it's politically expedient to do so. It's mostly the business sector that raids and pillages the poor and middle class. But recently, the government under our current Presidential administration has been making it easier for businesses to do their pillaging. The million-dollar handouts are being given freely to the super-rich, but it's the hundred-dollars-here hundred-dollars-there people who are getting attacked in the right-wing media. It's astounding that people fall for this line year after year.

Government should help the people that needs help including you if you ever find yourself in that situation. It does not force people. You must be a Republican because of course only your tax dollars goes for helping people that are too lazy to do anything. It's just that simple. Never mind the multi-billion dollar bail outs we are giving to private corporations. And the money given to cancer research or NPR don't help you at all. And what about public education?

Tell them "we sure are sorry we let people abort so many future tax payers". Tell them shut up and keep supporting a failed Social Security. Tell them sorry we had dumb *** people who kept electing democrats. Tell them to get off their butts get a job and take care of themselves because our welfare state led to this. The only government program mentioned in the constitution is the military. Kill all the stuff that ain't military and you kill the debt!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if we were still using the gold standard, then the value of the dollar would go the opposite direction of gold.

Dollars aren't valued in gold weight, they're tradable in the current value of gold.

Is America ill?



I was just watching JFK's Secret Societies speech.. I have to wonder.. where do the societies end, and the the government begin? I am not saying the two are one and the same, but I have come to the point that I can no longer deny that the two are in fact tightly knit together.

Ah, what has happened to this great country I once loved so dearly? There was a time, when I felt this country really lived up to the American dream. I was young, innocent, and free. I didn't understand what I see now. We are lied to. We are manipulated, that is true. No thinking entity can deny that we are manipulated. For what purpose, you could argue for centuries. The truth is too well hidden, I suppose.

Eisenhower spoke of The Military Industrial Complex. John F. Kennedy warned of the secret societies, and was shortly thereafter killed. 9/11 woke me. I didn't realize it at the time, but it was the catalyst. I started to truly understand, that, what I was told, was not the truth. I don't know the truth of what occurred that day, but the fact is, I should. We all should.

I carry this sick feeling, always. It follows me everywhere, and slowly gets worse, every time I hear something new.



There is something terribly wrong here. I don't know what it is, I don't know how to fix it, but something is dreadfully wrong. Our economy is faltering. You cannot deny it. Our superpower status is collapsing. You must see it. We are sliding from the world stage. You won't hide from it.

"Those who do not study history, are doomed to repeat it" -George Santayana

"Even today, there is little value in opposing a closed society" - John F. Kennedy

I see a pet, taken to the vet. The pet is ill, and in pain. It hasn't long to live, and it's last days will be filled with agony and frustration. I love this pet... but I fear it is time to let it go...

We must change something... It may already be to late.



</question>



<additional details>



Another quote:



"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
-Thomas Jefferson

I don't think that quote is directed solely at outside sources. I think the founding fathers understood, revolution, and consistent change of government is the true source of freedom. Thus the second amendment.



And the actual question, and purpose for the monologue...

Do you believe America is Ill? Do you think we are drawing near the end of our existence, like Rome, enjoying a relatively short, powerful existence, and burning out at the end?

The powers are conspiring for sure!  I don't get into the whole conspiracy view of 9/11 (some truth could be there though) but I definitely believe things are not what they seem!

Very Nice. Yes we have been taken over. It started in the 50's and McCarthy with the "Commie" witch hunt. Kennedy's parade route was changed at the last minute and then slowed down. Who had the power to do that? Kennedy was killed because he wasn't going to escalate America's involvement in 'Nam. That war would have been over by 1965.

They like war and chaos. It makes them money.

Hope my answer helps

The assassination of JFK, RFK, and MLK. The killings at Kent State. The deaths of millions of innocent Vietnamese. The deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis and the displacement of millions. We jumped the tracks many moons ago and are now careening out of control. I, too, am in pain over the direction this country has taken. We are being manipulated by divisive culture wars mediated by the mass media and false patriotism without sacrifice to fight the real wars against our unilateralism and economic excesses.  Ironically, the Republicans believe in economic Darwinism, but are opposed to teaching it in our schools.  Conversely, the liberals/progressives believe in altruism and the power of working together towards a common goal that betters us all.  I don't understand why that is a bad thing. As long as the Raging Right pronounces altruism capitulation, this is where we end up --  a mean-spirited country that celebrates ignorance and venality as virtues.
