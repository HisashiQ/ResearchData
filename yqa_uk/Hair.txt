Pink hair sounds kinda hot!



Anyways, keep washing your hair, over time it'll fade, if it doesn't work, next time you dye it don't leave the dye in your hair as long...I'm a guy and am ashamed I know this  :(

You can blowdry using a large round brush, you can also try doing it with straighteners (I use curlers when I want a more 'angel curl' look but I use straighteners when I want them to be looser'. To be honest the only way to get those big lovely curls is coke-can sized rollers! And they take ages to dry!

Toilet roll tube!  Clip it to your hair after rolling your hair round it, let your hair dry around it (obviously can't be soaking wet anyway, as the toilet roll tube will disintegrate in your hair) and hair spray it, then release. Mind you, it depends how many you have readily available!

Once washed your hair, when it is wet put your hair in lots of plats or a very messy bun, leave in for one hour or more, then gently take out , do not brush. If it is dry, wavy or curly put hairspray on it to hold it in.



Or try using styling gel and see if you can make your curls from that with no need for hairspray!

Your hair must be in really bad condition for this to happen.  If you say you put it in a ponytail, and you've used conditioners while swimming, then I really don't know why it's so tangled.  Seems quite unrealistic to me.



Yes, the chlorine is really hard on hair.  But a good shampoo after being in the pool will fix that.  Be sure to use one made for removing chlorine.  There used to be a really good rinse from RedKen and Jhirmack that will remove the chlorine coating on the hair, but I don't know if they make it anymore.



Of course, you know that your hair is more fragile when it is wet, so take care when combing out the tangles.  You know that you start from the ends, right?  If you used the correct products, there should be no problem.  Without seeing your hair, and what you are doing, I can't help any further.  The only other thing I can suggest is wearing a bathing cap.  You may think they are ugly, but that really is the only way to protect your hair from the water.  All serious swimmers wear them. Try these:

HAIR HELP!!!! Anyone know of any treatments which will colour my hair and make the split ends go away?



I've recently dyed my hair very dark brown straight from white blonde. I took my hairdressers advice and dyed it red first, then put dark brown dye straight over the top... It went fine, but now my hair is snapping, and some random bits of my hair have gone a purple pink colour.
I really really don't want to dye my hair again using chemical products, and i can't stand the site of the split ends, especially in the front where my once lovely side fringe is now higher than my eyebrows and full of split hairs...



Any ideas on treatments or haircare plans I can do to return to what was once thick, shiny, good conditon hair?



I've thought about henna but i'm not sure whether it would take the pink tone out on the lengths of my hair?



Also, I know cutting the split ends is the sensible idea, but the top layers of my hair have snapped so that they're only an inch long anyway....



Hellpppp!!!!

go to the salon and buy a deep conditioning treatment they are around 4.00 for the little pack.  Then get good hair products. I don't understand why your hair would break off from dying it dark. There are no ammonia's or bleach in the dark colors.  I could see if you were bleaching it and it started breaking.  you are just going to have to baby your hair back to health.  good luck

The purple hair means it has been over processed.  Did you color your hair at home?  The at home products tend to be more harsh on your hair, or maybe it's just that hairdressers know how to protect hair better.  I wouldn't color your hair again.  I have learned that the "wash out" hair colors that last for 24 shampoos seem to be a lot easier on hair.  Hair can be deep conditioned which will help with the effects you have, but you can't "fix" the hair.  You have to wait for it to grow out and cut it off.  Sorry you had such a bad experience.

Was your hair in poor condition before you coloured it?  Because dying it brown would not do this much damage on just one application of dye.



What you first need to do is go to a salon and have a good few inches taken off your hair.  Then buy a GENTLE shampoo and a good conditioner and a intensive conditioning treatment.



Use all these on your hair for the next few months..DO NOT DYE YOUR HAIR AGAIN!!!! DONT USE THOSE 24 WASHES EITHER!  If you really need to colour your hair you need to use temp wash in/out colours and just keep reapplying them every week/whenever you need.



Go back to your hairdressers every 4/6 weeks until you begin to see an improvement in the condition.  If you dont want to do all this and want a fresh start now is your chance to try that new short crop that Victoria beckham is wearing!...personally if my hair was breaking off so close to my head like you say it is, that is what i would do anyway.

Use a deep conditioner every day - one that comes in a big tub that you leave on for about 3 min's.



Trim the ends but don't cut hair too short , just keep trimming as it grows or you will have very short hair.



Blonde hair doesn't show up split ends as much so maybe your hair wasn't in as good condition as you had thought before you dyed it darker.



Dye it a lighter brown with a semi permanent colour that doesn't bleach the hair.



I would suggest you visit a different hairdresser and make it very clear that you don't want your hair cut short, frequent visits to have hair trimmed, gently coloured and deep conditioned should sort you out and while you are waiting for your hair to grow out buy some clip in hair extensions from ebay and then plait your hair to hide the natural ends.

Hey,



I know its probably not what you want to hear but you should probably cut the split ends out. You can try a split ends treatment program: http://beauty.about.com/cs/haircare1/tp/...  but eventually your gonna have to cut them out anyway so best to do it now instead.



You shouldn't be thinking about dyeing your hair again so soon it sounds like your hair has had a bad reaction to it already so dyeing it again even with Henna is a bad idea. You may end up with even more damaged hair and it could also turn a funny colour. (Green, or Silver Grey etc)



For professional advice you should visit your local hairdresser and ask if there's anything they can do! They may be able to strip the dye out of your hair and minimize the cutting of the split ends.



Was the dye permanent or wash out?

treatments which will colour my hair and make the split ends go away does not exist, what you need is deep nourishment of the scalp.
Try a lotion and shampoo called Ziravie, plus check their website which gives a combination  of fruits and vegetables that  helps to strengthen the hair roots internally.
The lotion that I use helps to accelerate hair growth but it is a process first it calms the scalp, itching reduces, then with discipline use hair fall stops, within 3 weeks of use the hair roots strengthens and you start to see volume and silkiness.
Once you do the treatment you can do hair dyes but just one hair colur every three weeks.
The website is www.ziravie.com but I bought it in Spain and now it is available on ebay.co.uk

You won't want to mix henna with the chemical coloring already on your hair. For color I STRONGLY suggest making an appointment at a salon that is experienced with color. Call around and tell them what's going on and see if they can handle it.



You may want to consider getting a cute new haircut to help get rid of the damage. There isn't a miracle treatment to make your hair the way it was before all the dyeing.

Definitely go a darker brown. You have dark eyes and eye brows, so it'd blend so well with your features.
Don't go too close to black, just a bit darker than your hair already is.

Why is it automatically boring just because its light brown? I think its quite a unique colour, so many people do exactly that and dye it brown or blonde, but brown and blonde are boring, everyone is brown or blonde, keep it like that, suits you. Experiment with cuts instead, maybe a fringe, curl it, put lil strips of colour in it that wash out, or go short

Go try finding youtube videos, many instructional videos. To blend, you have to rock the clippers quickly with a 1. Takes practice, start long until you get to the desired length.

start with the longest number first, then push the leaver on the clippers down that will make the grade slightly longer, then change to the next size clipper head down repeat process and you will find by not going as far up the hair each time that it fades it in perfectly for you.....

With a comb? Ouch. That really won't work very well, and won't really make it straight. Your best bet is a vented hair brush. Round bristle brushes work best. As to the time, that all depends on how wet your hair is when you start, how powerful your hair dryer is, and how thick your hair is.



You should never try to blow dry your hair straight out of the shower, even if you've toweled it off pretty thoroughly. It's just too wet. You'll need to really squeeze all the water out and dry it as well as possibel with a towel and wait about ten minutes or so before starting. It should almost be 'damp' and not 'wet' or no blowdrier in the world is going to have much success.



keep in mind that it takes practice to find a blowdrying method that works for you without giving you any stick-up hairs or funny kinks. I have thick, fine, long hair and after combing it out upside-down with a pick, I blow dry it upside down with a large round vented boar-bristle brush. When it's almost completely dry, I flip over and blow dry a bit that way around my face anf at the end to get a good shape with lots of body.

Blow drying!



After you've washed your hair, pat it with a towel and dry it for a couple of minutes, so it is not completely dry and it is damp.



Next, get a hairbrush (one of those round hairbrushes are best for this - if you're not sure what I'm talking about, I mean one like this: http://shop.fredsegalbeauty.com/images/p...



If you have an attachment for your hairdryer that is like this one, that is ON the hairdryer: http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...
...use this.  If you don't have this, you'll just have to use the hairdryer normally!
Put the hairdryer on high and get a section of your hair on the brush.  Slowly, dry your hair on this section, moving the hairbrush down as you do so, so that section is straight.



Do this on all of your hair.  Good luck!

well i only no of a few. there are creams and mousses that can be used as well as shampoos and conditioners. Another way is blow drying it straight. You may have seen at hairsalons, they blow dry your hair to the effect and style you want. If you buy a rounded curling brush and have a good blow dryer... you blow dry itby pulling your hair down if that makes sense. It might be easier to understand if you go to a salon yourself and ask. hope this helps :)

orr...you could just use a hair straightening product.  the body shop ha a good ones, and so does garnier which you can apply to dry or wet hair and they actually work!  especially the body shop one on dry hair.
or you could by l'oreal studio line curling mousse which i use when i can't be bothered to straighten my hair with straighteners.  I just wet my hair a tiny bit and apply it and my hair looks AMAZING.  seriously....you should use it. and yeh, or you could use the annoying way and get a round brush and a blowdryer and blowdry it straight. but that sucks cos it takes so long. so yeh. im 15 and thats what i do lol.  hope this helps :)

Naturally, her hair is a light brown but it's been some sort of shade of blonde, and about shoulder length, with big 80's bangs for about as long as I can remember!  My dad wants her to go red and it's my job to pick the style.  Can ya help?



here's a photo of the way she looks now:  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...

<additional details>



Just a comment on the picture:



It's about six months old.  She'd decided to grow those bangs out for a while (and we were all grateful) but alas....they're back!  And she looks fine with bangs, really...just she tends to have them way too long..and too curled...and too hairsprayed-unnaturally-up. lol

Your mom is a cutie!  It's so sweet of you to help her get herself up to date.  I def agree that red would work for her (maybe a 6R with a little bit of copper).  As far as a cut, because she has a round face I suggest a choppy layered, long bob with some angular face framing.  Her hair texture is nice and the layers will make it easy for her to pump it up a little.

Red would look awesome on her!  Just make sure it isn't too intense, her best bet is to go auburn with a few subtle copper streaks.  It looks like even though she's been lightening it for a while, it's still really healthy, which means she can keep it fairly long.  I think that if you can get her to do some side-swept bangs (get the stylist to teach her how to do them so she doesn't look like 1985), that plus the color will give her a whole new look!

How do you get your hair pale pink? pic.?



It's a two-part question.
I have medium brown hair, and I would never dye it pink before going white/blonde first. Is it better to dye multiple times with regular blonde dye, or multiple times with bleach dye?



And how do you get pale pink color, rather than bright pink? There doesn't seem to be any permanent pale pink dye on market.



I want it exactly like this:

Okay since you got the bleaching down.
Just use manic panic. cotten candy pink.
leave in hair for an hour. then aplly heat for 15 min.
rinse.



pour remaning color in your shampoo and re-dye about every 3 weeks.



Since pink is a form of red its not going to last long. I wish it would though. keeping its kinda a hassle.
but I love being a pinky&lt;3

Any time you go lighter you need to go to a stylist. Bleaching can ruin your hair if done incorrectly. You would need the hair stylist strip your hair then dye it over with a pale pink, take a picture in and show them and ask them if they can do the service for you. First you should have a consultation to see what condition your hair is in and if it's well enough to bleach the dye, you could also ask them to do a strand test. I highly recommend to not do this at home.

Put the lemon juice on whatever parts you want, leave it for an hour, then wash it off.



Do this for a couple of weeks, and the highlights should appear gradually.



Make sure you put the lemon juice all the way up to your roots!

Pink will fade within a week and requires a LOT of upkeep, but it's fun to have it for a while.



If you're thinking of going pink, because your hair is so light, I would advise you asked your hairdresser to put light pink through it, NOT bright, as this will be a horrible contrast.



I would have said the light blonde would have been nice, but so many people opt for this, if you want to try something different I would try the pink for a change, but don't be disheartened when it doesn't last long.



Try not to mess about with your hair too much, as too much bleaching causes damage and the hair to snap.

A little styling gel and a round spiky brush should help you get the effect you need.  You need to roll the brush backwards through your gelled hair to get it to rise and fall backwards slightly over the brush and then when it gets to the right height, pull back the rest of the way and let it fall naturally.



I may be a guy, but it's a trick that was taught to me when I stopped parting my hair and started coming it straight back and needed to get a lift in it so it would stop clinging to the top of my head.

Which part of the Philippines are you? The thing is, it's not the name of the salon you need to go to, instead, you need to look for a hairdresser that will know your hair. I've been to every salon myself and would you believe a no name salon with a gay hairdresser cuts my hair beautifully? Keep on experimenting on different hairdresser til you find the one that can cut your hair nicely.

i really doubt youre gonna get your hair any lighter than that. if anything try a violet based toner (it wont turn your hair purple.) this will cancel out the yellow in your hair.



as for the damage try Redken Extreme products. you can find them at just about any salon. these products are awesome. i use them myself. they bond damaged hair back together so it can become more healthy.

In my experience they have no "official" expiry date
but i have had old ones and gone to use them and they have changed colour and have dried up bits floating in them and looked yuck
hence i did not use them



so if it still smells/looks the same id say it should be okay

If you want a really short haircut, try a short side parted pixie. It is a bold haircut that is simple yet stylish and shows a lot of self confidence. If you have the courage, ask to have it cut above the collar and high on the ears with bangs and lots of layer. It is a very popular cut right now. Go for it!

Ginger hair!! HELP!!!!?



I've got gingery/strawberry blonde hair and just dyed it but its gone really wrong. I've been wanted to dye it blonde for ages now but was scared it would go a brighter shade of ginger, eventually i finally plucked up the courage and dyed it using "nice n easy". Big mistake though as it changed the blonde parts of my hair into a nice looking blonde but then has darkened my natural ginger highlights! It looks so bad and I don't know what to do. I really want to dye it a dark brown so that it will hide the ginger but im way to pale to pull it off. So what colour should i go for that will hide my ginger hair but wont make me look even more pale than i all ready am? I'll now probably be getting it done by a professional but if you have any box suggestions then that would also be great Thanks =]

I haven't taken a picture yet with my new dyed hair lol But This Is what My Hair Looked Like Before- Altho Its More Ginger In Real Life
As You Can See Im Quite Pale So What Colour Would Suit Me Best?

its a bit hard to help you without a picture



I say wait a few weeks before you dye your hair again because you will kill it :)



try using semi perment to see how it looks then you can wash it out if you dont like it !!



like you said the best is going to the hair dresser
Or shave it all off haha and go buzzed or bald LOL



hope this helped

why r u tryna hide it for?? i've been wantin' ginger hair 4 ages, lol. anyways, if u really wanna hide it, i should just give some advice on how 2 do it i guess, after all i'm not ur mom or anything... well dye it brown, not 2 dark but a normal, solid brown. i've got naturally pale skin w/ dark chestnut hair & very dark (black-ish) eyes, & it doesn't look so bad - w/ some bright jewel-toned make up, it'll look cool.

A friend did the same thing and she looked like a ginger cat for a week before she could afford to pay for a professional fix it for her, we were hard pressed not to laugh at her. They had to put in a red filler mixed with a brown colour, thankfully it looked natural after hairdresser had finished. I think it cost her about $60 to have it fixed.



I would check the Nice & Easy box for a contact number, and ask them what is the best thing to do, just in case you have thrown the box out I found a link below, which does have links to other countries.



You could also do as my friend did and seek the advice of a hairdresser, but it may cost a bit.



Good luck

Since this seems to be your first time, i suggest you go get it done in a salon, and while having a conversation with the hairdresser, ask her what kind of color is she using or you can even ask what kind of color will suit you. This way, you'll know what to do on your own next time.

well sometimes its hard being blonde takes a few bleaches to get there with some damage but hair grows and there deep conditioning treatments to help fix that....id either re-bleach your hair to get to more of a lighter shade or if you wanna be brunette do it the one thing i love about being brunette is looking so pale rather than tanned or maybe im just weird lol
but pale ppl can look really pretty and pull it off brunette...
like you can go see my myspace pics with dark hair and just ignore all my other pics of blonde blue and orange hair lol....

Best bet would be to go to a salon, before putting on something else and then changing it to a different color, it is easier to correct a color gone bad if it has only been done once, once you keep on trying to fix it yourself it can go from worse to horrid.  Without a photo I can't tell where it has gone.  All they may have to do is weave in some blond highlights but I can't be sure without a photo.  You can actually just go talk to someone and see what they say.  You don't have to get your hair done right then and there you could just get some advice.  (Remember when you go to a salon if you don't like the person you don't have to stay once you sit in that chair, you can still get up and leave) Dark brown will hide everything but since you aren't a brown naturally you may not like it.

it is amazing, it lasts FOREVER, and it is ceramic also which is good for your hair, but not cheap quality ceramic like conair and paul mitchell.



a bit more expensive then your average target straightner, but worth it!



it doesn't even damage your hair, and it leaves hair soft and smooth

I do the same thing. If your hair is dry it helps thin the gel out a bit and gets it more evenly through the hair. I'd suggest putting it in when your hairs damp though, but either or is fine.

I think it will be great!  just remember you will have more styling to do in the morning.  Normally your hair just won't go like that. If you haven't had it layered in a while, just remember why you grew it out, because if you don't like that cut it will take a while for it grow back out again.



But I would say go for it, it is a fun hairstyle

Try curling your hair but not too much.
They should look gorgeous so dont tie them, just keep them open but in a pretty way.

You should use conditioner on the LENGTH of your hair and TIPS...
and rinse rinse rinse until it almost feels like you haven't used conditioner at all, after a good rinse you hair should feel like it did before you put any product on it; just wet like when you go swimming. Your hair SHOULD NOT feel slippery or gooey.



Secondly - perhaps your hair doesn't like the type of shampoo and conditioner you are using...



Oh, and finally - the ammount of condioner you should be using is MINIMAL no where near as much as the ammount of shampoo you use!



Let me know how it goes please ;)

I leave mine down, my brother GF told me if you have it tightly done up while you sleep it can cause damage & subsequently fall out.



Maybe put it loosely up? Or why not try straightening it? Mine is fuzzy, but I wash, dry & straighten it everyday.

You can try wearing a hair net/shower cap.
Or use a hair/head band.
You can also tie it at the very longest possible place where almost all or the hair strands are equal in length.
You can also try braiding your hair, but it might take some time.



If you want you can straighten it, as in the long-lasting one that you get in hair salons or you can do the ironing one.
If you don't really mind, then just put it down, so your hair, your scalp, and your head can rest.

Layered hair is harder to straighten but it is worth it because it looks much more bouncier than hair that is just cut straight and layered hairstyles look great because they bring more volume to your hair

To look after layered hair i recommend you use Pantene's new range just for layered hair called Pantene Pro-V Enhanced Layers. It keeps the layers healthy and full of life.

My sister's hair doesn't like to curl either.



She puts those soft form curlers in her freshly washed hair and leaves them there overnight, or until her hair is dry.



Then she uses the curling iron.



Usually the curl will stay in until the end of the day, but not always.



The "quick" way to curl her hair is to use hot steam curlers.



Sometimes she'll get a hair permed with a wave so she does have to bother with all that.

Well if your hair is naturally curly and you dont have any tools,
you could try making ringlets around your fingers when its wet and letting it dry like that.



You can also go out and buy mousse or serum, or something that will help it curl.



Hope this helped!



EDIT: Sorry you said you did have a straightener!



Theres videos on the internet on how to curl your hair with a straightener.
Or ask a hairdresser, they'll know.
I have a CHI and it works great for curling!

You can do it with straightners.. you wrap it around the straightners...



but beware... do the curls tighter than you actually want them because they will start falling out...

Does the Chi straightener, straighten all hair the same way?



when I use a regular straightener...my hair comes out straight but it takes too long and the next day its messy and puffy. will the chi straightener help? does the hair stay smooth, slick and shiny?
also, does it ruin your hair badly if its ceramic covered?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Well I have puffy, wavy, curly hair.
Yes, its terrible.



And I use a CHI.
With my hair, I usually re-straighten it the next day because when I sleep it kind of gets flippy.
And if its humid, its just horrid.



But I'm sure with correct serums and if your hair isnt super thick like mine, then it should stay the same the next day.



It works for my friends the next day, so it will probably for you too.

Getting a hair cut need a new style?



I need a good idea for a hair cut
To see my pic follow this link: http://profiles.yahoo.com/caitlinhenders...



The pic was taken ages ago my hair is scruffy now. Oh and id straighten'd my hair there as well so its not always like that



I'm not allowed to dye, even If I was It would cost to much or If I did it I would stuff it up. If its past neck length I wake up and its curled up at the shoulders and looks gay. I also a main lead in a show at the end of this year and my charcter is a olden day wife, its my first shot at being a lead and I want to look good.



Some Idea's i came up with are
*Bob (with fringe) use a curler an curl it in wards
*neck length,largish side fringe, spikey

long hair with side part, shortish fringe, it goes best with your face shape, you need to add a darker shade of brown, maybe some highlights as well. also add more volume, instead of straightening with a hair straightener you should blow dry your hair straight, this will add volume.
no matter what the cost, looking good is feeling good

When you straighten your hair, how long does it last?

Totally depends on the straightener that you use, the type of hair you have, the type of products that you use and environmental conditions such as humidity, rain etc.  If you are talking about permanent straightening then that actually grows out but make sure you make endless enquiries before considering the permanent option I am aware of some horrendous outcomes.

Depends on how curly/thick your hair is.
I usually do mine about half an hour before i leave, after i do my makeup
and it lasts all day, and my hair is pretty long & thick
also depends on the straightener & temp.

What straightening irons are they? It really does depend. If you have split ends, then it's not gonna stay straight all day, whereas, if you use some products, like LoReal HotStraight product, it would work wonders. But yeah, it depends on the humidity outside, the thickening of your hair sections, and how hot your straighteners are. And weather they're Ceramic or not. I prefer Ceramic because it slides smoothly.

You should of got some of this with your hair dye? It comes with the dye usually. Once you've had your dye in for the recommended time rinse all the dye out shampoo and apply the conditioner for 2 minutes then rinse.

You have the same eyecolour and skin tone as me.
I have tried loads of different colours over the years and i found the best colour that really brings out the 'grey/blue' of my eyes is a gorgeous dark glossy brown - almost an 'off' black....NOT permanent black! Because you will be too pale to take it but a 'soft' kinda black that you can achieve using those wash in/out colours.

well i suggest you get a porcelain hair straightener. i know its a common notion that ironing your hair regularly is bad for your hair, but not really. porcelain does not damage your hair unlike those iron ones, and is actually better for everyday use than using products like hairspray. and with it, you can just iron out the unruly parts of your hair, giving you a more natural straight look, unlike the stiff look that hairspary can sometimes give you. as an added bonus, porcelain iron gives your hair a natural shine. i hope that helps~ good luck! :)

My mom doesn't think im ready to dye my hair but i do, am i?



My mom has hated the thought of me getting my hair dyed, i'm 13 and all my other friends have dyed their hair completely like fifty times and i'm the only one who hasn't. I really want to dye it black, because my hair is dark brown but it's already turning gray from genetics.
I just finished writing a four and a half page hand-written paper on why i should be allowed to, comparing it to all the other things i could ask for like getting my lip pierced or having some sort of surgery.



I also explain how i only have this year to express my style fully because i am going to a really strict high school next year and i won't be allowed to have fun with my hair or clothes while i go, so i want to get it all out this year. I'm only asking for this year, and it's not going to be crazy.



She always says no because i look older than i am already, but i think i'm mature enough to do this, it's just my hair and we can change it back any time.



Do you think my mom is right or am i asking for too much?



</question>



<additional details>



&gt;_&gt; um i don't want my lip pierced or any kind of surgery, i was just comparing dying my hair to them. . .



And i'm not following the crowd, i hate my hair how it is right now and it's not because my friends dyed their hair black, my friend dani had blonde hair and dyed it brown, i'm just saying that my other friends were ALLOWED to.

Dying your hair can cause hair loss at an early age and give you cancer but if your hair is turning slightly grey from genetics, I completely agree with you! I would buy one of those non permanent dyes from Wella ( the colour goes after a few washes) and then try that first to see if it looks to grown up on you.
Maybe you could dye your hair the same colour as you have now to disguise the grey hair. Then you could see if you really need black hair!!

I had a similar problem when I was 13. I wanted to cut my hair short but my mom wanted it to stay long. I told her my hair will always grow back, but I really wanted to cut it on my own, not because of friends at school. My mom said I could cut it but she won't do it, and if I make a mistake it's my mistake that i'll have to live with (she assumed i'd cut it bad).



Anyway, mind your mother. All you can do is ask her respectfully. If you can give her reason to believe that you are ready then go for it. But in her eyes right now, she might see your current reasons as excuses.



Ask your mother if you guys can come to a compromise. Someone mentioned earlier a dye you can wash out? That shouldn't be a problem? Tell your mom that if she doesn't like then you won't get it done permanently, but ask if you could keep it up with the temporary. If she see that you're that determined, she just may change her mind.
Hope this helped.

If you want to do it just do it, but I will warn you, as someone who died my hair at 12, you need to do it every 3 months from then and you feel the need to change your hair all the time..you kind of get addicted to it. I had highlights when I was 12, again a year later, since then my hair has been purple, red, orange, black, brown, blue, grey over and over again. Now it's a mixture of colours because once you put in colour it stays there. It's sort of red/brown with blonde/red highlights. It's a mess! I did it 3 weeks ago and already want it chnaged!



Unless you just want to keep it as black hair all your life I'd say don't do it.

Hair help, colour problemo....



i dyed my hair in june, it is naturally blonde-a really nice blonde aswell, and i dyed it chestnut. btw, it was semi permanent, 8washes kind of thing. anyway, its faded to a kind of coppery brown but the ends and roots are blonde, the ends are like that cos i did a bad job of dying it. but now im really wanting to speed up the fading process, does anyone have any tips? i want to do it faast but naturally you know, so shampoo recommendations or natural products would be great! i dont want to strip it cos ive heard thats really bad for your hair. thanks!

Don't try to dye it lighter!  Going from dark to light is very tricky and you would need to go to a professional to do that.  Try dish washing liquid and do a deep conditioner after.  If your afraid of dish washing liquid, you can use Prell (it's a strong shampoo, but a little easier on your hair.)  You can also reduce the "coppery" look by using a violet colored shampoo, like "So Silver" by Matrix.

What can I do with my hair?



My hair is very annoying to deal with. It is dark brown, curly [spiral looking curls] and thick. It also is very dry looking, and when I brush it, it becomes frizzy. I can't cut it short, because when it is short, it turns into a triangular shaped afro. LOL.



I don't know many people with my hair type, but the people that do manage to manage it have grown it out very long. It seems to look good that way. My hair is shoulder length, but cut in a strange way.



First off, how can I grow my hair out, what cheap black hair dye would you recommend, and how can I keep my hair from looking and feeling so dry? [Oh, and how can I keep the frizziness at bay?] Any additional info would also be appreciated.[Such as gothic/fantasy hair styles I could use. That is the only thing I have been able to do with my hair so far, make it look Goth. Lol.]
Thanks in advance!

One way you can grow out your hair is by taking vitamin supplements specifically for hair growth [you can find them at your local grocery shop, pharmacy, ect.] or by in-taking foods enriched with vitamins [such as fruits, veggies, beans, rice, ect.]. Another way to grow your hair out quickly is by taking regular daily vitamins, having a good diet, drinking lots water, and having adequate sleep. Also, trim hair when needed to get rid of split ends, and try not to damage hair to much.

A cheap black dye that I recommend is  the 'Herbal Essences' brand. It only costs around 10/12 dollars and lasts long. Go here : http://www.clairol.com/herbalessences/vi...



to figure out which of their products is best for you. [Start off by choosing your desired hair color/shade(click on a hair color and then proceed to the next step)  ]

To keep your hair from feeling so dry you can try using shampoo and conditioner for your specific hair type. Since your hair is curly and thick I would recommend using Pantene's Curls 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner. It:



* Protect waves, curls, corkscrews and spirals while controlling frizz



* Prep hair for styling, leaving it lively, moisturized and defined



Also, a gothic/fantasty hair style I recommend is making it big, so tease your hair alot [the big hair emphasizes the romantic and mysterious look and feel] and you can either leave it curly or straight. You can also just have the nice sleek do, or you can try to get the Amy Lee look. In addition, use dark make-up colors.

noooo, those things do nothing. especially the ones that try to identify your "face shape." not very many people have a perfectly oval face or a completely square one. so, going to your stylist and asking her/his opinion on what hair you should get is a much better bet. you'll be happier than if you try to "diagnose" your own face.

They both basically go by the same rules and will tell you the same thing. It is just about where your hair needs to fall and curl and such to accent your face. Same with color and style. Here is a website that might help you choose a haircut. This kind of thing helped me :-)

I am a cosmetologist, and I have never used such a software. In my experiences, I have noticed that even with all the education I have recieved through beauty school, people rarely ask for a haircut that "matches" there face shape, and that's okay! No matter how advanced the software, the client is always right and they will ALWAYS know what suits them best. A hairstyle detremine by software may not be a style that will be easily maintained for the client on a daily basis, then what? You have a client who is not happy at all.

How do I convince my mom to let me thin my hair out?



My hair is so so so thick and it takes me about an hour to straighten it and when I do straighten it, it comes out puffy, it's not that I don't know how to do my hair because I do but my mom is unconvinced and she doesn't understand how hard it is to deal w/. All I want to do is thin it out and she refuses to let me do that. How do I convince her to let me do it?

I already have layers in my hair, it didn't make a huge difference.. and stupid people I said I know how to do my hair and I do.. I take it by sections and do it by layers and I have used every product imaginable and none of them work.. I do blow dry my hair for a long time too and I do it as much as I can to make it flat, it does come out flat sometimes but it doesn't hold and starts to get out of control, I'm tired of having to put it in a pony tail every day...



and can anyone find me any pictures of before and after thinned out hair so I can show my mom that it doesn't make a huge difference.

ok so you say u know how to straighten ur hair properly, well if thats the case regardless how thick it is it shud not come out puffy! so Ill give u a few tips just in case u never know u might learn summit here lol, spray heat straightening spray onto ur hair before u dry it, take small sections of the hair, and blowdry under, do this all over until hair is fully dry, get some hair straightening spray which is specifically designed to be used with ur irons and now lightly spray ur hair with this, again take small sections of hair, starting from the underneath to the top and straighten do this all over until ur hair is straight! to finish off take some hair serum just a small spot into the palm of ur hand and rub ur hands together so u have an even amount on both hands, be careful not to over do it with the serum as its oil or it will make ur hair look greasy! smooth ur hair straight down, voila poker straight hair and no puff ball cheers Gilly x

Is she afraid that it won't look right?? or what is making her object to the thinning of your hair???



You can thin your hair out without even seeing a difference, but you will feel it. It will be much easier to style and cope with.

You could also get layers put in your hair, and that will make it easier to style, but you will see a difference with that option.

Try to explain to mom that it will not hurt your hair to thin it out. It will make your life alot easier also.

Ask her to see some other peoples hair that she has cut before you let her touch yours. This way you have some sort of an idea of how good she is. If you don't mind being a experiment then go ahead. There's a 50/50 chance that you won't like it though.

I think you should trust her, but don't let her cut it too short so that even if she does mess it up there will be room for it be fixed. Also. maybe you should wait until like tuesday or something to let her do it so that if she does ruin it you can get it re-cut the next day and you won't have to live with it for too long!

Well if you really trust her and are in a daring mood go for it! You have the possibility of getting it fixed if you don't like it and it's great fun. shows your friend you really trust her. Being spontaneous is good, and if she does hairdressing there's a better chance you will like it. Just make sure its what you really want. Good luck! ^^

Get her to trim it first and check to make sure it's even and looks good.
If it does look good, let her keep going.
If it's  poorly done at least it's fixable and you can get a pro to do it:)

How can I get my hair like the lead singer in this video?



The video is We Apologise For Nothing-Fightstar

And the lead singer is Charlie Simpson.
Has his hair got anything done to it or is has it just grown like that?
I love the bits that flick out if you know what I mean, is it just because he has thick hair or something else?

looks like he has really thick hair, cut with thinning scissors to make it irregular like that, hence it sticks out, I guess he uses wax on the tips to help define the sticky out bits you like so much.

If your hair is short like his, and you want the little bits teh flick out, use a good hair wax.
Rub it in your hands and apply it to your hair.
Once you get your hair in place, blast it with some hairspray.

Watch the video and find a part where his hair looks reallly good. Press the print screen button, go on to a document page or a place where you can paste the picture.Then print this picture out or if you don;t have a printer send it to a friend to print it out.Then bring this picture to a hairdresser or stylist and ask them about it.They know there stuff more than I do :)

WAXING. !!! its THE best. if you wax your hair will stop growning because you pull it from the roots and the roots get destroyed.i live in the U.S. i buy it from walmart it cost only 5-10 dollars. its really good and the hair doesnt grow untill 8 weeks. please dont use shavers. it will make it more and stronger.

Hair removal can be of two methods one is epilation and second is depilation First one removes hair entirely and the second one removes the hair thats above the surface of the skin. If you want to remove hair permanently or for a long time, you have to choose the first option. Epilation methods are

Plucking

Would Japanese straightening wreck my hair?



I am looking for something that will be easier on my hair, without using the traditional perm and relaxer because my Afro hair is quite a length for the texture that it is, I don't want it to break off.
By using Japanese straightening will it break my hair?
It is currently just below my shoulder.

as long as you use it how the instructions say it should be fine, i would advice for you to use products which are designed for problems like this tho there are loads of them around now a days.
if you have any concerns ask your local hair dresser as there will be able to give best advice, also if you use goggle search for hair tips there will be quite a lot of help.

I have thick mid-lenght hair and it doesn't stay straight. How can I get it so straight? I have ghds, use all the sprays, blow dry and I have tried everything but I don't want it chemically straightened, I'm too young.  It gets to a stage in school were it is all fluffy and curls under and sticks out.

I think people should embrace their natural hair.
But sometimes I know that doesn't work coz my hair naturally just goes annoying and wavy, but when i wash sometimes I scrunch it and twirl it into ringlets with my fingers and I think that can look really nice.

you could get it permanentlyy straightened at hair salon, i know a few people who have had it done and it works. I think they put perm lotion on and brush it through, its kinda the referce of a perm so will grow out eventually.

Try washing up liquid or washing powder/liquid.
I asked my hairdresser the same question yesterday - had chosen medium brown in a semi-permanent, and it looks more dark chocolate (apparently semi's come up darker than they claim they're going to look!).
She says they use this same method in the salon to strip colour off hair.
Just remember to deep condition afterwards.

No, there isn't any problem if you protect it by wearing a hat and using a good shampoo. This is the first time I have heard that the hair can change into different colours because of the sun, and I live in South America, where we have sunny days almost always. That makes no sense...

when you dye your hair blonde he bleach damages it and if left on too long kills it.
In the water all the chemicals, chlorine may turn your hair green though it will return to normal.
fall out? Only if you have had the bleach in too long but your hair is essentially damaged at the moment due to the bleach so don't wash it every single day! This removes all the natural oils from your hair drying it out and causing it to split and break. I've never heard of hair losing all colour but the sun lightens your hair so they may be talking about losing the colour you now are but only lighter.
Try and use deep conditioning masks if you can and not straighten it or heat style it that much it also damages your hair instead let it sit natural, scrunch or pin it up all look good, do this atleast until you return home to sunny..sunny..briton

There really is no age limit on white hair.
Does his father have white hair? 
If so how long has he had it. 
Did anyone in your family have it early?
If those don't answer your question,
it could just be bleached by the sun!
You may think it's white hair but could be really light blonde.
Hope this helps!

There are any number of reasons why hair will lose pigment. Scarring to the scalp from a bump or cut can damage the hair folicles and cause new growth to come in white.

There is a medical condition, Melanin, that causes loss of pigment in the skin and hair.



There is also a hair loss conditions called Alopecia Areata. Some time this will be cause a temporary loss of hair but may cause permenant loss of pigment.



I wouldn't worry too much about 1 hair turning white. If he continues to get more then you may want to take him to a dermatologist.

If it's that long, then scoop it up and clip it at the back of your head.
Or collect it with the rest of your hair and put in a pony tail.

How do i get my hair curly like Cheryl Coles?(Links to pictures)?



Hi,
I want to do my hair in loose curls at the bottom. I have curled my hair before with large curlers but it never looks like that, and it is always clogged up with hairspray to keep the curls in all night which doesn't make it bounce or look natural. Does anyone know how Cheryl (obviously her stylist) achieves this look?, it looks so glossy and natural as well, like there is no hair spray in it.
Thanks in advance!

Extra Large Hot rollers from Walmart.. I'm a hairstylist and use them all the time for that look, just section your hair the size of the rollers and and roll up and place on top of your head , so when they fall , they will have volume, make sure you use a mouse or light style cream to hold..

Well for the first and second what you need to do is apply chi silk infusion to your hair (optional). Then take a straightener and go straight down with it and the bring it upwards in the direction you want the kind of half curl in. Do this to the rest of your hair and add some hairspray for hold. This works for me hopefully it will for you ;). For the third you can either use a curler or a skinny straightener. Just drag the straightener down to the end of your hair and then roll it up while the hair is in it. Use the same technique with the curler, it should work better with a curler. This also works for me. You can use silk infusion by chi with this style as well it makes your hair feel soft and glossy.

-Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner.
-Apply a styling gel.
-Blow dry and style your hair the way you want it.
-Use a small curling iron and curl the bottom layers of your hair in small pieces.
-Spritz on small hair spray, and gently brush it out.
(not so the curl comes out, but so the curls are looser)
-If they don't stay, use a maxium hold spray.

I hope it helps!

Sarah is right, I'm afraid. Very hard to make curls stay, what Cheryl has are curly extensions. You can buy clip one ones at the chemist or on line, tho.

Extensions will make your hair grow slower because the glue is so damaging.
If you really want extensions then go for some clip-in ones.

Hi there everyones hair grows at different rates so it will be hard for anyone to answer that question for you! you dont have to grow your hair long to get extensions put in either your hair is long enough at the moment to get them! Just remember though that extension can be pretty temp and are high maintenance with strands coming loose and breaking off, and if you want them removed it ruins your hair and the extensions themselves weaken the hair with the weight of them, Ive seen lots of my friends getting bald patches all over their heads with the extensions being too heavy, so please think long and hard before you get them done! hiope this helps Gilly x

Your hair grows 1/2 inch a month so 4 months from now, you will have 2 more inches on the length you have.

There are vitamins that you can take to speed up the growing process. They are called Nioxin hair vitamins and you can get them at a salon that carries Nioxin. They make your hair stronger and longer.

Different people's hair grows at different rates, but its probably about 1 inch every 2 months, so about 1yr to grow 6 inches.

I like your hair now.



Besides, listen to the person who said extensions are damaging to your hair; AND think about this--whyd' you cut it if you like it long? If you were just trying it short, the just let it grow out naturally and don't get extensions...you're wasting money and hurting your hair.

About a year. I had a short bob 3 years ago and now it's down to my elbows, even with taking an inch off every 6 months to keep split ends in check.  But everyone's hair grows differently. Your hair looks like it's thick so you shouldn't have a problem growing it back. Just resist cutting it until it grows back. My sister is a beautitican and when she was in beauty school, she was SO scizzor-happy. The cow had her kids distract me when she was giving me a 'trim', when I looked back, she'd taken an entire foot of hair off of me. Then she wondered why I cried and wouldn't talk to her for a half a year! DON'T LET SOMEONE CUT YOUR HAIR MORE THAN YOU WANT! It's your hair, not theirs, so don't let them act like it is theirs!

Hii.

Hair grows about 6 inches in one year, thats half an inch each month.
so by december it shouldd grow about 2 inches.
Just make sure your nice to it, straighten it less (I know its hard!!), and keep it from tangling so it doesn't break, and it should grow a nice two inches!

Is this hair cut okay???



Right, i currently have a side fringe and a few layers. My hair only comes up to my collarbones and i was wondering if i could (while getting my side fringe trimmed) put in some short layers as well?
I dont know if this is possible as my hair is a bit short and does have a few layers but only at the bottom if you get what i mean.
I want to be able to put in coloured hair extensions which give it a bit of a scene-y effect.
So....any pictures or advice in how i can achieve this style/cut??

Well I guess you could use any color treated shampoo/conditioner, although it wouldn't change anything since bleach is permandent and doesn't wash out like color would. The best thing that works for my hair though is Biolage. It pretty much just re moistureizes your hair and makes it look and feel healthy. Get it from the grocery store or your salon.
But sally's beauty supply has a lot of good colour treatment shampoo and all that fun stuff, i suggest finding one and checking it out.

OK i do this too what you need to do an i am a professional  redken has a shampoo just for blonds but if you hair id very dry then you'll need yo use either the all soft or the extreme line first this will help put the protein back in your hair you may want to start with cat spay in after you shampoo leave that in for five ti ten minuets then condition make sure you use cool water when rising out or the cuticle of you hair get damaged

How do you keep backcombing in, what is the best way to backcomb?



Hi,
I love backcombing my hair (i know it is bad for my hair, so i only do it on nights out), but i find that when i backcomb it just goes flat really quickly. I do have quite fine hair. I use a 'Denman' comb with super hold hairspray when i backcomb.
I really need some tips to keep it in, i hope someone can help!
Thank you

The comb is great, but make sure your hair is really clean and bone dry, then backcomb it and hairspray the hell out of it! :)
Just be careful combing it out...

After backcombing, use some more hairspray, i suggest Silvikrin by wellaflex, you can get it in boots and its cheap and extremely strong, get the maximum hold one. its brilliant, nothing can move when you spray it on your head also use some kind of styling wax if you want even more hold but with this hairspray you wont need much more hold..good luck :)

when backcoming make sure you do it right in at the roots of the hair as this is where you need to get the lift . a tail comb with teeth close together makes it easier

I was Taught back in the olden days never to backcomb your hair with a comb because it splits the ends , to backcomb with a brush will do less damage you have to use a lot of hair spray do a bit at a time then spray when your hair is finished respray after about 20 minutes, we used to let ours go rock hard and then it wouldn't move no matter the weather.

On one of those makeover programs I remember a hairdresser saying that there's no need to go at it hard - hold the piece of hair and gently back comb from about 3-4 inches from the roots to the scalp (you can see/feel the hair kinda gathering at the roots), repeat 2 or 3 times, and then spray with a strong hairspray.
You have to do several layers of this, don't try and do 1 big clump.
I've tried it myself - it does work, and has got to be better for your hair than a savage back-combing attack!

How do i get rid of my brassy roots?



hello everyone!
right my hair is platinum blonde and i dye it at home
i use Schwarzkopf Live Color XXL 00A Absolute Platinum
normally with no problems but as i did my root touch-up yesterday my roots came out a light brassy colour which shows up pretty obviously
as the rest of my hair is so light.
anybody have any ideas how i could get rid of the brassiness preferably without bleaching or using harsh products as my hair grows quite fast so that means quite regular touch ups which makes my hair quite dry.
hope you can help
thank you in advance!

Personally I prefer the first one.  More versatile. Can be worn up or down, You can do so much more with that style than the second one.  You can curl it, or wear it straight. Pony tail, plaits etc.



Could be very limited with the second style
I'd pick the first one.  Classic style
2nd one with go out of fashion very quick!!

I think the first one it's more versatile really.
Why not get the first one but with alot more layers then you can always back comb it and stuff to look like the second one!
But once you have cut your hair you can't get it back if you don't like it.

honestly, if you go get ur hair cut the way YOU want it.. she might be mad at first.. but it might grow on her.. 
you can do an emo cut without dying ur hair black or whatever.. 
keep it blonde, just cut it the way you want it.. if you don't like it, just cut it short so u can spike it.. 
that hair style isn't for everyone, and if you do end up getting it cut like that, keep it washed.. i hate seeing that hair style with a greasy nasty look to it.

I don't mean to be offensive or anything but i think emo people try to fit in a bit too much with stuff like that. I mean your mum's probably stopping you for a good reason. I have 2 emo friends that get teased because of the way they are and other people actually don't like to look at that ugly style. I mean your mum's probably right. she's choosing the best outcome for you.



By the way i don't actually know if your emo or if you just want emo hair but my answer kind of suits both ways.

Argh, I dont understand parents like that, mine never stopped me having what style I wanted - I think the best bet is to just make it plain your old enough to know what styles you like and make your own choice, and that she can no longer having you dressing and having your hair how she wants. You havent said your age, but I'm guessing she would be the one paying for it, so go for the mature talk about it rather than shout about it.
Good luck

Cut your hair to below shoulder length and dye the tips maybe pink or another bright colour. It is your hair, and technically, your mum can't do much about it.

Is this possible?



Ok I have kinda long thicker hair that has no natural "way" about it! If I just let it air dry or blow dry its very crazy and kinda frizzy with a wierd wave to it.  Its not curly or straight.  So I have 2 options....I have to straighten it every day with a straightner or I can french braid it when its wet so its got a nice kinda of loose wave/curly thing. My husband and I both really really like how this looks but its a huge pain because I have to have it in a braid all day to let it dry and then the next day it looks good but then I have to do it all over again.  My question is....is there anyway to get something done that would keep it this way? It doesnt have curls so I know a perm wouldnt do it...its just so annoying to have to do this all the time! I need 2 days notice to have my hair look nice!! Any suggestions?

Wow! I feel like you just described my hair! I think you may be a bit luckier than me though. I could spend a couple of hours with a straightner only to go outside for an hour and have the wave creep back.

Have you tried a hair gel for curly hair? I use Tresemme Bouncy Curls mixed with some anti-frizz cream (currently the Dove brand). I put it on while my hair is still wet and "scrunch" it to encourge more defined curls. I let it air dry for awhile then spray a little Aussie Sprunch Spray on it and "scrunch" a little more. If my hair is still too "wet" to get dressed I use a hair dryer with a diffuser on medium heat.

It may sound like a bit much but it's the only way to keep my hair under control. It's also not as time consuming as it may sound... most of the time is just letting it air dry while I go about my morning routine.

Of course with 2 days notice , instead of stressing why not treat yourself to a style by a professional. :)

How should I get my hair cut? [Pics included]?



I am getting a haircut soon, and I am unsure what to do with my hair. I have thin hair with natural waves, (but in my picture I tried to brush the waves out). Please don't suggest short hairstyles, because I know my parents would allow me to cut it short. It would be great if you would post a link. Thanks!
Also, I would like some kind of bangs, so please tell me what kind would look best on my face.

If he doesn't like you because you have hair extensions, get rid of him first!  An extension of your hair is only making yourself feel better, like putting on your make up (only far more expensive!).  Wear your extensions with pride...... you paid enough for them!

If he really likes you, its not because of your long hair because genuine feelings are stirred from the inner person,'personality'. If he is turned off his feelings were superficial and you should be glad to say goodbye. Anyway short hair is in and sexy.

Lolliskins is right.  For me it is a turnoff.  There is nothing more offputting to many men than dishonesty and deceit, which is what extensions are.

One nightmare extreme of this is going to Thailand and finding you've gone to bed with a ladyboy!

Men who are only interested in looks and a shag will not mind, but those that want to know the whole you and find you have lied about something already will wonder what else you will lie about.

Some men prefer short hair.  Some men prefer long hair (I do, because I do love to run my fingers and my arms through it - not always wise with extensions!). Some men don't care.  Best to be upfront with him from the start, and if it is a turnoff then either find someone else or grow your hair.

As for any woman who finds it shallow that I love long hair.  Instant turnoff, no question.  We'll never have a meeting of minds. Ever.

i don't think blonde highlights will suit your dark hair
If you wanna warm up the tone try a brown that is 2 shades lighter than your natural colour.
this way it will look really good. :)

This could be an interesting question if it ever became a legal issue; would a parent have a right to forcibly brush, cut or style the hair of a fifteen year old? I would say definitely not, because a 15 year is not a child, but a 5 year old would not know what was best for him or her.

most children usually are defiant to parents. you want them to do one thing they do another and it varies throughout age. on your question your daughter or son is probably 8 or 9. No they don'tt have a right in the way they want their hair if your their legal guardiann its youresponsibilityty to make sure they are clean and appropriate for school or if they are going to be taken out into public. although if their going to school they usually go into the bathroom and change their hair style the way they want it. so really its disciplinaryry issue.

If its a child (under 16) then none i guess. a parent has the right to set standards and to enforce them if they are not being upheld. If my daughter tried that with me her father would take over and she does not like that coz he doesn't care if she cries or not!! (though he does do it gently, and she likes to make out it hurts when it doesn't coz were holding her hair in a ponytail so it does not get pulled)

You should try and find out where the child is coming from, if they feel they want to be more independent, then you should at least try and give them some space, or even use reverse psychology. But You can't jus force them to, try to treat them with ice cream, or some of there favorite things, when they do there chores and what not.

Im not sure about the rights or the child but when my little sister was younger she used to hate having her hair brushed because its quite long and curly and tangles a lot but we discovered that if we made it into a game like hairdressers where she would do my hair and then I would do hers she was more likely to let me brush it. Its not ideal for when you are in a rush but gradually she has become used to having her hair done and we have far fewer problems now.

Alright mate
Knotty boy sell a dreadlock removal kit which we sell on our site www.alteredstateseu.com. It is a shampoo and intensive conditioner which you site in the bath and use the conditioner and slowly comb then out from the tips. It takes hours but can be done and the conditioner smells lush.

There are creams on the market that help loosen hair.  You can unravel them lock by lock, but this will take a lot of time.  I've done this, I used a porcupine quill, but I've also heard of sharp, thin nails.  This has a lot to do with hair texture.  My hair is curly, not kinky.



Maybe you need to get a nice old fashioned HAIR CUT!

They grow as fast as all of the rest of your hair obviously, but if you massage your head while you take a bath then you will stimulate your hair follicles and your hair will grow faster.

First, stop calling your hair 'mousey'.  You'll never like it if you keep calling it names.  It's light brown, right?

do you have lice or something? 
Uhm, well lets see. head lice is like ants that run around on your head looking for food. They're white. Kind of like Dandruff, but not as common. I suggest you take care of this by showering about three times a day using some 'lice detecting shampoo'. That's all I can say.

lice like to suk blood from ur head causing ur head to itch if u have short hair itz going to be easy to get rid of and what pl dont know is lice like cleen head better then dirty heads(so if any1 says head lice r onli for dirty ppl they r wrong)
see if u have a cleen head itz easier for them to plant their eggs u can get a lice shampoo to get rid of them or this thing called(savila) which help u get rid of them and makes ur hair less dry and very shinny...lol

just like to say head lice only stay in your hair they do not migrate to other parts of your body as jonas said if you have lice say for instance in your pubic hair these are called crabs and are a different type ,so use correct treatment to eradicate the problem on your head and they will go away .it is more common than people know

have you heard of nits?i expect you have at some point.well they are the eggs of lice.lice are flat brownish grey insects about the size of a match head and they are very infectious and each one can lay many eggs a day.are you scratching your head a lot?especially at the back and the crown and round the ear area?if you are then you probably do have them.you can get some treatment from the chemist for them.they suck the blood on your scalp and can make you feel quite down,hence the expression feeling lousy.its nothing to be ashamed of as they prefer a clean head rather then dirty and greasy hair and there are not many who have escaped them in their lives at some point.children are the biggest carriers of them.

Yeah, some of them.. And some is whats called "Indian" hair, which I guess grows fastest...? I'm not sure. Some come from horses or other animals....
And cheaper ones are synthetic.



But you would probably want to know  where it came from before you bought it, you wouldn't want to buy something from abused people or animals... I would just get fake ones or take some vitimins :D

let it grow long, but as it gets longer it gets weaker so you need to make sure that you have regular trims and tell the hairdresser you only want a trim or they will go scissor happy; and once a week condition it better than you usually would so it stays silky and soft :)x

Stop colouring it if you can.
Try to leave your hair, AKA; Don`t kill it.
Don`t straighten it everyday.
Trim it every six to eight weeks.
Drink LOTS of water.
Eat healthy.
The healthier your body,
The healthier you hair will be.
Which means,
The faster it will grow!

Good Luck!

don't cut it (except a trim for split ends at the most). In a year, you'll have long hair, guaranteed!

When i straighten my hair tips?



Whenever i straighten my hair it looks all dry and my friend complains that she has the same hair as me but when she straightens her hair it's really straight and shiny and she tells me to put hair spray.

So is it jsut her... or does every girl do that too..... straighten hair PLUS hairspray? But if it works Ill do it.... but that sounds really damaging. And also I dont want it to work because straightening my hair takes like an hour and I dont want to mess it up with hairspray.
Whats the secret?

Hair spray will only give your hair hold to style, but not to style with a straightener. When you straighten your hair you should always apply a heat protective spray or serum. This is what protects your hair from heat and from what i know, makes your hair smooth and shiny.



You should try Tresemme heat protective spray. Its what i use and it leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth i love it. if u do not use any protective base products for straightening your hair, this is why you have dry hair.

The secret is a good hair straightener, thermal protection product(i use a CHI spray), and a shine serum.
Spray the heat protector, straighten hair and then apply the shine product of your choice. Personally I use CHI silk infusion, SOSILK silk drops or Biosilk. Put it mostley on the middle and ends of your hair.

"Processes like blow drying reduce the moisture content below its normal level and can in themselves be harmful. Hair dryers and other heated appliances first soften the keratin of the hair. If they are too hot, they can actually cause the water in the hair to boil, and tiny bubbles of steam then form inside the softened hair shaft. The hair is thereby weakened, and may break altogether."

Whats a good prelightner to use on medium brown hair ?! ?



One that doesnt turn your hair orangey. I then plan on dying it with either
http://www.superdrug.com/invt/499323&bkl... 8.0 is a dark frosted blonde which is a neutral colour.
http://www.superdrug.com/invt/499293&bkl... Natural dark blonde again neutral colour.
Thanks :)

</answer from>



<answer>



Garnier and Clairol both have a good pre-lighter that only costs about £5 or less. They may turn your hair slightly orangey though as you are going from brown to blonde but as soon as you tone your hair afterwards with your choice of hairdye, you won't have any orangey tones in it. It works really well!

Oh, I think I know this one. Is it the pink and white box that's Boots's own brand?

I've used it. Twice. Works as well as putting perm cream on your hair. It is literally inches away from cr*p.

It smells horrible almost bordering on toxic, it's messy, it's inconvenient (you have to wash your hair several times throughout the process) and in the end it does absolutely nothing but scrape the shine off your hair.

You're better off spending £15 on two bottles of Aussie Dual Personality Straighten + Heat Protection. It does what it says on the tin, basically. Spray it on wet hair, blow dry, spray on dry hair, straighten, done.

I use it and it works immediately from the first use. And it smells nice. That's important.

are u on about hair straigheners if so then yes they fry your hair...
if your talking about some kit thats says it will starighter your hair im thinking...its not going 2 work. look ive been a hairdresser and weve had to lie to peoples faces to get there custom, i no one lady who was getting her hair bleached monthly and they would tell her it was ok 2 do it..by the way she now has no hair!!..
all i can say is try to love your hair the way it is then it will look nicer for longer..

You need to use a ceramic starightener and use the straightening creams to protect your hair. for me it usually lasts untill th next time i wash my hair. it does mess up a little in the rain. oh and don't get to close to your scalp.

please please if your gonna permanently straighten your hair, go to the hairdressers.
but in my personal opinion DO NOT DO IT!
many friends of mine have done it, it ends up going frizzy and nasty, you cant really straighten it after with GHDs or any straightener because it kills your hair even more
and when the roots grow out, they're curly but the ends are straight, really bad look!

Hair dying...first time or root regrowth application?



I'm sort of new to this and unsure what to do.
Here's what my instructions say:

FIRST TIME APPLICATION
This method is recommended if
- you are colouring your hair permanently for the first time or
- your previous hair colour has totally grown out or has been washed away

ROOT REGROWTH APPLICATION
This method is recommended if
- your hair has been coloured and the colour is growing out
- the ends of your hair are darker and in poor condition



Ok so, sense tells me to go for the second because my hair is dyed at the moment and growing out, but does it matter that my hair is a completely different colour to the one I'm dying it?

go with the first but are you going lighter or darker. darker wont matter much either way. keep it on the lighter area first then apply to darker areas. if you are going lighter then reverse color it. apply on darker first then the lighter areas.

If your roots are darker and you are dyeing it a lighter colour you will need to use the 2nd method and vise versa as your roots would still stand out (especially if it isn't a permanent dye).  If it will be the same kind of tone (both light or dark colours) just a different colour then use the first method.

Well you can only do that w/ certain hair types w/ a curling iron. May I suggest using a scrunching product like loreal studioline? It is very easy and gives you more freedom to do the kind of curls you want.
It really depends on what kind of skin you have for your hair.. I have really tan skin and I wanted to die my hair blonde but everyone convinced me otherwise. If you do die your hair dark make sure you don't get a reddish brunette color make sure you get a more golden color. Good luck w/ your hair! :D

Use a good mouse on wet hair.
You can blow dry your hair half dry, and then twist sections with pins onto your head and dry it through.
Take the pins out and shake out your hair upside down.

OR, after half drying your hair, use Big, Fat rollers and let your hair air dry.

Resist the urge to brush your hair, just run your fingers through it with a flexible gel or frizz cream.
If some sections of your hair look flat, just use a 1" curler to curl that section.

I think if you would like to dye your hair that color, go for it.  I think its a pretty color.  Especially if your hair is naturally darker and isnt agreeing with the blonde!

Jojo's hair was curled tightly with a curler and then made into loose curls.

This is what you do:
1] Section your hair into two sides and take a lock of your hair and curl it. Count to 10 and let the curler go.
2] After you have curled all your hair, tip your hair upside down and scrunch your hair with mousse. 
3] Tip your head back up again and twist your finger around each curl.
You are left with gorgeous hair :D

(It's takes 5-10minutes to curl the whole hair and scrunching and twisting only takes a few minutes!!) x

You just need a curler iron a whole set.. no need to colour your hair if you think the colur of your hair now looks good at you, just curl your hair then everything's fine.

7.0 would be better, by the way you cant dye your hair lighter because a tint will only darken, if you wan your hair lighter you need to bleach first, some store tints will lighten but only by the tiniest bit!!!

these colours would be a very dark blonde more like a very light brown, if i was you i would have a look at the nice and  easy collection they lift hair very well. maybe try a light blonde or even an ash blonde, the boxes never turn out how they show on the  box the models usually have really light hair anyway and you are starting from a dark base. cut a piece of your hair from the back if your unsure or maybe just try highlights to begin with

Each salon is different. But you can do it at home... Put a towel in the dryer for like 5 minutes then get your hair wet and put conditioner in it. Put the towel on and leave it for like 10-15 minutes. Wash conditioner out and you're good to go! :)

Black To Blonde At Lowest Possible Price



Just Under A Month Ago I Dyed My Hair Black For My Year 11 Prom And Now Have Decided I Want It Blonde. I Don't Have Much Money As My Prom Cost Me Over £300. I Am Getting Quite A Bit Cut Off Of It Soon (its mid back at the moment i am getting it cut shoulder length like paris hiltons) And Can Only Just Afford This. Any Colour Stripping Products, Ideas, Salons That People Know Of That Wont Cost A Bomb. I Live In Bristol England?

Help! :)

A friend of mine did this, and let me tell you first off that stripping black dye from hair is not something to be done at home.  There will be products claiming to do so, but the result will never be attractive and will leave your hair very damaged.  You need to see a professional hair color specialist in a salon to get your hair fixed properly.

Now, the bad news: it's not cheap, and this is precisely why many people try and fail to remove the color at home.  Color correction is never cheap, but black hair is the most difficult color to remove.  Thankfully you have only colored your hair black once, which will make the process slightly easier. (It gets harder if not almost impossible for someone who has been coloring their hair black for months or even years)  The other bit of bad news is that lightening black hair to blonde is a process not usually achieved in one day.  Usually the hair is lightened to a brown and then to a blonde at a later date.  The reason is that if you were to have your hair taken from black to blonde in one day your hair would be very damaged; damage is the reason that some salons are completely unwilling to strip black dye altogether.

Moral of the story: go to a salon and have this fixed.  Also, for your sake and the sake of your hair stylist, understand what you're asking the stylist to do and have realistic expectations.  Finally, DON'T DO THIS AT HOME!  Again, if it's hard for a seasoned hair color specialist to pull off, what would make you think you could do it easily at home?  Good luck!

Salons will refuse to do this unfortunately.

L'oreal creme bleach is so so good (but Jerome Russel B Blonde is stronger!) I went from blonde to black in a weekend. Don't listen to anyone saying that it'll make your hair fall out, because it won't. The most it will do is break. Between each bleach, use a good conditioning treatment. When bleaching, leave it on until it goes a light orange/yellow then put on nice n' easy lightest ash blonde on top *I think that's what it's called* and it will make your hair blonde! 
Also, read through this website before you do it

You have a kind of mousy brown color, or so it seems in these pics.  I would dye it a chocolately brown color as it will add shine and dimension to it.  I would cut about 5 inches off (sorry!!) and have your stylist put layers into it.  If your stylist is good, he/she will know where to place the layers to flatter your face. I would get longer side bangs, and part your hair to the side.

I would say keep it kinda long cause it's feminine and suits your face shape, but you should get it shaped around your face and layered around the back cause it looks thick. It would give your hair more movement without taking any length off. I love your colour though, not sure if I'd change it. If you did maybe go a shade darker like a rich brown so it would be the same colour all over. Good luck =)

i got my hair colored and cut yesterday and had absolutely no say in it but what she did was amazing..

but if i had to say.. maybe a little darker color, trim and frame your face with your hair..

I actually really like your hair color :) you should just get it cut to your shoulders and get some side bangs, if you want you can some highlights or lowlights to your hair but I wouldn't do anything totally different from your natural color. Ask your hair stylist about getting layers too they add a lot of style to your hair :D!

hey I'm 18, and i work at a salon. i personally think you should keep your hair long, long hair is very popular this year. side bangs would also look nice on you, and maybe a dark brown color.

perms are expensive but a loose perm would look very nice on you!

if you do go with the perm, dont get the bangs, and do get a very loose one.

good luck!

Should I wax followed by plucking, or bleach my upper lip?



Okay, which is a better solution for upper lip hair for girls?



- Waxing once (so you dont have to pluck all of those hairs), followed by plucking when you see hairs grow in



OR



- Bleaching



My mom wants me to bleach because she thinks waxing will make the hairs grow in darker, but it doesnt matter because I'll pluck them! right?

I dont really want to bleach because it will still be noticable, and in the light i'll look like a freak!

Yikes--don't wax, pluck, or shave yet!  Those three methods will definitely make your hair grow back stubbly.  Not good.  (Guys who kiss you will feel it.)

To be honest I would go with the wax because it lasts longer and gets rid of fine hairs as well as thicker hairs.
I don't recommend the bleaching if the hair is quite dark as it may still be noticeable.
Hope this helps :)

well if you're not allergic to wax, go for it. although bleach helps the hairs blend in, they can still be somewhat seen. If you wax, the hairs won't come back darker or thicker, that's only if you shave. Actually, when you wax your upper lip, it takes a long time for the hair to grow back. So definitely stick with waxing.

well my answer is bleach it.you are who you are, people should accept you as you are. just remember after you wax, if you wanna wax again you have to wait til the hair is the length of the width of a dime.which means you will have a noticable 5 oclock shadow when it starts growing in. also there is gonna be alot of hair growing in, you wanna pluck it all?i have alot of facial hair due to pcos, i shave my chin and bleach my upper lip. it is an awful thing to have to do in the first place. if the hair isnt really noticable now, i wouldnt touch it.remember waxing can scar, and rip skin off in some cases.

when you straighten your hair start using protection and it wont fry it as much because to me it sounds like you fried your hair.

You don't have to start over! The same thing happened to my hair coz I over straightened it. You have to go about 3 months without straightening it and use some sort of "curl gel". (The one that I used was really good and it brought all my curls back).

Don't worry, this happened to me as well. Curly hair is in your genes, there is no getting rid of it. It'll just take some time for them to come back depending on how much and how long you've straightened it. Buy curling cream by Tresemme or Silk and curl your hair with your fingers. Help it become familiar again with the curving motion and give it some time.

you do not have to cut short and start all over.  you might have straightened it so much, that it flattened. that happend with my bangs.



anyways instead of starting all over, you can scrunch your hair after you take a shower, which will make it curly.the products that i use (even though i have extremly curly hair too,) is gardiena's proudcts, which are..
1. Mousse 2. Curl Hydration  3. Hairspray.
you can get other prducts from them to that will help curl. but those are the main things you need. 
good luck :)

just use moisturising masks, use curl boosting shampoos and conditioners, and just be patient, it will come back don't worry! but if all else fails, have a trim, the weight of the ends coming off wil give your hair bounce and make it curlier. good luck :)

Give your hair to recover and check out Pantene's restoratives line.  It did wonders for my dryer fried hair.

Also, if you are on birth control, talk to your doctor about it's possible involvement.  I know it sounds nuts but a friend of mine's curly hair didn't have as much oomff when she started the pill.

Get you self some hard plastic hair rollers and metal prong clips. Roll your hair up and blow dry it if you dont have to go anywhere you can even sleep with the rollers in (the first time i did this it took for ever but by the thrid time i got all the rollers in in like 20 min and that was doing it myself dont give up). Floding a pillow in half and putting it right under your neck above your shoulder with help you sleep with these things on your head. Also, keep in mind the curls are going to be a lil bigger than the size of the roller you choose so choose a size thats a lil smaller than than what you want. You'll need to part your hair one roller at a time start by makeing a part about where your bang would be about the width of the roller and not to wide (so the hair will dry) from the front of your head (bang) to the back Back of neck) depending on the size of the rollers you shoud have six to eight rollers. now for the side you want to start from the bottom up tucking your finger behind your ear and pushing the part straight back to meet the roller in the mid sectionthen part whats left in half and two or three rollers should be able to hold each half total you'll need about 16-20 rollers. Depending on how dry or oily your hair is is apply a small amount or your moisturizer to your wet hair and comb it through before rolling. If your dont have a sit down hair dryer a blowdryer is ok. The longer you hold the blow dryer on the curls the better. Your hair must be COMPLETELY dry before you remove the rollers in order for this to work properly. You will also need a flat iron for after you take the rollers out to touch up your roots. You can get rollers and clips pretty cheap at any beauty supply store. Oh and dont forget you'll need a nice scarf to wrap your hair in one you have the rollers i usually use one that kind of looks like a net. Good luck dear.

Should I thin my hair out behind my mom's back?
Hi I'm 13 and I have ridiculously thick hair that I want to get thinned out but my mom won't let me do it and doesn't understand how hard my hair is to deal w/. I'm getting so fed up that I'm thinking about going to the mall w/ my friend and doing it behind her back so she won't know..
Is that wrong to do that? And will it look bad if I thin it out?

Oh and I'm not planning to do anything drastic like I would do it a little on the bottom, I mean I'm 13 I can't afford anything real big on my babysitting salary.. I will add a pic of me soon k?! :)

problem is that thining your hair unless done really well can look absolutly awful, and thats why your mum is saying not to do it...

speak to your mum and go with her to the salon and get them to give you a consulatation as to the best route to go.

My gf's have had some awful things done to thin out their hair... from under cuts to worse... get your mum onside.. remember she is your best friend and wants the very best for you... :D



good luck

Thinning out the hair, if done properly, will not look stupid or messed up and your mom might not even notice. Never get your hair thinned out with a razor, make sure the stylist uses thinning shears. They are special shears that pretty much cut every other hair. Try to only thin out where YOU feel is the thickest, like in the back as you said. And dont thin out anything too close to the top layer because this could create fly aways! Good luck!

Get it cut in tons layers. This will thin the hair out a bit (not as much as getting it thinned but it will still help). This way your hair is more manageable and your mom wont be mad.

ok the ups n downs of thinning if u try to put it in a pony tail u may have alot of little pieces that always fall out n drive u nutty or if ur hair is curly at all it will only tighten up and become more and more curly and u will notice it no matter what~~~also if u ever separate your hair by dividing it in half and putting half to one side and half to another u will see the thinning weather they use thinning shears or a razor besides don't hide things from ur mom shes wise and probably has hair just like u she WILL SEE it somehow then the trust flag will fly up again leave it alone i presume u have lovely hair ~~~~designer here and no to hell with ur mom as another said u r just alittle girl

I did that ! My hair was so thick and unbearable, and my mom wouldn't let me thin it out. I didn't have much money, so I did it myself. I went to my local Sally's shop and bought a pair of special siccors to thin out my hair [it wasn't much money, and I had enough], then late at night when everyone was asleep I thinned it out [My aunt is a profession hair-stylist, and she had taught me how, and I went online and researched]. Anyways, the results were pretty good and my mom noticed right away, she was furious at first. But she got over it pretty quickly [and my mom isn't one to forget things and let things go easily- at all], and we both noticed a huge improvement in how much easier it was for me to get ready and that it took alot less time.



So, go for it! She'll get over it once you do it.
Of course, she'll be a bit angry at first, but, hey, after it's done, nothing can be done to bring it back. The only choice she'll have is to let it go, and forget about it.
&& you'll both be happy in the end because it will be MUCH easier for you to get ready. It's a win-win in the end, actually.

Also, if you get it done well, you're mom might not even notice! I did it myself [but I had no other choice], so it wasn't the best it could have been, and that's why my mom noticed.

Anyways, good luck and all, and sorry for the huge reply ! xD

it's just hair. it's not like you're asking her to do some extremely obnoxious blue/green/purple mix of dye in your hair.

it's just thinning! it will only help you, so i don't see why it matters?

i'd go for it, i understand how big of a hassle think hair is(i have it) and as your mom she should understand that you just want to be able to manage your hair.

Hi I know the problem as I have really thick hair too, I would just get more layers cut into the hair not just little ones at the bottom all over cut into the hair, this thins my hair out loads without the hairdressers having to use the thinning scissors on me as I think they do more harm than good myself, I dont like having it thinned at the hairdressers as it takes alot of the body out of the hair and make my hair all thin and weird, so I just go for more layers all over the hair but nothing taken off the length. 
But it is your hair and if you have money of your own then go ahead and do it.

no blue would not suit you,

but if you want the extensions i would pop down to sallys hair and beauty or go on their website and get the american dream quick fix clip-in extensions they are £16.99 per pack and you would need 3 packs for your hair.



you could also if you wanted get the "dipped" extensions in blue without having to dye your hair.

K I think your hair suits you as of right now...i guess it makes you look kinda edgy. However, if you want a change, you should let it grow out a little to medium lenght and wear it messy like so: http://haircutsformen.org/buzz/haircuts/... (yes I even got a picture)

If you just put it in a few minutes ago you might be able to wash it out. i'm not sure about when you should put on the remover. i would suggest looking on the warning label on the bottle of remover. Check how long you have to wait. I hope your school isn't in session yet (or that you don't have work tomorrow if you're older). I think you've done everything fine. I don't see a reason to be worried. you have the remover and the other dye. Don't freak out. Take deep breaths (unless of course your in the room with the dye then you might pass out)



best of luck with your hair and Have a good rest of your day.

It might tone down as you shampoo it a few times. You really need to go to a good salon to fix this -- they are trained in fixing it without adding more damage to the hair. (I know most salons are closed on Monday sorry about that). Definitely do not use a level 3 (permanent) dye use a wash in color.

<question>



Should I get my hair cut tomorrow or go out one last time before getting it cut?



Going out clubbing on the weekend and I can't decide if I want to get my hair cut to my shoulders before or wait and get it cut the day after my night out...



Cant make the decision myself.. I know its sad!!

If you don't like how your hair looks right now you should get it cut and then wait until after clubbing.
I don't see a reason though why you shouldn't get it cut before unless you really like your hair right now and want to go impress people with your hairy-beauty.



I'm assuming you wouldn't decide to get it cut unless you don't like it right now, so i suggest to go get it cut and then be confident when you go out [:



I don't like my hair right now and i hate going out before i can get it cut, so I'm hiding out in my house until my scheduled appointment.

Not good ones, at Claire's you will only find 1" thick platic looking synthetic pieces in ugly colors. The extensions at Hot Topic are also very fake and ugly.

For good extensions go to Sally Beauty Supply or a wig store.

if your looking for a quick solution and one tha is cheap ..then yh go to claires.....but i ahte to say it the more money you invest the better the hair extentions will look really.!! ....unless you;re the kinda person who doesn;t really mind as long as they have long hair.!! so it;s up to you....



but i recently saw some in top shop....they looked really good.!...
bit pricey but i don;t think it;ll brake the bank- if you know what I mean

I get mine from Sally's Beauty supply stores. They are actual human hair and are only $36. They don'tt feel  fake or look fake. You can sew the clips in them or use glue. Oh, The brand I get is Sassy, you can look at them on the sally's website.

you can get them at claires but they suck. hot topic has really cool extensions with all sorts of colors. they have synthetic two packs for $5.99. that's wat i have and i really like them, they're really good quality. you can get one synthetic extension at sallys for $6.99. i also have them but i don't like them as well. if u want human hair then get it at sallys. good luck!!!

Pob? Asymmetrical bob? Those are two names I've heard for the style I /think/ your describing.

If your looking to get that done at the salon just describe it to whoevers doing your hair - they should understand what you mean

Ha ha ha!  Well define "short!"  I never go shorter than below chin length, but for me it's a maintenance issue.  After it gets too long, it's really kind of boring.  Sometimes it just has to do with the fact that the girls you see might not have found the right hair cut just yet...!

I can't explain the freedom that you feel after cutting off your hair.  It's like a physical representation of getting rid of all your past emotional baggage and making a fresh start.



A woman (especially a younger one) with short hair is a confident woman who isn't afraid to have the focus on her.  Without a lot of hair to distract you, the focus is on the face.  Well, guys may be looking at other things too, but you know what I mean.

There are also practical reasons like simplifying your life.  You'll find lots of new moms cut their hair.

Finally, the bob has become very trendy again, although it's always been in style.  Katie Holmes and Victoria Beckham helped its resurgence.

I am currently thinking of getting a weave done as it is easy to handle and I like a change, most of my family now are wearing a half weave but I want a full weave so my hair is all one texture, but some people have said it can look a bit fake?

I have never had a full weave as I do think they can look so fake and wig-ish but I have seen some which are well done.
But as good as they look they still seem to look fake as most black girls do not have that kind of hair naturally so you realise straight away.
Why dont you have a partial weave,where you hair is left out at the front and your stylist can then relax your natural hair which is left out to match the texture of the hair u sew in? So it blends and looks natural.
This is what I have done and it looks great.
If you do go for a full weave go for a natural colour and ask to see some examples of the stylists work.

No, not really.
My sister has worn one before.
4 different times.
It actually looks really cute.
But if you make it too thick, like and it doesn't look
like your natural hair then it doesn't look good.
Don't make it too much longer than your hair is now.
Or a majorly diff color.
Or everyone will know it's fake.
Get it before school though so people think it's real.

It depends on how you get it done and who does it.



I use clip-in extensions and I have people telling me all the time that my hair is beautiful and when I tell them its fake they can't believe it.

Fusion hair looks natural, too. Sewn in is good but when you first get it done it looks a little bumpy but after a week it looks natural.

No it wont it depends on who doesn't and how good they are at it because some people can make a good weave look as real as it would the day you born.

It might. It all depends on how long your hair is and how long the weave will be. And it all depends on if it's super thick or what not.

try putting mayonnaise all in your hair, leave it for 20 minutes, then wash it out really well.
egg yolk mixed with olive oil works like that too.
i've done it and it made my hair really shiny and soft. :]

Well, since your hair is dry you need moisture :P

You'll need:
Olive oil
Saran wrap
A warm towel
& Shampoo to get it all out with :D

First you'll need olive oil. You can get it at places like Kroger or Walmart in the aisle with all the cooking oils. Put some olive oil in a cup, enough of it to cover all of your hair. Then microwave it so it's warm. Whenever it's warm, put it on your hair. After you have all the olive oil on your head, cover your hair with the saran wrap and put a warm towel over it like a turban. Then wait until all of it cools down, and when you take a shower, shampoo it twice. DO NOT use conditioner!! I used conditioner the first time I did this(because I had a 2 in 1 shampoo & conditioner) and ew was my hair greasy. It'll still feel sort of slimy, but whenever you dry it it should be soft and fluffy. Good luck. :D

You need a good deep conditioner.  I use Bumble and Bumble "Deeep" or their "Creme De Coco" deep conditioner.  These will make your hair shinny and very healthy.  Don't use them more than once a week though.  The Deeep condiitoner has protein in it and protein can cause damage if your hair gets too much of it!

Also take a look a your diet....if we don't eat and are lacking in vitamins etc... it tends to show in our hair, skin and nails. Drink more water...eat more oily foods perhaps or try taking something like evening primrose. Conditioners are good but the majority tend to just cover the hair...isn't it better to tackle the problem from the inside out?

And also go easy on the heat styling it can dry your hair out more.

Go for the Mayo: Heat up one half cup of mayonnaise until it becomes an oily, white goo and apply to dry, unwashed hair. Cover your hair with a plastic bag and leave on for at least 15 minutes. Then, rinse and shampoo thoroughly.



eat up on an Egg: Separate the white of an egg from the yolk, and whip the white thoroughly. Then add 1 tablespoon of water to the yolk and blend until the mixture is creamy. Next, mix the white and yolk together. Wet your hair with warm water, remove the excess moisture, and apply the egg mixture to your scalp with your fingertips. Massage gently until the froth is worked into your scalp, and then rinse the hair with cool water. Keep applying the mixture until it is used up. Continue to rinse until all of the egg is washed away

back comb all the top layers of ur hair straighten the bottom ahir remaining. you need an emo fringe to pull of emo hair so have a fringe which covers at least 1 of your eyes. and stick "scene" bows in your ahir to give it that extra emo/scene look =]

ok i have emo hair and its not that hard to do, ok first make the hair real spiky and crazy in the back. make the hair very textured and have long bangs brushed to the side of the face. also make your sideburn hair longer than your bangs so it makes it look cool. also brush the hair on the opposite side of the bangs toward your eyes. sounds complicated but real easy. if your doin  a drawing dont forget the classic black rimmed glasses

I'm not trying to be mean but it's not about the hair. I've seen chavs with what would be regarded as emo hair but you just knew it was a mistake. You can point out a supposed emo whatever that is when they don't have emo ish hair. It's more about clothes and genre of music you like. IT IS NOT ABOUT BEING DEPRESSED AND CUTTING YOURSELF FOR ALL OF THOSE LOSERS OUT THERE!!! Not you...lol.

But if you want to try it i'd say straighten your fringe in a front bang that covers most vision and curl the rest or staighten it. For an extra touch wear like a ribbon as a headband.

Hope i could help and enlighten....

layers on top, poof the sides
up and the back.

straighten the hell of it.

i can't see your pic but i think a mix of golden and mocha would make it look really rich and luxurious, perfect for the winter!
i love red hair, but red highlights can look really cheap and bright colours like pink are so high maintenance because they fade so quickly and you're left with bleached looking hair, hope this helps!

Well, my friend just dyed her brown/black hair hot pink and looks very nice. So u might want 2 dye it pink; dark mocha's a good choice too.
The link requires u 2 have an account. I don't find it very helpful.

Wash your hair in washing up liquid or washing powder/liquid (i'd stick to a non-bio like fairy) - this strips off the colour (they use this trick in hair salons sometimes).
You can then dye it the colour you want.
You really need to deep condition it (washing up liquid isn't great for your hair!) - but if you choose a dye with lots of conditioning treatment that will be good - and perhaps don't choose anything with bleach/peroxide.
If you choose a semi colour, then choose lighter than you want (I chose medium brown and it looks more like chocolate brown - hence the reason I asked my hardresser how to bring the colour up!).

Hope it works out!

i dye my hair a lot, but it never changes like that.  i think your hair color changed from the sun.  it depends on how long ago you died it.  once the dye has been in your hair for 6 weeks, you can re-dye it. 
hope i helped at least a little, haha. (:

Right well, there are quite a few options here... First of all, you could fade the colour. You can do that by using a hair-stripper, but that can be be quite expensive. I've heard washing up liquid can work, but that could seriously damage your hair. Personally, Head and Shoulders shampoo if brilliant. Its anti-dandruff so it opens up the scalp. Leave it on for about half an hour and wash it off, and most of the dye will come out. Since you died your hair brown over the top of blond, it would take the brown out and leave it blond. This is what I would try before getting any cutting or re-dyeing done. If that doesn't work, I would dye over the top with a darker colour. That's sure to work :) Hope this helps x

okay the night before take a shower then put about 6 small braids on the first layer of your hair (3 on each side) 
then when u wake up your hair will be dry so straighten the rest of it and then unbraid the braids u will then have a straight and curly look.
this is what i always do

another idea for a hair style is a "poof". You can take a small section of hair including your bangs or you can leave your bangs down and just take pieces of long hair right behind your bangs. Pull them back but poof them up and secure it with bobby pins.
a poof is great by its self, with a pony tail or half up. It also tends to disguise dirty hair.

When I was in middle school I also used to twist pieces back all around the front of my head and hold them with bobby pins (or just untwisted with  little rubber bands).

Anything different and fun are good ideas. Try headbands and clips, or making your hair curly.

Hope these are good ideas.

I disagree with everyone else. I felt like I wouldn't get a good straight iron for cheap, but I decided to try a cheap one first just in case it worked. I bought a ceramic one by jilbere de paris from sally's beauty supply 3 or 4 yrs. ago for $40 and it was awesome. I have really thick kinky hair and I had a relaxer but my hair would still get really frizzy whenever I did it myself. But this would straighten my hair flawlessly everytime. I used it on the highest setting and it's the only iron I had that never damaged my hair. I'd recommend it before you spend like $200 on a flat iron, I never had to buy another one after trying that one. Just remember to use a heat protector.

Most of the cheap ones are bad. 
It's best to just get a really nice one that will last a long time. My flat iron was over a hundred bucks; however, I have had it for about five years. I dropped it one to many times and probably will ask for another for my b-day.

Generic Value Products at Sally Beauty Supply is the best one I know of that isn't super expensive. I would recommend a heat shield spray or serum to use with any flat iron, and don't turn it up all the way, it gets very hot! I think this one is around $60

Can I have an Emo hairstlye without a fringe?



I've searched through tons of possible emo hairstyles, but every single one of them includes a fringe. So does this mean that I and doubtless other girls without fringes cannot have emo hair?



I have long brown hair that's completely straight, and goes down about five or six inches past my shoulders. My parting starts at my hairline, and goes straight to the crown of my head. It has always been that way, and it will be hard to cut it otherwise, and I'll also need to be able to tie it up for school. Does anyone have any ideas, or photos they could show me of possible styles? I would like to take such a photo to the hairdresser, that is, if such a style exists.

Yes I think you should tell him, but definitely do it nicely.  Think about it as though you were in his shoes: you'd want your friend to let you know that you had an unflattering cut, to reassure you that you could fix it, and to do both of those things without offending you.



Offer him suggestions of flattering cuts for people with his facial structure... i.e., skinny men can usually pull off a longer cut (think scene boys with their flatironed past ear hair) or a short cut, whereas if a larger man tries a mid-ear length cut it will highlight chubby cheeks, etc.

Just be gentle, and think what you would want a good friend to tell you!  Good luck!

Made a mistake dying my hair, can you help?



I decided to dye my hair a brown colour from mousy blonde but it's a little darker than I'd hoped and I even think it's slightly red. I really don't like it.

I want to lighten it slightly or at least make it more brown than red. I don't need to get it back to blonde or anything so extreme, I still want it brown. I think the dye I used was Henna though; it was a permanent box (well known brand) DIY job.

Any suggestions? I can go to a Salon but do not want to be blowing a fortune on it - more to the point, I can't afford to blow a fortune on fixing it!

If you want it to be lighter color so it can go back into brown, try to use a blonde shampoo, it will lighten it up. You will need to wash you hair a lot.

well you could try COLOR OOPS its in the drug stores and it is suppossed to restore your hair back to its originial color
most of the time it works



OR 
you could keep dying it the color you want every week and it will go to the color you want



but it damages it



OR



you could go to the salon and ask them what to do



my best suggestion is to get color oops

Malibu Rinses are given to people who have well water and it brings their hair back to its normal shade.  A salon gave this to me once when I didn't like the highlights they gave me, and it brought my hair back to the way it was before.  Ask a professional about it, as this was about 10 years ago, and I'm not sure if they've changed it or even still have it.

Henna is always a bit "Russian Roulette", it can go anything from ginger to dark brown.

Having said that, red is actually lighter than brown in hair colours, so if you went and bought (I suggest a non-henna) hair dye in a mid brown, that would cover up the colour you have now and should work fine.  If you go for a permanent with a small amount of lightening in it you could even opt for a lighter brown than you have now.  There are loads of brands that would do this, but check your hair colour against the side of the pack, where it shows what colour your hair will go, to make sure it will do what you want it to do before you buy it.

Asda, Tesco and TJ Hughes all do hair dyes from around £1.30, so it needn't cost a fortune either ;)

Good luck!

the best thing for you to do is to get a rinse.  anyone at the beauty supply store should be able to help steer you toward the temp rinse.  this is a non chemical and temporary fix.  because there are no chemicals it wont damage your hair.its safe enough to do every day if you so desire.  this will allow your hair to grow out or fade and you can still feel comfortable with your appearance. and the best part is that its relatively reasonable in the $$  department.  good luck!!!

We've actually suggested washing the hair with a harsh shampoo or a detergent like tide it will help stripping out some of the color. If you don't want to blow a fortune at the salon just get another box of color because I can almost guarantee that you will show some more red after washing it. Get a color with an ash in the title but only leave it on for a few min. you are nor trying to color it again you are just toning it. Maybe ten min . You have to watch it. Good luck You could do it.

Hi,
You can reverse the problem because henna does not stay for long. Shampoo it often and try a good oil (coconut or almond oil ) massage on regular basis will do world of good and after oiling apply egg yolk and yoghurt mixed together which has to be 15 minutes before shampoo or if you find this messy look for a hair lotion Ziravie which has extracts of herbs, fruits and essential oil which when used three times a week for at least 6 weeks will help you to get rid of the red colour and leave your hair healthy and shiny.
With washing of of 3 times a week you will get rid of henna within 3 weeks

I'd say it's somewhat true. but (dont know if its scientifically true) i would say it's not to do with more heat, it's to do with more UV rays and more vitamains that are abbsorbed from the sun (think it's D)



also with more heat, there is better food, better digestion so theres more things in your blood to actually make use of.

also (this is true) hair has growth periods. and i dont really think heat effects the growht periods. it's more to do with a sort of growth cycle.

your body reacts on nature and the course of the seasons - in spring and partially in summer, hair and nails may grow faster, at least they grow somewhat more and faster than in winter.

but never believe that heat makes hair grow - that is nonsense.

the only thing you can do for healthy hair, skin and nails is eat good (you need vitamin B), drink enough (2 to 3 l a day, preferably water and juices) and use the right care.

Well, sweat provides moisture...but if your scalp is dirty, sweat can foster bacteria in your natural scalp oils which build up on your scalp which can clog the follicles and hinder growth. Excessive heat damages your hair by drying it out and causing breakage...I imagine heat on your scalp isn't much better either. The only things that really grow your hair are water and vitamins.

Without adding any hairspray or anything (you can add at the end) , grab a 1 1/2 or 2" curling iron, ( I use a really inexpensive metal conair, $9 at target) get a stand of your hair and wrap it around the curling iron starting at the top (by the handle of the curling iron) all the way down. Make sure to curl your hair in the opposite direction by wrapping the strand under the curling iron instead of over when you start (hope this makes sense). It just gives your nice soft curls rather than curly sue curls. Once you are done curling run your fingers through all of the strands. I know this sounds like you will be ruining your styled hair but it gives it a really full and soft look. If necessary spray a little hairspray in. Hope this works for you! Sounds time consuming but it really isn't.

That's one way.

You could also get something that is about that size and wrap your hair around it TIGHTLY when it's wet, and then leave it in until it drys and you have curls :D

You don't need a 2-inch neccessarily, that would be best, but,
if you get just a one inch or smaller, just wrap the curls looser.

Try a 1 and a half inch or 2 inch.....but it depends on your your hair length and thickness.  You can also try hot rollers, which can be difficult if never used before, but easy once you get the hang of it

yes. 
but heres a better idea, one that doesn't harm your hair like a curling iron:
when you get out the shower and your hair is wet, wrap thick strands of your hair in rags. let it sit like this over night and take them out the next morning. to make your curls more resistant, you could add mousse to your wet hair before you put them in rags, and spritz them with a flexible hold hairspray after you takem out the next morning.

a BIG CURLING IRON such as a 2 inch will only make waves. and usually it will only flip out the ends. i use a bedhead 1" curling iron. but i kinda already have curly hair. my friend uses the heated otherwised steamed curlers in the morning and they look adorable. it comes in a set at walmart. and believe me it works.

You need a two inch curling iron, flexible hairspray and maybe even hair rollers.

1. Wash and condition hair with a curl-enhancing product.
http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...

2. Blow dry hair upside down  until damp and divide into sections.

3. With each section, twist hair around a roller and secure with a bobby pin. Blow dry hair and mist with a curl enhancing spritzer.
http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...
http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...

4. Blow dry hair until dry.

5. Going section by section, take out the bobby pin and train the hair to where you want it to go. Take your curling iron and wrap hair around the barrel. The heat will help to keep in the curl for even longer. Go around your entire head taking out sections and curing them with the curling iron.

6. Spray in a "flexible" hair spray, so that you get the hold but your hair is still soft and touchable.  Tousle your hair a bit to loosen the curls up and make them look more realistic.

It's no worse for it than dying it any other hair color, except bleaching your hair is HORRIBLE for it. The problem is that red pigments basically stay in your hair until they grow out, so if you dye it reddish and don't like it and want it back blonde or even just brown, there will still be a lot of red in it no matter how much you dye it.

dying your hair in general can be bad for your hair. if you are a bit worried, then go for those semi-permanent colors that can wash off. if you like the look, then dye it. it is better than bleaching or perming and as long as you don't do it often you should be good. it all depends on your hair type.

A couple times won't hurt, but doing it many many times can weaken the quality of the composition of hair. Kinda like if you don't clean your hair, it gets all dry and starts to fall out, but not THAT bad, if you know what I mean.

i died my hair blonde 3 times in 2 weeks
now my hair is fried and pink/orange
:/

im dying it again
and cutting it cuz its so dead



so if you die it make sure you'll like it 
it takes more to get it back then to get it to one color that you might not like

Well for many reasons but mostly due to the climate they lived in. The sun hits the equator more than the poles, and the temperatures are warmer there. People closer to the equator have darker features while people closer to the poles have lighter features. Get the connection? Over time these things affect your appearance as in colder places - lighter paler things(like how polar bears are white), hotter places - darker dimmer things(like darker hair, eyes, & skin), as a result of more sunlight and heat exposure. And then there's genetics and stuff but this most likely started it. =)

Colouring bf's hair with garnier home kit.. ahh please answer asap! :)



hi there..



my boyfriend wants his hair colouring because he's got massive roots and because we r poor ive offered to try and do it for him!!
ive bought a garnier nutrisse kit (kit 1) and we have just done a strand test.



because he wants the colour as natural as possible, im going to do tiny strands.. u get a little tooth brush thing to paste the colour on.. but how many pieces should i do?? he has dark blonde hair naturally .. and the bleach in his highlights is only on the ends at the moment.
also.. if half of the hair is bleached and the other half dark blonde roots, do u put colour on the whole length of the hair or just the root??
thanks:)
xox

to be honest though he is having about3 inches cut off it this week anyway so all the old bleach will probs be gone..

heres a pic of him (without roots)

the only thing with bleach and hair colour they dont always mix.
what you can do do little strands over the hair make sure they look even maybe 5 or 6 on each partin 
if it doent work you can always buy the loriel one 2morrow that has both colour and hightght kit in it.

for 1st application i wld put it all over the strand nxt time jst the root

i hope that helped
gud luck

I would do the cap method, you know where you pull bits of hair through the little holes in the cap, It'll be much easier to judge like that, but also seen as he has curly hair it'll be more forgiving if its not perfect. But if you cant do the cap method then you just need to make sure you seperate his hair into sections well, then use a comb end, you know the ones with the long thin metal handle and weave it through bits of hair , if you've ever had your hair highlighted at the hairdressers you'll know what I mean, then you wrap each bit in foil. I'm probably being really confusing here. Sorry! I'm sure there will be a haridresser along soon to answer it better for you. Good luck though!

There is no way the color will show up nicely unless you bleach the tips.
If you are worried about doing it yourself-- go get it done professionally so you have no hair mishaps.

The only way to make your hair look a bright color without dying it would probably be to use a hair mascara. The bad thing is that it usually washes out. I have seen a product that claims that it colors your hair bright colors without actually dying it (it's supposed to wash out in 6-12 shampoos) but I'm not sure how it would work on really dark hair. It's available at the grocery/drug store.

Definitely do not go for any kind of blunt cut, as that will only accentuate the roundness.  The best kinds of haircuts for round faces are very layered and loose, and bangs help a lot.

Here are a bunch of hairstyles of varying lengths and textures to give you some ideas:

Wash your hair, and then dry it until it is nearly dry. Twist it really messily into a bun and leave it to dry naturally for at least an hour. Spray it with some hairspray and let it out of the bun. Should create a natural wave, and give you a beach sort of look. To make it a bit more funky use a bit of wax or clay at the roots and rough it up a bit (not to close to your parting though because it will end up looking greasy)

i'd go for loose curls through the ends, use curling tongs to curl fairly thick one inch sections, spray each curl with hairspray as you go to keep them in, rake your fingers through to mess them up, then pile it all up into a messy bun , secure with pins add a thick hairband and your all set.

Ok, my hair is fine... naturally medium brown.  I straighten it.  But I think black would wash me out, so I was going to do highlighted blonde over my current hair color.

Some people say my hair is too fine for this cut... some say it would look great.  What are your honest opinions?



Any other hair suggestions are appreciated with pictures... but it must be semi long and have side bangs or no bangs.  I do not want short/one length forhead bangs.  Thanks so much!!

I think you could pull it off. For you I would suggest doing blond. Stay away from dark hair colors. I will let you knnow this is a hard hair style to manage. To get your hair to look like this it will take about thirty minutes. It looks as though, from the picture anyway you have fine hair. Which means it wont curl easy like the other girls hair will. I think you could pull it off your a very pretty girl however I would recommend something different for you. I just don't think your hair will end up looking the way you want it. Her is a hair style I think would fit you great.

Yes, I think that you can pull off the style.
It would help to get it chemically done, but that's not always the greatest idea.
Your hair may be too fine to STAY like that, but if you use a lot of mousse, hairspray, and a round barrel heat-safe comb, I'm sure it will work.
It suits your face, go for it [:

Tips on growing out bangs/hair and how to make it grow faster?



so erm, i've had bangs pretty much all of my life and after constant remarks of "oh you look beautiful, blah blah" from both my friends and family when i pull my hair back, ive decided that i might as well grow my hair out. my hair is currently past my shoulders but not by much, and a year ago my hair was fairly long. as for my bangs, they were short and sideswept, but now theyve grown out to pretty much eye level and its getting on my nerves. fyi; i already deep conditon twice a week, air-dry and don't curl/straighten it, ive got no split ends and my hair is very very soft. so, any tips on growing out my hair/bangs and or how to make it grow faster?

The best way to grow out bangs really FAST is to eat lots of veggies and fruits & take vitamin A & B , or a multi-vitamin (even better!) also apply olive oil to your hair, this can be used once a week as a mask to make hair more healthier & stronger & longer, it is organic so its VERY good for the hair.

That is the Best way to grow out your hair believe me.!

When your hair is wet don't brush it too much.
Sleep on a silky pillow as cotton or flanelette can pull on hairs.
Keep deep-conditioning it and you jstu have to wait it out.

Here are some more tips that i C&P'ed from a website

1.  If you have bangs that are shorter in the center than at the sides, wait until you can pull the center strands below your eyelashes, then get a teeny tiny trim (1/16th of an inch) to even all of the fringe hair to the same even length.  Keep in mind that bangs that are all one length will be easier to manage as they grow out.

2. Use accessories to help you manage your unruly fringe pieces.  Adjustable elastic headbands or ones with teeth that allow you to place the band at various positions on your head from right at the hairline to midway back, allows you to control renegade strands.  Experiment with matching baby barrettes that will clip mangy strands up and off your forehead near the forehead area.

3.  Play with hair paste, gel, molding mud or wax to smooth fringe hair out of your eyes.  Use styling products to direct hair to one side or back from the forehead towards the crown area.  Start with a small amount of styling product and experiment.  Add more if appropriate.

4.  Separate the bang hair into individual one inch sections.  Twist each section clockwise and then click back off the forehead with a small claw clip, bobby pin or tiny alligator clip.  Create an evenly spaced row along the front of your hairline for a chic look.  No one will even know you are growing out your bangs.

5.  Experiment with different parts to control the growing hair.  Start with a middle part and clip the hair back on either side.  Or play with side parts that allow you to sweep the hair and clip it to the side.

6.  Braid the bang area when it is damp.  Create a side part and then tightly French braid across the hairline near the forehead.  Mix in longer strands from the sides to control the braid.  Tie off the end of the braid with a chic ponytail elastic, clip or barrette.

7.  Use a clip on braid worn right at the headline to hold bangs straight back.

8.  Backcomb bangs into a mini-quiff.  Use a good setting or volumizing spray and a rat tail comb.  Tease or back comb the bangs to get lift.  Direct the quiff up and off your face. Use a great hairspray for great hold.

9.  Wear creative headgear.  Throw on a baseball cap worn backwards for uber chic.  Try on a cool beret, cowboy hat or newsboy to hide your straggly fringe.

10.  Use bobby pins to secure your bangs up and off your forehead.  Add one of the silk ribbon headbands worn right at the hairline and over the pinned strands.  You will be at the height of hair accessory fashion and will have tamed your bangs, all in one simple action.

So on Friday I'll hopefully be going to get my hair coloured blonde at a good nearby salon. :) I'd like to keep it up for quite a while, so I was just wondering how long would I have to leave 'til I had to get it touched up again? Just for future reference! Thank you in advance. :)

Not sure if you are asking for advice on how to help dried hair or what style to get your haircut....?

My hair was the same last week - over dried due to straightening, and I dye my hair too.  My last haircut was also in April, so I got it cut last week.  Unfortunately, if you don't get regular trims, it means when you do get a haircut they will have to take a little of the length off to keep it healthy.  Make sure you pay for a good hairdresser - expensive doesn't necessarily mean good though.  Find someone who knows how to remove the split ends without chopping all your hair off.  Asian hairdressers are especially good at this - my hair dresser is Japanese and she told me this is something they are trained in, yet English hairdressers never seem to have the knack..... so there's a tip.

It depends on the shape of your face and how bold you are in making a new change.  You could always go for a short crop, or just get the ends trimmed and get a fringe.  Hard to say without knowing what style you already have.

It's recommended thay you get your hair cut every 6-8 weeks.  If you have curly hair or straighten your hair it is very important that you do not leave it longer than 8 weeks or you'll get very bad split ends.

All I can really suggest is that you get regular hair cuts to try and prevent damage to your hair.  The body shop do a leave in conditioner (Amlika or something similar) that it's worth putting on you hair after it's washed before you brush it.  Wash your hair as normal with shampoo and conditioner.



I've seen some emo girls with curly hair in fashion shoots.  They tend to have vintage soft curls or mess their hair up a bit so it look like they've just rolled out of bed but dress very emo with their clothes.  If you don't mind being a bit of a rebel and trend-setter on the emo scene you could have a few days off from the straigteners until your haircut.



Or you could keep the curls get a side  long 'emo' fringe and have your hair cut very asymentriacal so one side is longer than the other and I've talking 4" or more so it's obvious that it's mean to be that way.  If you had a very asymentical cut and straightened the long side fringe and left the other bit curly with a few coloured streaks red or purple if your hair is dark you would definately pull of the emo thing and reduce damage to your hair.  A little bit of colour is probably going to be less stressful to your hair than every day straightening.

If you must straighten every day go out and buy some GHD straighteners and some expensive hair protector and accept that you will need to use a bottle a month if you straighten every day.

Sort of.  It can certainly bleach things, but when somebody says bleach, they could very well mean something else, such as sodium hypochlorite.

If we're talking hair bleach, you need to actually buy a product designed to bleach hair.  I know a guy who tried to use a bottle of peroxide from the first aid aisle, and it didn't work at all.

Should I thin my hair out behind my mom's back?



Hi I'm 13 and I have ridiculously thick hair that I want to get thinned out but my mom won't let me do it and doesn't understand how hard my hair is to deal w/. I'm getting so fed up that I'm thinking about going to the mall w/ my friend and doing it behind her back so she won't know..
Is that wrong to do that? And will it look bad if I thin it out?

If you get your hair thinned in a few weeks you will little hairs sticking up all over I also have extremely thick hair and have had it thinned and regretted it for a very long time afterwards.  Get it layered if anything but I would definitely not get it thinned.

I don't think it will look bad, but she will defo notice
and then be angry
you should've not asked and gone and had it done then been like 'i didn't think it would be such a big deal...'
but you obv cant do that now...

i think you should try and convince your mum, try and explain how hard your hair is to deal with etc, and say you won't be getting it THAT thinned
then if you want it THAT thinned say the hairdresser did it wrong lol

If you wanna go FULLY blonde, but are scared, then just put blonde or lighter brown highlights in for now. If you like it, gradually go lighter and add more highlights all around.

You just have to wait it out.
Also, some hair reaches a certain length and then stops growing.
And you can't control the rate your hair grows.
Some just grows faster than others.

Being in the sun helps your hair to grow. It is a proven fact your hair grows faster in the summer months when it has been exposed to sunlight. This is because the sun provides us with Vitamin D. I take Vitamin D pills. It helps with stong healthy bones and nail and hair growth. Maybe try that?
It cost me about twelve dollars for a bottle.

Hi,
Yes I do know of a Natural Hair lotion which is 100% free of chemicals. I have been using for almost one year
Ziravie combines tradition, science and nature to provide a mixture of natural nutrients, minerals and vitamins, which act on the scalp in depth, that in turn stimulates strong, healthy, robust hair growth, strengthening hair roots, and reduces thinning , hair loss and baldness.
 I used to buy from Spain but now it is available on ebay.co.uk under ID of hair-treatment. It is called Ziravie.
They offer external and internal nutrition which helps a lot. Using this lotion I feel Health and Beauty comes into Harmony

Try this ... http://www.ovationhair.com/cell.htm it makes hair thicker... or  you can also try castor oil.. Just use it has a hot oil treatment in hair before shampoing with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Your hair will be more thick but it will only last a day or 2.

Hi I seen these and I liked the design on them, I think they will be ok I dont know what brand makes then, I know it says headkandi but there will be a brand make like phillips or somthing that make them, if its babyliss then no matter how high a temperature it goes the plates will ruin your hair, to me they look like good slim line ones and as long as they go up to 210oc or hight you will be fine with them, £50 is not too bad for a decent pair.

Hair..... Your opinion? :)



Im having my hair done in a short while....
Either all done a dark brown/black
or dark brown/black with thin blonde bits at the end of some of my layers.
Which do you think I should have? Do you think all one colour would look more grown up? My hairs long with very short layers. I backcomb it and have a side fringe. I think that if I dont have the blonde in it might look a little boring. I like funky hair :)
What do you think ?
Do you like funky hair?
I'm 16

I think a really hot hairstyle is making your hair black than putting big blonde streaks through kinda like highlights but thicker and kind of like a bob length it looks so hotttt

I'm actually in the same dilemma as you are, I've been debating on going an all over dark brown shade or an all over dark brown shade with light blonde peekaboo pieces in the under layer of my hair. I'm actually leaning more-so towards with the blonde pieces as it'll "spice" things up a bit =] You'll stand out more rather then just being all over brunette- so I'll go with that option. I think you should get the blonde as well, it'll look really cute I'm sure! Hope I've helped.

i think maybe instead of having blonde i would have a colour such as blue purple red green 
that would be funky 
alot of people have blonde in there hair and if you want it to look a bit more original and out landish i think you should go for a colour

you could have some blonde slices in your hair along with the dark brown/black. how about red slices with the black that would look really great. talk with the hairdresser first and they can usually help u to decide. dont be afraid to ask cos thats what they are there for. good luck.

An easy to manage hairstyle?



I want to do something interesting to my hair but find it really difficult to keep my hair looking nice, of course I keep it clean but don't have to time to straighten it etc. What can I do that will be easy to keep looking great?

(My hair is just past shoulder length, dark brown, fairly thick, slightly layered and straight with a few annoying kinks) - P.S. my hair doesn't agree with fringes! They just look terrible.

You should cut it short, just below your ears, with lots of layers. Just mess it up with some gell. It'll look funky, and it's easy. :]

Hmmm, I'd suggest you go to the hairdressers and tell them you want something different but easy to manage, they'll sort it for you. Also maybe get some hair magazines and see if there is anything you fancy and just show it to a hairdresser.

How can I keep my hair straight?



I have naturally curly hair that I straighten with GHD's.
Problem is though it stays straight for a while after an hour or so it starts to go wavy and flicks out.
Any ideas how to stop this?
Ive tried changing the way I straighten so I curl the flicky bits under and different products like the one from Bedhead but it made my hair feel horrible

Spike it up with the spiking gel, if you usually have it flat it'll be different for a night out. And it also looks more fun that way too, kind of like you're up for anything then & not so neat & professional looking.

It's so short, there's not much you CAN do with it. Maybe you can just try and spike the front, and flatten the rest. Maybe even dye a section (not the permanent dye, the wash out kind).

Try the strong hold gel and push it all to the middle (a bit like a shortish mohican) - that fructis product is pretty good.

To spike it - get the gel on your thumb tip and first two finger tips, and twist random pieces into spikes, all over (don't be too neat about it).

In both cases - catch it whilst it's wet.

Have a great night out!

No .
Home waxing can remove most hairs but it won't get rid of all hair going to a salon may be more expensive but it is denfenitely worthwile and gets rid of all unwanted hair ! I would definately reccomend the salon !

Hope i helped you !

Why don't you moisturize your hair?? Lack of moisture causes frizz.. a good remedy is a homemade mayo conditioner:

Depending on the length of your hair, apply approximately 1/2 cup of mayonnaise to your dry hair. Work into hair really well and then cover your hair with a plastic bag, allowing to set for about 15 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and then shampoo as usual.

(i would leave it on for about an 2 hours for better results)*

Goodluck!

If I were you, I would just ask the principal. I know you will be nervous about it but they respect those who ask before you do it. That way you cant get in trouble. Also if you are worried about frizz, what I would do is take a shower in the morning. Try not to use a whole lot of conditioner because it will make your hair greasy. Get out and dry your hair thoroughly. Brush then upside down, apply a hand full of moose (scrunch). Then spray with hairspray. That way your hair is curly/scrunched and as long as you dont brush it at school you should be fine.

A product containing silicone can a helpful addition to your hair care arsenal.



* For flyaway or hair that suffers with static electricity, take a sheet of your favorite dryer fabric softener (like Bounce) and rub it on your hair.  The static will disappear and your hair also smells nice.

This will make your back pack smell nice.

try a lavender scent.

Tip without product : Wash your hair the evening before and when it is almost dry part it in the middle and make 4 big braids before bed ...one for each quarter of your head.  When you wake up your hair should be frizz free and wavy but not crazy.

Tip with product: King of the mods from Lush is amazing on curly thick frizzy hair. If I am too lazy to do my hair I just use the tinest bit of this rubbed in my hands and then pulled down through my waves/curls. Makes them sleek, shiny and defined.

First thing to remember is, NEVER touch your hair! it is one of the most common reasons for frizz.
As posted before me, lack of moisture is another reason for frizz, you should use a good conditioner and a gross as it sounds, people with curly hair should only wash their hair 2-3 times a week.
Another thing that would be helpful is putting a good product in your hair every morning before school, just wet your hair until it is damp and then put a frizz calming product in the palm of your hands and evenly distribute the product throughout your hair.
Also, make sure that you never brush your hair while it is dry.

try this for the next couple days and see how it works, if your hair is still persistent on becoming frizzy, then i would speak with the principle of your school to get permission to bring a hair product with you to school, as long as it is not in a spray form then i dont think anybody will mind. ( spray distributes throughout the air as well as your hair so it will effect people that may be allergic to an ingredient in the product)

Prom/Grad emergency?



Well my mom is good at hair so I figured that I had nothing to worry about but then she finds out she has an exam so here I am around 7 hours away from Prom and have no idea what to do with my hair. I can do some basic stuff but I'm bad with instructions so videos would be good. but either was is fine. I dont have money to go to a stylist or the time. Any good prom sites? I have medium length hair with layers. So if you have any ideas that would be great too. thanks!

If that is the colour that you have now you should get professional advice before you start dying your hair.  What you have is cute.  I think it should ge a little darker before you put a pink fringe on it.

Yes it is damaging but everything else is bad for your hair too hon

-exposure to cold weather
-exposure to extreme heat
-dying & bleaching anddd perming 
-blow drying 
-hair spraying



All of those things damage your hair. Make sure you do a deep conditioning once every 2 weeks and keep up on getting your hair trimmed.

Flat ironing or curling your hair everyday can cause hair damage because of the excessive heat. It takes away the natural moisture and basically fries your hair. Try not to always straighten it every single day, just do it on the days you plan on going out. Make sure you have a really good hair straightener and some hair serum to maintain the moisture in your hair.

Yes, it will ruin your hair if you use it everyday like I used to. I've always had good hair on my head as one of my positive assets until I started using the curling iron and straighteners. My hair was fried for awhile. I haven't been using any hair tool or chemicals in the past several months and my hair is getting healthier again.

Yes it is really bad, in the long run your going to have very damaged hair. maybe do it like once or twice a week, try and leave it as long as you can, also buy some sort of heat protecting sprays.  They will help your hair stay healthier for longer, but try not to be so obsessed with the straightner, it really isnt that good.

Well, it will damage your hair, and you will get split ends, and lots of frizziness, unless you use some products. Just use heat protecting spray and don't straighten it EVERY day.

'Scene Hair', Need Extensions?



I got my haircut yesterday. It's supposed to be 'Scene' style. I got short choppy layers, One on top which goes to about my eyebrows and a second layer down to my chin. Which left the back of my hair looking really thin and stupid. I've been wearing it tied up since I got it done. I want to be able to tease the top layers and wear it down but I cant because the back/bottom part of my hair is way to thin. When most girls get their hair cut like this do they wear extensions underneath to thicken it out? If not, How do they do it? I'm going to buy some clip in ones on Saturday but I don't wanna waste money if I don't need them =]
This is the hairstyle I was going for, Notice how thick and nice her back/bottom part of her layer is?:

her hairs kinda thin on the bottom too though...
i wear extensions pretty much everyday but i dont have scene hair and they are great and definately worth an investment if you buy the good quality ones.

you could just backcomb the underneath gently and use hairspray because chances are the thinner your hair is on the bottom - the more extensions will show

Dye your hair light brown and then get bleach blond high lights will make you look very sexy and will bring a lot of attention to your cute face.

Another good thing to do if you do not wish to have highlights just go for a dark brown. If you are the emo type Jet black

They all seem to be different shades to me, but I really love the first one. It looks natural, and cute. You should stay away from the darker-roots-lighter-ends trend - it's not your thing.
You should go for a more softer blond because it seems so real, and makes you look very girly and sweet - a good thing by the way.

I don't think you'd look good as a brunette either, because that would also look fake. We're going for real here, babe, so stick to what you know!

I don't know what types of hair this is for but it's called "Doo-Gro." I'm pretty sure they sell it in different bottles for different kinds of hair...so I'm pretty sure they'll have one for you. I just started using it so I can't tell you how it works, but my friend uses it and she said it works really well for her. You can find it at Sally's Beauty Supply.



I've also heard that something called Nioxin and Nutri-ox work really well. You can also buy those at Sally's.

Taking vitamins will help make your hair healthier, which will also make it grow faster :)

I take prenatal vitamins with iron, not because I am trying to be pregnant or that I am pregnant, they are one of the few things I CAN take with iron that does not break me out in hives.  I am iron anaemic.
My hair grows like mad too.  I also drink about a glass of milk a day and eat cheese.
I donate about a foot to two feet of hair a year to Locks Of Love for women and young girls with alapecia.
It takes time.  I may be white but good health seems to be a benefactor in growing hair and nails no matter what your colour.

trim regularly, wash regularly, dont color, eat healthy..

i think i have your type of hair(im east african).  But i relax my hair, and it grows to half way down my back. i wash my hair(and use heat on it) once a week(i can go that long without washing hair because i dont use moisturizers-just small amt of antifrizz serum-, so there's no oilness), and relax and trim it every 2-3 months and nothing else.

Depends. You have to focus on retaining the length you have. If you retain your length then you will *see* growth, because if your hair is breaking off then it's not going to seem like its growing. Hair grows an average of 6 inches per year, but *your* hair growth could be more or less because it depends on genetics. You can attain your optimal hair growth by taking good care of your hair and health because they go hand-in-hand. Drink plenty of water and make sure you keep your scalp clean so it doesn't hamper growth. Try to minimize breakage. Blacks and mixed girls can usually use the same hair regimens/products/resources because our hair is usually the same: very curly (assuming it's chemical free).



There is no secret to hair growth because your hair will grow no matter what, unless you've damaged your scalp to the point that hair will not grow in certain spots. It comes down to keeping your hair from breaking off so you can take advantage of that growth. There is nothing that can make your hair grow faster than it's genetically supposed to. I'm black (non-mixed) and I dont' have a problem with hair growth, but I have had a problem with breakage in the past that prevented my hair from getting longer. There are also things you can do to hamper your hair growth like putting grease on your scalp because it clogs the pores.



Protective styles is also something people do to help with hair growth. They wear weaves, wigs, or braids for several months to keep from manipulating their hair. As long as they don't comb, brush, use heat, or do anything to keep their hair from breaking off then they will begin to see length after a few months.



I don't know what websites/message boards you've been to, but I've added some in the sources section. Long Hair Care Forum, for instance, is dedicated to helping people obtain long natural or permed hair. You can get ideas from these places and from people who have the same or similar hair texture.

I don't know what hair type you have, but I'm assuming your natural. I'm natural, too, but natural hair comes in many different textures, and there are some mixed girls with the nappiest-type hair, so they all don't have the type of curls you've seen.

I would recommend a healthy diet. Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and protein. You may want to try a supplement, but I haven't seen any valid medical evidence that they work. I have heard of products like Doo Gro. A girl at school used to use every product they brought out. It made no difference to her hair so we all called "Won't Gro!" Try the Organic Root Stimulator system. You may have to face that not all of us were born to have long hair and may want to try some shorter styles. I am loving the hairstyle Estelle rocks (have added a link to a picture). I cut 5 inches off of my own hair to get the style Sayesha had on America's Next Top Model cycle 9.  Short hair rules!

Your hair grows approx. 1/4 of an inch a month.  So, every 3 months, cut off 1/4 of an inch.



Vitamin E will make your hair grow faster and healthier.  Nails too.
DON"T blow dry your hair.  It kills the ends and makes you have to cut off more hair.

there is no way to magically grow your hair out you just have to be patient
trim abut an inch or so every 6 weeks so it will take out of the damaged ends for then when your hair reaches the length you want it is healthy

There is no special way to make your hair grow any longer all you can do is wait and take care of it and the best time to trim it is every 4 to 6 weeks and you should be good.  good luck

I heard that eating crust makes your hair grow a little more :P
Or you can just get extensions.
You should probably cut your hair according to how the shape of your head looks, such as chubbiness, cheek bones, or the general shape.
I usually just cut my hair a little above my shoulder about twice a year.

I hope I helped! :D

Sally's Hair & Beauty Supplier is the best one but quite pricey.You might get cheaper from ebay if you like online shopping. Also Accessory shops like Claire's is good as well. if you friends abroad, ask them the cost of hair extensions there.you never know,sometimes even with post fees,is much cheaper than in your own country.

I suggest you shower everyday.
If your shampoo is very strong, use it only every other day,



but if not, use it everyday.
You should also use a hair conditioner everyday, even if you're not shampooing it.
You can permanently straighten it if you want.
It costs some money, but it's worth it if you get a good one. :]

Actually, how many time you should wash your hair depends on the texture and how long it is. As yours are rough, 1 or 2 times will be largely enough. Also, choose a well-adapted shampoo and conditioner according to your hair type. You can also use this home made stuff- you mix 50ml of yogurt with 3 tsp of lemon juice, 2 tsp of coconut milk and 1 egg. You use it once in a week for about 1 month. This will help your hair to shine and reduce its roughness.

going that blonde you posted would probably not take on ur hair right now if it's golden brown.. but if it did, and ur pale, it might make you look ill.. i think the brown (the last one) would be more healthy looking, and the black would be too much..

dont mix the brown and black, it will probz just go a weird sickly brown with half black bits;/

To be safe, I would go with the brown itself, not mixing it or anuthing, this will give you a nice tone and darker complexion of your skin to and is not a very drastic change, you will look older tho.

Dying your hair completely black would look trashy :/
Mixing the brown and black just wouldn't work cause the black would over power the brown.
The blonde would make you look even more pale but sometimes it works.
You could get more tan and dye your hair blonde but I highly think that the dark brown is the BEST way to go.
I dyed mine DARK BROWN and it looks GREAT. 
&& I am on the pale side too so it looks really flattering on my skintone and makes my face look very nice and pure looking.

My father had hair implants and to be totally honest with you, he still looked pretty bald. It was a painful process for a little bit more hair and it didn't make him look any better. Don't put yourself through that. Shave your head and embrace your look. It's such a charming look for a man these days. If you don't think you can, go for the hair transplantation which is hair from your own scalp. As painful as it is, it works better than those lotions you're talking about. Minoxidil is pretty good and promotes a little hair regrowth, but like I said before: my own father had hair implants and used most lotions and products available in the market. He always still looked bald. I am sorry if this answer disappoints you in any way.

I have allot of hair and it is very straight and I keep it short. I can't get it t do anything at all. BUT, if I put some "serious" think glue like gel in my hair and then let it dry and then put my hat on. When I wear my hat for like 3 hours, the hat will cause my hair to look like it has "curl" in it. It really looks great after I take my hat off. I have the George Clonney hair cut from 8 years ago but still looks great on me. But that's my hair. Straight as hell unless I put a hat on it with gel in my hair and then my hair has a personality then. It comes alive!!!..lol

My hair just touched my bra strap. It's layered into a longish "asian mullet" so I can curl it more easily. It's bright pink right now, and pretty easy to take care of. I wash my hair every other day so my hair doesn't dry out too much, and use products to keep it soft.

Sometimes I straighten, most of the time it's up in a messy bun, so when I let it down, it is wavy.

My hair is sometimes wavy and sometimes straight. I don't use flat irons or any heating devices. I like to keep my hair natural (: When I comb it, it goes pretty straight with some pretty waves at the tips of my hair but when it isn't combed, it goes so wavy. I normally blow dry my hair to keep it voluminous and nicely tamed. When using my blowdryer, i always use the cool shot button for a cool breeze to prevent damaging hair frequently. When I don't use a blowdryer, it goes frizzy otherwise it is very easy to take care of. So i guess its 1/4 wavy and 3/4 straight. :D It can change some shape ocassionally

It is a nice STYLE.
I wouldn't advise getting your hair cut like this unless you can STYLE it like this. Because its not the hair CUT which makes the difference its how the girl has styled it.
Also, many girls who use this style have used extensions to achieve it.
I dont mean to be rude, but when i use the words in capitals its because i want you to understand that its not about the cut, its about how you style it. I.e mousse, gel, backcombing.
However, it is lovely.
but without seeing you we cant tell whether it will suit you. It all depends on face type you see.
:)
Hope this has helped in some way!

You have to go through the 'Twatty-Hair' stage at some point no matter what you do. I've done it a few times, right in the middle of it at the moment, in fact. Best advice from personal experience - buy a hat that suits you and don't leave the house without it for a while. It gets worse before it gets better but it doesn't really take that long to get through it :-)

the best thing to do is do this,
i use this method every night, my hair is rele curly and it just stays straight all day =]
so here goes...
1.wash your hair normally with whatever shampoo you use, then condition it.
2.towel dry it as much as you can
3.use a hair dryer to sraighten it dry down
4.once its dry get a anti frizz serum (i use the loreal one in the orange bottle)
5.straighten it 
6.put some more serum on, but dont overload
7.when you wake up in the morning, the majority of your hair should be straight, just go over it and put a little bit more serum on.
it doesnt make your hair go greasy at all
just dont use to much :D

it works wonders for me (Y)



hope i helpedd x

i use a tresseme salon silk shampoo & a tresseme heat defence conditioner.



then i sometimes use this really great straightening lotion thing. you put it in while your hair is wet, then you blow dry it with a straight brush, & it relaxes the kinks & waves & makes it straight. if you straighten it after using that it stays straight for a few days sometimes. its called Charles Worthington Results, salon shine Relax&Unwind.



id recomend it for anyone.



after straightening hold a can of hairspray far away from your hair & spray it on while shaking your hair (so it doesnt clump together or go dry or solid) then brush it lightly, that keeps it straight  :)



hope i helped X

<question>



Does hair grow faster in the USA than in the UK?



The question often comes up "Help! I have cut off my hair and I hate it - when will it grow back to where it was?".



In the USA, this is often for the hair extension business scam Locks of Love, but there I hear two feet is lost, but grows back in just a couple of years ready to be harvested again.  Also in the USA, we often hear of thigh-length, knee-length or even floor-length. They think nothing of hacking this off, confident that it will be back there in just a couple of years.  Whether this is true or not, maybe some Americans could comment?

In the UK, this is unheard of.  I do not know of anyone with hair longer than hip-length, and that is very uncommon.  Much below mid-back is rare.  If someone cuts off their hair here, the chances are that it will never grow back, but stays stubbornly just below the shoulders.  So many times have I seen women in their 20s or 30s with foot-long hair sighing and saying I love long hair, but I cut it off and I am trying to grow it again.  But it never does grow again.

If this is true, then is it something in the diet?  The one thing I can think of right now is Selenium.  This trace nutrient is common in the USA, but deficient in British soils.  If Selenium does help hair grow, then the wonder hair growing supplement might just be Selenium, which is present in Brazil nuts, among other American foods.

im british, & have been to 3 different parts of america (san fransisco, new york and latham, massachussets) and i have to say i actually noticed people had much shorter hair in america.

i did a bit of reasearch & discovered that highly populated and places with more buildings, cities, pollution, noise etc. tend to weaken the roots of the hair making it weaker & more vulnerable to split ends and being broken, resulting in people in America trimming it more often.

i hope this helped, sorry i couldnt find out more x

Hair grows about 6 inches (Im a USA citizen) per year. Some women get their long hair cut off because they are tired of it, or because if they are older, it doesnt look good anymore. Not all women have long pretty hair here, maybe just the ones on tv. The average woman here isnt real fun to look at,sad but true.

well... on the average hair only grows half an inch per month ( a little more or less depending on each person).... so with that being said: wait! and it'll happen. However you can increase your potential to make sure that you reach your maximum limit with a few key things.



Make sure you get your vitamins.  B complex is most important when it comes to hair.



And i know it sounds crazy but... don't cut it!  People say that trimming your hair makes it grow... which is complete and utter bs.  Lol why would cutting the end of something make your hair grow faster?



Also some people say scalp massages can help stimulate growth as well tho.

Supplements for hair. It should include vitamins E and B. Fish oil suppelements are also really good for hair, skin and nails. These are definitely worth the money. Don't believe in topical treatments like shampoo "hair growers"...they may be cheap but if they don't work you're just throwing away your money. Healthy growing hair depends on what you put in your body.

The best tip is to first trim it, just to get rid of the split ends...and then rarely use flat irons, hair dryers, curling irons..they damage your hair and make it hard for it to grow. 
I know this from experience. In the summer I barely do anything to my hair, since I don't do as much or I'm working out or outside...so I just shower and go. My hair has grown so much. I cut it to my shoulder a year ago and now it is to "chest" (you know what I mean). Styling is the number one problem for hair. Try to go natural and it will grow like a weed.

A few questions about lice!?



I'm training to be a hairdresser and I absolutely love it! Except for one small matter... we get at least five customers come in a day with head lice! Our salon has a system were if someone has lice they can pay an extra £15 per adult (£7 per child) and be treated. All of the staff must know how to treat someone with lice and how to recognise the symptoms ETC. My questions are these, how can I recognise the symptoms before I start to work on the client, what is the most efficient way of telling the client, how can I treat the client the best and how can I stop MYSELF getting them?

Thanks in advance x

ok, i'm a hairdresser of 18 yrs, some facts, 1) lice don't jump they crawl, so u have to be pretty close to get them, hence kids get them more and the adults tend to be parents, 2) they go on any clean hair, tinted or not.
If one has lice, u will c little red dots behind the ears, where they've bit. Also base of neck. Biggest sign is white oval small eggs on the hair shaft, normally about 1cm from scalp, these will not move as they are stuck on with a glue type substance. To check if they are live eggs then u need to crack the egg between  two thumb nails, if it clicks/makes a crack sound then u no they are eggs. 
Though everyone knows or has had lice at least once in their lifetime, it's still embarrassing, so b tactful, just take them to one side, or to the basin, less obvious, and quietly inform them they have an infestation. When u do your consultation, comb the hair, part it as u are talking and check, less obvious wat you're looking 4. 
As long as your hair doesn't come into contact with theirs , you'll be fine, i've not caught them in 18 yrs.
Best way, and most natural way to treat, and not damaging the hair is to apply lots of cheap conditioner, making sure the scalp is thickly covered. This works if done properly because lice crawl up the hair to the scalp to feed, by sucking your blood, nice hey, so the idea is to make hair slippery and therfore they can't feed and die, and the eggs loosen and with a nit comb they r removed. Leave on overnight, rinse in the morning and u should see them in the bath, if infestation is bad then chemicals will be needed.
But if your boss is charging that amount of money to get rid then he should make sure that he has trained and informed his staff sufficiently to be able to carry out this service.

theres no real symptoms except for itchy head. if they have lice you will be able to see them and teh eggs when parting the hair.

just tell the client you see lice. simple as that. its somethign you HAVE to get rid of. all you do is shampoo their hair with stuff that kills them throw tons of conditioner on their hair and pick it out tediously with a long thin metal brush.

thats really disgutsting .. you should wear your hair up, as lice can jump from head to head and if you dye your hair lice don't go in dyed hair (small side note)

If someone has headlice they will have small creamy-white balls that stick to their hair (eggs) and you might even see a few bugs. Also they might be complaining about having an itchy head.

If you're worried about catching head lice, then tie back your hair so that it doesn't touch theirs

Hope this helps 
:)

Dirty beggers. Are they thick not to know they have nits? Ask the salon manager the procedure and what to look for, my head is itching at the thought. God I wouldnt dare go the salon with nits. Got them though when my boys were at school and we had a nightly routine, we didnt get them again after that.

look for anything movind but mostly look fof there white eggs which will be in warm areas like behind the ears. get right into there scalp to look. keep your hair tied back but you wont really be that close when you put the treatment in and washing it and by the time you are cutting theyll be gone lol

Keep ur head away from theirs, take them aside and tell them they will probably b very embarrassed but that's not ur fault, ur boss or work friends should be able to tell u hot to use the necessary lice lotions.

My friend worked in a salon and if sum1 had lice the hairdresser wouldnt style their hair, the customers with the problem were just told to leave the shop.

First comb through there hair and check (without making it obvious) if they have head lice, then you should not cut their hair, you are liable to finish cutting if you find out after starting.
Keep your hair tied back at all times to avoid your hair contacting their hair.
As for the rest IS THIS LEGAL????? My  children have had head lice and if you go to the chemist the qualified pharmacists has to ask questions about your health to decide on the appropriate treatment, and also nurses need to check the medical conditions of everyone else in the household to prescribe the appropriate treatment.
The treatments can cause severe breathing problems in some people, I personally would not be putting myself in the position of getting sued.
Got to go I am itching my head now.

Their really is no symptons...Usually they may have a itchy head, or You can see little white eggs on their hair strand, take your finger and slide it down, If it doesn't come off easy..It's most likely a nit..Plus, You may see one(a bug.).



Just talk to your client quietly...Don't speak loudly, cause it may be slightly embarassing...Or you can pull her aside, take her to a back room, and tell her.



and keep your hair back, would be the easiest way to make sure you don't get it. Or if you wear hair down..Push it back..Don't let it fall near the clients head..or When you do a clients hair, Pull your hair back into a pony.

There you go. 
Just tell the customer quietly but civilly that you have notice they have an infestation of head lice & would they like to be treated for an extra fee?
Best way I've found to stop my daughter ( who has waist length hair )having them is Tea Tree oil, add a few drops to your shampoo bottle at home.

Not really im afraid, if you straighten / blow dry / brush it a lot, that slows it down, as the hair damage is repaired, rather than adding to extra growth.



Condition it a bit, thats all you can really do.

sorry, no.  just a healthy diet, keep the ends trimmed to reduce breakage, don't do mean things to your hair ie; bleach,heat, rough brushing.  your hair grows in phases.  theres nothing we can do to make it go any faster!!  believe me there are millions would love to hear a yes to your question.

this is what i do.

Crack 3-5 eggs. depending on how thick and long your hair is. min, is 3.
 take out the egg yolks and add 2 caps full of milk. mix the egg whites and milk together very well for 10 seconds, apply all through the hair.
Than, fill a bowl full of just milk. than apply only 2 small spoon fulls of yogurt, mix well.  Use all the milk on your hair, making sure it's well covered, fold your hair up in a towl and leave on for an hour. Take a warm ( NOT hot ! ) shower, apply a small amount of shampoo through the hair, than apply a lot of conditioner !

Eggs, milk, and yogurt have a lot of protein. Do that once or twice a month, and you'll see changes. :))

i do it all the time ! and it also makes your hair stronger, silkier, and smoother. :)

Do a regular quiff on top. grab some strands on each side of your temples and twist them loosely and pin them to the back, somewhere behind that quif. this adds a bit of volume and is great day look and for long hair. you could style it up a bit by using a curling iron at the ends of your long hair for loose curls.

Everybody has a scalp. It's only natural.
There were some tribes of native american indians that would remove it forcefully from their enemies.
Many men shave their hair so the scalp will glisten and shine in the sunlight.
Many people decide to tattoo their scalps.
I think it's rather strange you didn't have a scalp until a few days back.
Must have been a horrible condition to have lived without one for so long.

I made a mistake once of using a relaxer that's too strong on my hair and it over processed and looked like it was melting.. After that I cut it all off and stopped using anything with harsh Chemicals and started using Amla Oil by Dabur in my hair. I would apply it after every shampoo, but remember not to shampoo too much bc it takes out all the oils and your hair needs some. I have curly hair so I only shampoo about 2-3 times per week, and all other times use water and conditioner. I also use henna in my hair (it tints it reddish color) and it makes it strong, but I only use it like once evey couple months. You can find stuff like that in Indo-Paki & middle eastern stores ( I don't originate from either of those ethnic backgrounds but their hair is really nice for a reason). My hair is longer than I've ever had it before and its SO healthy! O and keep your dead ends clipped too, it helps promote regrowth of healthy ends.

Get your hair trimmed regularly--it will grow faster.

I used to get my hair trimmed about an inch every three months, and my hair would grow over an inch a month. Now I'm getting my hair trimmed roughly every 9-12 months, and it's growing about half as fast.

Vitamins and good nutrition are also a good idea. Poor eating habits and overly stringent diets can cause brittle hair and other hair problems.

If that's not fast enough, or your hair is not as thick and full as you want it to be, there is always hair extensions. ;-)

vitamin B and E supplements... in addition to fish oils/ omega 3 supplements. Hair growth has mor to do with nutrition than what you put on your head.

Also, just avoid damaging your hair from heat and chemicals. These don't "stop" your hair from growing but they can break your hair or cause split ends, which may prompt you to get a trim...hence slowing down hair growth.

Dont wash your hair everyday. it will make your hair dry and hard to manage. But its not as bad with boys hair so if you still end up doing the gel and wash everyday it wont be too bad.
But at the end of each day just shower and rub your hair while in the shower. This wont get rid of your natural oils but it will get rid of most of the gel. Then every two days wash your hair and you wont get build up at all. Also you can condition your hair which will also help restore its natural condition. but this is every second day as well. hope this helps!!

Washing your hair takes off the natural substances and oils that are healthy for your hair, and by washing it everyday you will need to continuously do that as you're hair will just become greasy within a day if you don't.

If you're using shampoo everyday it will probably take the natural oils out of you're hair, depending on your hair type. As long as you're hair feels like it's in good condition then it will probably be ok, just use conditioner after you wash it. If you're concerned about it though, ask your barber next time you get your hair cut.

Not if you use a shampoo for frequent washing. Most say on the bottle for frequent use. As you are spiking it every day, it won't hurt, but buy some Vo5 ht oil and do your hair every weekend with that, to keep your hair and scalp in good condition.

Not at all, that's a common myth that many people will continue to tell you, even though it's been tested and retested and always comes back to the same answer - if you use a mild shampoo (almost all shampoo's and gels are mild) then no it wont strip the natural oils and no it certainly wont make you bald. Happy washing :)

I have washed my hair every time I shower for as long as I can remember. For the last 12 years I have lived in Thailand and usually shower 3 times a day. If I have been out of shampoo I have used washing up liquid. I have never used a conditioner. At 63 I still have a full head of healthy hair even though a few grey ones have begun to appear.

Everyone's different.  I personally think it's okay for guys to wash their hair every day.  If you are just putting gel in it you are probably fine.

Hair is dead once it leaves the hair follicle so its a bit of an odd question. Really you need to know will it affect the condition ?
Well as long as you use a good shampoo and conditioner and rinse well then no then it wont harm the hair.
Has no effect on balding whatsover - thats genetic

Depends on how hot the water is and your hair type.
And the shampoo/conditioner you use.
If the water is hot it can cause some heat damage. That's what I have heard.

Yes, it will. Leave the gel alone if you can - just look at the ingredients. Go find a good health food shop which also has cosmetics and ask to see the manager. Explain your problem - i'll bet they can come up with a good hair dressing product and an even better one for removing it which will not damage your hair - second bet - these will both be cheaper than what you are using right now! Good luck xx

if you go to a good hair dresser, they could give you a perm. But dont get them alot cause it will destroy your hair. Then after you get the perm use a mousse that is for curly hair and you should be good to go.

Try the foam rollers.NO HEAT NEEDED.  There are some plastic ones as well.  You have to put tiny pieces of hair into them then roll them up starting from the tip all the way to your scalp and clip them.  Once you've done your entire head then put some hair spray on ALL OF IT and go to sleep.  The next morning, take them out and add more hair spray.  You're hair will be really curly all day. Remember, small chunks of hair so this will take time.  Good luck.

Hmm.... the other thing would probably be to braid your hair and leave it overnight. That wont be curls but it will be thick wavy. Since you dont like curling irons or rollers... there isnt anything else.



Try the rollers and blow dry your hair with the blow dryer on cool instead of warm since you dont like the heat!

Would vibrant colors in hair seem weird?



I have recently just dyed my hair dark brown, my original hair color was brown to begin with, I have pale skin (I never tan), blue eyes, and medium length hair. Just tonight two of my guy friends said I would look good with pink hair. I don't think I could ever picture myself with pink hair or any bright hair color like that though highlights might not be too bad. I'm unsure as to what color I'd have seeing as how I do have dark brown hair and pale skin. I wouldn't want anything too dramatic seeing as how I would like to maintain a clean look without looking too crazy. I was thinking pink or possibly purple, but still I'm not sure. Does anybody have any ideas?

to some poeple it is weird, and it does become pretty uncomfortable if you dye your whole head.
i have a friend and she regrets dyeing her hair purple because she has to put up with whispers, stares, and sarcastic comments. when she goes out all you can see is little girls and boys pointing and gigleing at her.

if you want to dye your whole head then you better be strong enough to handle all of this.

but i reckon streaks or lowlights are ok, and i think you should get them and get used to it before you go and dye your whole head.

oh i also think that judging by your description you would look good with light brown hair,

Someone already mentioned a free website where you can view.
Vibrant hair colors are the thing now.
There is color spray you can check out, try those at least you won't make a mistake and it washes out.
If you like the results. Then color your hair.

If they arnt real human hair then they probably need throwing out as they dont last that long. Maybe invest in some real ones, mine usually cost around £40 whenever im not wearing them i put loads of conditioner on them put them in a plastic bag leave them for a few days then wash them all out shampoo etc then blowdry keeps them all smooth.

I have a blunt heavy fringe - what hairstyle can I have for my wedding?



I have currently got very dark brown hair in a bob with a heavy blunt fringe, I am planning on growing my main hair long (have 18 months so should become a reasonable length). However I definitly want to keep my blunt fringe as it suits me but have no idea how to do the rest of my hair as people rarely tend to have fringes on their wedding day? Any suggestions of styles  could have, links to pictures of hairstlyes would be great! 
The fringe is just like the picture in the link probably slighty thicker though - http://www.adpunch.org/images/nelly-furt... )

I've cut my own fringe and can't wait to get it out. You go through phases of wanting a fringe and then getting rid of it it takes ages to grow it out again. Its best to pick a style and get a fringe cut into the style. Like one bit of hair that sweeps over your forehead for example. I think my blocky straight fringe looks too childish. Ask your hairdresser how long a fringe would suit you, I hate fringes that are longer than the eyebrow but some people suit long fringes.

i have long hair, and i got a straight fringe.. 
i liked it but after i got an A-semetric fringe 
also known as a sweeping fringe 
and that suits me personally more 
it depends on your face shape..
when you next go to the hair dressers explain what you would like and 
ask if they think it'd suit you.. it will grow out if you dont like it :)

or try getting a side fringe, and then go to a full fringe.
get a feel for it without going in head first.

good luck.
hope this helps

Another question about ghd curling haha?



when i curl my hair with my ghds it comes out really well but i coc my hair is so thick i cant keep the sections between the plates, i've tries uding smaller section but im after a looser curl and smaller section gives me tight curls.

any suggestion, tried using an elastic and putting dragging it out with the straighteners but it means the hair doesn't curl

thanks

She's okay. Maybe with a make over-- she needs eyebrow and eye definition, with a little color in her cheeks and her lips. 
She looks like she could be a stunner all dolled up...but I wouldn't wanna see her first thing in the morning or right after she washed her face....

How to manage my black hair when i'm away at college?



I'm a 18 year old black woman away @ college. My stylist told me to wash my hair every week because I have natural oil glands. My hair tends to grow faster on the side I don't sleep on but lately is has been growing faster. I was told black people do not have this natural build up of oil. But do anybody have any other or if it is wrong, correct advice for keeping my hair up?

you can do braids, or grow it out so that you can wear it in a nice ponytail carefree.  I personally wear my hair natural just do wet sets.  Those styles worked for me in college.  Short hair cuts can be harder to maintain since they are high maintenance.

this is simple--and low maintenance.
all you have to do is dry it, run a little mousse through it, and then spritz it with a little spray and you are good to go in about 10 minutes.

you could just not dry it, brush it out, scrunch it up with some spray, and add a cute ribbon or something, and you'll have very chic hair in 2 minutes.
this is a really cute style

it wont come out like that by just towel drying it.

you will need a texturizing cream to put on your hair when wet (after the shower). rub through your hair. when blow drying, use a round brush to curl up the layers. once dry take a 1" curling iron and pull random chunky sections of hair and curl under.

<question>



..Where can I buy...?



A spray or something that protects hair from heat
(especially straightening) damage?

I get quite a few compliments from people
who say it's pretty and shiny, I don't want
to lose a lot of that. I never used to straighten in and usually wore it up, unless it was a special occasion or I felt like wearing it down. So now, I'm starting to straighten it a lot
more often, because it looks better than before
and I don't want to damage it too much.
I'm not straightening it EVERY day, besides my side
bangs, but where can I find something 
that protects it? It doesn't matter if it's expensive, 
but it has to be good.

Thanks.

Redken has a Shimmering oil that puts a barrier between your hair and the sun. There is no actual SPF and stuff for your hair- that's SPF bull winkle is for the skin. The important thing to do is to put that barrier between your hair and the sun. Here's the direct sight to the shimmering oil: http://www.redken.ca/_en/_ca/products/pr... and here's the link for the UV rescue line: http://www.redken.ca/_en/_ca/products/ra... GOOD LUCK!!!!!



P.S. as for the straightening try Redken "Heat Glide" you could probably use that instead of the shimmering oil spray because, again it's the barrier between your hair and the sun that protects it. This product protects your hair from the sun AND heat damage, if you don't have much hair DON'T use too much, you may make it look oily. AND AGAIN LUCKKKKK!!!!!! x] ♥ Heres the heat glide direct product site: http://www.redken.ca/_en/_ca/products/pr... and heres the "smooth down" line site:http://www.redken.ca/_en/_ca/products/ra... for the entire site form step one: http://www.redken.com/international/

Not really..your face makes you look older or younger, changing your hair colour can sometimes make you look a little older or younger, but it depends on the person, the colour they suit and their face shape.

It depends. Depending on your face, it could make you look younger, or make you look like you're older & trying to look younger.

it depends on your skin tone as to what type of hair color best suits you.

Blonde hair does add light around your face-but with the wrong skin tone it will wash you out.

I hope so!  I was originally dark-haired, then dyed it for years to cover the grey (dyed it almost black).  18 months ago I had blonde and brown highlights.  I liked it so much, I then went completely blonde 1 year ago.  I've had compliments from everyone who knows me.  I love it!

Hi there.If the woman's skin tone is quite dark like Middle East nations,they should wear a little bit make up to not look tired.If she's black,it's not a good idea.if she's got a fair skin tone like Europeans,going blonde will suit her a lot especially with Ash for dark color eyes or Golden tone for bright color eyes.Also High-lights or Low-lights make it more beautiful.

okay. lose the facial piercings. make your style very fashionable, like not just teeshirts and jeans. maybe like a cami or tanktop. or a vintage tee. also maybe try tanning spray or tan as much as possible in the sun. try to wear makeup and jewlery like silver heart neckalaces or crowns. try getting cool shoes, like glatators and try some skinny jeans. it will really bring the best of you out.

Well I certainly dont think you are ugly at all, in fact I think you are very pretty,  the only way i think you could improve the picture is for  you to smile,  beauty comes from within so if you believe you are attractive  you will come across that way,  a little smile will make all the difference.  :-)

first off, i think you are a nice looking person, would like to see you smile.  i don't think you should worry about high school boys.  i know you don't want to hear that, but take it from someone much older.... in the grand scheme of things.... they really don't matter.  you have to do what makes you feel good inside, if its a little blush, or mascara, or a nice perfume....when your happy inside the outside will show that. when i look at your pics, you look dark and sad...if your not that inside then experiment with different looks.  lighter clothes, smile more, down size or lighten your lip stud.  pull your hair back on one side.  stuff like that.  if you are dark and sad.... that's where you need to start.... inside!  but just go back and read my first sentence... its true!

http://www.iforgetthenameofthatsong.com/...

also you should try adding more make up you have really pretty eyes play them up, not too drastically but liner and maybe a smokey eye. next with such light skin try bare essentails powder foundation it works great and will give you a nice even look. I would also consider lightening your hair maybe adding some copper or red (wine) highlights. But just be more confident and put yourself out there. your a pretty girl no need to feel otherwise

You are beautiful no matter what...all we need to do is making some changes. First loose the piercings ( facial ) keep your regular earrings ( ear ), then we need to change a look in your hair, maybe dye it a bit lighter to give you a softer look and not too dramatic as black is. Then maybe a little makeup...not much just enough to cover some redness on your skin, and just a bit of mascara, you don't need much, remember the more natural you are the better it is. Then regarding your wardrobe keep it modern but yet casual, some jeans and a nice t-shirt or casual tank top, loose the big fat runners and long black t-shirts, we want to see what your body looks like GUYS too!!!! :)
Hope this helps, and good luck.

First of all I am not a stylists but I have had many years of these kind of issues with myself and my friends. I am 22. I would like to say you are very pretty but your hair and eyebrows aren't working for you. Your eyebrows are way too thin. Your hair color doesn't compliment your skin so much. I would go a couple shades lighter and then get some blond and may soft caramel color highlights. That lip piercing really needs to go away to hun. It is hiding your lips. You have angie jolie lips. Good luck hun!

I have 3 twin brothers and when I was thirteen as a prank their friends and them cut off a 4 inch chunk of my hair so I had to cut my hair short. As the hair guy was putting on the cape on me he misunderstood and so he started to cut I started to see my hair in my lap and on the floor and he gave me a chin length bob with long bangs. And the hair guy used clippers on my neck and bangs for softness I hated the whole thing and the worst part was that my brothers sat in the chairs next to me watching me and laughing at me as my hair was being cut off.

What hairstyle would best fit me?



I have a receding hair line at the temples...its not quite extreme 'yet' but its definitely noticeable...right now i am just shaving my head every day.. i was thinking of maybe growing some short hair since im not going bald all over... i was thinking of getting a crew cut styled forward to help even out my rather large forehead and temples and bring some attention to my face rather than my shaved head lol. i think it will look alright if i grow it a little longer than the average cut and style it forward...maybe ... i think it would look better than having 0 hair. what do you think?

You have lots of options. I think you should get the style where there's some hair at the top and tapered or shaved at the sides. Refer below:

It'll lighten the black, but if you're doing it at home, not a lot of those kits/products are strong enough to lift black a lot. Black is the hardest color to get rid of. The only way to do it is bleach. Most of the time, it's best to bleach it and then tone it, as the lightening can cause it to turn reddish/orangeish.

That is a job for a professional hair colorist. Black dye is extremely hard to remove, if you attempt yourself, you may end up with orange hair. See a pro for her advice on how to correct it. she may take a sample of your hair and bleach it or strip the black dye to see if your hair is healthy enough to withstand the chemical process.

It could turn green, I'm serious. I had brown hair with golden highlights before I dyed my hair with a semi-permanent color "black"....when the black started to fade my hair was greenish for some time. Black hair dyes are the *most difficult* to color over...I suggest let the hairdresser do the fixing for you. Sorry but there's no natural way to get rid of the black. Black stays like a pimple.

It will go ORANGE!!!!!

Black is the darkest tone of colour you can get, there are many colour molecules and stages that have to be broken through before returning to a natural brown or blonde colour...

My only advice would be to use Head and Shoulders shampoo twice a day until a natural / lighter shade is reached.. Honestly this shampoo can remove varnish from a table.. I wouldnt recommend it as general everyday use but it is FANTASTIC for stripping unwanted hair colour (or dandruff)..

It should and may only take a few washes or weeks for your hair to be light enough to leave naturally or dye over with a lighter shade..

You could like you said bleach for 10 or so minutes and then dye over with a lighter shade, however the results are likely to be uneven and your hair will be in awful condition.

Blow dry your hair to create volume to your bangs and hair. Use hairspray after wards so that way your hair stays in one place instead of separating.

the gaps in the fringe are usually produced by a cow's lick (and no i dont mean the animal licked you!)  - this is seen at the front of the hairline where you fringe is in a whirl! meaning this hair will part or stick out at funny angles.

have you tried having your fringe on the other side you may find it lays better.

other than that im afraid your hair pattern is not suitable for a side or anytype of fringe as it will never sit flat! did your stylist not tell you about it at the time you had it cut in?

I have a friend that has the same thing, her hair is very thin so her ears poke through. I suggested that she curl her hair because then it would hide your ears.

If you want to keep it straight I don't know what to suggest because it depends on the thickness of your hair to.

Maybe try a special shampoo that will make your hair thicker?

Also, if your hair is really long, maybe you could cut it? When you have long hair there are a lot of choices for nice haircuts!

Hope I helped. :)

A good hair cut will keep your hair growing steadily and will neaten up that "in-between" bit of growing your hair out that everybody hates.



When I was in a very similar situation this time last year I went online and bought some Clip-Inz hair extensions. You can cut them to the right length and are definitely worth the investment because even if you hair is the perfect length they make it really thick and voluminous.

Been there - feel your pain, chick! x

If you want to naturally have long hair, good diet and proper nutrition is the best route. Try taking a multivitamin...I like Centrum Silver or the knockoff brand (I know, it's for OLD people, but it provides complete vitamin nutrition without having to take multiple pills). They market certain vitamins for hair and nails, but they're not any different in ingredients than other multivitamins. Vitamin E is the most essential vitamin for hair growth because it helps with scalp circulation and stimulation of hair follicles.

Unfortunately, hair grows slower in the winter months, which are coming up, and faster in the summer time.

If you don't feel like waiting for long locks, you could ask for extensions at a new hairstylist...I suggest a new stylist because anyone who cuts your hair to the jawline when you clarified at the shoulders was not listening to you and your desires as a client, and I don't let anyone mess with my hair unless I know they have a clear idea of what I want. Don't be afraid to speak up if you feel weird or notice your stylist is going in a direction that doesn't look right.

Good luck!

Get your vitamins, like omega 3 and those fish oil ones. Exercise, and eat right, basically keep healthy, that will help a TON. Along with that, use a good conditioner, I prefer professional products I find they work best for me, but whatever you choose. (Redken's great) There is also a shampoo I've used that REALLY sped up my hair growth. Its called FAST Hair Growth Shampoo and Conditoner (Fortified.Amino.Scalp.Therapy.) http://www.fasthair.co.uk/ But I found it did dry my hair out a little so its best to use it for a week, switch to your regular, and switch back kinda thing. And... yeah other than that, if you've got split or dry ends, keep em trimmed, but only a little. Take it easy on the straightening and curling.

Any suggestions for grownig out my fringe/bangs?



ive been growing it out now for about 2 months. it was a very full fringe, an it barely long enough to be make into a side fringe/bangs. im getting a bit sick of either wearing it back with a hairband or pining it up into a lil poof thing ( for those who dont get what i mean : http://www.flickr.com/photos/7366849@N02... and just to let you know this is not me, it has been used from a tutorial on punkrockdomestics.com)

it was long (below my eyes) 2 months ago but i had a random moment an re cut it in for some stupid reason, even tho i knew it didnt suit me in the first place.
what else can i do with it? it around lower eye level at the min. having it down as a fringe does not suit me in the slightest!

so any ideas on what i can do with it? an if you give ideas with pinning or something more complicated than puttin a clip in can you give a tutorial or at least some pics please. im really bad with my hair lol

ive only got one hairband that is comfortable for me to wear. all the others dig in behind my ears really bad an give me headaches. (this is like the alice band type, not the strechy type) it might be in, but its not worth a headache.



yes im serious. just askin cause i couldnt think of anythin else an someone out there might have somethin a bit different to do with it.
and yes i know not to cut it, thought i made that a bit obvious that im trying to grow it out.

Have you tried parting them (with hairspray's help) and then sliding a headband over it?  That will hold and hide the loose ends.  Plus, headbands are still in and super cute.

I had my bangs cut straight-across a few months and have been growing them out too. I find it very frustrating, too! What I do is I pin it to the side of my face with a gold bobby-pin. But if your fringe is too short to do that, you might consider using a small clip to clip it back behind your forehead, near the top of your head. Or you could also use some hair mousse, gel, or spray to style it to the side. I use Aussie hairspray, Got2Be Sexy mousse and Garnier gel (of course not all at the same time) :P. Other than that, all you can do is wait for it to grow out to do something with it. Hope I've helped :)

The worst bit is when your fringe is at eye level so stick with it and it'll be a bit more manageable in a few weeks. Or you could have it cut diagonally up to a centre parting and do it stage by stage with less to fall into your eyes at any one time. Then you would only have the very middle of your fringe to pin back as it grew down to eye level. You could use a strong gel to curl it out of the way or try wearing a bandana or even a cute hat like the girls in Abba used to wear. Or why not get those braids put in to lenghten your fringe effortlessly?

side-part your hair and brush your bangs to the side.
use a bobby pin and clip your bangs to the rest of your hair. it will be easier to style and it will look cute.

Ok here are some ideas for doing things with your bangs:

Just put a clip in to the side.  Super cute and super easy.  Simply pull your bangs back, only to the side, not the front.

Pull back your bangs like if you were to do the bump thing, but without the bump.

Braid sections of your bangs and clip it back

get all your bangs together and braid the end of them, then clip them back as if doing the bump, but don't put in a bump thing.

Depending on how long the fringe is, you could possibly get them back into a high ponytail or in a side pony.

I find that braids (plaits) make your hair grow if you leave them in overnight. So try and braid the fringe (bangs) and clip the end to the top of your head area.  I bet you'll find your bangs grow quickly.  Or you can use cloth hairbands, they're very comfortable, even with the braid because they're wide enough to hold it back at top/front.

Id say get it cut into a sidefringe, even if it has to be a bit shorter, ebcause that way it will look nice as it grows out and you can wear it out. and if yoiu keep trimming it a tiny tiny tiny bit it should grow back faster.

pull more hair from the center and cut them, but not to short and they'll hide the short pieces and give you cute side bangs.

I have the same problem. Idk what went through my head but its been 3 months since i cut my bangs short l: Its taking forever to grow. But this is what i do; I overcome hair from the opposite side of where my fringes are and i come the hair over my fringe *( since i have layers it looks like my bangs )* and that helps. Or sometimes when i overcome; i add a cute clip to the side. But recently I've just been pulling to the side so it looks like when the wind blows yours bangs over your hair(:

Yep; Tho just wait- Before you know it. Your fringe will be long and good :D

braids.  either synthetic or just keep your hair in french braids or various other braided styles for a while.  they'll grow faster (well, there will be less breakage) and since you won't be "watching the water boil" so to speak, may be less frustrated.

I was in the same situation, I had a fringe cut in March and it's still growing out - an endless wait!!! My hairdresser did a really good side parting cut which after a couple of weeks of styling to the side, started to fall that way naturally. Think of it as the reverse of when you had the fringe cut in - your hair didn't naturally fall into place (unless you were really lucky and your hair is VERY straight!), your hair has to be retrained to go the way you want it. If you keep wearing headbands, your hair won't fall into place, rather it'll stay in 'fringe mode'.
Good luck!

What should i do with my hair and fringe? (Pic included)?



Okay so im getting my hair cut tonight and im thinking of getting cut just below my shoulders. But my main problem is my stupid fringey thing. I hate it, its awful! What can i do with it? It needs to go or be hidden! It looks hideous when i put my hair up.
And i have a cowlick at the front cso i cant really do much with it. I might try a nice side fringe? 
Any ideas?
PLEASE INCLUDE PICTURES.

You look like your yahoo avatar so much its uncanny LOL but erm yeah i'd definetley go for a shorted cut. Perhaps a little shorter than the cut you had in mind and a nice little sidefringe. I say shorter because it will frame your face better and plus the sidefringe is a nice addition.

Okay, i have exactly the same problem. I have a HUGE cowlick which is always going to make fringes awkward because there is nothing that can ready be done about it, apart from shaving it off.

I have a sidefringe and i think that would suit you as well, although your hairdresser may advise against it. You just need to get a thick amount of hair into a side fringe, and that should cover the cowlick by just flattening it with the weight of the hair.



If the hairdresser doesnt do it right, which i often find, cut it yourself to how you want it. Fringes are fairly easy to cut, and from then on, you have to blowdry your hair down to flatten the cowlick. Good luck!

I think you should get short choppy layers so when you put your hair up it won't look as bad because it'll fall forward. Have a chat with your hairdresser before you get it cut. I think you should go for shoulder length hair and get it layered using a razor, oh and a huge Nicole Richie fringe.
You'll look great don't worry!

bobs are still in fashion :)
but if you're getting one cut make it a long bob (not shaved or anything drasticly short at the back)
so if you feel you dont like it or the do go out of fashion your hair will seen to grow quicker and it'll be easier for you to buy/get extentions
happy bobbing :) x

What shampoo do i need to buy?



basically i have to wash my hair every day with a moisturizing shampoo cos i have to straighten my hair every day, but i no that washing it everyday is bad and i have 2 straighten it every day because no matter how or what i do too my hair it wont stay straight when im asleep, i also go to the gym or do some kind of exercise most nights, so i need to keep  it clean or it looks kind of dirty :S

so what i want to know is, is there a shampoo that puts oils back in to your hair (from washing it every day)

And is there a shampoo that does the above that also moisturizes your hair (from the straightening)

Well, there is this product called WEN cleansing conditioner and you use it instead of shampoo. It cleanses and conditions your hair at the same time, as well as leaving in some of the natural oils that your hair needs. I personally swear by it and think its a great product, especially cause I have really dry hair. Plus they have about 5 different ones to choose from, from oily hair, dry hair, you name it.  You can buy it Amazon.com.

Short or long hair? Which one?



I've always had pretty short, barely shoulder-length hair and I was thinkin' it might be time for a change:

Here it is currently:

http://i33.tinypic.com/2ezo381.jpg
http://i33.tinypic.com/263efxx.jpg

As you can see it's kinda layered but still pretty trimmed, I was thinking about growing it out for a while and seeing how it turns out..
Do you rkn it would suit me?

thnx in advance =]xx

yes. even though you use a protective spray, the fact that you wash your hair everyday is bad. your hair will brake more often and split ends. really, i think you should only wash your  hair every 2-3 days and straighten it as little as you can.

Yes. Straightening your hair everyday will eventually cause damaged/burned/dead hair in the later future. It's best if you don't straighten your hair everyday, but if you're going to do that then you should get monthly trims and use a protective spray, along with damage proof shampoo/conditioner. Make sure, though, that you don't wash your hair everyday because it will strip your hair's natural oil, making it dry and brittle.

You should wash you hair every other day. Washing it every day strips the oils right out of your hair. Put a treatment in your hair once a week and allow your hair to rest from all the products you put in it.

What kind of "Scene" Style will do well with my hair?



Well, i hate that word scene, but i just want the hair style, because i thought of everything in the book. So i thought " Maybe they can help." My hair just got cut. I just washed it and blow dried it, and it is neck length. Its Black and brown and very short in the front. I can't even do a "Sasuke Uchiha" Length hair style. Any ideas? I don't do weave in braids and having it curled is out of the question. So how about a scene look?

When put in securely, they wont fall out.  Always make sure that you have a thick layer of hair on top of the last layer of extensions and dont put them directly next to your ear, always put them further back and make sure you stagger them (like how brick walls are staggered if you can imagine what i mean).

Take a thin comb , and at the top of your hair, lift up some hair about the same size as the extension, now comb it out so there is no tangles!!  It should be a thick amount of hair, but not too thick, and that is how you get it not to show the clip!! The only thing is is when you put the extension under your hair, if it covers the whole extension, then push the hair over the extension over a bit.  To get it to stay in , put some hairspray on before you put on the extension!!!  Ok so here is the steps once more:

1.  Lift up a thinck amount of hair with the comb, and comb it out so there is no tangles.
2.  Apply some hairspray, and stick in the extension
3. Push the hair on top over a bit so you can see the extension!!
4.  Put a bit of hairspray on top and you are good to go !!



Hope this helped !!!! :)

I wear clip ins a lot. First of all you snap open the clip, section your hair as if you're going to straighten the underneath part of your hair, then attach the clip closest to the part under your hair. You will see if you need to reposition your clip when you loosen the hair you moved and your clip should blend into the rest of your hair. If you have enough hair in the clip they should last all day. You have to get used to wearing them because they give me headache sometimes. But if you've placed them in the right part of your hair and styled the hairpieces into your own they shouldn't be noticeable.

it hard to say without knowing your skin tones, but i do agree a deep plum is nice.

are you planning on doing this yourself? because it you put a deep plum over the bleach blonde it will turn out bright purple!!!! you will need to add a dark base colour with this to stop that happening.

however if your planning a trip to the salon a deep plum with a few lighter highlights (non bleach) on the top in parting foils with add even more interest to the hair. also with some choppy layers your hair will appear darker underneath by letting the richness of the plum shine through with just a subtle hint of a mid blonde streak on the top.

Hair coloring: XP 100 equivalent of Wella Koleston 12/03?



I'd be very grateful for help: I used to get my hair colored with Koleston 12/03, and am now going to a salon which uses XP 100.  Does anyone know what type should be used to achieve the same color/shade of blonde? Thanks so much, Louise

I have a blunt heavy fringe - what hairstyle can I have for my wedding?



I have currently got very dark brown hair in a bob with a heavy blunt fringe, I am planning on growing my main hair long (have 18 months so should become a reasonable length). However I definitly want to keep my blunt fringe as it suits me but have no idea how to do the rest of my hair as people rarely tend to have fringes on their wedding day? Any suggestions of styles  could have, links to pictures of hairstlyes would be great! 
The fringe is just like the picture in the link probably slighty thicker though - http://www.adpunch.org/images/nelly-furt... )
Many thanks

Question about dying hair ?



i live in australia
and its just coming in summer in one month or so.
last year i had alot of blonde in my hair and then i dyed it for winter a light brown and i kept on having to die it so it would stay in.
in the end my hair was wreacking so i had to get $145 worth of products to fix my hair and make it healthy again

Everytime you dye your hair it gets severely damaged, more so if you dye it multiple times or from brown to blonde.  My advice is to pick one color and wait for that to grow out before dying it again.

Bleaching your hair dries it out and basically fries it so I recommend getting that done professionally.  Dying your hair darker isn't quite so bad for it so you can do that by yourself if you want, although if it kept fading last time, then you should either go with a permanent hair dye or just get that done professionally as well so that it will turn out nice, you'll do it once, and spend less than the $145 you would have to spend to fix it again ;)

Yes, I've witnessed a lot of people having issues with hair dye.  The more you dye it the harder it is to get back to normal health.  If you had trouble with it the first time then chances are you will have as much, if not more trouble again.  Is it really that important to you to change the way your hair looks?  What's wrong with natural?  But if you must, maybe go for a weave.  When it grows out it looks natural.  I hope it goes well!

You should get it dyed professionally, otherwise  it will turn a greenish colour. I had the same problem before and I also find that brown hair dyes don't stay in. But the hairdresser is so expensive.

Why would you want to keep dying it brown for the winter, what does the season have to do with the color of your hair? Keep you blonde highlights all year long or leave it light brown. No need to change your hair like you do your clothes from winter to summer. Just condition it more in the summer especially if you spend a lot of time out in the sun.

Hair falling out in chunks?



My hair falls out a LOT. Like at least 5 HUGE chunks while in the shower and after the shower when I brush it. Then in the morning huge chunks of hair come out too, like my brush is full of hair by the time I am done. My hair wasnt always like this, mainly more after I had my son. Could it be my diet? I am overweight and before I had my son I wasnt so I was thinking maybe it had to do with it?

This often happens during pregnancy and after child birth... It usually isnt something to be concerned about UNLESS you are losing enough hair to create noticable bald patches (in which case you may have contracted alopecia- relatively stress related SRA).. It is 100% natural to lose at least a hundred hairs a day and is infact very healthy!! If i were u i seriously wouldnt worry and the hair loss should settle down shortly, please DONT STRESS over this as u may contract SRA..

<question>



I have thick, frizzy hair - will a perm make it better or worse?



I've had frizzy hair forever (seriously, a pinch of hair = 5 inches of frizz), and it has a natural waves. It's also very thick, and I don't like spending 30-40 minutes straightening it on an average day. If I don't straighten it, it's out of control. So it's always in a ponytail.

My hair is not dry or coarse - when it's flat-ironed it is very smooth, silky, and shiny, and my scalp is greasy the day after showering. So to sum it up, my hair is soft, but frizzy.

When it's straight, it's verrryy straight. No volume at all. Due to the fact that I have a chunky face (lovely..), I'd like more volume in my hair.



I've been thinking of maybe getting a perm. But if I get a perm with all of the factors mentioned above, will I get more frizz, or will I get silky curls?

My natural hair won't curl anymore, I've tried everything...HELP!?



I'm African American with naturally curly hair; however, I have consistently straightened my hair for almost a year and my hair does not curl anymore. So, now I have these ugly waves and straight ends.

I feel like I've tried everything to restore my natural curls. Here's a list of things I've tried:

Cut my hair 3 inches
Tried every curl defining shampoo/conditioner/serum in the world
Went 3 1/2 weeks without straightening it
Scrunched my ends after getting out of the shower
Used styling gel and mousse

Now, I roller set my hair every night to attempt to get the pattern back. It's Day 3 and I haven't seen much improvement. What should I do?

Go to the hairdressers and get some advice i think. They'll know what to do. They will prob have a treatment that is stronger than what you have been using that will restore the curl and body back into your hair. Hope that helped :)

Well, for school photo's or any other events I had going on at school I would plait my hair directly after getting out of the shower. Maybe, before you plait it, you could put in some hair products? That might help to keep it in place once its dry. Leave your plaits in until the morning. But don't just have one or two plaits. 5-6 plaits are best... It depends on how curly you want your hair. Naturally more plaits would make your hair curlier in the morning, :] Hope this works for you like it has for me!!!

It sounds like your hair is damage. You should have a consultation with someone that does hair professionally to see what they can do to help you. Instead of trying to restore the curl look for something for extremely damaged hair.  The curl might come back once the damage is somewhat repaired.



Hope this helped.

No hairdresser is going to solve your problem. Since you damaged your hair by frying it for a year, the best you can do now is control the damage and let it grow naturally. I recommend hot oil therapy, continue to trim your hair (it will remain damaged and no glue in the world will fix it to the way it used to be) so it's the scissors for it.
Be careful with applying gels and mousse, don't let it get to your scalp.
Continue NOT using the straightening iron.
Continue doing this until you can eliminate all the old broke and fried hair.
Damage with curling irons, bad haircuts and straightening/relaxing (chemical or with heat) takes YEARS to fix.
Good Luck.

give it some time - honey, nothing works within less then 4 weeks / 3 days!

your hair has been straightened for a year, it is completely stressed, and probably damaged. I'm afraid, you'll have to cut more than just 3 inches...
use some repairing shampoo & conditioner in change with your curling shampoo, and a hair mask once or twice a week. let your hair dry naturally whenever possible.



and Good Luck!

Use hair products that help with curly hair
Not mousse or stuff that makes your hair hard
But like greasy products that are meant to help

On the other hand your hair might have just changed over time
I used to have straight hair and then curly at the front and straight at the back and then mega mega curly stuff
So your hair may never curl ever again

The picture doesn't work it says you have to be the buyer or seller to look at it. But anyways i suggest looking through bridal magazines they have so many hairstyles and then you could go for a practise at a hairdressers to see if you like it.

It would be best to meet with your stylist to try out different hair styles. You can take your veil with you so that you will know what it will look like, with each style. This is very helpful to brides who aren't sure how they want to wear their hair.

How old are you? Maybe you could just do it semi-permanelty like a wash in wash out dye. Then you could make sure you like it. But if your hair is blonde then going to black it a big jump and can be extremely diffucult to get back to blonde if it goes wrong!!! Also if you went to the hairdressers it would cost a lot to do your roots all the time. Meh - just wash it in and out and see if you like it.

Going from blonde to black is very dramatic,parents worry so much their precious daughter is going to ruin her looks. I wasn't allowed to dye my hair black as a teenager so I opted for natural dark brown and it didn't look as harsh. But if you're natural blonde you've got to remember your eyebrows have to match your hair colour so don't go too dark. People pay millions to go blonde why not celebrate the fact you have a nice natural colour.

I am a natural blonde, but I have dyed my hair black since it suits me. I am northern european, so here most of people are blondes and being blonde is nothing special on these latitudes.

I do not know what your age is, but you seriously have to have a discussion with your mother and tell her that you want to decide about your hairstyle by yourself, because you are not a little child anymore.



Of course you can do like I did when I was a teenager, that I colored my hair black with permanent color without asking my parents. Mother was terrified,  because in our area black hair color used to be related to goths or satanists,  but she got over it in some days. If your mother gets really angry suddenly or is violent, then I do not recommend this option.



Sometimes parents just think they can decide everything for their children and someone has to bring them back to earth by being a little rebelious.



Your mother should understand at that age, that blonde haircolor does not make anyone better or more special.



There is not one good or beautiful haircolor in the world. Bloinde color do not make all people look fantastic and it does not suit everyone. Black or brown hair can be easily as beautiful or sometimes even more beautiful.

My advice: don't do it. Especially permanent color. Chances are, you won't like the extreme change - that's two opposites you're talking about. Plus, when your hair grows back, you'll have the whole skunk strip thing going down the middle of your head. No fun. Try a brown first - not so drastic & typically works well with blondes. I've done pretty much every hair color & you have to have the right skin tone for black har, chances are if you're a natural blonde, it just won't work. But if you really want to see how it looks, Halloween is just around the corner, and you can buy that color hair spray & they have black. You & your mom could see how it looked & not worry about it being permanent cuz well, it washes out the next day.

why not ease her into the idea gently.

have you thought about meeting half way and trying a nice brunette first?



also/instead suggest wash in-wash out colours. available in varying shades of brown, red and even purple (sadly not black, don't know why) these won't ruin your hair or affect your natural colour once rinsed out if that's what your mum is worried about. and they're great for a quick change for parties or just to try out a new colour.

there's a really good range of sachet's available in boots and superdrug, can't remember what they are called though but they last about 3-4 washes. and LIVE Colour Xpress is also rinse out colour but lasts up to six washes (sometimes longer on blonde) and do brighter and wilder colours.

if this works after a while suggest trying black in a semi perminant.  they last about 16 washes (but mine took longer to wash out), not always recommended for blonde hair and may look grey-ish as it washes out towards the end.  look for a brand that does a dye remover in their range (not bleach).

hope this helps, threre's nothing wrong with wanting a bit of a change.

Slap a load of deep conditioner on i and wrap your head in clingfilm this should make the quality of your hair better but please do not try to dye your hair again fora while as it may just start to fall out. Wait a few weeks and go back to the hairdressers.

ah ive been through this problem.



my hair went ginger,
and a disgusting yellow colour.
that's the colour of my hair now :).

and this is what i used:



http://www.wilkinsonplus.com/invt/018987...



it's really good.
you need to keep your hair mousturised if it's going dry.
so i suggest that one night you should put conditinor on your hair and leave it on over night with a towell wrapped around your hair,



and then wash it off in the morning.
and brush it through with a COMB in the morning to get rid of all the split ends aswell.



good luck. x

Dont use hot temperatured straighners, they burn your hair and make it frizzier and have more split ends.



Try Pantene Pro-v -perfect curls or repair and care.



Pantene have a whole set, they have the shampoo,the hair mask, the consitiner.



Remeber to shampoo and condition your hair every other day.



And plait your hair before you go to the sleep, thats stops it from frizzing too much.



Enhance your curls! Try curling mouse.

honestly, the best way to straighten (and keep it straight) frizzy hair is to:



1) wash with a good quality shampoo & conditioner
2) blow dry your hair straight- use a brush with each stroke (get a hairdresser to show you how)
4) straighten it immediatly after blow drying
5) apply a few sprays of anti-frizz hairspray and brush it through

Anyway, I need some styles to make it look better, The bangs are just underneath my eyebrows and I have strands (that I did) on either side that go to my chin. In the back I have some layers that go just past my shoulders.

do a light brown with a dark blonde highlights . if you can only dye it one color just go for a lighter brown darker blonde ; at your age you really dont want anything too drastic because if its not what you want and you have to keep changing colors it will ruin your hair .

hi, im a hairdresser so hopefully i can give you some good advice.



firstly i recommend you condition your hair thoroughly before you do anything to it, at age 13 your hair is very vunerable and liable to a lot of damage and breakage because it has already been dyed previously. you should ask your hairdresser to put a colour one shade lighter than your natural colour (base) over your hair and then have some caramel strips put through it to lighten it up and bring warmth to the overall look. if you have fair/medium/dark skin it will suit them all but with very fair skin never go too dark, it can really wash you out.



hope i was of some help and dont forget to take care of your hair with lots of conditioner,heat defence spray and a wide tooth comb xxx

How can I style my hair with a "dry" look?



I have thin hair, but lots of it.  The problem I have is when I put gel in my hair it clumps together and has a "wet" apparance and due to my hairs being so thin, shows alot of scalp.  I want my hair to stand up and hold in place, but look dry.  I will not use hairspray.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Blow dry your hair upside down that will give it volume and also maybe back combing, think Amy Winehouse but toned down!

It doesn't look like you need any advice on giving it volume to me, you seem to have quite big hair as it is. try a volumising mousse and drying your hair with your head upside down. If you straighten your hair spray with hair spray before you straighten and once its done get some wax and tease some of the ends, will make them flick out and make your hair look even thicker

Well while your hair is still wet, part it and comb it, like comb your fringe down and stuff, get hairspray and lift up the areas of hair around the roots and spray it with hairspray, or anywhere were you want volume, then put your head upside down and blast your hair until its dry. I have naturally straight hair and it works perfectly, pretty much the same style as yours!



I think you would suit choppy layers :D get it thinned out a bit if you don't like the thickness, but keep your hair long!! Long hair always looks great! Maybe some streaks? To high light it would look nice.

How do you sleep with long hair?



Because it gets on my nerves! Don't get me wrong though, I don't want to cut my hair or anything. It's just that when I'm trying to sleep, it keeps getting in the way and I get really suffocated and flushed. Setting it to one side doesn't help much either because I toss and turn a lot in bed. Help?

Hair and nail growth trouble? Any advice?



I'm 17 and my hair and nails are not growing well at all. When I was younger my hair used to be down to my back and my nails always got so long so fast thats i'd have to trim them every 2 weeks. I mean things have changed, like about 3 years ago I permed my hair and I've colored it a few times in the past, but it's about half way grown out to natural. I also started picking at my nails as sort of a nervous habit and they've become so brittle and hardly grow. I drink lots of water and have a healthy diet. I also get my hair trimmed regularly and use conditioning treatments. I've heard from people that flintstones vitamins also help hair and nail growth so I've started taking those. Any other advice could be greatly appriciated =)

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Let it dry naturally so it doesn't take on extra volume.



When it's almost dry, rub some mousse through it (buy a good quality one, it's worth the investment), remember that you don't need too much, and that it should mostly be on the ends of your hair.



I'm assuming that by saying you have the cut, you also mean you have the layers. So take a hair Straightener to kink up the ends (do this by running the straighter down the hair then curling it up when you're getting to the end).



IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HAIR STRAIGHTENER ONLY:



If you don't have a hair straightener, then spray in some straightening aid (anything that helps your hair go straight, I recommend John Frieda 'Straight Ahead' for $16.95 at supermarkets) before you let it dry, then run your fingers through it while it's still wet.



Tousle your hair once it is dry, then rub the mousse through your hair. Put some extra mousse on your fingertips, then run it down sections of your hair to give it a 'kink' look.

if you still want it bleached, but not brown, you can re-bleach it.  the reason why it's orange is because you didn't leave the dye in long enough.  but you might want to be cautious as it's store-bought.  getting it the right shade of bleach is tough.

This has happened because all hair colours are based around Red. The bleach wasn't strong enough to remove all the colour, so it has left the red/orange base.



Rather than going and bleaching it again (which can be dangerous, and bad for your hair) buy a 'Pre Lightener' (I recommend the one by L'Oreal) and then use that to take the rest of the colour out. Remember that it will still have a bit of an orange tint after you have used the Pre-Lightener, but this will go when you dye your hair to the desired colour.



Best of luck! xx

My hair won't hold dye?



I'm a natural blond, and have been dying my hair red for a few years now; not consistently, but about once or twice a year, and never before the previous colour has  completely faded.  My hair has stopped holding the colour for more than about a week and a half.  What could be causing this, and how do I fix it?  Thanks for the advice!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



well first off, red hair dye almost NEVER stays very well. Red is the fastest fading color by far.
Your hair may have grown resistant to that certain color, maybe you should try a different brand of that color.
also, your hair might be damaged because some hair can get very damaged just from dying it a few times.

the only way i have ever removed hair from my eyebrows were plucking and THREADING, lol. and i've been getting it threaded for about 4 years now. I have to admit, threading does hurt but you get used to it after a while...kinda. it's just like plucking but much faster and it picks up more hair at a time than tweezers do. it almost feels like 5 little tweezers removing your hair at a time. lol..i hope i didnt scare you. it's really not that bad. just try it out. It's so much more precise and effective than waxing. i would not recommend waxing to anybody. If you can handle plucking, then you can surely handle threading.



hope i helped =)

After a relaxer, it is important to get a good reconstructor treatment.  Thats basically a deep conditioner that contains protein.  Relaxers actually damage the hair by altering its natural curl composition and breaking the top layer to achieve the straight look.  Try also getting a trim to remove the split ends.  You may want to look into getting some type of oil such as carrot oil or olive oil to help it retain its moisture thus giving it volume.



Hope that helps ya!

What I normally do to add volume to my hair is curl my hair all over using a curling iron [what size depends on the length of your hair ], then I wrap my hair. I normally do it right before I go to sleep, and depending on how you want to wear your hair you may not have to re-curl it for a while.

HELP! I need a few hairstyles for school?



Im 13 and it's now the start of term 4 and i'm looking for some new hairstyles, just a few so i can change them around a bit and also one suitable for PE. I have lightish brown hair with blonde streaks, its wavy and it comes a few inches over my shoulders and it has front layers and a side fringe, i also have brown eyes and a high hairline, i'm short and skinny if that helps. I don't like to wear it out because of the frizz and especially on hot days it makes me sweat, i normally wear it in a messy bun with my fringe pulled to the side. I want something that is easy, looks good, feels good and suites me. Also if you can help me with my frizz problems because my mum would like me to wear my hair out more often

How should I get my hair cut? Send pics?



I have long, dark brown hair and I've always had side swept bangs and lots of layers. They've all grown out now and my hair is just under my boob in length. Haha. It's kind of thin and naturally very straight. How should I get it styled, cut?



I kind of want Miley Cyrus'  long straight across bangs but I'm not sure. What should I do?

YEAHH!! I got across bangs last winter and hated them, however, my hairdresser was kinda on the tipsy side when she did them. She made them way too thick and short. But I changed hairdressers to the owner of the salon so she might be better? Idk...

be careful with those bangs
i tried that and hated!!! them; but i also thought my hairdresser cut them wayyyy too thin and short.



ive had hair about mid back length and super thick for years and like 2 months ago got it cut into a longer bob [like the posh cut] with the longer front part at my collar bone and the shorter part and the middle of my neck [where that prominant bone is] and i LOVE it. its very easy to maintain



but on another note; i would consider keeping it grown out--it may just be a personal opinion but i find longer hair to look better in the winter.

if u have wavy or curly hair use conditioner and evenly spread it through your hair but be careful of putting too much on the roots as it will make it look greasy. Before you use it though scrunch your hair to add more volume :)
if your hair is naturally straight then use a good serum on the tips

Why would you blowDRY your hair if it's not wet?  Best not to have your dryer on highest heat close to your hair.  Besides, you can burn your scalp.

clamp the plates near to the root to start heating up the hair, then slowly roll in one direction (preferably the easiest one is up and over like putting curling rollers in upside down), pulling the hair (below the straighteners) through the plates in a curling action. once the hair is fully through it will leave a nice curl :)

it is very simple and effective:
1) wash and dry your hair so it is fresh and clean don't put any spray or heavy products that will drag down the curl.(you don't have to wash your hair each time you want to curl, just got to make sure that you haven't put in any products in your hair beforehand.
2) have a straightener that is fairly thin temp (210-220degrees)
3) grab a small piece of hair about 5cm



4) put the straightener at the top of the piece of hair twist the barrel half turn INWARDS (going into the hair don't twist outwards going away for the hair) and slowly pull down.
5) you can twist the curled piece of hair with your fingers then leave that piece to cool (otherwise it will fall out)
5) you can add hair spray but it will only drag down the curls and not be so effective for as long.
NOTE:::: that the slower you pull down the barrel the tighter the curl.



I hope i have helped....:)
Ps. it works perfect if you do it the second day as well

gah, i tried, its hard =[



to curl hair:
1. let the iron heat up
2. start about 2-3 in. from the scalp and wrap a small section of hair around one plate, leaving 2-3 in. at the end.



3. twist the straightener slightly in the direction that you twisted the hair. at the same time move slowly down the hair. for looser curls, move faster

It's really bad for your hair if you straighten it every day! You should try setting your curls free, they might surprise you!



*sigh* Try getting some straightening cream to rub into your hair before straightening it. That might add a little hold and keep the ends from going too crazy.

first off, shampoo and condition with straightening products and after you get out, make sure to put straightening spray in and blow dry it.
(PAY ATTENTION TO THE ENDS)
if you do it the night before or in the morning, it doesnt matter, btu afterward when you straighten it, make sure to angle your flat iron
and put straightening or heat iron spray in your hair before and afterr
finsih off with some wax at the ends

red ken smooth down shampoo and conditioner and heat GLIDE treatment is worth the money. another tip at night before you go to bed put a little conditioner at the bottom of your hair about the size of a quarter and put it up in a rubber band cloth and every 8 weeks cut the ends about a1/8 of an inch the fizz will stop and the conditioner protect your hair from fizzing that's static electricity from wearing your hair down.example when your hair is down and you walk across carpet you create static electricity which in turns burns the ends of your hair.

How do I stop my hair from parting down the middle?



I have straight, kind long hair and it naturaly falls to the sides making a part in the middle.  I usually put some grease in and slick it back, it helps but it eventually ends up parting.

after you shower at night,



use a comb and brush the hair in the direction you want it to go.



Use a bobby pin and pin the hair down, so it knows not to move.

You literally have to train your hair. Comb it the way you want it to go and pin it down, eventually your hair will fall that way naturally.

None is. but if you insist on doing it yourself than go with Loreal. All the other colors (well most of them) have metallic dye in them. That ruins your hair and never comes off of your hair. It makes it so that if you ever wanted to highlight or color your hair a lighter color that it wouldn't come out the color you wanted.

HELP! I need a few hairstyles for school?



Im 13 and it's now the start of term 4 and i'm looking for some new hairstyles, just a few so i can change them around a bit and also one suitable for PE. I have lightish brown hair with blonde streaks, its wavy and it comes a few inches over my shoulders and it has front layers and a side fringe, i also have brown eyes and a high hairline, i'm short and skinny if that helps. I don't like to wear it out because of the frizz and especially on hot days it makes me sweat, i normally wear it in a messy bun with my fringe pulled to the side. I want something that is easy, looks good, feels good and suites me. Also if you can help me with my frizz problems because my mum would like me to wear my hair out more often

Use Frizz-ease. It comes in a bunch of different colors depending on your hair type. I use the purple one. It's just like lotion for your hair. It works pretty well. Also blowdrying your hair with a round brush is supposed to help. And straightening your hair works really well to make it unfrizzy. There is also a sea-salt hair spray that you can make that will make your hair a little more curly and less frizzy. Just add about a tablespoon of salt to a half a cup of warm water and a tablespoon or so of hair gel. Then spray it into damp hair.



As for hairstyles- I loved pigtails when I was in high school. It keeps your hair out of your face and looks really cute. I also loved headbands. They really add personality and there are so many different designs. Or do twisties and twist some of the top of your hair and hold with butterfly clips (its hard to describe.) For gym I like to wear my hair in a big banana clip. Those clips that have the prawns on the end and you squeeze to open. They're really easy to put your hair up in and they don't leave those waves that pony tails do.

Changing Hairstylists?



I am changing hairsylists and I am concerned if my new one will be able to match the haircolor I am currently dying my hair.  My current hairstylist dyes my hair with redken expresso and redken mocha java..not sure of the ratio of each dye..but will my new hairstylist be able to match my hair color?

Does Baby Shampoo thicken your hair?



I started to use it, seems like I have more volume and softer hair. I use pantene now, but I am thinking of using the baby shampoo all the time. My hair is typically oily, but the baby shampoo does a nice job. What do you think?



</question>



<additional details>



Well, I needed to use it cuz I had some stitches on my head. I guess it is back to pantene.

i used to think the same thing, but i figured out that i was only drying out my hair with shampoo, which gave the illusion of thicker hair.

Is Kera Care shampoo and conditioner good for transitioning hair. What about aphogee treatments?



I'm an african american female and I'm newly transitioning my hair to be relaxer free. I'm about 6 weeks in and I am thinking about what products to use. I currently use Kera Care but I am using the dry itchy scalp products. Thinking about switching to their moisturizing system. Is this a good idea?



Also I currently do aphogee treatments for damaged hair. It really strengthens my hair and I think this is a good thing to have as I get farther along. But I'm going into uncharted territory and need some advice. Could someone that has or is down this road give me some insight.



Thanks. Serious responses only please.

Pictures of side fringes?



I am getting my haircut soon and am wondering what to have done. I have long hair and do not want it cut or layers put in. I already have a bit of a side fringe (but its not very neat or big and I always clip it back) but would love to have it made bigger and have some hair cut around my face, as i feel bare without any hair on my face. I would be grateful for any website/picture links of hairstyles with fringes/side fringes. Thanks :)

I don't think you should touch a thing!!



you're hair already brings out the beautiful, bright green eyes you have.



you are so pretty!!! don't do anything.



trust me, I speak from experience. I am a natural brunette and when I turned 18 I started dying my hair red (I have brown hair and brown eyes). I just recently went back to my natural brown color and the amount of compliments I got was crazy!! my coworkers went nuts telling me how pretty I was with my natural color back and the guys won't leave me alone (lol-but I have an awesome bf thank goodness). it was really hard and quite expensive for me to get all those years of dying out of my hair plus it damaged my hair too so I had to condition it. highlights require alot of upkeep and that can be expensive too.



I think you are super cute just the way you are!!



hope this helps!!

Haircolour Ideas for a brunette ?



Hi,
I've just started college and want something different (but not too crazy). I have brunette hair and always have. My hair is quite curly and gets frizzy/fluffy/humid really easily. I have hazel eyes and am quite a shy person, our school doesnt allow too crazy colours anyway. I dont want a really drastic change.



I'm getting my hair done with a side fringe and it's almost half way down my back. If anyone has any ideas please let me know!!



(I was thinking of mid brown hair on the top layer and then a dark brown underneath. similar to this: http://www.ultimasurf.net/images/celebri... but then cause my hairs curly and frizzy it wouldnt look that good...)

think about streaking.



can be done with some blonde, some cherry/burgundy, auburn, even black.



can have all or one.



i have done sometimes 1 or 2 and even 3 at a time.



looks great.



in view of the fact that you have long hair you could of course just have any of the above down the sides.



go for it whatever you decide will be great.

Changing Hairstylists?



I am changing hairsylists and I am concerned if my new one will be able to match the haircolor I am currently dying my hair.  My current hairstylist dyes my hair with redken expresso and redken mocha java..not sure of the ratio of each dye..but will my new hairstylist be able to match my hair color?

So why do we still have these somewhat odd patches in the armpits and pubic region? Part of the reason is friction. In the armpits and pubic areas, the hair acts as a lubricant between the two patches of skin that would otherwise rub together uncomfortably. The other reason might be that the hair catches the scent which is produced in these areas. In both the armpit and the pubic area, there are special sweat glands, the apocrine glands, which produce a far more nutrient-rich sweat than is produced elsewhere on the body. This sweat conveys quite a lot of olfactory information about the producer, which makes it attractive to mates. Unfortunately, it also makes these areas great petri dishes; hence the unpleasant body odor that results when you exercise for a long time. (As an aside, showering, then brief exercise, is said to be the best way to make yourself olfactorally attractive to the opposite sex)

Try Indian Gooseberry, Curry Leaves. and vitamins.
The vitamins considered useful in guarding against premature greying of hair are pantothenic acid, para-aminobenzoic acid (paba), inositol. The minimum daily requirement of these vitamins appears to be 10 mg of pantothenic acid, 100 mg of para-aminobenzoic acid, and 2 gm of inositol. To obtain satisfactory results, all three of these vitamins belonging to the B group should be supplied at one time, preferably in a form which supplies all the B vitamins, such as yeast and liver. The three anti-greying-hair vitamins can also be produced in the intestinal tract by bacteria. Thus, taking a sufficient quantity of yoghurt daily and a tablespoonful of yeast before each meal is an excellent remedy for the prevention and treatment of premature greying of hair. If one wishes to take tablets of calcium pantothenate and para-aminobenzoic acid (paba), they should be taken in addition to the yeast and yoghurt, and not as a substitute for them.



Avoid foods such as white flour, refined sugar and all products made from them, Avoid soft drinks, pastries, jams and jellies

it is normal, these days so mny people are having grey hair in this age, so do not worry. First take proper diet, like dals, rajma, curd, fruits, do not miss meals, take fruit juice, also. Then drink enough water, when diet is good, hair are good, I tell you one thing, it is important that the quality of hair is good, rather than the color. Then you can use mehendi on hair, these days so many brands are there which are makinh hair mehendi, they also pour reetha shikakai in it so the hair color become drk brown, which is quite good, or you can try hair color of garnier, loreal etc.. Can contact a skin doctor, there are some hair proteins which also help like Silvikrin.

Dying blond roots that have a yellow tone?



I recently had a bad "bleaching" earlier this year! I was trying to go back blond, and yes professionally, but the stylist thought bleaching my hair 3 times back to back would be a good thing. My hair turned an icky whitish yellow!  Finally I have managed to get my hair back to its normal color of blond. I am very happy with the shade. But when I went to redye my hair at home my roots turned yellow. How can I get an at home blonde color where my hair is all the same color? I really don't have the cash at the moment for a professional. Thanks

When you bleach your hair you will reach the 3 undertones. Red / Orange / Yellow. You will need to get some kind of toner, which is just a hint of a color. I would suggest some kind of blueviolet. This process is a little tricky when it comes to how long to keep it on your hair. you might need to get someone to do it for you, or go a darker color.

Blue/Violet cancels out Yellow/orange tones..so look for a toner or Hight Lift color with Blue Violet tone(base)



Also before you try to fix it yourself got o sallys and buy shimmer lights shampoo..and see if a couple of washings clam down the yellow a bit...
also go here for a good hair color read

First of all it is retouching new growth. A product called kaleidocolor is the product the purple package is the one you need, if you still have yellow tone in the new growth you will need to use a toner that has a green base.

It depends on your hair type. Pantene in good but if you have really thick hair I would suggest you buy the red bottles. If  your hair is really fine and thin than use the blue or green bottles. Don't use purple bottles unless your hair has no volume.

jet black hair looks artificial on anyone unless it is naturally black. Hair grows out at 1/2 inch per month and you would have roots showing really quick.

Straight hair might be the most consistently fashionable hair texture in the past three decades, but curly hair, when styled properly, can be equally alluring, if not more so. The biggest blunder most curly girls make is allowing frizz to conquer their locks, but with some care, frizz can easily be eliminated. Here are some tips for maximizing your hair's bounce and minimizing flyaways.



*Never brush your hair dry: Unlike straight hair, which should never be brushed while wet, curly must ALWAYS be brushed when wet, or at least damp. Curly hair is already naturally brittle, so brushing it while dry will only tear it up. Instead, wet your hair and apply conditioner before you brush it. The viscosity of the conditioner will help the brush glide smoothly over your hair and will make knots easy to untangle.



*Find the right brush or comb: Never brush your hair with a fine-toothed brush or comb. Fine-toothed brushes and combs are intended only for thin, straight hair and will therefore damage curly hair. Be sure to buy a wide-toothed comb instead; the curlier your hair, the farther away each tooth should be from its neighbor. Also avoid steel-toothed brushes. Your brushes and combs should only be made of plastic or wood. Steel-toothed combs are too harsh for curly hair and will make it frizzier, even if the hair is brushed while wet.



*Be smart about shampoo and conditioner: Never buy conditioner or shampoo intended for all hair types. Curly hair requires very special treatment so only buy hair products made specifically for it.



*Always condition: Every time you shampoo your hair, you should also thoroughly condition it. Because curly hair is naturally dry, it is in constant need of moisturizer in order to look fresh and clean.

come on, when people need help, dont answer with a dumb answer. some people are on here asking qestions for a reason, they need help.



to answer this respectfully rather than some people.....i bought this product recently that you can get at any walgreens or longs for 6 or 7 bucks. its in the hair isle and in the pantene pro-v section. its a small bottle and it is a frizz control. you take a shower, wash out all the gunk, come out of the shower having hair damp. be sure you have a hair dryer, if not borrow one. i had to borrow my mothers since i didnt have one.  pump out a small amount and place it on end of hair or wherever you need help. its best to put on all hair so it comes out even. you use a hair brush while working in the hair drying and wha-la. smooth hair. i only had frizz at the end of my hair and i didnt think it would work cause i tried it all, the frizz ease....all of it, but others just seem to make hair sticky. this makes hair smooth. try it

There are a lot of things to help-defrizzing shampoo, conditioner, and other hair products that all prevent frizz, dont use a hair dryer let it air dry, dont dry it with a towel because it makes static electricity, there are also hair brushes that prevent frizz.

What can I do about a bad haircut?



The other day I went to the salon  and the lady who cut my hair made it very thin by trimming the layers rather short. Even though I told her to keep them long. I think she tried, but I really don't like the way it looks,she told she didn't take any of the length off, but it seemed to me my hair was almost half way down my back, and now it's shoulder length. Does anyone have any styling hints that can make my hair look better while I try to grow it out again?

That happened to me too. It sounds like she did layers the "old school way" - which is why my new stylist told me about the bad cut I had. Apparently, back in the day, they used to cut layers really short but now that has changed. I hate to tell you this.. but you just really have to be patient while all the layers grow out longer before you can have the thickness and length back. But, in the meantime - I would try blow drying it with a thickness serum (or something of that nature) and maybe using a curling iron to curl under or up the ends. Then spray it and play with it. It will make it seem thicker. (not longer unfortunately.. but thicker)



Or - of course you could always go to the salon and get extensions. But good ones are really expensive.



Sorry that happened to you. Good luck with it.

they put different chemicals into shampoo which do different things to hair... makes it wavy or straight, bla bla bla. the fact is, that they really do usually work. I used to use shampoo to straighten my curly hair when I grow it long, and it worked. so getting shampoo specific to your hair type and the kind of hair you want is not a waste of time.

Personally, I'd go for the Babylis Pro 230's, but if you're willing to pay top dollar, get a nice pair of medium GHD's. Or if you're feeling the burn get a pair of Chi's, they're much cheaper than GHD's and have the sam performance. :)

That hair cut and color combiniation is very emo meaning it is just a fad. That style will be out played in 2 months or so.



You can not deposit color on color, well you can..you'l just have a huge build up of hair dye and no new results. So yes, to get your hair a light brown they will have to lift it with a certain level of peroxide that will be strong enough to lift the hair. If your hair is healthy enough (virgin hair) it would be best to have however much of your hair that you're wanting light brown stripped to bleach blonde. Once you have your hair that white blonde color whatever you deposit next will come out even and at a shade you're expecting. If you do go this route definitely make sure the stylists uses a toner afterwards to make sure the color is evenly distributed, as this will play a big part in the after math of your light brown color. Those models you see on the L'oreal and Clairol boxes have all had their hair stripped to bleach blonde and then had the box color applied, which is why most people say don't ever think you're going to have the same results as the box because how many people really want to strip their entire head? You run quite a risk of damage.



I do not think you should get more layers in your hair, it's gorgeous as it is now. I do however think the light brown would be lovely and flattering on you but remember to get a full coverage you're gonna have to take the route I mentioned above, otherwise you're not even going to come out close to that picture you provided.

yeah! i take it. my nails grew faster (not so great), the calcium spots went away, and they were stronger. my hair did grow faster than usual and its ALOT thicker than it was before i started taking them, how it does that i have no idea, but it did that for me. as for my skin, it didn't really do anything really. my facial skin was oily before i used them, and it still is. now that i think about it though, i didn't breakout as much while using them.
so overall, i do say they work. make sure you take them at every meal if not at ever meal, with a meal or some sort of food because if you take it without food then they make you feel sick and its not great.

Ok..Help me understand this "base" color?



SO today i used color fix..and it worked great..my hair had turned mousy brown/green from trying to go from Blonde to Brown...I'm actually pretty happy with the color it came out after the color fix..but i bought some color and was wondering if i can  put these colors on my hair w/out turning my hair Purple/.orange/or green(LOL)
My hair right now is about an 8.3(light golden blonde) and was wondering if I could put a 10.3(Lightest Golden Blonde) or will it turn out too orange???



Basically i'm not sure what Base(tone) color my hair is besides blonds..i suppose yellow? Any tips on what NOT to put on my hair..ie. ash etc...

Ok the first answerer is completely wrong so do not pay attention to that.  A 1 is black and a 10 is blonde.  And a saloon is where you get a drink in the Old West.  Anyway, you can't lift color with color.  in other words since you already have artificial color in your hair, putting a lighter color on it won't lighten it.  Only bleach will do this.  And yes yellow or gold is the base of a golden blonde.  An ash base is a green, a beige base is a pale violet or sometimes a blue.  A warm base is a red or copper.  If i were you I'd have someone weave in some bleached streaks and just gradually add more over the next couple of appointments.  And condition it and take really good care of it because color fix and bleach are more harmful than just regular color. Or they can be if you're not careful.

when you look at the color wheel, the colors that are directly opposite each other will cancel each other out.  or say you have too much ash in the hair,  that's a green base.  so what's accross from green?  red.  so you would add a color with a red base to the hair to tone down the green.

Bumble and Bumble deeeeeeep conditioner. Thats what it's called. Bumble and Bumble is extremely pricey (a small bottle of their deep conditioner will cost you thirty dollars), however, as sad as it is, the more expensive a hair product is, the more likely it is to be more effective. Basically, anything you can buy in a drug store is unlikely to do very much for your hair. Go to a salon and ask to buy some of their products.



Also, try leaving conditioner in your hair overnight. This will help your hair to repair itself and you will slowly but surely see your hair begin to get softer, shinier, and healthier looking

Rihanna's wig in Disturbia?



Hello! I've been thinking about cutting my hair for almost a year now it's down to the small of my back and I'm not too sure how I would look with short hair... I don't know if I have the face and neck for the Style I want. I was watching Rihannas' music video for Disturbia and at about 0:26 she has this cute bob-cut wig I was thinking of cutting my hair like. Does anyone know the name of this style or where I can find a look alike wing? Color doesnt really matter I just want to try it out for awhile before I really cut my hair. Thanks in advance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6zdhHLvT...  Thats the MV with the wig in it

Wow, be sure you have a very slender face for this wig/haircut. If you have a round face you will be asking for trouble!



You really need to contact a lace front wig company who can cornrow your natural hair and place this wig on you, it will stay intact for about 1-2 months. This will give you plenty f time to see if you think you could rock that style permenantly,

for best results you are going to want to bleach the hair you plan on dying or else the color will be dull and wont stand out.



You can get bleach paste or gel at any hair product store, usually on the same isle as the dye.



I used Special Effects, always liked it, never had problems.



as for the bleach i used "Flash lightning"



get some tin foil, lay your hair on it, apply bleach (folow directions) when thats done, just add the dye.

hey there the best thing you can do is get a hair streaking kit from the chemist, you get a brush with it that gives a nice size streak, most of them come with two packets of poedered peroxide so you dont have to use both at once you can keep one for when your roots start to grow back, and make sure you always do a strand test before applying hair dye to make sure it will take and that you are not allergic to it.

I personally love Loreal Paris Preference hair color best.
It always did a good job and never tuned my hair a different color.
For doing it:  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.
That is so so important.



lol.
It's probably best to have another person help you,
I always had my mom help me



because she has done her own hair before too.
It just helps for keeping the hair separate.
I've never done strict high lights from a box,
so Idk which brand makes the ones with the cap with holes,
it is just like a little hair net with little spaces for holes,
and you poke a tool through the hole and it pulls out strands of hair.
You can look around the web for the websites to find those brands.

Easiest way to do it is with a highlighting cap.  it's pretty fool proof.  Once you have the cap on and the hair pulled thru, just use a hair coloring brush. It's like a paint brush, but flatter and has a longer width, it's ez it use!  the best highlighting kit is by herbal essence or feria.  they are both pretty cheap and work very well.  i have put many a streak in my hair and have no complaints on either product!

You should get Loreal's Frost and Design in Champagne (it only costs like ten bucks). The color is a nice light blonde that doesn't turn orange or yellow. Don't pull the hair through every hole though, otherwise your hair will look way lighter.

Questions about my hair!?



1.Why is it easier to comb my hair to the right side of my head,but not the left? Does it have something to do with my hair growing in one direction? Or is it that I comb my hair to the right side of my head a lot of times and now, my hair is used to be growing toward the right+



2.What are good hairstyles for Vietnamese guys?



3.What hairstyles can you do with coarse hair?

I want to temporarily dye my hair red (more like orange) w/o bleaching.?



I have medium brown hair with copper undertones. I do not want to bleach my hair. I've read about Special Effects dye and Manic paint. Do I have to bleach it? What else could I use. This is for Halloween.  I heard the spray stuff makes your hair hard.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I'm not exactly sure about this, but I had a friend with blonde hair who went green for a month without bleaching.  You won't need bleach if the shade of red you're picking is darker then you're natural color.  You can probably get fun semi-permanent color without bleach at Newbury comics, that's where my friend (with the green hair) got hers.

Growing hair out natural, any suggestions?



Hello all, I'm a biracial woman (black/white) who has been getting relaxers for as long as I can remember. I want to try growing my hair out natural b/c from what I've seen of my new growth my hair is pretty fine and silky and I think it might look nice if I gave it a chance. I'm just scared of that in btwn phase when I have some relaxed hair and some natural....I think I'll look pretty funny. Any suggestions on how to make a smooth transition so I don't have to walk around lookin a mess for the next year or so?!

The best way to grow out hair without putting anything in it is to braid it as much as you can. I once had a very bad hair cut so I had to cut my hair short and I am use to long hair. So each night I always braided my hair and as much as could during the day and in about a month my hair was back to normal :)

before you dry your hair, use some Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum on your hair, then dry it, and use a flat iron.. my hair was uncontrollable and i bought some of that serum, and it worked wonders for me!
good luck! :)

Invest in a good pair of hair straighteners. I brought myself some GHDs and in all honesty, they are one of the best things I've ever brought, and definately worth the money. Sometimes its worth pushing the boat out price-wise, cheap straighteners just dont tend to do the trick.

Long naturally curly hair?



I have always had really thick and long hair. Right now its about 35 inches long. I know it has natural curl, or at least wave because it's really frizzy and curls on top, and underneath where it is shorter and I have to straighten those parts.



My question is what type of product is strong enough for my hair to hold curl? I have tried several gels including  Aussie, Matrix, Samy, and a lot of others. Should I be using Mousse?



What can you recommend? I have an event coming up I would really like to curl my hair for.

Should I add pink, black and blonde streaks to my hair?



My hair is more of a brunette color, I used to be a natural blond, but as the years wen by, my hair slowly change to brunette.



I've really been wanting to add some pink, blonde and black streaks to my hair. Black parts more underneath, the Pink and Blonde blended throughout. Make it more of a natural look, but still REALLY cool!



I would so love to do this. http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y52/roc...
Or as close to it anyway, BUT incorporating the natural brunette with it.

i am a brunette, and i have had pink hair many times in the past. pink and brown look amazing together.
blonde, black, pink AND brown is way too much color, and will look trashy.



stick to just the pink, it looks way cooler and is much easier to maintain.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Thanx so much! Knowing you've had the experience is much more comforting. I agree too many colors would look trashy. I'll give Pink a try:) Thanx so much!

I believe you should skip the black streaks to your hair. Adding black will add a trashy bro ho/scene/ugly to you, and I don't think you want that. The second picture you showed showed a much natural (and better) hair style, so I think that you should go with that style.

I would stick with the color you chose in the picture (don't go any darker or you'll look too pale).



as for the cut-it's cute (not my style personally-too over the top) but keep in mind it's a drastic cut (trendy) and will require alot of work to keep it up. I think long layers w/your hair cut to in between your length now and your chin would look really cute.



I have a complextion similar to yours and my hair color is about the same as the one you chose. I just got my hair cut recently and had it layered (keeping my long and tapered). it worked out great-the cut gave me lots of volume and I get a ton of compliments when i curl it w/hot rollers then shake it up for volume. w/blow drying it takes about 30-45 mins to do my hair.



good luck w/whatever you choose!!

Dying brown over dyed blonde hair?



my hair is naturally very light brown, but for the past couple years i've been getting a two-color foil over my entire head with light blonde colors (http://photos-f.ak.facebook.com/photos-a... thats my hair color now), but i can't really afford that any more. i was thinking of buying a dark brown and dying over it at home...i've dyed my hair many times at home and never had a problem, but never done anything this extreme. how can i dye it at home without totally ruining my hair? or should i pay to get it done at a salon?

You should be fine to dye it all over.  You will have some strands that are lighter then others but it will just look like natural variations in your hair color.  I actually did this myself and was very please how it came out.  I went from blonde to a medium brown.

Your best bet is to go to the salon and have it done.  Going from such a light color back to something more natural is a two step process.  If you do it on your own, the color will not take properly and will most likely be a greenish mucky color.  Before you have it done, get a full consultation. Because this very drastic change is color correction, and it really helps if you and the stylist are on the same page completely, and they know what condition your hair is in, how long you have been lightening it, and why you want a this change.

i do ^^ the darker parts are clip-in extensions



i really enjoy clip in because im able to take them out or in varying my length
and i also rechange them into different colors, blacks, platinum blondes, dark browns, i even have purple ones!
that way for whatever mood im feeling, i can put them in
they look great but the only thing i dont like about them is that it takes me about two weeks to wear them down to look like my hair
(i tease my hair soo much it looks like i have split ends)
so i have to hairspray them, tease them, and ruffle them up a bit everyday for about two weeks until they look natural

I love extensions!  Just make sure you get human hair.  The better quality ones will usually cost more, but are worth it.  You can get some that are your color to elongate your hair, and you can also get platinum ones and color them whatever colors you like to add dimension or edge to your style.  If you can afford it, go to a stylist that specializes in extensions, there are several different options, and some of them will last up to 4 months.

um stay with your natural color. when people dye their hair, unless you get it profesionally done, it will look terrible and fake. if i were you, keep your hair natural. also, if you are a brunette and dye your hair blonde, you will have to dye your roots every 2 months or so. brown roots in blonde hair looks so much like trailer trash

I love when guys actually style their hair :}
No, it won't make your hair curly again.  Make sure you let your hair cool before styling it, then add product.  I suggest Dirt by Jonathan, you can find it at Sephora or on Sephora.com if there isn't a store near you.  If you can't get that, most lines have a good molding mud.  Finish with a little hair spray, and you should be good.

How to get Jessica Rabbit's hair?



I'm having my 21st birthday and dressing up as Jessica Rabbit. Since it's MY party, i need my hair to resemble hers as close as it can.



I've got long hair to my (almost) elbows, dying it red. I bought root lift stuff for my hair and i got moose and hairspray. I spoke to a hairdresser and she told me all these things i had to do but i forgot which order &gt;_&lt; i think it was:



1. apply root lift to damp hair
2. blow dry upside down
3. put in some moose if needed
4. flip hair up and tease to get volume
5. comb over and style
6. &lt;do something to get the bottom part to curl under&gt;
7. lightly spray with hair spray



i haven't got a pic, but if you go to google images you'll find MANY! thanks for your help!



</question>

oh, sorry i forgot to add the main part...

I really liked the second pic!! your hair looks really cute straight and would look awesome with some layers in it.



DON'T dye it!! my natural haircolor is the same as yours and for years I dyed it red b/c I too was bored with my hair (I was 18 when I started). i'm 29 now and just went back to my natural haircolor and it took an act of god to get it back!! I had to go to the salon and have them strip the red color out then put my natural brown color back in. I then had to have it deep conditioned about 3 times to repair damage.



I get a ton of compliments now that I have my original color back and I got my hair cut (to the middle of my back) w/long layers.



I think having yours straightened again and having some layers put in it would look cute on you!!

haha I was in the hairdressers once and one of the girls that worked there tried going from black to blonde. Her boss the senior stylist had told her not to but she insisted so her boss said she would do it for her to minimise the inevitable damage.



I watched the whole thing take place and her hair looked liked straw and started to break apart. She ended up having to get hair extentions.



Just dye it hun.

wish I could show you my hair, I've been bleaching and lifting my hair platinum blonde for the past two days now, but I've been working towards it for about a month. Its blonde and black and has the skunk affect. You can achieve whatever color you want, it just takes time, but expect some damage to your hair, bleaching will always damage your hair. BTW whenever you add color it's not as damaging and might even give it a healthier look.

if you want to make your hair even just a tiny bit lighter, then you'll have to bleach it. But the thing is you cant just put a little bit of bleach in and it will go a lighter shade of your natural hair color. Bleach has its own color so you could end up having a greenish or grey tinge to your hair. If you are game, then get the hair dresser to put some bleach in your hair as a lightener, then get them to put a dark toner on it and you will get lovely dark brown hair. Alternatively, you can get highlights to make your hair lighter without really any damage. Hope i helped xxx

Make sure you keep your scalp very clean. Buy some non burning shampoo (Like baby shampoo) and run cool water over your hair while you lightly drizzle it onto your scalp. You need to make sure you keep it clean and dislodge the hair from it.



If you had it done in a salon, go to the owner - You have a chemical burn and this is not right. You can sue for this. The hairdresser should have taken more precautions to prevent this from happening. The chemicals could have been mixed incorrectly, put on too long, or applied improperly.

Go to the doctor and get a referral to a dermatologist because it can get seriously infected, and you can get scars and damage if you don't get any help. Don't go back to that hairdresser because they didn't do a patch test on you and they're probably using tacky stuff. You said  your head felt like it was on fire after a few minutes, well if that was in the hair salon, you should have complained. If you did and they didn't rinse it out, you can get them in to a lot of trouble because that is very un professional. Good luck xxxx

You don't really need them - your scalp produces them already. However, if you have long hair, you can choose to apply hair oils on the length only (not the scalp) to nourish and protect.

Yes, i think its very beneficial for hair and skin as well



Look at some middle eastern and asian hair, they oil it regularly



As for me, my mom used to oil my hair as a kid with olive and coconut oil and i ve always had healthy long hair



but since i stopped oiling it and straightening it, it stopped growing and ended up with damaged hair



Now i oil my hair again regularly and its starting to grow healthily again



So my conclution is yes hair oil is good for hair it protects it and penetrate inside to make it grow healthily



but remeber if your diet is not good your hair wont be better so start from a healthy diet and then oil your hair



Hope i helped

The highlights are cute, because you look really young, and they are pretty natural-looking so it fits. They add dimension. You should keep them!

The highlights are nice, but I say go for something a bit darker, the winter season is a perfect time to bring out the dark and mysterious look, highlights are more summery fling in my opinion.

Frizzy hair that refuses to straighten?



At the back my hair is curly really layered and frizzy it WILL not straighten even in when i section and straighten for ages, I do try to evenly condition and shampoo my hair. I straighten with a ghd, i try smoothing milk. all the layers will straighten but then 5 seconds later LITTERALLY they all flip out anf frizz again it looks horrible. I don't know whether its just damaged beyond recognition or its just retarded hair, my mum just said my hair isn't like hair its fluff. I use thermal protectant so it shouldn't be getting too damaged.
my hair on the sides and fringe is silky.

If you're hair doesn't straighten and you feel that you've tried every product, maybe there isnt anything you can do. A few suggestions I have are that you could get it Japanese Straightened. It's a little pricey but it will keep your hair straight, soft, and smooth for a few months or up to a year. Depending on which salon you get it done at.
Or maybe your hair just isn't meant to be straight. I bet it looks pretty being natural and curly. And if this is the case, embrace the fact that you have gorgeous curly hair. :)

tie it up but braid the front part and bobby pin it to side of you head or tie into your ponytail



loose bun: half tie up your hair loosely. get the bottom half loosely wrap around rest and tie it with another hair tie. use your hands to shake it a bit and loosely pit extra bits down.



french plait- google it for instuctions.



if you can leave it down then plait it before you go to bed and sea spray it. take it out in the morning and shake it and voila! loose waves



get a nice clip and get the top section of your hair and clip it at the back of your head/hair



loose side ponytails are always good



you could also just tie it up and use a headband in your school colours!

yes it is okay, as long as it says for color-treated hair.



as for how long the dye will last, it depends on the kind of dye. permanent dye lasts for about 6-8 weeks (until you need a root touch-up). semi-permanent dye lasts for about 6 weeks until you need to totally redo it. i could be wrong about the last one, but im sure its between 4-6 weeks. semi-permanent also washes out slightly as the days progress.

Usually shampoos that are okay say that it's okay to use for colored hair. If it's FOR COLORED hair then I'm sure your fine. I honestly didn't like Loreal Paris Vive Pro. I didn't like the anti frizz one though. It did a good job with the frizz it just dried out my hair. Maybe the Color Treated Hair will be different though. :] Good luck

The shampoos help make the color last longer. I use them but I use different ones depending on whats on sale. Your color will last longer if done at the beauty shop however I do mine at home and it usually lasts about 6 weeks.

Can I make my own shampoo?



I've read about making your own shampoo in a magazine and I wonder if there'd be any benefits to whipping up a natural hair product yourself. And I've been told before to try getting shampoo and soaps that don't contain sodium laureth sulfate, because it might be an irritant. Is this true?



Anyone got any home-made recipes that actually worked great?

Yes, sodium laureth sulfate is an irritant. Here are some other irritants commonly found in shampoos:
* propylene glycol or glycol– a petrochemical used because it is cheap
* cetearyl alcohol – emulsifier that can be synthetic or natural
* methylparaben or propylparaben – typical synthetic preservatives
* distearate – this is polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol which are petrochemicals
* isopropyl alcohol – used as a cheap solvent to carry synthetic oils.



Here is a natural shampoo that you can make. This formulation is something that I have been using for many years. First collect the following items:



4 oz of castile soap with any scent is that available – plain, peppermint, eucalyptus.



½ oz of rosemary - stimulates the hair follicles and helps to prevent premature baldness



½ oz of sage – has antioxidants and keeps things from spoiling and is antibacterial



½ oz of nettles – acts as a blood purifier, blood stimulator, contains a large source of nutrients for hair growth



½ of lavender – controls the production of sebaceous gland oil and reduces itchy and flaky scalp conditions



2000 mg of MSM – provides organic sulfur to your scalp, which improves the health and strength of your hair. It also helps to drive herbal nutrient into the skin and follicles where they can do the most good.



one empty 8 oz plastic bottle, or any other empty shampoo or soap bottle.



Mix the herbs in a mason jar, which has a lid. Boil 2 cups of distilled water. Add 3 heaping tablespoons of the mixed herbs into the boiling water. Pull the boiling water and herbs off the stove. Let the herb mixture sit for 30 – 40 minutes. Put the 2000mg of MSM into the herb mixture after 30 minutes of cooling. After 40 minutes and the MSM is melted, strain the herbal mixture into a bowl.



Pour 2 to 2 1/2 oz of strained herbal tea into the 8 oz plastic bottle. Now, pour the 4 oz of castile soap into the 8 oz plastic bottle. Cap the bottle and shake to mix the ingredients.



The shampoo is now finished and ready for use. Use this as a base for all of the shampoos you make. You can add different herbs as you learn what these herbs do and how they help your hair. You can vary the ingredients according to your taste. But now you have a shampoo that has no additives that can harm you.

Wait at least two weeks before doing anything to your hair to let the dye settle. It may lighten up a bit by then anyway and you may like it. Any time you color and bleach your hair that many times, it will damage your hair. Things like bleach especially hurt your hair.

I know I am a guy and I am gay for answering this but YES! It will ruin your hair. 2 reasons. 1 bleach is alone very bad for your hair. If you don't have to bleach it then do not. 2 You just died your hair and your hair is in a very unhealthy state. Bleaching it right after dying it will force you to have to leave the bleach in longer than usual. This is bad, very bad. 2 Things. Either dye it Black because black never looks bad on any girl or... let it grow out or wait a couple months before dying it again. I died my hair black one time. 3 Weeks later I bleached it while it was black and it took 2-3 hours. A lot of my hair fell out.... not good! It is different with everyone but I do not recommend it.

Definitely you will damage your hair by bleaching it when you already dyed it.  Dying hair is already drying out your natural oils in each strand of hair so doing it more than once with in 3 months can dry out each strand making your hair look dry and unhealthy.  Strands may even break and become so brittle that you will end up with split ends too.
Nope, I don't suggest doing that just yet.

Will blow-drying your hair or perming it cause dandruff?



I had mild dandruff a while back and I don't know what caused it. I wash my hair everyday with shampoo and I apply conditioner to the ends twice. I permed my hair about five months ago. Sometimes I'll blow-dry it but always with the lowest heat. Usually I just let it sit and air-dry.
Could it be the blow-drying that caused the problem? Or was it the perm? Or am I not drinking enough water (I really can't fit in 8 cups a day)?

Well dandruff comes from the flaking of skin from the scalp. So i don't think the blowdryer will  have much of an effect, but dehydration would. You can add fruit to your diet for added water and vitamins.

To the best of my knowledge I believe dandruff is caused by many different things.  You could have a dry scalp, which can be caused by the products you use, or over processing, or blow drying or a combination of all the above. Could be the gel or mousse or hair spray you use.  You could try switching shampoo, or conditioner, gel hair spray.  Try the kind specifically for dry scalp. Or try dandruff shampoo for awhile.  It could be caused by your environment or even your air conditioning or heating unit in your home.  The point is that something you are using or living in is the cause of this annoying problem.  If you live in a particularly dry climate or perhaps very humid climate your scalp could be affected.  If your air conditioner or heater keeps the air too dry in your home your scalp could become dry.  If you change your hair grooming products and this does not help then try purchasing a dehumidifier for your home and see if this helps.  Otherwise there are some good dandruff shampoos out there.  For some people dandruff is just a temporary side effect of one of the above mentioned causes or a combination and will go away once you figure out what caused it and change.  Unfortunately, though for some it is something you must learn to live with and the embarrassing flakes can be kept at bay with proper hair care with dandruff products.  I am almost sure that for you though the answer will be found in changing your hair care regimen completely for awhile until the flakes go away.  no perms for awhile and less blow drying and changing styling products until you find the combination that works for you without overdrying your scalp.  Hope this helps....good luck

I died my hair blond a couple months ago, now its growing out and I have ugly dark roots...?



About 4 months ago I had someone (a professional) die my brown hair blond with darker blond highlights.  Now my hair is growing out and I have ugly dark roots.  It's about 4 inches of dark roots and I have long hair.  My husband is in the military and we live overseas in Spain.  I do not know Spanish so I can't go off base to get my hair done and we do not have a hair place on this base because its so small.  I plan on getting my hair done again when I go home in January.  But what can I do until then?  Is there a way to get the died color out so that my hair is brown again, or should I just go buy a home kit and die my hair close to its natural color?  I would think that it would still be two toned because I'm dying the dark and the light hair the same color.

If you can't go to someone to get your roots done and you don't know how to do them yourself then in my opinion your safest plan of action would certainly be to buy a home coloring kit closest to your natural color and color your hair.  Get the best one you can find. Don't go cheap and follow the directions to the letter and you will get good coverage.  It won't be two toned because you are coloring your entire head the same color.  It will however start to fade over time to the point where the lightest parts become a little lighter than the roots again.  This is because you completely stripped the dark color pigment from the hair when it was bleached blonde.  The color difference will be gradually noticeable, but not nearly as it is now and will be more livable as the contrast will be subtle.  I would be happier this way myself than with ever lengthening dark roots and blonde ends.  This should at least fix your problem until you can either get to a salon to have it redone or find a suitable one close to base where someone speaks English and can offer you other options.  Hope this helps. Good luck

Does jumbo hair rollers really straighten your hair?



I have slight wavy hair that always gets out of control in the morning. I'm using a flat iron but I think it's damaging my hair too much so I was thinking about hair rollers. Do they really straighten your hair?  My hair is a few inches below my shoulder and slightly wavy. What size should the rollers be. I'm planning to grow my hair too.

1. Swear by leave-in conditioner. Slather it on every morning before going outside, to combat dryness.



2. Protect hair from the sun. This is especially important if you color your hair! Use a spray-on UV protectant over your leave-in conditioner to prevent the sun's rays from turning your hair a brassy shade.



3. Use salt as a styling aid. Saltwater gives hair texture and allows it to better hold a style, especially key for lank locks. Take advantage by skipping the shampoo after the beach, then scrunching as you dry hair with a diffuser.



4. Trim before summer. Summer tends to make hair dry, so this process will speed up on hair with already-dead ends in need of a cut. Trimming before the summer minimizes damage by removing unhealthy ends before you hit the sun.



5. Try braids. They're too youthful for the office, but braided pigtails look fresh and energetic at the beach. Simply part hair down the middle, braid each side, and secure.



6. Apply styling paste to short hair. A gummy paste will give short cuts hold and definition, plus protect them from the sun and chlorine. Smooth onto dry hair before going outside.



7. Sport a scarf. It has a decidedly Jackie O. feel and protects hair at the same time: Tie a long headscarf over hair, letting the ends dangle.



8. Swear off blowdryers. While you're at the beach, vow to air-dry your hair. Using a blowdryer after a day in the sun can make your hair doubly damaged.



9. Don't leave home without a wide-tooth comb. While saltwater is a good styling aid, it can leave hair knotted and clumpy. Spritz a bit of your UV protectant onto the comb's teeth and run it through strands after every swim to prevent those knots.



10. Add an accessory. It's simple but chic: A bright, beachy pony holder gives flair and style to even the simplest swimsuit.

lol i like this look a lot and i do it often with garnier fructis beach hair sculpting stuff...its easy.
http://www.garnierusa.com/_en/_us/progra...
just click beach hair, the blonde on the left...and for a diff one that is similar click the runway volume pic... or if u dont have time in the morning to do that look....set ur hair in large rollars...like about the size of a fifth of ur face after taking ur shower..by morning they should be dry, if not then just blow dry on low heat for a little bit of time, sometimes thick hair will still be wet at he ends...take em down and ruffle them up a bit and put some shine serum in ur hair, only a tiny amount not a lot so that some of those cirls come out. instaed of being really frizzy...for a few defined ones just twist/twirl small chunks of hair that u want mroe defined a little bit.

if she has darker hair, go for a strawberry blonde...the darkness of the blonde is much better looking because often the dark hair is complimentary to the skin tone...going really blonde would wash her out...if she is this unsure, have her try wigs on to see what color she likes best that is of course a type of blonde wig...that way she can see what suits her best before ever getting it lightened.

A few hairstyles for school?



Im 13 and it's now the start of term 4 and i'm looking for some new hairstyles, just a few so i can change them around a bit and also one suitable for PE. I have lightish brown hair with blonde streaks, its wavy and it comes a few inches over my shoulders and it has front layers and a side fringe, i also have brown eyes and a high hairline, i'm short and skinny if that helps. I don't like to wear it out because of the frizz and especially on hot days it makes me sweat, i normally wear it in a messy bun with my fringe pulled to the side. I want something that is easy, looks good, feels good and suites me. Also if you can help me with my frizz problems because my mum would like me to wear my hair out more often.

Quiff and a pony, high piny with fringe down to the side (chic), if you straighten it the frizz will go away so I think you should wear it down, pigtails for P.E., fish plaits; look it up on the internet, messy bun is good; i see you already have that one, half up half down, braids and/or bouncy curls. =P

try putting some mousse in your hair when its wet. it can help tame frizz and makes your hair look pretty and full of volume. then make a high pony tail. this looks really pretty. try doing a loose side pony.

My hair is wavy and frizzes so what I like to do is straighten it sometimes. Also you could do the whole half up half down thing which will pull up the top half your hair and then have the bottom out or leave your fringe out and pull up just a bit from each side like your front layers.



For a new style try having your fringe out and pull up your hair into a ponytail but leave your front layers out then slightly twist them and use bobypins to pin them back and make them messy. Or after your hair is in a ponytail braid the end part.



These styles are really popular with the girls in my school so hope I helped.

How do I grow my hair longer if I am a vegetarian? I want my hair to grow at least six inches by June.?



I'm a vegetarian, so it is hard to maintain my hair so it grows at a quick rate. And also my nails. My mother says to eat oatmeal because it will help but I hate oatmeal. I don't eat any poultry, meat, or egg yolks. I also don't eat gelatin. Somebody help me and tell me what I'm supposed to do!

just eat loads and loads of fresh fruit and veg and use a good quality shampoo and conditioner so your hair maintains its healthy look and condition you can straighten your hair which makes it look longer,but i wouldn't recommend doing this all the time as the heat can damage it

Does jumbo hair rollers really straighten your hair?



I have slight wavy hair that always gets out of control in the morning. I'm using a flat iron but I think it's damaging my hair too much so I was thinking about hair rollers. Do they really straighten your hair?  My hair is a few inches below my shoulder and slightly wavy. What size should the rollers be. I'm planning to grow my hair too.

no, they don't :/ i've tried.
but try just blow drying your hair out straight. they also sell like special serums and stuff to use when doing that.
also, have you tried a flat iron spray, they are excellent and when you use them it doesn't damage your hair as much. plus they smell good and make your hair shiny

I don't think that your blowdrying/straightening beforehand would have done too much damage really.



Blonde shouldn't fade, as you have essentially just had the colour stripped from your hair, not had another colour put on top of it.
You could use a colour-specific shampoo/conditioner if you wanted, but I would personally use one for coloured/dry or damaged hair because the bleach they have used to lighten your hair is not very good for it.



regrowth depends on the rate at which your hair grows, but i wouldn't worry about it too much, as all you have to do when it gets too bad is go back to the hairdresser and they'll put in some more foils to cover it up.



Have fun with your newly blonde hair!

it will fade within a few weeks the colour will be there but it wont look as good. Buy a few of them wash in wash out packet dyes normally 40p-£1 and put that through your hair every week. thats what my hair dresser told me and it really works well. Everyones hair grows diffrently so its hard to say. The best shampoo to use is charles worthingtons .. hope that helps!

Well blonde doesn't really fade.



But if you're worried about it going green/too yellow, then I suggest using a purple coloured toner. You can get it in Priceline or chemists or any stores like that. You only need to use it about once a week to keep it a nice blonde, too much & it turns blue.



& make sure you wash it all out.



I washed my hair really quickly before school photos last year & its all clumpy & horrible! & it was year 12 photo. =[
But otherwise it should look really nice.

I don't think you should get full bangs as they might not suit your face shape..
Instead, you could try some more side-swept bangs, seeing as your hair is almost at a side part already.
Go to your hairdresser and ask him/her what they think would suit you, and then go for it!

Homecoming Hair?? What Should I Do?



I am 14 and going to my first homecoming next week. I need hair ideas. My hair is long and thick and brown. I'm thinking like up in curls, down curled, or half up half down straight or curled. Please help. If it matters my dress is black. PLZ no stupid answers. I'm serious. I can't go to a salon cause I spent all my money on my dress. LOL.

I think you should curl it, like not small curls, but big loose curls. It'll look great! then you could pull half into a ponytail, or just leave it down.

curl your hair by loose curls by these steps



Shampoo and condition your hair normally. Towel dry. Create a bun at the nape of your neck by twisting your hair as you shape it into the bun.



http://jamaluk.com/images/2004/brac20s.j...



then apply hair spray called Shockwaves Curl Energy Spray from wella
Pin your newly formed bun into place.
Allow your hair to air dry naturally. When hair is dry, take the pins out of your hair and should have long, loose, sexy waves.

Few hairstyles for school?



Im 13 and it's now the start of term 4 and i'm looking for some new hairstyles, just a few so i can change them around a bit and also one suitable for PE. I have lightish brown hair with blonde streaks, its wavy and it comes a few inches over my shoulders and it has front layers and a side fringe, i also have brown eyes and a high hairline, i'm short and skinny if that helps. I don't like to wear it out because of the frizz and especially on hot days it makes me sweat, i normally wear it in a messy bun with my fringe pulled to the side. I want something that is easy, looks good, feels good and suites me. Also if you can help me with my frizz problems because my mum would like me to wear my hair out more often

how about just up in a high pony tail, bend forward and get your hair over your face and then fling it back and stand up right and put it in a bobble. doesn't get any easier and it looks great and natural.



or, side pony tail is always good and easy.



pigtails, if your skinny, that's good (but not plaited)
you could have it in a pony tail put only pull it through half so its sorta like a bun



hmm... fizz problems... well you could wear your hair down with a hairband or one of those round bands that goes all the way around. that would hide any fiz and keep hair out of face. also, if you keep running your fingers through it and pull it back but keep it down, it looks for natural and fizz free. or just use styling moose, doesn't show and isn't too bad for your hair.



any help?

I can say having the right hair stylist can really help you. I went to school for cosmetology and I have 2 cousins that are brother and sis, that have them smack in the middle of their head. the boy spikes his head, and the girl usually wears head bands but you can try a good stylist that can show you options for your hair!!

This will not work. It may lift the color a little, but black dye is extremely difficult to get out. Think about it this way. If you get some bleach on your black clothes, you usually end up with a brownish-orangish spot. What ever happens, the color is not pretty. Take it from me, it practically takes dynamite to get black dye out. Leave it to a professional.

I would still suggest waxing I'm afraid! That way the hair grows back less quickly and also you find the amount of regrowth is less too (more noticeably on the bikini, leg etc areas).



Maybe you could try going to a beauty salon and explaining you suffer a reaction, that way they will make sure to cleanse your skin before the procedure (key to not getting bumps) and will usually apply a cooling gel after wards. If this work then you can get really good home kits and aloe vera cooling gel really calms down any redness after waxing.



I would advise against bleaching as your skin sounds quite sensitive and the chemicals they use could likely cause a reaction or dryness or the area.
Hope this helps! x

If you're going to have an unnatural color is your hair, you have to keep it extremely neat, clean, and cared for. It's kind of a trade off- if your blue/green hair was smooth, brushed, and not oily or stringy, the it would be pretty.



The color itself is nice, though I would steer away from adding green, due to your skin color. Focus on keeping it up for awhile, not going extreme with the color.

its a pretty hair color but i think u needa dy the roots up a bit more...they are slightly faded looking compared to the tips...and i think when u have a n extreme color like that u should always have a defined flattering hairstyle everyday or sleek style to make it work for u, ur style doesnt match u or ur hair...try straightening it or getting really shapely defined curls or perhaps getting different shades of blue to create a really neat style that look intentional...green hair wont look too hot on u lol sorry to say...the blue works better...or maybe u can strip the color and bleach it...and then dye it dark purple...green would make ur skin look mucky because ur are fair skinned... this is what i mean by a specific sleek and or flattering style...

don't green it up. i don't think it's pretty because it does not compliment you at all. your hair looks very damaged. i suggest coloring it to a dark chocolate color. it'll help your hair look richer, healthier and fuller.

I don't know if you're being serious or not but to put it nicely, that is definitely not a nice color. Don't make it worse by adding green. Perhaps try a more natural color? Chocolate brown would be gorgeous!

Apparently the more often you wash your hair, the oilier it can become because when you wash it you are stripping it of its natural oils and to fix this you produce more oil.. giving it the oily look.



Maybe try washing it every 3 or so days and see if it makes a difference.



Also the best trick out there haha.. put a bit of talcom powder or baby powder in your hair where it looks oily and rub it in. It acts almost as a dry shampoo and gets rid of the oiliness. Its awesome for when you dont have enough time to wash your hair. Just make sure you rub it in properly or else your hair can look a bit grey.



Hope this helps!

Make sure you're not using too much conditioner and that you're washing it out properly



Otherwise it tends to make your hair oily faster then usual.



Also any products you use may have a similar effect, dont over do it.

I have always had naturally oily hair that I have to wash everyday. Every once in a while I can slide by with putting it up the next day if I am late or something. I think you will probably have the best results with your hairy if you start washing it everyday with a quality line of shampoo and conditioner. I use Pantene and I haven't found anything else that is of standards to that for me. I also use a generous amount of shampoo and conditioner and I don't think that's the problem. I think you just need to wash it more often. Some people just have a naturally oil scalp. Even more if your hair is straight, it tends to show up a lot. Try washing it everyday and see if this makes a difference. Or at least the night before work/school/etc (not as good results but better) if you absolutely don't have time. Good luck! I hope I could be of help to you.

Reduce the use of some chemicals to your hair, you'll just end up damaging your hair if you use shampoos and conditioners too often. As far as I can remember, doing a hundred strokes of combing to your hair will make it more dry because it allows the oil in your hair to go out.

Use a little less conditioner when you shower and make sure that you rinse it really well. When putting the conditioner on try not putting it too close to the scalp. Depending on the way you style your hair, a little aerosol hairspray at the roots takes away some of the oiliness. Good luck!!

How can i fade my hair colour?



My hair is naturally light brown but for a year or so i've been dying dark brown (so dark it's often mistaken for black). Now about half the length of my hair is dyed and the rest regrowth. It didn't used to be that noticeable, but now the sun's touched it, the regrowth is going lighter.



I want to try and fade the dark half so there isn't such a distinct line across my head!



Many people have said dishwashing liquid... is this bad for your hair? if so how bad?



I know i could bleach the bottom half but that's a bit risky trying to get it the same tone as the top :)



thanks

Hair extension question?



Hi,



I am thinking about whether to get hair extensions, I found the place where I want to get them done and the method they use is "fusion bonding" does anyone know how this works and if it hurts?



Thanks

How do I keep my hair flat after I wash it?



This is a little embarrassing.  I'm 18 and about to start my training for the Royal Marines, which means I'll probably after shower at least twice a day.  I don't want to sound like an insecure metrosexual *****, but my hair is really lame, it is really straight and puffy, and if I wash it and then dry it I get a really big blonde afro.  The only way I can keep it down is if I wear a cap for a while or put some gel in it.  I can't do this when I'm in training so is there any other way I can keep it down and not like an afro?

For one thing if you think youre going to have time for (2) showers a day wihle in your in training - think again.  I was an Army chick and we got one shower and that was with 6 showerheads, about 30 of us and 15 min.  You dont have time to blow dry anything.  you take showers at nite for the most part.



I am not sure if you are male or female...guys...you'll have a whole new haircut courtesy of the R.M.



A lot of the girls cut their hair short for basic and let it grow after that.  I didnt as my hair was easy to keep above my collar.  RAF might have different regulations as us Yanks.



The military has no room for prima donna's...



I would think they'd give you a short military cut for training.  If youre a girl...how is it that you have straight and puffy hair??  straight hair does not tend to have afro like qualities...



Dont you guys wear caps or berets?  most military personnel do...



to recap: guy - you'll be getting your haircut anyway for hygiene and uniformity...if they dont do it- you do it.



girl: get a better hair cut for training.  use gel or a smoothing gel...



you can wear gel in training- you just cant go crazy style salon- something like a pomade should help.

Before you do anything permanent and end up regretting what you do, you should try a semi-permanent haircolor first. Clairol Natural Instincts has a lot of natural, semi-permanent shades to choose from, but you just have to go darker, which in your case is just fine. Try a darker color from that brand before you do anything and if you like it, dye it the same color in a permanent shade, and if you don't like it, you can just let it wash out. This is their full shade pallet:

Hair extensions??? advice please!!!!?



I want to get extensions again
i had them 2 years ago with that special glue stuff and it was really bad. i payed 400 quid and you could see where they attached. and when i used the hair dryer they used to heat up and the glue went sticky.



i really want them again but i want to be able to put my hair up without them being seen.
i was thinkin about the ones that get plaited into the top of your hair. does any1 know what this is called? also the ones with the ring that is attached in rows. whats best?
i really dont want the clip in ones because i want them long term and cant be bothered takin them out n putin them bak in again..



anyone know of any sites with info or any videos on youtube... send me the link please and any info with personal experiences would be great!

Aww man, glue extensions are the MOST damaging to your hair, it ruins your natural hair and looks horrible.



I had the weft hair extensions glued in and they wripped half of my hair out..literally.



Because my hair's thinner and shorter now I still wear them, so the best ones I have tried are...



Hair weaving (when you buy a natural human hair weft and have it weaved into your head by a professional, a lot of hairdressers do it now) it causes no damage, and they're in your head for about 4-6 weeks before you need them tightened or taken out).



Hair weft with clips - You can style your natural hair, then clip these into your head, and there is some good ones out there.



I buy mine from a guy on ebay...



http://stores.ebay.co.uk/MiSS-WORLD-HAIR...



They are extremely cheap and extremely good!



These don't ruin your hair and you can take them out when you like.



The ring extensions aren't great and you can see them more than these.



Whatever you do, don't be tempted to glue them in again, there's plenty of other options.

your talking about the weaves or sewn in ones.... these are best done at an afro Caribbean salon as they are used to doing them.



they are less damaging to the hair than the individual extensions as the put your natural hair under less stress.

at 13 you shouldn't really be worrying about hair styles man.



Just get whatever you want.  stuff with gel sucks, cuz you have to sleep on it every day unless you shower at night and not in the morning, in which case your hair will smell bad in the middle of the day if it has gel in it and you haven't washed since the night before.

Getting your hair wet is not going to hurt it.However, washing it every day will. Each time you wash your hair you wash out all the natural oils from it which in time will dry your hair out.If you feel the need to wear a shower cap you can however it is not necessary .

If you wash your hair everyday, you are going to strip it of its natural oils && it will get greasy and gross fast.It also can damage the hair and make it brittle and easy to break.



As for getting it wet, i would recommend using a shower cap. If your hair is getting wet just a small bit by the spray of the shower/tap, then it would be okay. I wouldn't recommend putting your head/hair directly under the water, as it too can make it go gross.

Hair extension question?



Hi,



I am thinking about whether to get hair extensions, I found the place where I want to get them done and the method they use is "fusion bonding" does anyone know how this works and if it hurts?

The basic concept behind fusion bonding is to fuse the extension with the keratin protein of the natural hair, strand by strand. In this process the weft is attached to the hair root using bonding glue with the help of heated adhesive sticks which are create specially for this purpose.Such hair extensions are of different types such as hot and cold fusion according to slight detours from the elementary procedure outlined above. Wefts or single strands can be used for hair extension purposes.
personally i wouldnt get this done isnt good for your hair

fusion bonding in my opinion is the best because they last a long time. on the end of the extention is a karenteen tip wich is what hair is made of and they use this tool to melt that onto a tiny piece of your real hair. then the roll it with there finger tips to make sure it stays.



this method is prolly the least pain full putitng in and taking out.



good luck

my daughter just got hair extensions but she was advised against that type, it puts too much pressure on your own hair and can break the hair off, plus when you get them taken out they use this stuff polymer, i think that's how you spell it, but it can cause a reaction, the hairdresser told a story about a girl taken a reaction when she was taken them out, had to be rushed to hospital, any way, my daughter got micro ring wafts, its much kinder to the hair, plus you don't notice it at all, she got them 18" so it looks really good, they cost a bit more than the other ones, but if your hair is thick and you want loads of volume then that's the way to go, she has had them for about three weeks now and thinks there great, she gos into the hairdressers once a week and they blow dry them for hair, then she washes it herself and curls them herself as well. I hope this helps, oh plus get the more expensive hair, it will last longer, and looks better. what ever you decide, make sure its a good place your getting them done, or you could spend a lot of money for nothing, kates cost £500.

When I was considering what I wanted to do to change my hair I visited this website! It's really good but you need lots of patience.



Firstly you need to register which is free and they won't contact you with loads of jargon.



Each style can be dragged about so it fits to your face (different thickness or length etc) and also you can change the colour or add highlights! It has all the latest celebrity styles! Remember if your not sure of it straight away try it anyway you might be surprised or play around with it a bit!



Hope this helps x

i think what you need to think about though is that - although it is in fashion to have retro hairstyles and they look fantastic in your head, they might not be practical everyday.



even Elvis didn't ALWAYS have his hair in that style - it was his stage look...

Yes really the only thing you can do is try and cover the spot with other hair.  Dont let anyone try and fix it until it really grows in.  It takes a very experienced hair stylist to fix those types of problems.

You can try going to a salon but, to fix the problem entirely, they would have to clip your hair at the shortest spot. I would just try styling your hair over it until it grows back. I am so sorry that this happened to your hair :(. If you want it to grow fast, try getting some prenatal vitamins. They're a  little pricey but, they work!

Go to a Salon (Don't tell your friend or they'll be hurt)
Tell the hairdresser about what happened, they'll understand (they are human beings!)
Have a (not too obvious) style added to your hair to cover up the embarrassing spot of hair...
....and your problem's solved!!!

I cut my hair too short...?



I ahd the Victoria Beckham cut where my hair was shorter in the back with lots of layers, and longer, a-lined in the front. The front pieces were very thin and were starting to be very dry and brittle from straightening (which, yes, I must do). So, I cut off the dry thin front pieces, in an attempt to have healthier hair. Big mistake. My hair is now at or slightly above my chin, and slightly longer in the back, whereas before it was nearly shoulder length in front. I look like a boy! How long do you think it will take for my hair to grow back? And, more importantly, what styles or tips can I use in the meantime to be able to walk out in public?! I use extentions, but they are kind of a hassle. Any other ideas?

Don´t bleach the whole head, just the roots, that way you won´t damage it so much. A month and a half is a reasonable time to bleach your roots. Then put on a dye on your whole head.

If your just wanting your hair bleach blonde bleaching is a BAD idea. It will not leave you with a good color, and it will damage your hair. Go to a hairstylist! They can give you the blonde you want, if it is already pretty blonde it shouldn't be too hard for them to get it as blonde as you would like. It will cost you a little money but it will be totally worth it to get a great more natural and healthy looking color. It will look so much better!!!!!!! Don't bleach!

You died your hair..Now you want to bleach it  WHY?  It will become like straw..split ends..and you will be sorry.  If you want it more blonde than stick with a lighter shade of blonde.  Stay away from the bleach for awhile  like 3 months.. Depends if your hair is thin..it might fall out. Try walking into a Salon it cost you NOTHING to ask a stylist ..they can touch your hair and tell you. It's best that way so that you don't ruin your hair.
Bleach is strong so you will be taking a chance..if you don't get the correct information you just might NOT be able to get a comb through it.

well, bleach questions on here should be way more descriptive, no offense to you or anything, but just in general, there's a lot of things that go into bleaching hair. first off, how light is your blonde hair? how dark are your roots?. i'd say that if you have dark roots bleach them and then bleach your blonde AFTER you get your roots the color you want them. i'll assume that since you say it's blonde that it's fairly light. so, i wouldn't bleach with more than a 20-25 for 30 minutes tops. I'd say use 10 volume, but the truth is, is that i used 10 volume with purple bleach on my already bleached yellow hair to turn it white(long story, if you want to hear it just message me via e-mail or leave yours if you comment my answer) and it did NOTHING. and you have artificial color in your hair and i'm assuming that you want to color it lighter? so i'd say 20 or 25 volume. with, i'd say purple bleach? ya, lol. hope i helped!



P.S. IT WON'T FALL OUT IN CHUNKS! i've bleached my hair one day with 30 volume developer for an hour, colored it 12G blonde the next day with 40 volume developer for 30 minutes, didn't work, so i bleached it AGAIN the next day with neutral bleach for an HOUR, then the next day, bleached it with PURPLE bleach for ANOTHER 30 minutes! and the worst thing that happened to me was dandruff because my scalp was dry :-(

it makes your hair weak with lots of split ends
and evenutally will start frizzing and you'll get alot of fly-aways.

Your answer ..... it is bad. Bleach removes all pigment from the hair shaft and  leaves your hair shaft empty and damaged.



Hollow and lifeless basically. You should counteract it with a dark brown red color maybe, I used Perfect 10 Dark Auburn it actually made my hair like a light brown, it was pretty. And before that my hair was black. Might help.

You probably don;t want to try to bleach your own hair.  It could fall out.  You can use bleach to strip your hair which will leave it blond.  They you can dye color on top of that if you want brown.  But I'd let a pro do it!

for one you dyed your hair... which can cause damage if not properly cared for and in direct sunlight for long hours...



since you want to transition back, you are risking breakage and damage!! relaxers, hair dyes, and bleach strip away the natural barrier of your hair strands, making it more vulnerable to damage.



Unless you can moisturize, condition, and get weekly treatments and trims for your hair unconditionally than you can do it... but I strongly advise you don't and just cut it shorter and wait for it to grow out more...

If your hair is black do not bleach it! It will mess up your hair. Your best bett is to wait about two weeks (from the day you dyed it) and than just go to the store and buy some very light brown hair dye. You cant not just go Straight from a dark color to a light color. You have to gradually get lighter and lighter. I know I went from blonde to dark brown. Im at dirty blonde now. Still working on it.

Bleach will cause the hair to thin. You will have split ends, very dry hair.



Please take my word for it and stay away from bleach.

it does damage your hair if you do it even once, but as long as it's just once it shouldn't be too bad. The reason they're saying to "bleach" it is to lift the black out of it... but if you're going to a dark brown from black you won't need to leave the bleach on for long... I would suggest a 30 or 40 cream developer from a place like Sally's Beauty Supply and a lift like BW2 Powder Lightener http://www.thisnext.com/item/0F13836D/F6... talk to the girls/guys at the beauty supply store and they'll give you some tips if you don't have a professional do it. Then I would use a hair placenta like HASK after for a few days to keep your hair healthy http://www.hairproducts.com/view_product...

You have such a beautiful face!  But your hair is covering it up way too much.....get the bangs out of your face-maybe part it in the middle, or cut the bangs shorter. Bob your hair-you have a very good face shape, so it would really make you look great!  Slap a few blond streaks in the front, around your face.  And post a pic when you're done! :)

Oh WOW... you have a pretty face and you have all that hair covering it.



You bangs are too long and in your face.  Cut it about an inch  and leave it alone. It's pretty and maybe you can wear decorations in it.. put it up..wear it curly  and straight.



Just get a full trim. Leave it alone  and show that pretty face.
get some highlights in it....that will be a big change.

I have the same coloring you do, and based on my personal experiences with hair color, both good and bad, I recommend Bitter Cappuchino or Caramel Brown.  If I had to choose just one, I think Bitter Cappuchino would be the most flattering.

Ok so if you want to be brave... go with the mango gelee
the orange biscuit isnt bad either...
I can honestly tell you that the carmel brown (if it comes out right) will not leave you un satisfied...
Well to say the truth All these would look good on you
but IM the bold type so im suggesting you go with the mango one i love it...(if your safe go with the carmel brown though)

Dry hair solutions??????????



I have really dry and frizzy hair. I use the conditioner and shampoos that my hair dresser recommended but they dont help much. I dont mind it being wavy but when it gets to dry its out of control and then I end up straightening it which only makes it drier. any solutions or ideas on what to do??? do you use a good shampoo or conditioner?

use any brand shampoo/conditioner that says its for moisture. i know herbal essences has one. also, use a heat protectant before blow drying and straightening hair. it makes it super soft and protects it from damage which is why your hair is probably so dry. i suggest tresemme heat tamer spray. it works great and smells AMAZING. =)

How can I get long healthy hair?



First, is there any way to make you hair grow longer faster?  And second, my hair seems to get dry a lot...Mostly probably because I highlight it. I am wondering if there is a way I can seem to stay blonde but actually not strip my hair (at least not too badly) Don't ask why I have to stay blonde-ish...I don't want to get into the reason....And I use moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and color treatment conditioner.

Keep your hair trimmed when needed. Keep your body healthy and well nourished. make sure your hair is moisturized and protected as much as possible. Use a treatment serum for moisture and shine. A natural alternative is coconut oil or olive oil. Just use a tiny bit to keep end moisturized and healthy. Also can be used for deep treatments and overnight. Just gently shampoo/condition after.  I have been using a product called Smooth n Shine hair polisher forever. It makes my hair look and feel shiney and healthy. It smells nice too.  i have long wavy blonde hilited hair. It is always looking nice and healthy.

Cut it often.  This helps the hair grow healthier and faster.  Try and just wash your scalp when you shampoo and apply your conditioner twice in the shower...the second time around the hair seems to soak it in better.  I don't think you need moisturizing shampoo.  Use other products in different ways...experiment.  If it says to put a product in dry hair, try using it in wet hair, etc.



Hope this helps,

Possible to get a Asian hairstyle at any Salon?



I usually go to the barber and get plain haircut, but I'm growing out my hair and its getting uneven. I want to get a layered razored cut to break up my thick hair. I found some styles I like but they are all Asian.



I live in Santa Barbara and don't know of any Asian salons, and prolly won't be going to LA for a while and don't want to drive down there just for a haircut.



So, can I just print out the style and go to a regular salon?



And does anyone know of good asian salon, korean one, in LA?

Help with my mom's hair... Picture?



My mom has thick, short and layered hair that is very thick but really soft… she is trying to grow it out but it’s driving her crazy because at work she is outside in the wind all day and it’s not long enough to even pull back into a pony. She sometimes uses a headband but it’s not appropriate for work because with all the layers the headband just makes them all stick up and out everywhere! She is complaining that its unmanageable, all over crazy and at times it looks plastered to her head… she is asking me for advice on a product to use but I don’t know anything about products as I do not use any! Any suggestions??? Thank you for your help! P.S. she is 50 and not very… girly lol, check out her pic.

Okay, get an EYEBROW pencil, and wash it off EVERY night before bed, and yeah, your eyebrows WILL grow in again!! That is why women are constantly plucking there eyebrows!! In fact, your eyebrows are growing right now!!! :) I mean, when I wash my face at night, sometimes a couple of my eyebrow hairs will fall out. They have probably just been falling out because you have been constantly drawing on them with eyeliner and not been washing them. I'm sure everything will turn out just fine!!! :) Good Luck!!!

You answered your own question your using eye liner get it for your eyes and clean it everyday. Use eyeshadow instead get a q-tip put some brown or black eyeshadow and color it with the q-tip to the side not straight it will give you a more natural look and don't make it to dark then it will look nasty and stop using pencils you should let your eyebrows grow thiker they look much nicer and dont shave them pluck them out that is so 1990's.

Firstly stop plucking, or waxing.
Let them grow back naturally then you can shape them to your desired thickness.



If you think it is the pencil you are using. Stop using it, get a different brand. Even try using eyeshadow instead. But make sure you wash it off every night.



Hope this helps

if you are trying to get that edgy look then definitely razor... it looks like that picture was actually cut with a razor... i use my razor for almost every long hair guys cut.  it grows out nicer and doesn't look so much like, "i just got a haircut".

Yes its common
well seeing as im from and live in Ireland
im used to seeing quite a few..
people laugh and roll their eyes when i say this ..



but Strawberry Blonde and Ginger are ACTUALLY!!!.. different colours!
its hard to explain in typed words, if i find two pictures that separate the two il email them to you =)!...



i personally love the colour.
i think its really cute and has a somewhat innocent vibe about it =)
just make sure you dont dye it!
so many girls i know with that colour hair but blonde highlights and lowlights and all that crap and it just ruins it and they just end up looking like everyone else ... snoreee. =(!
hope this helps

Question about dying hair?



I've been thinking about dying my hair a dark auburn red color ( naturally I have a dirty blonde hair color ), I might have them dye my eyebrows as well. My one worry about this ( beside it maybe looking like crap lol ) is how it may effect my future relationships... For example, what if I get with a guy and he really loves red hair. I would eventually tell him that it wasn't my natural hair color. Do you think that hair color can make or break a relationship? Like what if he wants to have children with red hair? Since a natural auburn hair color is so rare. I notice that when I am in a relationship I consider the guys hair color and eye color to have an idea how our children may end up looking. I don't know if I am making any sense but I think it may be something important to consider before actually taking the plunge to dye my hair. What are your thoughts, advice, and opinions...?  Thanks :)

How do I get rid of the icky dishwater tint in my hair?



I always used to have long blonde hair but about a year or two ago it started growing out a light grayish brown (I hate that color!!!) and now about two inches from the scalp it is dishwater color, and the rest of my hair is darkening too, for that matter. What can I do to get it back to the nice light blonde it used to be. There isn't much sun where  I live so I can† sun bleach it. I dont want to dye it either

If it's urgent, try styling gel or mousse.
But, if you have some time, buy some of Sunsilk's shampoo. They have brands to make flat hair very wavy, and maybe even curly!

Sunsilk has conditioners too, if you're wondering.

You would have to get a permanent. A spiral prem works best when scrunching hair. But I would make sure you get it done by a good beautician.

You can't. Scrunching brings out the curl, and wave in your hair. Not Gives you curly/wavy hair.

I need a hairstyle that makes me look older?



I am 25 and starting my career. The one I have is not up to par and I'm beginning to go on some job interviews. I have very long, straight, dark hair (as long as Lauren Conrads and Audrena's color) with side swipe bangs. When I curl it, it looks really good but it's still too much hair and makes me look like a little girl.



I have an appointment to get it cut next Thursday and I could really use some opinions. I would look really bad with short hair and have an oval face. Any suggestions on some styles that would help me look like I'm in my 30's? I am an intelligent woman but and I would really like to be taken seriously.



Thanks! OH....and pictures would help out a lot!

If you like your hair, don't cut it. If you would like to look more professional - wear it up. Keeping hair away from the face so it will not detract from you. I know appearance is important but try working on your wardrobe. Putting on a great suit does way more for you than a cute cut. And as hard as it is loose the 20 something vibe by buying outfits that are not for 20 somethings.

<question>



Hairstyles for girls to answer?



Should I get long or short hair, as I have no idea what girls prefer. When I say long it's not really long just not short or spikey. What do you think?
