Is corporal punishment in school effective?



I have recently taken custody (6 months ago) of my ten year old twin siblings ( boy and girl). They are very, very badly behaved and have never been disciplined by there mother. They never do anything they are told and have frequently been in trouble with the police. So much so it's gotten to the point none of the local police have to ask the twins where they live because they already know. I've tried everything from time outs, grounding and taking away every privilege all at once, nothing has yet worked. I've also tried positive reinforcement techniques and taken them to a specialist, the specialist refuses to see them now after a number of incidents. But she did suggest a behavioural correction boarding school, but I'm unsure because they still use corporal punishment.



Would this be effective?



At this rate the twins are going to end up in juvenile detention, they're seriously out of control.

Well if the specialist suggested it them it probably will work for the twins. Look at it this way..what's better for the twins a sore bottom or ending up in prison a few years down the line. I was sent to a behaviour correction boarding school and yes they used corporal punishment and you know what?  It worked, I was 8 at the time and very much like the twins, my mother couldn't cope so she sent me to the school. The first time I got my butt warmed I thought nothing of it. But after a month the school got my mothers permission to use corporal punishment more on me and After a few months I started toeing the line because I knew what was coming if I didn't. I was given a consequence for my actions and I didn't like it so I behaved. I graduated after 6 months but as soon as I went home I was back to my usual self so mother sent me back again for a 1.5 years and it worked. I think I've turned out great, I'm not prefect but I respect authority a lot more and I haven't been in trouble with the police since. The teacher at schools like this are highly trained, they will have counsellors and therapist and it's not simply a case of getting hit and that's the end of it. It was a long process and you do get plenty of warnings to modify you're behaviour. Just do what you think is best.

If they're out of control at 10 then it's going to be far worse when they become teenagers and the hormones start to kick in. Behavioural correction boarding school seems tough, but it may make them appreciate what they have at home, and it's better now then in 10 years time them being in jail and seeing what tough really is! Our parents received corporal punishment and that generation doesn't seem nearly as disrespectful as the current one, and it's not like they're going to use it without justification, so it really depends on what the twins want (that is by their behaviour). If they choose to behave appropriately then they will not get punished, and if they choose not to then they will learnt the hard way. Tough love!

would something like a boot camp for the two of them be a good idea for 3 or 4 weeks to get them back to go again so when they come back to you they will understand better what you are doing for them i believe these boot camps have excellent and highly experienced counsellors that would have an arsenal of techniques to hand to give the twins a fresh start with you

I guess you must be in USA because its unlawful in UK.  If you can, send them quick before they do some real damage to someone else, themselves or, worst of all, you! I think you have done everything you can and you have been very good to these kids. The sooner they learn this the better.  Good luck, I'm sure one day they will thank you for it,

corporal punishment uses violence, if the kids are out of control using violence means you'll get violence back from them. beating kids has always worked two ways:
a. they become submissive and realize they've done wrong
b. they take the punishment and lash back with more than what you did to them.



corporal punishment is not a solution, because you don't really know if the kids are really bad or not. they may be out of control, but it may be cause they don't know why society has set forth strict rules they (and everyone else) must submit to. if you use violence or introduce violence to them, then they may believe society is using violence against them and lash back at society with violence, which will worsen the problem.



i think they need to be evaluated to find why they are so badly behaved. do they believe that he world is theirs and they can do anything they want? or is there some other reason- rebellion, refusal to go with the flow, etc. assessing the real problem may give insight as what to do and how to do it.

beating kids is bad. if you beat the wrong person they will do anything to get back at you for it. some people will get pushed too far and react back violently to the violence given to them.

In this case I would say, yes it would. If you've exhausted every other method, you have no other option. My guess it that it will work, it'll shock them so much but at first I would be willing to put money on them rebelling against it. Have you first tried spanking them? If you can do it at home it may be better then sending them away to a school. When they get into trouble separate them, make one go an sit in a different room because no doubt they will stir each other up. I would say give them three warnings to change there behaviour and if they don't tell them you will spank them. 
Make one sit in there bedroom and one sit in another. Take 10 minutes to calm down and go to one of them. Tell them what what they did wrong and why they shouldn't do it and then spank him/her. Afterwards again tell him/her what they did wrong and how they can avoid future spankings.  Then tell then to stay in their room for while to compose themselves and think about what they've done. And go and do the same to the other twin. Always ask for an apology and if they did something that made a mess, make them clean it up. If it fails then the school will probably be a last resort, but at the end of the day and red behind has got to be better then prison.
