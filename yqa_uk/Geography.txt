and you get onto a plane at 1pm but you have no idea where you are going.



you arrive at the unknown destination and you see that you have travelled for 10 hours.



Your watch now says 11pm.



but the clocks where you have arrived say 5:30 and it's evening.



what reasoning would you use to figure out what part of the world you might be in?

If you traveled for 10 hours, it's 11 pm by your home time zone, as you said. If the clocks say it's 5:30, and it's evening, it's 5:30 pm, so your current time zone is your home time zone -5:30. PST is UTC-8. Your new time zone is UTC-13:30. Since that's less than UTC-12, it's actually UTC+1:30, which doesn't exist. The closest real "half" time zone is Iran, which is UTC+3:30. If it was 5:30 the NEXT day, the time zone would be UTC+10:30 which DOES exist. Lord Howe Island Standard Time or ACDT (Australian Central Daylight Time: Broken Hill, New South Wales and South Australia).



Edit: "Perhaps a new island has surfaced and you're the only one living on it?"



Umm...where'd the clock come from and how did a jet capable of transcontinental flight land on this newly emerged volcanic island?

If you arrive somewhere where the difference between their time and your watch's time is 5.5 hrs, since the clock there is reading 5:30pm (&lt;11pm), you also know that in Seattle now it's 11pm.  Also, 10hrs ago in this destination it was 7:30am.  So when it is 1pm in Seattle, it's 7:30am in this destination, X.  X is not Hawaii or Alaska, as they only lag by 1 or 2 hrs from Seattle, and the Eastern Pacific time (New Zealand, Japan) is about 18hrs ahead of Seattle, so you're somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean still sitting on a ship!  Perhaps a new island has surfaced and you're the only one living on it? :)  But that's only if it's 5:30pm the same day as the one on your watch when your watch says 11pm.  If, however, the 5:30pm is of the next day already, then that's 18.5 hrs ahead of your original time zone so that'd most likely be the eastern coast of Japan/Indonesia/Australia/New Zealand.  I don't know what that timezone is called but that's where you would be in that case.



So, depending on what day it is in both zones (the one you departed from and the one you're in now), you're either in the middle of the Pacific or on the east coast of one of those countries that borders the Pacific.

What speed & direction are you travelling from your departure point? Without the rest of the info it would be just a guess. Perhaps the clock at you final destination is not working!

Why might a river not fit the '3 course model' typically linked with rivers? ?



I've taken loads of measurements of the dimensions of a local river of mine like velocity, gradient, channel width and depth etc. And they all increase as i get further down the river but im struggling to find a reason of why the velocity is increasing when the '3 course model' i was taught in school says that it should be getting slower. The same is witht the gradient shouldn't that be getting smaller as well?

A river in its lower reaches may appear to be flowing slowly, and many text books suggest that it is. However, this 'slowness' is often an illusion and your measurements bear this out. Textbooks often recycle errors and in many cases it is due to lazy or sloppy authorship.

The source has much more information, but this is basically what you asked for. The numbers are for 1992, 1997, and 2002 respectively.



Percent with farming as their primary occupation: 53.0, 47.8, 57.7
Men (persons): 40,338, 44,922, 42,644
Women (persons): 3,599, 4,571, 4,839



Err...that's actually "principle farm operators," not the total population in farming. Let me look some more.



This is better. 2000 census data.



Farmers and farm managers:
Total: 773,218 0.6%
Men: 661,288 1.0%
Women: 111,930 0.2%

In the popular imagination lost cities were real, prosperous, well-populated areas of human habitation that fell into terminal decline and whose location was later lost. Most known lost cities have been studied extensively by scientists. Abandoned urban sites of relatively recent origin might be referred to as ghost towns, although this term is more usually restricted to examples in the north American frontier. This article however includes places where people lived that were important local centres, without applying a specific test of size.



Lost cities generally fall into three broad categories: those whose disappearance has been so complete that no knowledge of the city existed until the time of its rediscovery and study, those whose location has been lost but whose memory has been retained in the context of myths and legends, and those whose existence and location have always been known, but which are no longer inhabited. The search for such lost cities by European adventurers in the Americas, Africa and in Southeast Asia from the 15th century onwards eventually led to the development of the science of archaeology

continental divide-An imaginary geographic line defined by the fact that water poured on one side of it would ultimately flow into the ocean on one side of a continent, while water poured on the other side of the line would flow into the ocean on the other side of the continent.



In North America, the continental divide is located in the Rocky Mountains.



# North America has four continental divides:



* The Great Divide, also called the Continental Divide separates the watersheds of the Pacific Ocean from those of the Atlantic or Arctic Oceans. It runs from the Seward Peninsula in Alaska, through western Canada along the crest of the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico. From there, it follows the crest of Mexico's Sierra Madre Occidental and extends to the tip of South America. It is crossed by the Panama Canal.



* The Northern Divide, or Laurentian Divide, separates the watershed of the Atlantic Ocean from that of the Arctic Ocean.



* The St. Lawrence Seaway Divide separates the Great Lakes Basin from the rest of the Atlantic Ocean watershed. Two canals cross the divide: The Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal crosses the Chicago Portage and connects Lake Michigan to the Mississippi River watershed. The Erie Canal connects Lake Erie to the Hudson River watershed.



* The Eastern Continental Divide separates the watershed of the Gulf of Mexico from the Atlantic Ocean. It runs from northern Pennsylvania down the Appalachian Mountains to the tip of Florida, dividing the Atlantic from the Gulf of Mexico. The city of Atlanta sits atop this divide.

It's where the elevation of a continent tends to decrease. There are several in the U.S., but the "Great Divide" in the Rockies is the main one. The direction rivers flow is part of the definition of a continental divide. To be concise (and try not to be wrong), here's Wikipedia's definition:



"A continental divide is a line of elevated terrain which forms a border between two watersheds such that water falling on one side of the line eventually travels to one ocean or body of water, and water on the other side travels to another, generally on the opposite side of the continent. Because the exact border between bodies of water is usually not clearly defined, the continental divide is not always definite for any continent (The International Hydrographic Organization's publication Limits of Oceans and Seas defines exact boundaries of oceans, but it is not universally recognized). Moreover, some rivers empty into inland seas, and thus do not end up in the oceans."



The source lists the other continental divides in North America and on the other continents.

Yes, there is more than one continental divide in the USA.  Most people don't realize that the Red River between Minnesota and North Dakota runs north and empties into Hudson Bay, part of the Artic Ocean.  That creates a divide between the Artic and the Atlantic Oceans.  The divide runs through Sisseton, South Dakota.



There are many sub-divides in the USA between major rivers.  The Arkansas, Colorado, South Platte and Rio Grande all originate within a few miles of each other in the Colorado Rockies.  Yet the divides between these rivers run for many miles to the Mississippi or the Gulf of Mexico.



The Mississippi drains much of the central USA, but the Great Lakes all flow into the St. Lawrence River.

I can only confirm what everyone else has said already:

Israel - Judaism....and then add:

The star in the middle is 6 pointed and known as the star of David after the character who killed Goliath in the Bible and who was the second king of the united Kingdom of Israel.  He is thought to have been the author of many of the Psalms still used today in both Judaism and Christianity.  There is a very famous painting of David slaying Goliath in the Prado art gallery in Madrid which was painted by Caravaggio (my favourite artist, incidentally) in around 1600 ad and which is well worth travelling to see (as is most of the art work in the Prado....).

I can see where she is coming from. The accepted terminology now is Australia and Oceania, or Australia/Oceania, to sweep up all those annoying bits of land that don't quite fit into Asia or Antarctica.

The Continents of the World
Africa, the Americas, Antarctica, Asia, Australia together with Oceania, and Europe are considered to be Continents.

Australia/Oceania.



Collectively it then combines all of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, as well as the thousands of coral atolls and volcanic islands of the South Pacific Ocean, including the Melanesia and Polynesia groups.



Oceania also includes Micronesia, a widely scattered group of islands that run along the northern and southern edges of the Equator.

This is a very Theoretical question.  Geography is the total sum of the shape, size and makeup of our planet, solar system, Galaxy and Universe.  It measures size and shape of individual items, and distance between two places.  It IS an all inclusive form of Science that has many different smaller parts that make up what we know about the world we live in.

New ZeAland is in the Southern Hemisphere, southeast of Australia.  It is not part of any continent.  Some people consider it part of the "continent" Oceania; but Oceania is a continent-sized geographical region, not a true continent.

your best bet is to get onto the local Council...or even Herts County Council...they might have some information for you...especially in the Enviromental Health Department.

Herts County Record Office too will have info on the area i would think.

Hello again :)

I have found nice site, unfortunatelly in POlish that give you daily raport about air pollution in biggest cities in Poland
http://cas1.poznan.wios.gov.pl/iseo/
u can also take raport roczny (yearly raport) or raport monthly (monthly raport)
First you give peremtr and later choose a city (for exampliethe biggest here is Poznan :) )
then u click POKAZ and they give u result (godzina means hour- the measure every hour)

Later of course wikipedia
http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanieczyszc... for enviroment pollution
http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanieczyszc... for air pollution
Unfortunately also in polish, but mainly parameters are clear

<answer>



<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Voters</evaluation>



Longitude are the 'vertical' lines on a map and imaginary lines on the earth used to calculate distance east or west. Greenwich village near London is thought of as the central point (0 degrees).



Latitude are the 'horizontal' lines - they are used to calculate distance north or south of the equator (a line of latitude around the 'middle' of the world - 0 degrees).

Since the earth is round, only part of it can be in sunlight at once. Think of it like a football. if you have a torch shining at a football, the part facing the torch will be brightest (day) whereas the part facing away will be dark (night). 
The earth spins on its axis (imagine the football turning) so every point on the football will (at different times) see the torch way off to the side(the 'sun' is low in the 'sky' -&gt; morning ), then to high (when it faces the torch), and then to the other side (evening).
When the sun is 'lowest' in the sky the shadows it causes will be longest. This is where sundials come into play. The shadow created by the arrow of the sundial points to a different number (the time) as the day moves on.



I know I probably make no sense but it's kinda hard to describe..

P.S. A hemisphere is half of a sphere (if you chopped an orange in half). When we talk about the earth's hemispheres we mean The half of the world north of the equator and the half below it.

Mass transporation.  Before the railways came in the early 1800s the average person in the UK never went more than seven miles from home.  These days it's pretty hard to find someone who hasn't visited at least one other country.  You could argue that that's made the world a "smaller" place.

use code d454000

OR If your prepay you get a discount..though no refund if you return early. Usually they will NOT upgrade you free...but sometimes they do.

If you can rent off airport it is usually cheaper.

Also can try Priceline

Or hotwire.
Hotwire can be really cheap..but you don't know the car rental company name up front. This is a prepaid. Worked great.

Tajmahal is one of the
great wonders of the World.

Taj Mahal, the pinnacle of Mughal architecture, was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-1658), grandson of Akbar the great, in the memory of his queen Arjumand Bano Begum, entitled ‘Mumtaz Mahal’. Mumtaz Mahal was a niece of empress Nur Jahan and granddaughter of Mirza Ghias Beg I’timad-ud-Daula, wazir of emperor Jehangir. She was born in 1593 and died in 1631, during the birth of her fourteenth child at Burhanpur. Her mortal remains were temporarily buried in the Zainabad garden. Six months later, her body was transferred to Agra to be finally enshrined in the crypt of the main tomb of the Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is the mausoleum of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan.

It is a symbol of imperialism, slavery and colonisation.  It was built by muslim warlords and mughal imperialists who colonised and enslaved the noble people of the Indian subcontinent and forced many to convert to Islam.  Indians should deplore the Taj Mahal as being a symbol of oppression and slavery but instead they glorify the Taj mahal as being the symbol of India.

Geography
A satellite image of the Sahara; the world's largest hot desert and second largest desert after Antarctica.



Deserts take up about one third of the Earth's land surface.[1] They usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures, and low nighttime temperatures (due to extremely low humidity). The temperature in the daytime can reach 45 °C/113 °F or higher in the summer, and dip to 0 °C/32°F or lower in the winter. Water acts to trap infrared radiation from both the sun and the ground, and dry desert air is incapable of blocking sunlight during the day or trapping heat during the night. Thus, during daylight most of the sun's heat reaches the ground, and as soon as the sun sets the desert cools quickly by radiating its heat into space. Urban areas in deserts lack large (more than 14 °C/25 °F) daily temperature variations, partially due to the urban heat island effect.



Many deserts are formed by rain shadows; mountains blocking the path of precipitation to the desert. Deserts are often composed of sand and rocky surfaces. Sand dunes called ergs and stony surfaces called hamada surfaces compose a minority of desert surfaces. Exposures of rocky terrain are typical, and reflect minimal soil development and sparseness of vegetation.
The snow surface at Dome C Station in Antarctica is a representative of the majority of the continent's surface.



Bottomlands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Cold deserts (also known as polar deserts) have similar features, except the main form of precipitation is snow rather than rain. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert (composed of about 98 percent thick continental ice sheet and 2 percent barren rock). Some of the barren rock is to be found in the so-called Dry Valleys of Antarctica that almost never get snow, which can have ice-encrusted saline lakes that suggest evaporation far greater than the rare snowfall due to the strong katabatic winds that evaporate even ice.



The largest hot desert is the Sahara.



Deserts sometimes contain valuable mineral deposits that were formed in the arid environment or that were exposed by erosion. Due to extreme and consistent dryness, some deserts are ideal places for natural preservation of artifacts and fossils.

Yes, the main one is the Gobi Desert but mainly after the summer. But the Mojave  also gets cold in the winter as do some other ones as well.
A desert is defined as an arid area.
Now you can look these up in the dictionary and/or on line.
In the future do your own homework.

Desert, because it doesn't have water, have high fluctuation in temperature in day and night. water absorbs heat due to bi polar property.  It was go below zero. and deserts are created by lack of plants and droughts. therefore there is nothing to hold the ground together.  but i don't think there are any famous desert the way we think a desert is.  so if

Yes! Antartica is actually a desert. The definition of desert is a place with a lack of rain, snow, etc (precipitation)- not by whether a place is hot or cold.
