What did you think of Rafa`s performance against Gonzalez?



I thought he played extremely well. He was very aggressive from the start, hit stunning winners :) his passing shots their always a thrill to watch ;) hehe What i notice though was how accurately he was serving, i really feel if he keeps this type of play up going into the US Open he has a great chance of succeeding on that surface :) I think he is definitely improved on this type of fast hardcourt surface, he takes the ball earlier and plays more up court, who thinks he has a good chance of getting to the finals at the US ?! (dont want to get ahead of myself, but i really think his game is looking solid) especially on his least favourite surface :) !

You're right. He played very well, made like 2 unforced errors in the first set, and when he won the first set he completely went all out. He served pretty well. I think he can win the US Open, now having the confidence to beat this years favorite Novak Djokovic and now he can take out guys that beat him before like Youzhny and Ferrer. I hope he wins!

Yeah he played really well :).  He had Gonzalez running all over the court lol.  His serve was really solid and Gonzalez only got break point cause Rafa stopped concentrating for a couple of minutes hehe !  His forehand and backhand are both amazing, he doesn't have a weak shot :) !!  He is looking in great shape for the US Open :).  If he keeps playing like this, he's gonna win the US :D !!

Well Rafa has officially taken over the top spot at both #1 and as the King of Tennis. Rafa Rey has proven what a solid all court, all surface player he is. He has won 38 of his last 39 matches again proving his dominance in the sport. Great to see him beat Djoker and now Gonzalez along with all his other opponents along the way to Olympic Gold.

Nice also to see the old King still has game winning Gold in the Men's Doubles with his understudy Stan Wawrinka. I say give Roger till next year to get back to his top form. Rafa will win both the USO and the AO so that he can have a Golden Slam since he is so deserving of one.



Novak will never win a Grand Slam or an Olympic Gold as long as he plays which should make many people happy.

Vamos Rafa Rey!

It was brilliant. He knows exactly what shot to make and is so accurate especially with drop shots and his serve is improving particually with the spin he's using. It is great to see him improving on hardcourts- he can't just be a clay speciallist now! I think his chances in the US Open depend on his health. He's never got past quarters before, as he is a player who puts so much energy into every match and must be feeling drained by now. I was pleased that he didn't have so much trouble with his knees- Wimbledon was scay! He should be able to do it though, his confidence must be increasing now he is about to be NO.1!!!. It's great to see matches won by someone so humble.

Originally it was 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, which makes a bit more sense. 60 is a nice round number, the same as the number of minutes in an hour. It goes back several hundred years, so it’s kind of been lost.

Later, "forty-five" was abbreviated to "forty", which is faster to say.

I think Federer needs a coach...he has been coaching himself for most of his career and it has paid off, but now he is lacking in confidence and needs help....I think he will perform badly over the next few months unless he takes active steps to improve things.
I can see Novak becoming No.2 and I think Murray is on his way up and could end up as no.3.....I quite fancy Murray for the Olympics.

I believe that he will carry on trying his best. Unfortunately, it seems that Mr Nadal is doing better at the moment. Sometimes sportsmen/women come up against someone who is just at their peak performance and there is very little that can be done to overcome this. He is still an exceptional athlete and folk should remember this. He will have nothing to be ashamed of if he doesn't come first in every tournament....

Roger is at a loss of confidence. if he can somehow get over this i'm sure he will play at his best. however, i think the only way he can get over this confidencell is by winning a tournament, which frankly at the moment seems pretty much impossible.

I think everyone is writing him off too soon.  I don't see Novak overtaking him as #2 tbh :).  Not in the near future anyway.  I think he will get to the semi's defo in the US Open but maybe not the final :-).  Rafa is playing a class ahead of both Roger and Novak right now (well not in Cincinnati lol) so lets hope he keeps it up :)

I'm not sure if Rog will bounce back this year or if we will have to wait till 2009 but I am sure he will be back. I know he cares more than any other player about the Olympics, and he seems to do well in things he really cares about. So hopefully this will help him put on a good show. Same with the US Open, can't see him getting upset early there. Dunno if he will win it, have to see at the time.



People who say Federer will never be back amaze me. Have they honestly never watched sports in their life? Teams and players have slumps of form all the time, entire teams lose confidence and then come back to win again. Nobody doubts them. Fed has been number one in the world consecutivly for longer than anyone else by a long way. Sampras and Agassi lost their number 1s alot longer and got them back. Why do people like to think Roger won't do the same? Its ridiclous. His talent hasn't actually gone anywhere, hes playing a bit worse at the mo. But its form. Remember when everyone was going on and on about Novak at the start of the year cos he was awesome. It was form- look at him now, a normal, non-amazing player. A solid number 3. The same will happen to Nadal. But they come back. Thats what sport is.

I believe he will win a medal in Beijing, just not the gold. Nadal, Djokovic and Murray have better chances for the gold. As for the US Open, the key is for Roger to make it to the second week. If he does, he could win the whole thing as he becomes real confident once he is in a quarterfinal in a best of 5 format. He has reached the finals of 12 of the last 13 Grand Slam tournaments! And the one he missed, he was playing with mono! He will be the No.2 seed with most of the media buzzing over Nadal, Djokovic and now Murray. I would still pick Djokovic as the favorite for the US Open but Federer comes a close second, followed by Nadal and Murray.



He will comfortably end the year as No.2. Chances are higher that he will take over the No.1 ranking next year (albeit briefly) than Djokovic passing him for No.2. There is just too much talent left in the tank and he is not even 27 yet. He will be competing hard for the next 2-3 years to be the best. Only thing, it won't be near as easy as before.

There are 4 grand slams as you may know. They are the AUSTRALIAN OPEN, THE FRENCH OPEN, WIMBLEDON, and THE US OPEN.

-The Australian Open is held in Melbourne, Australia in January. It is the first grand slam of the year. It consists of a new rebound ace surface. It can be dangerous to some players because you can trip on it quite easily. The ball bounces slow and higher than faster hard courts do.

-The French Open is held from May to June. It is held in Paris, France. Being the second grand slam of the year, the surface is red clay courts. The ball bounces even slower and higher than the rebound ace, and gives an advantage to topspin players. You can also slide on this surface to cover more balls easily.

-Wimbledon is the third grand slam of the year and is held in London, England. It goes from June to July. The surface is grass courts. The ball bounces lower and faster, giving a disadvantage to topspin players and an advantage to people who hit the ball flat. Also, serves are more penetrating on this surface. Yes you get to play on real grass....

-The US Open is held in Flushing Meadows, New York and is the final grand slam of the year. The surface consists of faster hard courts than the Australian Open, bouncing lower and faster similar to grass courts. It gives people almost the same advantages as grass.

Speed up the courts again?



I'm an avid tennis fan and as much as i love clay court tennis and watching baseline out smart each other, i think that an effort has to be made to speed up the "faster" hard courts and especially the grass at wimbledon. Look at all the best rivalries in the history of tennis, they have mainly been between a baseliner and a serve and vollier. mcenroe-borg, mcenroe-connors, mcenroe-lendl, Agassi-Sampras etc. The contrast in styles was what used to make tennis enthralling, now the main rivalries are between attacking baseliners and defensive baseliners. Wouldn't you like to see nadal square off against people like pat rafter, sampras and edberg? Speed up the courts again? opinions please.

I think slowing down the grass courts at Wimbledon was a mistake. The fast surface was special to Wimbledon and required a certain type of skill and playing style to be successful there.



People still refer to Wimbledon as the fastest courts around but something tells me that's no longer the case. We lost something special when they decided to make the grass slow.

I agree, Wimbledon was such a special tournament that the organisers managed to make less attractive.

there is really no need to speed up the courts.. they can be fast enough, especially with everyone hitting much harder then what players use to do...

also, players can still be serve and volleyers on any type of surface, or they can choose to stay at the baseline.. they can still have whatever of style of play they want..

speed of the court is not everything..

I would say that the grass courts shud b a little faster, u cannot speed up clay, the US open is fast and Australian open had been on the slow side as far as the hard court goes but the aussie open was never the fastest.

The one grand slam l always found dull and monotonous was Wimbledon.In the last few years,l have never enjoyed Wimbledon as much as now (l have been watching for 35 years) There are now rallies,and more service breaks,and women are hitting very well also.
The reason for this is the slower balls,slightly longer grass,but the real reason is the plethora of clay courters from Europe and South America,who insist on more rallying.Thank god the Americans and Australians are gone with their crash,bang wallop tennis of old.l truly detest Rafter/Sampras/Edberg/Lendle/Becker...du... dull dull
