<question>



Why do you think it is wrong to eat meat?



I do not understand why its like this. That so many vegetarians will lecture people who do eat meat and say that we are murderers. Why is it okay for other animals to hunt, kill and eat another animal but its so damn wrong for us as humans to do the same natural thing and consume another animal. Human beings are animals too. I don't see how that makes sense. How are we any different from the other animals eating those of another species?



We humans are animals too and well it just makes so sense to me why some people throw fits over people who do eat meat. Personally I do eat meat but in moderation and I make sure what I consume was killed as humanly possible.



I don't see a lion making sure its pry died painlessly. Although yes it is true some of these poor animals were tortured. Thus why I never like eating awful fast food. I just think what we do as humans is natural needless to say I think our teeth prove that we were made to be omnivores!



If meat is murder then so is the natural order and food chain.

i don't think it is "wrong" to eat meat, and clearly humans are omnivores



but one vegetarian argument would be that humans also have compassion unlike other animals, and should attempt not to cause the suffering of fellow creatures.



you said yourself that you avoid fast food because "some of these poor animals were tortured". you have answered your own question. but, is there really evidence that fast food meat includes more tortured animals than other meat? this seems like a dubious claim.



and yes, clearly the whole food chain is murder if you accept the "meat is murder" slogan. again, the difference would be that humans have a capacity for compassion and conscience.

Is it unethical to eat meat? In my opinion hunting your own meat is more preferable to shop bought meat. Whilst hunting is not something I would do myself, there is less suffering involved, the animal hasn't been pumped with growth promoters, and the animal has lived a natural life outdoors. (At least wild animals have felt the earth beneath their feet and the sun on their backs unlike the animals in factory farms). So in that regard, I wouldn't oppose... However, I AM firmly against killing animals for ''fun'' or ''entertainment'' though.



Some animals NEED to eat meat, like lions. It's the natural way.  But raising animals for food on factory farms is different. Slaughterhouses are not 'natural'. In addition to that, biologically speaking the human body doesn't require meat to function optimally. Animals that are raised for human consumption are destined for a premature gruesome death. People can be vegetarian for a number of reasons. Some do it for reasons unrelated to ethics, like health or environmental concerns.

I agree, we are animals and animals kill for meat.



Here is a scientific reason why humans should eat meat and that is, if we were meant to JUST eat veggies, then we would have our eyes on the side of our heads.
Have you seen animals that are just herbivores, like rabbits, they have their eyes on the side of the their head, b/c they don't need to have them in the front b/c they don't need to track animals.  All omnivores and carnivores have their eyes in the front which are able to track animals.  We have canines (even though not as pronounced as our ancestors), but we do have them for tearing meat.  Humans are animals, we eat meat.  If people rather not eat animals then let them go ahead and do so. But I am tired of hearing people that are vegans telling those that aren't that we are horrible people for eating animals.  Thats the one thing i dont like, they are putting their beliefs on others.

i have a funny (maybe) story to share: i have a very, very old neighbor here that says she won't never eat meat. all she eats all the time are just vegetables. even fish she won't eat.
here is what i did: i cooked some kind of food (just don't know in English), a combination of bean sprouts, carrots, onions, string beans, shrimp and grind meat (pork). i cut the ingredients into small and tiny pieces and mixed them all, then wrap it with a paperwrap (edible) and fry it. i brought some for the old woman and she ate telling it tastes so good. and they told me that it is the first time that this old woman ate meat but she didn't know i mixed it with meat and no one told her so.
*i think, vegetarians if they don't see the real meat and doesn't know the taste, i guess they coud eat too. just like Muslims who said that they won't eat "pigs" (pork) but i knew some here in my country Muslims eating pork and they love it. so i don't know really what made them believe so...
NB* no offense to any Muslim reader or vegetarian.

The very act of killing for food is no longer necessary unless you are dirt poor and must hunt or you call the Arctic home.  If it's not necessary for health or happiness then why cause needless violence?



We should think of the reasons why humans in Western Society kill and eat what they do.  What is the reason that most eat cows, pigs, poultry, and fish?  The reason is because it's (A) an easy target and they're easy to catch and hold by farmers and (B) because we keep a separation between ourselves and these animals.  If we kept these animals as our pets we undoubtedly would feel differently about them.  But why give dogs, cats, horses, mentally disabled humans, and infants a reprieve?  Aren't they just the same in suffering capacity as the food animals that we eat?  The only reason we don't eat them is because of a cultural barrier that tells us not too, but when you think about it, it's no different.



If a being is born into the world, I believe it has an inalienable right to live it's full life free of shackles, suffering, pain, isolation, and slaughter.

It would be impossible for me to choose my fave, but l like anything tofu. Like this recipe:



Scrambled tofu and grilled tomatoes - piled on thick granary toast



Take 285g / 10oz regular firm tofu, 15ml / ½floz vegetable oil, 50g / 2oz onion, finely diced, ½ small red pepper, finely diced, 1 small carrot grated, turmeric, shoyu and freshly ground black pepper.



Drain the tofu and mash it, or crumble by hand. Heat the oil and sauté the vegetables until soft. Add the crumbled tofu and sufficient turmeric to give an attractive colour. Season with shoyu and pepper to taste. Serve hot. Yummy!

You will probably loose some weight.  If you have allergies or get sick often you will find that these aren't problems anymore.  If you have a chronically stuffed nose or congested throat and chest, these will most likely clear up.



I haven't been sick since I cut out animal products nearly 2 years ago (not that it won't ever happen but it's great).

Raising a vegetarian child?



Both my husband and I are vegetarians, and have been for over 8 years. We have a baby, who has started eating solids. We're wondering about raising her a vegetarian and if there are any health risks. I know some people are going to say, oh it's pushing your beliefs on your kid, but really, isn't forcing a kid to eat meat, pushing beliefs?
I never ate meat while being pregnant, and she was born 8lbs 2oz, the doctors, nurses, everyone pointed out how alert she was right away. Also her manner is very pleasant. So there isn't any downfalls that I have seen now.



I'm wondering if there are other supplements she will need, and how soon can she start eating beans, soy, etc? Like after 12 months?
Any POSITIVE help would be great! Thank's so much!



Side note: I don't need any vegetarian haters to respond, so leave it for someone else. I'm looking for real answers.

Sam G- of course you're going to see eating meat as natural. That's all you've ever known, that's what most of society has ever known.
Then why have some cultures been continuously born and raised as vegetarians?  Wouldn't that be considered normal to them?

There are some really great books that can help you with vegetarian nutrition. It is perfectly healthy to raise your child as a vegetarian, as long as you are properly balancing her diet. Even the American dietetic association and the Dietitians of Canada state that a vegetarian diet is perfectly healthy for all stages of life(1).

Good job on sticking to your morals for so long =D



Congrats on having a kid.



As long as you balance her meals she can be a vegetarian.



Give her all vegetables and fruits and nuts and seeds and make sure she's eating them.



Supplements are unnatural and unnecessary.



I would give her soy as soon as possible. but you should alway talk to her doctor. and make sure you go to a doctor that isn't against vegetarians but knows what's good for the kid.

Raise her as a vegetarian. I can't be that complicated. There are some people that raise their kids as vegans. Just remember to teach her how to keep herself healthy and about vegetarian nutrition. You should also talk to a doctor about what to feed her at this age.

Sam G- I think the couple was actually in Scotland, not England and they were vegan not vegetarian. The girl's death was from a vit d deficiency, so she had a serious medical condition which her parents didn't notice.The consensus in the broadsheets was that her death was linked to the parents neglecting her, not the fact of them being vegans. I think any diet needs to be carefully thought out and vegans can be healthy just as omnivores can be healthy. (Though personally, I cannot abide the thought of drinking the pus filled contents of a cow's breast- yuck!)



Also, Sam G, 'modern' society is just a code for 'western'. We don't always know best in the west! Not all civilisations eat meat, lots of Indians don't and I'm sure there are hundreds others if one reads a little about the world....I've had excellent vegetarian cuisine in Thailand for example.



OP- I've not heard of any risks.I think the child will be fine with the fish, seafood, yoghurts, cheese, milk, eggs, nuts, beans,pulses, fruits and veg that you will give her/him. Those foods cover everything we need don't they? Good luck and hope everything turns out well!

In all honesty humans need some nutrients found in meat.  So unless you're making sure to supplement your child's diet with these nutrients naturally found in a normal human diet, then your child will have development issues.  There was a case in England recently where a vegetarian couple did that and the child ended up severely malnourished.  Make sure you do extensive research before doing anything like that.  And to say that eating meat is a "belief" system is amusing.  It's natural.  Any human culture (even those not touched by modern society) eat meat as a normal way of surviving.  It is your choice not to eat meat, but eating meat isn't a belief system.  It's natural.

All dairy cheese contains lactose.  In order to avoid it you should try soy, veggie, or rice cheese which is available at most supermarkets and health food stores.  You will probably be able to find it near the health food section and meat alternatives.

Lactose-



1. A disaccharide, C12H22O11, found in milk, that may be hydrolyzed to yield glucose and galactose.



2. A white crystalline substance obtained from whey and used in infant foods, bakery products, confections, and pharmaceuticals as a diluent and excipient. Also called milk sugar.



cheese is made from milk and bacterial cultures  (gross to think about, but tastes sooooo good ^_^) heated and left to settle, pressed into shapes if you like.

Yes Lactose is the "sugar" in Milk it also has Casein the protein in milk.
That being said If you are Lactose intolerant there are alternatives, Veggie based cheeses R ice, Soy, Almond read the label to make sure they do not have lactose most do have Casein.

Margarine is usually milk free,,read the label. be aware many margarines add milk for more flavor.



Butter is sometimes well tolerated those with Lactose allergies. I was told because the butter fat(which butter is made) is different than the whole of milk.  You are going to have to do trial & error on this. Stay off all dairy for a few weeks then 1 at a time over a 3 day period add each of the products you want to use back in your diet.  Example 3 days using butter. Stop then try it again. Note your reactions: tummy ache, gas,other tummy distress, running nose, congestion etc.

I rarely talk about why I don't eat animal products on Yahoo because there's a fine line between informing people and being condescending, but since you asked, I'll be willing to share.



Vegans do not consume milk, meat, or eggs (or any animal derived product) because..



-Meat involves killing animals (usually en mass) for human beings to eat. The conditions on factory farms are far less than desirable and animals are treat like meat machines rather than sentient beings



-Purchasing "battery hen" eggs supports an institution



that cages up to nine birds together, debeaks them, and



forces them to continually lay eggs until they are calcium



-depleted and on the verge of death--at which point, they



are slaughtered.



-"Free range" hens are actually packed into houses, where they have minimal access to the outside.



-Producing even "free range" eggs



requires having fertile eggs--half of which will hatch into



male chicks (which will then be slaughtered after birth or



fed to a certain weight only to be culled as male chicks CANNOT produce eggs).



-Dairy milk (by nature) is intended as a complete food for baby calves. Humans are the only species to drink the breast milk of another species.



-Dairy cows are artificially impregnated, they become pregnant, produce milk.. and when the baby calf is born humans take the milk for human consumption, and the baby males go to veal production. Baby female cows join the dairy herd.



-Cows sometimes develop mastitis, a painful udder condition as a result of over milking



-Besides, milk is a common food allergen. A lot of people have problems digesting milk protein.

I'm vegan because animal abuses do not stop at meat.  In my opinion, dairy and egg animals have it worse than meat animals because they are worked on intensely.



Dairy cows are artificially inseminated every year.  The gestation period is like a human woman's at about 9 months.  This cycle of birth and then quick insemination is so that the cow will keep producing large quantities of milk.  Most operations will take the calf and if female, she will be raised to produce dairy, if male, will either be shot or sold to veal farms where they are raised shackled inside a box and fed an anemic-inducing liquid diet.  The calf and mother never see each other after that first day.  Dairy cows can normally live up to 25 years but dairy cows in the factory farm industry only last until the age of 4 or 5 until they are killed for meat.  YES, dairy animals are slaughtered for meat.



Almost all eggs come from farm operations that deprive hens of space, adequate food, adequate water, sunlight, and a clean environment.  Having 9 hens living in a space the size of a normal rodents cage is cruel and disgraceful.  In the US, chickens are only allowed 50 square inches of space by law.  Take an 8-1/2"x11" piece of paper and fold one end over about a third of the way.  That's how much space a hen has; smaller than a normal sheet of letter paper.  Hen beaks are sliced off so they won't peck the others to death, and their toes are clipped.  Often they undergo what is called "forced molting" where they are deprived of any light, food, and water for up to two weeks.  This is done to shock the birds' bodies into quicker egg laying cycles.  Many die from the deprivation.  Like the dairy cows, egg-laying hens are slaughtered for meat as well.

There are lots of reasons... so i'm not really sure why you are asking this... Just because you don't eat it because of "religion" doesn't mean that every other reason for being vegan is ridiculous... Other reasons can be that some people are morally opposed to eating animals..there is so much creulty in slaughter houses its becomming much easier to say no to meat, for the animals sake. And reasons for not using animal products such as fur coats and leather boots is simple, the fur and hide belong on the animal, not on a human.. Do you see animals using human meat, and human skin? No.. because it's ridiculous. The boots I buy look like they are leather, however they are not. There are other options other than just leather.

Are vegans legally allowed to adopt a child?



I'm vegan and single but financially able to provide a stable environment for a child and am considering adopting a child or baby.



My question is: Would adoption agencies have a problem if I don't have meat in my house and intend to raise the child vegan?



I heard that at first, some agencies want you to provide a weekly meal plan to them to assure that the child's nutritional needs are going to be met.



If there are any other vegans that have adopted, I'd especially like to hear your story and any struggle you've had.



Oh and please do not respond if you're only going to criticize my decision to not eat animals.

I have never heard of an adoption being denied because of a person's nutritional choices.  I suggest you be prepared with a sample meal plan that proves to them you are eating a healthy and balanced diet that does not include animal products.  Research the amount of protein the child will need and be ready to answer those questions appropriately.



I've never adopted and I'm not a vegan but I do eat meat only on occasion.  Many years ago I was licensed as a child care provider.



I had to list what I was feeding the children because I received reimbursement for that from the state.  I was feeding them tofu dogs.  The licensing people told me to simply list it as "hot dogs" since someone may have an issue with tofu.  Go figure!
Good luck to you.

I wouldn't think that would matter. But in the event that you did have to prove that he/she would get adequate nutrition, Just go over the plan with great detail, maybe talk with a nutritionist that can help you to understand what is needed for a child that has a vegan diet... make sure all your bases are covered and you can prove with out a doubt you can and will provide the best of everything for the child.

The only issue you may encounter is as an adoptive parent potentially of an infant things such as formula may be an issue, many do contain dairy or dairy by products.  Since you will be unable to breast feed you may have to be more compromising for infancy.



With an older child speak to a nutritionist, regarding balance.  The needs of a child especially a growing one are different than those of an adult.  Ensure you know how to feed a vegan child.



As long as you go into your interview with a well thought out diet paying special attention to nutritional needs at different stages of life you will be fine.



Being a vegan can be a very healthy diet if done right, you just want to ensure you are able to acheive balance within a restricted diet.

well, vegetables don't grow in sand, so yea, they are either chemically grown or fertilized, both methods seem to go against vegetarianism, but i'm sure they will come up with some excuse as to why exploiting animals to grow food is ok, or why growing them with chemicals that were probably discovered as a result of animal testing is fine, but eating them is not. go figure.

I do.



I became a vegan to reduce the amount of animal suffering I cause, and contribute to.  I hate the way animals are treated byt he meat and dairy industry, and there is an easy and practical step I can take to make sure I am not funding it, and not supporting it - going vegan.



But yes, a lot of vegetables are fertilised with animal manure.  Is there anything i can do about that? No.  in an ideal world, i would grow my own, but it could easily be argued that soil contains the reminants of dead animals anyway.  Again - nothing i can do about that.



I don't know what point you are trying to make -  "aha - vegans have to eat vegetables fertilised by animal manure, or by chemicals tested on animals, therefore being vegan is totally pointless, and i can eat my veal with a clear conscience" ?? is that it?



Vegans are simply doing all they can practically do to reduce animal suffering- i don' get why there are sad people posting increasingly ridiculous "arguments" here every day which serve no purpose, and just make it clear that they have missed the point entirely.

Are vegans using a 'fear tactic' to recruit people?



NOTE : i'm not saying that vegans or vegeterians are wrong and 'meateaters' are right. I'm purely asking about their way of recruiting. Is that right?



I was looking to turn from partly vegetarian (i eat out on sundays at restraunts and i enjoy a Chateaubriand) to completly vegeterian/vegan. SO! i looked up vegan videos who i was hoping to have some advice on youtube, and i found videos like '10 reasons meateaters are stupid' and stuff like that. I watched a few and these were their pointers of most



1. you have rotting flesh in you
(fact : food doesn't rot inside you it gets digested)



2.  meat eaters are violent cause of it



3. livestock is fed on antibiotics which makes you sick



(fact: plants are also treated the same, only it's called bug poison, you're not safe unless the soil, the water, the air is free from any type of polution to either grow plants or have livestock on that field. )



4. you have rotting carcass in your colon and that is not sexy
(i didn't know crap was sexy in any way possible.)



5. meat eaters get sick easier
(fact : no one in my family has ever gotten sick more than a headache, and i don't know anyone who was ever with a fever or in a sick condition that wasnt able to get out of bed)



6. in packages of chicken there is poop



7. humanizing animals like 'they don't want to see their family killed'. We are different for a reason, animals are based on their insticts. if you put a cow in your garden without a fence, it will eat your flowers, cause thats what their nature tells them.

You have to realize that the "angry" vegetarians and vegans are just a small percentage of the non-meat-eating group. They bring a lot of negative attention to themselves and thus stand out more. I myself am vegetarian and I have NEVER tried to gross someone out of eating meat. Life is about choices, right? I don't care if someone eats meat b/c it's their own choice. If you try to force someone into what you believe in, you're trying to take away their choices.



And yes, I believe that those "angry" vegans are trying to scare meat-eaters. To me, it's just like a religious fanatic telling a person she's going to burn in hell for eternity b/c she doesn't believe in God. It's unnecessary and pretty damn rude.



All those things you listed above as scare tactics are pretty lame.....I mean, veggies get digested, too and I agree: poop has never been sexy.

I personally think their is a small group of people who will use scare tactics to push their agenda.  You will see this in many forms, religion, eating habits, drinking alcohol, type of car you drive.  The beauty of this rock we live on is a little thing called free will.  I can do whatever I want, and it's really none of your business.  Yes there are guidelines that people must abide by and if they don't they will be punished.  But your eating habits is not one that you should be punished for.  I have a few friends who are vegan or vegetarians.  Good for them I don't say anything about it, it's their choice.  And they know me well enough not to bother trying to convince me that "meat is rotting in my colon"  It's called respect.  I respect their views and in turn they do the same.  Scare tactics are nothing more than people wanting to spread a message that isn't being heard, so they must get louder and scarier.  If they can't respect others decisions (right or wrong) then they shouldn't expect anyone to respect their need to throw a nugget of misconstrued information in the faces of people.

I  feel that anyone who can say they love animals is lying if they eat meat. THis is because all animals are creatures and that have the ability to feel, and bond. these animals are being tortured!
a lot of people mistake anger from vegetarians when it is really frustration.
i can't see how others do not see what pain these animals go threw for a pair of shoes. It's sickening and devastating that people actually will own a cat or dog and say they love them when they are being killed by the billions in china for their fur. The same fur many people wear thinking its well they don't think. all they know is it is animal fur. the video's people show is their way of getting people to pay attention to real issue's.



I am not a angry vegetarian but I am frustrated with the people who choose to ignore the abuse and horror these animals go threw in vain.

I think the videos you described use someone's opinion, being that it's not entirely fact or is exaggerated fact.



YouTube has a lot of amateur videos and anyone can post.  Most vegan organizations (but not all) try to get away from that kind tactic to show people how animals are raised.  I know that saying "meat is gross" is only going to entertain some fellow vegans but it's not going to be "recruiting" any meat-munchers.



I'm sorry I couldn't watch the videos right now but I have seen some in the past.  Some I believe to be fully legitimate but usually show the worst moments that they filmed.  Still, if the footage they show of the animals in slaughterhouses happens at all, it's too much in my opinion.



Sometimes "fear tactics" are appropriate to shock someone into becoming aware.  Or they can be used as part of a propaganda machine.  In the USA, the milk industry does this by claiming that you'll be in bad health and people will make fun of you if you don't drink "White Gold".  They also produced a commercial where an older man was mowing the lawn and his arms suddenly fell off because he wasn't a milk drinker.



Basically, it goes both ways.  However, vegetarian "propaganda" seems to make much more sense to me than propaganda put out by industries out for profit.  You have to remember that most vegetarian organizations are not selling anything.  Sure they hope for donations, but they are non-profit organizations and most money goes to advertising, fundraising for sanctuaries, protest materials, etc.



You can look through all the BS and still come to the conclusion that vegetarianism is a great choice.  And still, there are many investigative books that describe poor working conditions for humans and despicable conditions for farm animals.  These books are often backed by numerous sources and bodies of evidence.



A particularly good book to read that I feel is right on point is "Slaughterhouse" by Gail A. Eisnitz.

<question>



If vegetarians don't eat meat because it is cruel is it not cruel to walk along the street + squash insects?



Do some people not realise that it is impossible to go through life without killing other living organisms? What happens when you have a disease and you take medicine? The organisms causing your disease get killed. Does this mean that you shouldn't take medicine if you are sick?



</question>



<additional details>



Gerard - you could prevent killing insects by squashing them with your feet. Just stay indoors!



Ed - how can you say that? Are you saying that all those insects that get squashed on the car windscreen are not intelligent beings? Not to mention all the mammals that get run over on our roads? Who are you to tell which animals are intelligent and which are not? Anyway, should the life of a sheep or cow be 'worth more' than that of an innocent insect?



Don't get me wrong, i am against the intensive farming of animals and avoid buying them if i can. If farm animals were not killed for their meat would they not die out? How do we know it is not cruel to eat plants?



Calliope - I eat nearly no red meat or chicken at all and all of the fish i eat at home is caught personally by me or my partner. It seems vegetarians and other people put more value to animals like cows and sheep than they do to insects, plants and bacteria. Could it be perhaps that cows and sheep are nicer to look at?



Homo Sapiens is omnivourous, i know this because we have both molar and canine teeth. The molars are for chewing vegetables and the canines for tearing flesh. Surely history cannot be wrong?



Why do we value cats and dogs more than sheep and cows, and sheep and cows more than insects? Strange!



Christine - i hold my hands up to you, you have put across some great points and you are very knowledgable. I am not anti-vegetarian at all, my sister is vegi. I am just interested to talk openly about some of the issues involved.



Lish - if it is such a stupid question, why did you answer it and why have so many other people answered it in detail?

It's extremely unlikely that I will be able to go through life without inhaling a little bit of secondhand smoke (walking along the street, to use the same example you did, somebody will probably be smoking). Therefore, I might as well smoke 3 packs of cigarettes a day. See the problem with that logic (basically the logic you used)? You probably can't be 100% smoke-free, but you can significantly minimize it by not smoking. The overall damage done to your lungs will be much less if you just inhale the secondhand smoke.



Similarly, vegans don't try to eliminate animal suffering (that would be impossible), we try to minimize it. Yes, we accidentally kill insects while walking down the street, but the ability of insects to feel pain is debated, and even if they can feel pain, it's probably very minimal, due to the simple nervous system they have, as opposed to the complex nervous system we, and other mammals, have (this might answer your question about valuing cows over insects). Plus, when you crush a bug, it dies immediately, not suffering at all. I'm not saying it's right to kill bugs, but voluntarily contributing to the torture of mammals is much worse than accidentally stepping on an ant.



When you talk about taking medicine, those are bacteria and/or viruses that are being killed. Viruses are typically not even considered living, are not animals, and cannot suffer. Bacteria are living, but they are not animals, and they cannot suffer. Plants also can't suffer, as they lack a nervous system and brain (to answer your question about plant cruelty), and they're obviously not animals. As I already stated, the goal of vegans is to minimize animal suffering, not to eliminate the killing of all organisms.



You say you avoid buying factory-farmed animals if you can? I'm pretty sure you can anytime, it's just a matter of how willing you are. And if your teeth are such a good indication of the proper human diet, I suggest you try to take a bite out of a cow, and see what happens. You probably won't be very successful. It would be much easier to pick some fruit off a tree, and that way you wouldn't get sick from the raw meat that your body can't properly digest.

Always taking it to the extreme. Yeah, I understand some people are extreme, but not everyone.



Did you know that 10 billion animals are raised and killed annually for food, yet there are millions of people starving. Yeah, ridiculous isn't it.
Also think about how much land is needed to feed those animals, which is has a huge environmental impact.



Just by cutting down on the meat you eat, you're helping. Heck, even eating the amount you're supposed to would help. (a deck of cards)



If you're going to get ridiculous to the point of asking about diseases and plants having feelings, then technically nobody should wear clothing, have a house, furniture, etc.



The fact of the matter is, we can survive without eating meat. We can't survive with bacteria (disease causing), we can't survive with a lot insects (because they would eat all the crops)



A lot of people are ignorant, I get that. But if you're doing one thing that will hopefully help others, then kudos. Some people don't give a crap about who they are affecting, even if it is their child's future.

THANKYOU.  Thankyou for enlightening us dumba** vegans about the absurdity of our animal-lovin ways.  We sure needed that.  However, the truth is we all despise plants.  That's what the real deal is.  Yup.  Anywho, the point of becoming a vegan/vegetarian is symbolically withdrawing your support of an industry that exploits animals.  We are aware that we kill germs and squash bugs.  However, most of us who are vegan for animal-rights reasons are just trying to go through life causing as little pain and suffering to other beings as reasonably possible.  Some of us are also vegan for health and environmental reasons.  There is no need to belittle us with questions you know are silly.  Your need to talk down to us tells me that maybe you just feel defensive about vegetarians.  Don't worry.  The vast majority of us don't feel that we are morally superior to you, and we are not trying to induct you into an evil cow-worshipping vegan cult.  If you'd like to learn more about being vegetarian before you start asking us about plant's rights, I encourage you to visit www.vegan.org for some great info on the benefits of vegging out.

Oh dear. What a sad display of ignorance. Have you ever met anyone who believes that they can got through life without harming other life-forms? Of course not. So why ask the question? You reveal an unreasoned and shallow prejudice.
I am a vegetarian. It does not bother me one bit if anyone else is or is not. I am because I like animals, and don't want to eat them, and because I deplore many of the methods employed in farming them. This I have seen myself, being the son of a farmer.
If I had to eat meat to live, then I would eat it. But I don't, so I choose not to. I also try not to harm insects etc, but know that know that harming other life is an unavoidable part of living. Live and let live when possible, and when not possible, simply live.

Hence the large obstacle of being a vegetarian. Almost everything in life involves the death of some animal in one way or the other. It's just how the world turns. However, I think they strive to kill as few as possible, rather than go to the extremes of not killing any at all. And one of the easiest ways to not partake in animal death is to boycott foods or clothing associated with them.



I've yet to find anyone that is willing to give up their health for their love of animals though. (medicine)

Even if you stay inside it is probably you could kill one.
I think this is like when a human kills a human, not because he wanted, but because it just happened (i.e. crash)
Sometimes it is really impossible to avoid that ( like when you eat pasta, and pasta can have insects parts) but at least a lot of people such vegans and vegetarians try to do what they can for animals.
I really feel bad whenever I kill an ant, it i not my intention to do it, but at least I know I can avoid killing some pigs, chickens, and cows. :)

Thats impossible.  Its not possible to not kill insects.  You know you eat about a pound of bugs a year, mostly in your sleep.  They all die whether you want them to or not.  There is also billions of microscopic insects on you and your furniture right as we speak.  Thousands are killed everyday by you.  You can't avoid it.  Bugs will get killed

Vegetarians are not only vegetarian to save the lives of animals but also because of health reasons.



It is true we can't possibly go through life without killing other creatures, bugs or whatever but we try to avoid that if at all possible.



Isn't that better than deliberately killing?

With all due respect, Emma, I never heard such complete and utter bollocks in my life. The incidental squashing of an insect is hardly the same as confining a captively bred intelligent, sentient animal in poor conditions. btw I stopped eating meat because I lack the enzymes needed to digest it properly.

Do you realize that it is possible to go through life minimizing your contribution to animal suffering, global warming and enormously reducing your risk for cancer and other unhealthful conditions simply by eating real, wholesome food? This is our message, and we state it plainly. You can choose to disregard what we say, but don't expect any sympathy when you are on your death bed.



Edit: Emma, if you cared at all about plant welfare, you would cut meat altogether. Did you not know that the diet of the animals you eat is vegetables and grains? Did you know that SIXTEEN (yes SIXTEEN) pounds of grains need to be harvested to produce one pound of beef? Believe it or not, you carcass eaters contribute more to "plant suffering" than we do. And on a side note, why would plants have the instict of feeling pain when they cannot move - what purpose would pain receptors serve? They do not have a central nervous systerm. And I am sorry, but there is a difference between a strawberry harvest and tying a cow upside down and relentlessly slitting her throat til all the blood gushes out while she is fully conscious.



Edit #2: Why is it that you meat eaters put a preference on dogs and cats over cows, pigs and fish? Is it because fish are not cute and cuddly like "pets?" Is it because cows are ugly? Is it because you are a specieist?



Edit #3: Humans are not omnivores by nature, they are omnivores by culture only. And though our carcass-eating culture has developed a number of myths (historical and supposedly medical) to bolster the claim that carcass-eating is 'natural' or that we have 'evolved' to eat meat, the facts of anatomy clearly indicate otherwise. Your teeth are designed to grind vegetables, fruits and seeds... not to bite the neck muscles of a cow.

I am not a vegetarian, but I believe you are taking your assessments too far---it sounds like you may be a little bitter towards vegetarians.  Why, I'm not sure.



Anyway, to answer your question, many vegetarians abhor the way animals raised for food are treated.



Have you ever done any research on the topic?  These animals are often quite abused.  Kept in small pens, force fed, treated with chemicals, and then killed in various inhumane ways.  I do eat meat, but I will not eat veal; if you want to know why, look up what veal is and how it is made.



But it's not just the food companies.  Many vegetarians I know also will not use products tested on animals.  Why pour bleach in a puppy's eye?  We know what it will do.  A lot of times, there is no reason for the ill treatment of lab animals.  Don't get me wrong, animal research for things like the curing of AIDS, cancer, diabetes...well, it's warranted and needed.  I don't like it, but there it is.  However curing AIDS is entirely different from sticking a mascara wand in a rabbit's eye to make sure the mascara works the way it was intended.



Now as to squashing insects and killer-disease causing microbes...vegetarians are humane, not insane.  Squashing insects is sometimes inevitable and accidental.  There isn't too much we can do about that.  Secondly, killer viruses and bacteria are dangerous to almost all other living things---humans, animals, plants.  To allow them to flourish would not only be crazy, but inhumane towards almost all other life forms.



Vegetarianism is a lifestyle I haven't chosen, but it is one I respect and understand.  If you do a little research into the treatment of animals, you may come to the same conclusion.

Bacteria is indeed a living organism, but viruses on the other hand are basically little pieces of genetic code that copy themselves by use of a host cell. A vegeterian may not eat meat, but this doesn't mean that they persue life as "Jesus's of life." Many of them choose to be Vegetarians for health matters rather than for the simpathy of animals.



If they do find wrong in killing animals for food, then chances are they know they may accidently kill an inocent bug. They just try to kill less and not contribute to the killing of  other livestock.

im a veggie and i also hate the thought of killing any living thing, insect or otherwise. but some things cant be helped, its unrealistic and a bit stupid not go leave the house because u might walk on a beetle. But where there is a choice involved, why not make it?



I dont force my beliefs on other people, I dont give out to people because they eat meat.If someone asks my opinion I give it but I don't preach. Im not against the fundamental idea of eating meat - I am against the idea of treating animals just as products that can be used for food. And unfortunatly most meat is produced this way, unless on free range farms. And it is possible to live a normal life without eating meat - I haven't eaten it for 10 years and Im still alive!
People think it bad to abuse children, but they still buy Nike gear, which uses child labour. My conscience is clear I know that no animals have died in pain to feed me - I realise they have died anyway but I can't really do anything about that.
Also I believe that it is the intention of an act which really matters, I would never step on an insect just for the sake of it, i think every organism deserves to live its life, but if it happens by accident than there is no way around it.

It's about not killing sentient beings. Bacteria and viruses don't count. And it's vegans who don't eat meat because of the cruelty towards animals. Vegetarians don't eat meat for several different reasons, some just because it is healthier.



Vegans try not to step on insects, but aren't always successful. The same with Buddhists. What it comes down to is intent, and they don't intentional step on insects. And insects aren't only outside, so your taunt of staying indoors is nonsense.



ADDITIONAL: You're wrong about the teeth. There is plenty of plant life which has a tough outer skin, so canine teeth would be useful to tear through it. You are making a lot of mistakes in your thought process because you are trying to view this in an elementary way, when it is more of a complex issue.



And we don't value certain types of life more than others. Look at the fuss being made over the diminished number of honeybees. Insects simply are smaller than other life forms, so they are easier to overlook. As to cats and dogs being more revered than sheep and cows, that isn't necessarily true. There are plenty of countries where cats and dogs are used as food, and also plenty where sheep and cows are not. The reason certain animals are farmed and slaughtered for food overall is because of their size, their numbers, the type of meat they produce and the type of food they consume. So animals which are cheaper to feed and keep, but which also produce leaner cuts of meat are the more desirable. Shep, cows and chickens tend to fall into this category, dogs and cats don't.

definitely put them in the freezer unless you live near an area of water where you could safely store them without other critters getting to them first(you'd also have to figure out whether they were freshwater or marine clams)

Hemp protein is really healthy, fills you up, and easy to work into your diet. You can buy it at health food stores and farmers markets. I put 2 tablespoons into a smoothie and it fills you up FAST. Eating meat is largely unnecessary if you have the means to avoid it, so I wouldn't go back to it just yet. Beans, hemp, soy, anything to get you protein should do the trick. Also make sure to get lots of whole wheat bread products.



Oh, and be careful with soy, it contains large amounts of estrogen. It's not a good or a bad thing, it's just something to consider. It can reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but some worry it can lower your sperm count. But remember, estrogen isn't bottled feminism. It's not like you'll eat too much and then start shaving your legs and talking with a high voice. That's just a common misconception.

Did you find it hard to start eating meat after being vegetarian?



I have been vegetarian since childhood, basically it was imposed on me by my family and now I no longer want to follow those ideas, we only live once after all so may as well eat drink and be merry, as the saying goes, but I do feel guilty about it, I think it's sort of an obsessive thing, like I don't want to break the habit. How do I get past that?

Perhaps by engaging brain first:-



Patrick Wall, chairman of the European Food Safety Authority, recently asked whether it is "morally or ethically correct" to feed grain to animals while people starve. Rearing animals for human consumption is a shocking waste of resources: 16lbs of grain are needed to produce just 1lb of animal flesh. The world's cattle alone consume the same amount of calories it would take to feed more 8.7 billion people – that’s more than the entire human population on Earth.



Some more statistics for you: ninety per cent of the agricultural land in the UK is used to raise livestock, but still we do not have enough grain and so we import 46 million tonnes annually from developing countries. These are countries which not only suffer environmental degradation as a result but, in many cases, cannot afford to feed their own people. Every day, 24,000 people die from hunger and hunger-related causes; 75 per cent of them children less than five years old. Meanwhile, millions of tonnes of grain are being siphoned off to feed animals destined for the already groaning dining tables of countries with the fattest populations in the world.



Factory farming puts a serious strain on our water supplies too. While millions face drought, much of the world's water supply is diverted to animal agriculture. A study this year by the Stockholm International Water Institute, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Water Management Institute found it takes up to 4,000 litres of water to produce one kilogramme of wheat but up to 20,000 litres of water to produce one kilogramme of beef. A totally vegetarian diet requires 300 gallons of water per day, while a meat-eating diet requires more than 4,000 gallons of water per day.

Do you think the lioness thinks guilty about killing her prey?



We are omnivorous creatures. We eat meat. IT's only wrong when an animal is killed for other purposes than survival. If you feel guilty however.. no one can take the guilt away and you should't do something you're not entirely ok with doing because you'll regret if even if you make the decision to remain a vegetarian.

First off! Kayamat stop posting the same answer on all these questions, you looked up a paragraph you thought look intelligent and started posting it on all the questions about vegetarians and some that aren't try using your brain!



Now to your answer....I was in your boat and started eating meat again after 13 years, yes I felt guilty at first, but I only ate free range, non altered meat! I came to the conclusion...why are their food chains? To be put into motion, our bodies where made to digest meat, therefore we are meat eaters, why do you think we have to find other ways of getting protein when we don't eat meat because its not natural its something our body craves..okay now for most people who just gluttonously consume meat no matter the origin, yes its disgusting, but if you can find the ones that where treated like animals and not well assembly lines, then i think it will make you feel better! hope this helps..

i suppose it would depend on how long you haven't eaten meat for. if you have been a vegetarian from birth then your body might not be able to handle it. you may even be intolerant. However it is probably best to start small. if you want to eat meat don't go straight for the huge steak with mushroom sauce. Maybe start by eating fish & small bits, then start adding chicken. then move up to red meats, small bits at a time see how your body handles it :-)
I know how you feel about not being able to break the habit, I think it is probably best to consciously make a meal with meat in it and sit down relax and eat it then go "ok done" and if you feel bad about it maybe its not time to stop being a vegetarian yet, good luck with it all.

Well, you don't necessarily need to be vegetarian. A good way to feel better about it is to buy your meat directly from an organic farm where you can see for yourself how their animals are treated. But if you really want to be vegetarian, you could always try meat imitations. They're supposed to be just as good as the real thing.

You can try those expensive vegetarian meat substitutes
they look and taste almost like meat but really aren't,
you can also try being a semi vegetarian, or  pescetarian
meaning the only type of animal u eat is seafood or fish
since meat is officially considered of mammal land animals flesh only
and then there are the types of vegetarian that eat eggs, or dairy, or none of those, or one of the either

You could start slow. Once or twice a week replace meat in your meal with a vegetarian option. Every little bit helps. Increase the vegetarian meals gradually as you feel comfortable.



If you decide on the other method and go cold turkey then my suggestion is to watch animal cruelty videos until you're disgusted (Meet Your Meat by PETA should do the trick) and then purchase a lot of meat substitutes. It's a lot easier to go vegetarian when you have a freezer stocked with tofurky deli slices, vegetarian chicken nuggets, veggie hotdogs, and other favorites.

Technically, a vegetarian that eats fish is called a pescetarian, although many simply call themselves vegetarians.  A true vegetarian eats no meat.  A vegan also cuts out all other animal products, such as eggs, dairy, and honey.

As a vegetarian you don't eat any meat at all. I am like you though, I eat only seafood, no land animals.



The name for that is Pescitarian.



There are different types of vegetarians, but none of those eat any living creature at all, extending right to vegan which cuts out eating anything that comes from an animal including milk and eggs etc.
I hope that helps you have good luck with being a Pescitarian :-)

well some people consider vegetarian as not eating meat or flesh of mammal animals
meat usually refers to mammals, which means fish are not considered meat, the same goes to sea food
some do eat fish
there are actually 4 types of main vegetarians
Semi-Vegetarianism, the most common one actually eats eggs and dairy products, fish, and poultry as well
though some do not consider this as a true vegetarian
Lacto-vegetarianism, eat all dairy but eggs
ovo-vegetarianism, eat only eggs but no dairy
lacto-ovo-vegetarianism, eats no eggs or dairy



after that comes the vegetarians that eat certain fruit, seeds or certain plants only.... that's another story
u have alot of choices, it's all up to u, whatever makes u happy, good luck

No, vegetarians do not eat fish, flesh, or fowl.



Someone who eats fish but otherwise adheres to a vegetarian diet is called a pescatarian. Note that this is a separate diet and not a form of vegetarianism, as no vegetarian by definition would eat seafood.

Of course! You have to get your protein and fish is a great source of protein. Many vegetarians eat fish, while others don't. If you choose not to eat fish, then you will have to find another source of protein, such as eggs or pills. Yes, there is such a thing as protein pills.

<question>



Starting a new Vegetarian Diet, needing some advice.?



Well not a diet. I am changing my eating habits consistent to a Vegan diet. Meaning ZERO animal proteins such as eggs, milk, cheese, butter...so on. I have been considering this decision for about 6 months and after reading an article about the treatment of animals in slaughterhouses I have made my final decision.



So in consideration of the cruelty of animals (which had me crying for the duration of the article) plus the health benefits of a Vegan diet....I am willing to alter my eating habits completely.



Has anyone else made this transition before? That is going from a 'normal' meat, eggs, milk, cheese, vegi, fruit diet to that of a strict Vegan diet and if you have, can you offer me some advice on how to stay on track?



Also, any suggestions on new foods and brands to shop for. Im going to the grocer this evening and will be purchasing a new pantry full of foods. So besides the obvious fruit and vegi's, are there any other alternative brands that are 100% free of animal proteins and products? Such as gardenburgers, substitute eggs, cheeses and milks? I would love any help or advice you can give me from people that have converted into this new lifestyle.



Thanks for taking the time to answer!

I agree with the veggie skewers.  You could use small tomatoes, mushrooms, pineapple, chunks of onion, peppers, and pretty much any other type of vegetables.  Just make sure you soak the skewers overnight before you use them...or else they will burn!

Also corn on the cob is just great on the grill.  Make sure you make a lot though.  Vegetarians and omnivores mostly all love corn on the cob!



I can eat 5-6 ears of grilled corn by myself!  You can offer butter and salt to put on the corn...if your veg friend doesn't do butter they can just use salt.  To grill corn on the cob, just soak the ears (still in their husk) in water for a few hours...You can weight them down so they don't float on top of the water.  Then throw them on the grill...or you could husk the corn and put it in foil.  Then grill it.  Yum!!!

You could also get some large mushrooms at the grocery store and grill the mushroom caps.  Just be sure to keep them separate from the meat.  When they are finished you serve them just like burgers...on buns with any topping they would like.  Get some extras because non-vegetarians might enjoy them as well.

Wrap a few potatoes in foil and grill them.



The options are endless.  It's just really nice that you care enough about this person to take the time to come on here just to ask what they might like.  You must be a good friend.  There are people out there that are really rude and cruel to vegetarians.  Vegetarianism is not always an easy path.  It's people like you that rock!  I wish you the best of luck and I am sure they will appreciate any special thought you take for them.  They are lucky to have you as a friend.

As a vegetarian, first I would like to congratulate you for being considerate enough to think of your friend.  It wouldn't even cross most people's minds to offer something special for your friend.  I know this is kind of a hot dog, but Boca makes a soy brat, very good.  And garden burger makes a BBQ Riblet.  I don't think you could really put it on the grill (may fall apart), but maybe on the broiler? Or you could make a skewer with veggies and riblets.  Good luck!

Question to the vegans ?



I have been a vegetarian for a few years now and really enjoy the diet that I eat. I feel now that I want to try a vegan diet for a while. What I do want to know is what foods you eat to replace the nutrients lost from eggs and milk. And could you give me some sort of guide as to what you eat during the day, just to help me decide on some meal ideas.

Here's a food blog that my wife is always looking at.

Bread, pasta, cereal, rice, beans, peas, lentil, nuts, seeds, fruits and veggies can easily offer everything that you need except B12.
http://www.veganhealth.org/sh
http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo

All vegetarians should take a B12 supplement regularly since most people eat meat, dairy AND fortified cereals yet still have a B12 status that is lower than recommended.

For milk, I drink rice milk. Rice milk, in my opinion, is sweeter than soy.

For yogurt, I use Silk. Silk is delicious.

For cream cheese. I use Tofutti cream cheese-and my family has tried it by itself and decided it's better than regular cream cheese.

For smoothies/pies, I use silken tofu. I buy the silken tofu at HEB.

There is pretty much a vegan sub for EVERYTHING. Go to Whole Foods and explore. They have the widest selection of vegan goodies in my area. Good luck going vegan!

For milk, instead of dairy, I drink calcium-fortified soymilk.  I simply buy it in bulk from Costco so I always have a supply of it.  As far as eggs and other proteins go, I eat a variety of beans (stuff them in burrito, bean & rice, etc), tofu, and wheat gluten (otherwise known as seiten, when you mix it with water and cook it.  It does give you a meat-like texture).  Also, nuts and nut butter are good sources as well.

An example of my meals go like this:

Breakfast: fruit & nuts (mango & raw walnuts) + 1 cup soymilk



oat meal + 1-2 tlsp peanut butter + 1 banana + sprinkle of  cinnamon



two slices of whole wheat + peanut butter + banana/grapes

Lunch: saute veggies & tofu/seitan & carb (whole wheat/brown rice)

Dinner: beans & carb & veggies



burrito (veggies, vegan cheese, brown rice, beans)

Snacks: fruit, soymilk, nuts.  I usually combine fruits and nuts because the nuts fill me up, and i can't go a day without eating something raw (such as fruits. or for that matter, veggies)

By the way, if you want to use eggs in your baking, I use arrowroot starch as a replacement.  It is similar to potato starch or corn starch.  It binds your ingredients together, so whenever i bake, I add a tablespoon of arrowroot starch (depending on the composition of other ingredients) and mix it with the dry ingredients.  It always works.

Here are some articles on vegan sources of iron and calcium (I assume you're not interested in replacing the saturated fat and cholesterol in dairy and eggs!)
http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/iron.htm
http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/calcium.htm

A couple of great resources for vegan nutrition and meal ideas include "Becoming Vegan" by Brenda Davis and Vesanto Melina (the bible of vegan nutrition) and either of Isa Chandra Moskowitz's cookbooks.  "Vegan with a Vengeance" is the book that made me realize that vegan was totally doable, and her newer one "Veganomicon" is incredible (lots of good info on stocking a vegan pantry, and lots of mix and match bean, vegetable and grain recipes to help plan balanced meals.)

The only things you'll lose by dumping dairy and eggs is saturated fat and cholesterol.

I don't drink soy milk anymore, but when I did, I bought chocolate silk.  I use soy milk in baking and cooking, and I buy the Whole Foods store brand in the aseptic boxes.  There are soy ice creams, rice ice creams, and Purely Decadent even makes coconut milk ice cream.  Whole Soy & Company makes vegan yogurt and frozen yogurt.

For eggs, you can use Ener-G Egg Replacer in baking; the instructions are on the box.  Some people use 1 tbsp flax seeds and 3 tbsp water per egg, soaking the flax seeds first to form a slurry.  You can also liquefy 1/4 cup tofu per egg in a blender and use that.

If you miss scrambled eggs, you can do a tofu scramble instead.  Any vegan cookbook is going to have a recipe for tofu scrambles.

If you're already vegetarian, there aren't many changes you have to make to have vegan meals.  Stir-fries, grilled or pan-fried tofu/tempeh/seitan.  Black bean tacos or fajitas.



Check out www.vegweb.com for recipes.

And good luck!

I'm not a vegan, but the first thing that came to my mind is that you could make a simple spaghetti bolognese but without meat or cheese. That way, you could all eat the same dish together.

dinners that you and the vegan might like......

spaghetti squash w/ red sauce, served w/ dinner salad and bread.  you can make one large batch of sauce, separate it - and put meat into the portion your family will be enjoying.

pot of beans, salad, sliced melon (such as canteloupe) and bread.

stir fry veggies, baked potato, salad, bread.....and grilled meat on the side for rest of family

crockpot of vegetable soup with grilled meat for the rest of the family

Keep a large bowl of salad in the fridge is good idea anytime- and certainly is ok with the vegans.

With company in town - many families go to buffet dinners more than they would at other times....this would be a good time for that at least once during the visit - everyone can simply pick what they want for dinner....

if the vegan gets militant - introduce him/her to a local hotel to finish the trip with, and then meet in restaurants the rest of the trip.



you really can't strip your household of their right to eat meat if the vegan demands it - it isn't fair to them....so, hopefully your vegan won't get militant on you.

There are so many meals that can be made to suit everyone's tastes.  Like pasta with tomato sauce; you can add meat or meatballs after your vegan friend has taken their portion.  You could make a veggie and noodle stir fry and just cook up meat separately to add to your portion.  Like someone said, Indian food is full of yummy, satisfying vegan dishes.  We eat much like anyone else, surprisingly.  And there are millions (literally) of vegan recipes available online.  Ask your friend for some suggestions, too... he's probably had some experience with this before.

Why not try only cooking vegan for the duration of your friends' stay..then your whole family might get to try foods they may never have encountered without your vegan visitors visit :-))

So, for example, you might be cooking a roast dinner, well try it vegan style, roasted veggies and baked tofu, or veggie burger mix, or make your own creation out of chick peas..
Anyway, if you like food and like cooking, you should enjoy the challenge, even though, it isn't really a challenge, just sounds a bit daunting until you start.

Becoming Vegetarian.Honest opinions.?



Please be nice.

I've been a vegetarian before but I got extremely sick. Well lately I have become distressed, so bad If I see KFC I start to get emotional. I just, I don't ever want to torture anything. But Being a vegetarian is so hard. 
You can eat something and get sick because of protein loss. Or you can kill animals and be better for the enviorment by not wearing vegan products....plastic.

What do I do. I don't want to buy leather anymore, but I don't want to be a vegan either. I won't wear fur,leather is the same.

And I hate to say it, but I LOVE fish. It's so yummy, and healthy. 
On the subject of healthy I've read report after report about how vegetarians are healthier but then go to another study and meat eaters live longer.

I can't be a vegan because I can tolerate soy, but not pure soy. I'm allergic. So I have to have real dairy...or else I'll die.

I feel guilty, sad. How do I make changes without being sick?

Please, if you give a website do not show one with dead animals. Peta makes me sob. Seriously.

It's up to you to decide what the right balance for you is, between  your compassion for animals, and your health.

I suggest you get a good book on vegetarian nutrition, so you can understand what you may have been missing. Protein isn't magic, nor do we need that much of it; typically about 70-80 grams per day. You may have been missing other essential nutrients; generally all you need is a well-balanced diet with lots of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and some protein sources.

Try just going to pescetarianism for a while (that's just fish, no other meat). See how you feel. Balance your diet with other healthy foods, learn to make a wider variety of dishes for yourself. Then if that's working for you, you can try cutting down on the fish.

Yes, your dog can be a healthy vegetarian. http://www.petfoodshop.com/

I've been a vegetarian for 28 years, and see about 5,000 vegetarians a year as part of our vegetarian business.

I've never seen a vegetarian get sick because of "protein loss"

I suspect you sickness is due to something else, there is not a problem with veggies getting enough protein:

http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html

Its not an "either get sick or eat meat" choice. You can be perfectly healthy on a vegetarian diet.

You seem to have lots of "excuses" for not being vegetarian, do you have any reasons ?

sorry, but "hospitilized for malnutrition." is completely different to lacking protein on a veggie diet. There is either somethng else medically wrong, or your general diet is shocking and pretty much unrelated to whether its veggie or not.

Best of luck with finding your solution, but i doubt if the "veggieness" of the diet is the root cause

You appear to have 2 illnesses

(1) lack of meat hospitalises you due to malnutrition
(2) lack of dairy will kill you

All the expereinced vegetarians posting here don't seem to have ever come across ( over many years and by meeting thousands of other vegetarians) these symptoms.

Really, if this is the case you should be straight back to the doctors, we can't help you.

"I can't be a vegan because I can tolerate soy, but not pure soy. I'm allergic. So I have to have real dairy...or else I'll die."

What does soy have to do with being vegan? Who told you that you'll die if you don't have dairy? What's in dairy that you need so badly? If you eat dairy, it's because you want it. No one *needs* dairy.

Bread, pasta, cereal, rice, beans, peas, lentil, nuts, seeds, fruits and veggies can easily offer everything that you need except B12.
http://www.veganhealth.org/sh
http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo

All vegetarians should take a B12 supplement regularly since most people eat meat, dairy AND fortified cereals yet still have a B12 status that is lower than recommended.
http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/b12

It may help you if you see proof that vegetarians have the same potential as anyone else.

I actually had to stop eating meat because it makes me sick. Since becoming vegetarian, I am healthier and have actually gained weight.

Vegetarians don't have to eat soy. And soy products such as milk etc. should be steered clear of anyway, as the high levels of oestrogen have been linked to breast cancer.

People who make fun of your for being a vegetarian and having a conscience are not worth knowing.

I would talk to your doctor, because I think I don't think your illness was because of cutting meat out of your diet. Or maybe its simply your subconscious craving meat?

It is purely up to you if you want your dog to become a vegetarian. It goes against the nature of the animal, but you can buy vegetarian pet food that conatins all the vitamins and minerals that a dog needs.

If you were hospitalized for malnutrition, you were starving yourself. It had nothing to do with being vegetarian  You will die without dairy?  I've never heard of a condition that requires dairy to stay alive.  Google the vegetarian food pyramid.

This is what I usually make for potlucks. Meat eaters like it, too. Bowtie pasta salad with cherry tomatoes, olives, artichokes, asparagus, baby broccoli, Morning Star Chicken Grill Strips (can't remember the exact name), and Italian dressing. It's good. And maybe you can have a salad, too. How about cookies topped w/ soy ice cream and fruit for dessert?

How do i start feeding my family better?



I would really like for my family to start eating better, completely stop fast food. i really wish we could be vegetarians, but i don't know how to go about this. my husband is into the idea, and i think he would do it, but we have a 6 yr old, a 2 yr old and a 1 yr old. the 1 yr old is still nursing, so she wouldn't be that hard, but the other two would probably be very hard to convince! what can i do? what is the difference between vegetarian and vegan and all the other ones?

Your kids being as young as they are actually would make things easier.

I will never forget years ago when one of my children came home, totally shocked by what someone was eating, 'a black looking round thing - and it had stuff that oozed out of it all over their fingers' - their first sight of a ''Ding Dong''.  :)

Some children will do better than others.  Some will not want to make the switch.  I will say that all my children while not vegetarians are very aware of the foods that they eat and do not allow much if any 'junk food' in their homes.

The one thing that you can control is what they eat in your home.  They actually have soy hot dogs, and 'hamburgers' - even sausage.  I am not a fan of the fake poultry - but that is my personal choice.

I would suggest just start by taking out all the 'bad' snacks and replace them with things like - oh apples and peanut butter - maybe some celery sticks, baby carrots.  Believe it or not, I have NEVER had a child not like them - even when I have had parents swear that they wouldn't eat them - they did for me.  There are also nuts, trail mix, dried fruits - how about just some plain old fashioned regular fruit like apples, oranges, and grapes?

When you go out to eat - don't do McD's.  Easeir said than done if it is a place that your children have come to look forward to going out to.  Instead try to go to a place like "Subway" where they have the "Veggie Delight".  "Wendy's" has baked potato - but then that is going to be having them begging for the hamburger that they more than likely are used to eating - so I would avoid it.  There is also cheese pizza or one with every veggie possible on it with no meat since you posted another question showing that your looking more to a diet with dairy and eggs.

Your a military wife it appears - years ago when I was an NCO wife, I used to make sure that I always had a cooler full of things for the kids to munch on when we went out - because one never knew if where one was going there was going to not only be something that the kids would actually eat - but if the people there were 'open' to an American (more than a tad bit of hate against Americans back in the 70's and 80's, esp. those in the military, esp. overseas).

Take it at a pace that is comfortable for you and that you can live with.  Do study on it.  Make the choices that you need to make and fit them into your lifestyle as you are able.  If this indeed is something that you really want to do - you will find that you have the success that you are looking for sooner than you think.

It doesn't matter what the ages are, it is always possible to be a healthy vegetarian.

If you need meat or dairy during any stage of your life or to live any certain lifestyle, why does the American Dietetic Association say otherwise?
http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada...
http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/preg...
http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/real...

The only definitions worth repeating are from the founders of the words.
vegetarian - http://www.vegsoc.org/info/whatis.html
vegan - http://www.vegansociety.com/newsroom/ind...

Bread, pasta, cereal, rice, beans, peas, lentil, nuts, seeds, fruits and veggies can easily offer everything that you need except B12.
http://www.veganhealth.org/sh
http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo

All vegetarians should take a B12 supplement regularly since most people eat meat, dairy AND fortified cereals yet still have a B12 status that is lower than recommended.
http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/b12

It may help you if you see proof that vegan people have the same potential as anyone else.

Well, you could try eating meat less often first off. Try bringing it down to 1-3 times per week. You don't have to be absolutely anything. You can just greatly reduce the frequency that you eat it if that's easier at first.
Being vegetarian simply means not eating meat. You can still have eggs and dairy.
Being vegan means eating no animal products at all.

What do you think of my idea to promote veg*ism?



Here is my idea

Veg* storm:summer '11

I had this massive idea and I would like to share it with you. This vision is set in my imaginary world of unlimited funds so, it might be really expensive. Well anyway, I want to try to have all the resources for the veg* community in New York City sometime during the summer of 2011. (This will give time to plan it) This would be a 2 week event. The first week would be a veg* convention. The purpose of this convention is to draw media attention and train people in the art of leafleting.



The second week is where the hold veg* storm idea gets it name. Think of it, people leafleting at every corner. Trucks with megaphone rooming  up and down the streets. Just a massive effort.

I want to have enough time to plan out where the activist will eat and sleep. So, what do you think of my delusional idea.

Have you heard of Vegan Outreach? They have the leafleting down.
http://www.veganoutreach.org/advocacy

"Trucks with megaphone rooming up and down the streets"
No offense, but it sounds like you are trying to piss people off and turn them away. Yelling at them until they submit isn't a good plan.

Back to the leafleting. I'm afraid that there might not be enough veg activists that are mature enough to leaflet respectfully for you to cover every corner or even a large number, especially if they are down with the megaphone idea.

I suppose it's suitable, but do you really want to drink that stuff? It's mostly chemicals.

Tofu comes from soybeans. They're legumes (beans). I don't know what is in Quorn as I've never had it. I'd imagine that it, too, is plant-based.

Most meat alternatives are processed in some way or another. It's relatively rare to get plain soybeans.



So, to answer your question: they come from plants, but have quite a detour in between the ground and your plate.

Yes; when you think about it, it is very weird and unnatural to drink the milk of another species (and one that's not even biologically similar to us), especially into adulthood.



Dairy cows have been selectively bred so that they now have freakishly large udders that must be very heavy and uncomfortable to carry around. They are also made to have a calf every single year so they keep producing milk, and their calf is a 'by-product' that is usually turned into veal. Huge amounts of water and chemicals are used to keep the dairies hygienic, as they are full of... well... cows and cow dung.



So when you look past the industry-sponsored hype, there's really very little that is natural about humans drinking cow's milk.

Yeh, it is kinda weird. I just try to think that cows ALWAYS have milk, and if they dont get milked, they actually become sick in some ways.. So i guess they were put on this earth to give us an alternative to water. Not really like humans, since we just lactate after giving birth.

Yep I do think it's weird and disgusting. It actually boggles my mind why adult humans drink milk at all as it's only intended to be food until you are able to eat solids. Also, it confuses me why people think it's normal to drink milk from a cow but disgusting for adults to drink it from a human. If someone is going to drink milk i think it should atleast be from their own species! If it were from humans, then it wouldn't need to be processed - when has milk straight from mummys breast ever been processed? Never.
Rice milk and Almond milk are good alternatives to soy, and personally, I think rice milk is the best. They also have it in chocolate and vanilla flavour.

Yes!!! I find it really weird. Milk was intended for the babies of each particular species. It's always kinda grossed me out but not alot of people agree with me and yeh I'm with you I don't like soy milk all that much either. I don't know I guess we're missing out on some good calcium but it really turns me off.



Also what I don't get is people would be grossed out if we started drinking milk from a dog or another animal but isn't it really the same concept, someone just had the idea to drink cows milk first and call it "Dairy".

I just finished reading a book by Marilu Henner who doesn't drink milk.  Even though nutritionists say we need to drink milk, milk is intended as food for babies and after they start eating solid foods, no one should be drinking milk at all.

Did you try almond milk?  It's got a nicer taste than soy milk.

I'm female. My boyfriend was a vegetarian when he was little (his mom is a vegetarian but his father is not), but now he eats meat, though not that frequently. I do the shopping, so at home he mostly is a vegetarian. When we go out to dinner or if he buys packaged meals (like frozen dishes) then he'll eat meat. But I don't mind that much. I got him to cut down a lot and he is an animal lover so he's toyed with the idea of becoming a vegetarian again.

Yes, I know male vegans and vegetarians.
I would certainly date someone non-vegetarian, I don't like to date exclusively in ANY group. I don't date people that are only my religion or only my race either. I think that by isolating myself from those with different opinions than me, I willingly subject myself to ignorance and prejudice. Who knows, dating a non-vegger might make them change their mind and go veg? I've had men go vegetarian for me before.

You do not say what you want to use the "agar agar" for but if you just want to make a recipe you can use any packaged, unflavored gelatin.  In the US the brand is usually Knox.

If you are wanting to do a microbiology experiment (or science project) then look at a scientific supply store.

You may also find it at a health food store.  But agar is no more healthy to eat than gelatin.

You would be able to cope, the human digestive system is designed to cope with eating meat, maybe after many many generations of people who didn't eat meat it would start to evolve.

Although you may, at first feel sick or even throw up. But if they carried on the nausea would go away.

Also, your teeth may not be very good at cutting meat.

Yes, but not without being very sick. They'd be very lucky to get away with not being sick because their body will think the meat is a foreign object that it hasn't encountered before. A bit like when people be sick when they're ill - the body is trying to expel something it thinks shouldn't be there. Hope this helps:-)

Not a problem. The body will take it in its stride without any ill effects. I know a friend who started eating meat after 30 years of being a vegetarian ( he was more or less forced to do so, since he was posted to a country where no one was a vegetarian ). He did not suffer any ill effects.

Of course. All babies are vegetarian at birth because they can't swallow solid foods.



No matter how long you go without eating meat you will still have a human body and humans can digest meat just fine. You can of course find all of the nutrition you need from non-animal sources.

Not being able to eat meat after so many years without is like saying that if you don't have sex for a few years you lose the ability to pro-create. Plain old silliness.

When our veterans of World War II were returned from years of captivity in the German concentration camps, where the food they received was awful and non-nutritional, our commanders made a grave mistake in allowing them to eat anything that they ordered.  Many of them were eating steaks and lobster and very rich items that they desired, but hadn't eaten in years.  Some of these men died because food they ate disagreed with their bodies so much.  I'm not saying that you're going to die if you eat meat, but be extremely careful on the amounts that you ingest at the beginning.  Eat only one type of meat per day and only at one meal.  See how your body reacts to it, then have the same thing on the second day.  If you have no ill effects, either try a larger portion, or try a small portion of another kind of meat.  No matter what you do, when making a drastic change in your diet (going from vegetarian to omnivorous) just take it slow and allow your body to adjust after each meal.  Once the adjustment takes place with no ill effects, you'll be able to eat anything without fear of getting sick.  Good luck.

Yes it could cope, whether you would get sick or not is a different question, your body wouldn't be used to processing the ratio of fats/proteins/vitamins in meat so it would throw it out a bit, but yes humans are made to be omnivores, we have the biological capacity to digest meat, even if you choose not to.

Hope that helps.

Biologically, of course you could still digest it.

But you would need to go easy, starting with very small amounts of very mild meats.  Simple things like throwing a few bacon bits on a salad or using a little chicken broth in a vegetable soup.  You wouldn't necessarily want to dig right into a big beefy steak.  Your body would likely be sent reeling.

Yes, you've a right to choose but I sincerely hope you think carefully before you exercise that right. We are not born as omnivores as many believe.

Definitely. I'd say vegetarians are hypocrits because animals are treated much the same in the dairy and egg industry. If they replace the meat with dairy and eggs, they're not doing a whole lot of difference.

Animals have rights and if you want to be taken seriously as a compassionate person, you need to go vegan.

Well I used to be a 'Vegetarian' and I ate Chicken and Fish. The reason for this is as a Vegetarian I stayed away from the red meats (As you had said), as well as other meats that affect the body in negative ways. Chicken for example is the least lethal of the meats and contributes enough protein to make up for (there of) lack of it. Fish, well... I grew up on Fish, and my excuse is that Fish really doesn't have any bad qualities... Everything a Fish contributes will (in the long run) help our bodies more then anything. That's just my two cents. :-) - Also adding on, 'Vegans' are people who solely eat Vegetables only. Vegetarians are dietary people who are 'picky eaters' but only in the sense of there own personal well-being with there meals. Vegans will not touch any sort of meat. If you meet a Vegetarian, they most likely will eat some sort of meat.

Depends on the reason for being a vegetarian.  If it's a matter of healthy choices, then it might make sense.  If it's a matter of being against the specific methods of raising and slaughtering certain animals, it might make sense.

But if you're a vegetarian because you feel that it's inappropriate for humans to kill for their own needs, then I fail to see the justification for chicken or fish.

3 different definitions of vegetarian....Guess what?  NO MEAT IS INVOLVED IN A VEGETARIAN DIET....Fish and Chicken ARE MEAT.  They breathe, bleed, feed, have eyes, hearts, guts..etc...Anyone who says they eat either of those is NOT a Vegetarian.  Makes me livid!

A vegetarian would not eat chicken, so they are not using the right term. Someone who is vegetarian otherwise, but eats fish is called a peskatarian actually, not a vegetarian. They either do not know the proper term or don't want to deal with having to explain it every time they say what they are so they just say vegetarian. I don't believe there is a name for someone who only eats chicken, they should just say that they don't eat red meat.

Absolutely. People like that are misguided, confused, or just plain inconsiderate. They make the world that much harder for those of us who are vegetarians. Why do they think people are trying to serve us fish all of the time!? Because they're perpetuating the myth that we eat seafood, that's why.

A vegetarian does not eat fish, flesh, or fowl. Period. End of story. The end.

Asda used to be good for things like that but has gone downhill sadly and now I go to tesco instead.

It is suggested that if everyone became vegetarian 10 times more people in the world could be fed...?



because if you got rid of cattle and used the land they were on to grow crops you would be providing more food, but in practise fewer extra people would be fed in this way?
What are some reasons for this?

No because we could already feed the whole world on the food we throw away..  Yeah because there would be less grazing land.  The world is fucked up like that because of capitalism aka MONEY

money was made so the people with businesses and stuff could stockpile  and be able to do anything they want....  The only reason money is worth ANYthing is because some people have none of it or NEGATive amounts of it.  You can't have a house full of 1 million potatos right???  but you can fit many of those "dollars"  in a house.

It's all a scam. If you wanna feel better jsut go to a restaurant and eat everything the assholes paying for it don't

This is a doddle.  Slice your onions into very thin rings. Fry very gently in olive oil until transparent.  Add crumbled veg stock cubes and hot water and allow to simmer for anything from 20 minutes to an hour, depending on when you want to eat it.
This is actually a variation on French onion soup.
Per person: one medium-small onion or half a big one.  One stock cube. half to threequarter pint hot water.
Taste-test to see if it needs salt, pepper or more stock cubes before serving.  You can also add a dash of soy sauce, or anchovy essence, or marmite

The fact that French onion soup is based on a beef consomme is typical of the French attitude to vegetarians.

Just caramelise (ie. slightly burn) the onions and use vegetable stock.

This is to get your complete fill of omega 3 and 6 oils - the best way to do this is to eat spreads that have these in them, and to also eat flax/pumpkin seeds/soya beans/rape seed/walnuts/olive oil/sunflower seeds/almonds and olives...and avacados (thanks to Jen for reminding me of that one :-)

If you're worried about getting enough Omega-3s, I found an alternative that is vegan - smart balance omega cooking oil is a vegetable oil blend that is great for cooking stir-fries or pasta or whatever you like to make and will give you the same benefits. It also has vitamin E. I found that oil in Von's (same as Safeway) but I'm sure there are other products that re fortified with these oils. Or just take some Omega-3 supplements - you can find those in any Rite Aid type place. Nuts, nutbutters, seeds, and seedoils are also good sources of healthy oil.

If it's for omega 3 fatty acids, flax, hemp, and walnuts are a good source.  But remember, never, never, never heat flax oil.  It's good for a salad dressing, in smoothies, or for drizzling over vegetables.  You can use cold-pressed in raw recipes as well.  I think hemp oil is the same way.  There are lots of hemp snacks out there and even hempseed butter (like peanut butter or almond butter).  There's also hemp milk, but I hated the stuff.

You have to order vegetarian food in advance. It's not enough to click a "vegetarian" box when you buy your ticket. You have to call up the airline, usually at least 1 day in advance, but not too far in advance. I try to call 2 days before the flight.

I suggest just taking something with you, like a simple sandwich and snacks. Airline food is so gross anyway. Surely you could even find something better in the terminal to buy before your flight.
If your flight is really long I would definately contact the airline to have something for you inflight but be prepared to not be able to eat much of it...
My latest trip which was from Atlanta to Vancouver didn't even serve a complimentary meal on the almost 6 hour flight. You could buy something if you wanted or have free peanuts. I did buy a fruit and cheese plate on the trip back which I think cost $6 and it was better than any of the food like sandwhiches that people bought in flight sitting near me. Usually I bring my own water and snacks though, not bothering with the cheap, terrible airline food.

yes u can ..normally if your flight is more than 2 hrs long.

If you booked your Holiday in a travel agent then you should have booked it then ..but just gave them a ring and you can sort it out.

they normally have only couple of vegetarian meals ready ...so even if then you would be able to ask them when you get on the plane...

i had a flight last month and i got vegetable cottage pie i think.....cheese , crackers, butter , and small pot of pudding...sometimes flight food is rubbish but mine was actually quite nice and it makes you enjoy yourself better !!

so the answer again - YES YOU CAN HAVE VEGETARIAN FOOD.

I would not think you would have pure veg in flight. Isn't prepared in the same kitchen with meat? Actually I don't know. 
One time I ordered a fruit platter and there was a dead shrimp decorating it. Yuck!
It's nice if you can take your own foods or otherwise, as the other answers have suggested, inform them early.

I don't think you will have to worry about getting anything to eat on a domestic flight, except a snack.
On over-sea flights I have requested vegetarian as soon as I make my reservation. The added bonus requesting vegetarian is that the attendant will give you extra fruit during the entire flight.
I was very satisfied.

You do have to order in advance and, as someone else has said, you generally need to call the airline up a day or two before the flight to confirm. It is worth it for long haul though.

I had a couple of veggie meals on flights once with Butter and I wasn't convinced it was truly veggie, so I now order vegan.

I have to say that every meal I have had has been lovely, especially the breakfasts! I even know some meat eaters who order the veggie / vegan options, as they tend to be nicer.



An added bonus is that they tend to hand out the 'special' meals first.

However, I other than not eating animal products, I am actually a non-fussy eater, so will eat what is served to me. If there are lots of foods you don't like, stash a few snacks in your hand luggage.

Hope you enjoy your flight!

take your own food. at best airline food isnt  fit for dogs.  even a non vegetarian  doesnt eat the stuff served on most airplanes. on a short flight a sandwich and a packet of crisps will see you through. on long haul, eat what ever is edible that they serve you. it adds to the in flight entertainment,  and supplement it with what ever you've brought with you. choccy bars , fruit, a salad box etc can all be packed into your hand bag.

Both. I eat what I want, but I want to eat healthy foods so in that sense I think I ought to eat it. I've always preferred savory to sweet and I've never been overly fond of candies or junk foods, and I'm now a vegan. So by default, I eat healthy stuff, but within that I certainly chose to eat foods that I like and are tasty to me. I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, for example, so even though they are very healthy, I don't eat them unless they are in another dish. I choose the foods I like, but they're healthy foods. Like I might choose to have a rice and vegetable dish instead of a salad, even though that would probably be healthier, but the first option would still be a healthy meal.

I eat what I want, but by default, it is also what I think I ought to eat most of the time.



I'm vegan, so I want to eat foods that are not derived from a sentient being. I also care about my health, so I want to eat things that are going to keep me healthy.



I think I ought to eat as healthily as possible, because I don't want to come down with fatal or chronic diseases or have to be on pharmaceuticals for the rest of my life, and I want to live a long, healthy, happy life.



So, what I want to eat is also usually what I think I ought to eat. I'm usually getting optimum nutrition by eating what I want. I do like to indulge in sweets and other not so nutritional foods sometimes too, though, and I drink much more coffee than I should. :) So those are the exceptions. Oh, and alcohol would be another exception, I suppose. Vodka is nice. :)

I don't eat meat or dairy or eggs because I don't want to and a vegan diet because I want to.

If I feel I need something I just add it t something else.

It works and I'm happy :)

Story about them:
I was babysitting for my brother, who was 8 at the time (he's 9 now) and my mom told me to make him dinner. So, I cooked two quorn fillets and served him one. I told him it was chicken mom wanted me to reheat for him. He took one bite and said "This is so good!" gobbled down the whole thing, and then I told him what it was. He was shocked it could be so good!

The lentil is a small, bushy, annual plant, it grows lens shaped seeds in pods, which are what we eat. They are grown mostly in India and in the Middle East, although Canada grows a lot as well.

They are the eggs of the cave dwelling Lentil bug. Just kidding.

Try planing some of them and you will find that they are a plant. They grow in pods like peas.
