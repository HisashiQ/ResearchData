No, it's most assuredly not just you. His election made history, his assassination would make headlines around the world over night.
Face facts, their are Americans who still won't accept a Black Man as prez because of racism
Least Obama did pick a VP qualified enough to run the country should he meet an untimely demise. The thought of Sarah Palin ascending to the presidency is one scary idea.

While there are probably more than a fair share of racists who don't want him in the white house I doubt they would be that retarded; if Barack Obama is assasinated, you are looking at a nation wide version of the L.A. riots.  No joke, black people will go cuckoo, and I'm not saying this to be insulting, I have had a lot of black friends in the past, and because of their self image issues due to a culture of defeatism, they are extremely thin skinned, you have to be careful around them.  I mean its easy to make friends, overlook their skin color, but occasionally you say an off color joke and everything stops and people go "whoa.... dude, you're not black...."  No one says it, but people definitely think it.  Hey, reverse is also true.



I mean, you make friends with people not of your race after a while you only see the friend and you ignore the racial difference until it comes up somehow.  I know black people well enough to tell you, it doesn't take very much to set them off, and often times, they can be their own worst enemy at ticking each other off.  Obama is more than a new U.S. president, whether he wants to or not, he's a latter day Martin Luther King Jr.



If black people lose a SECOND symbol of equality, oh, its gonna be ugly.  Really ugly.  Forget the race riots of '68; we are talking the freaking apocalypse here.  The hoover building in Washington D.C. even, FBI H.Q. will get stormed and everyone inside will be slaughtered.  And in D.C. hey, black people have numbers.  Oh trust me man, no one will touch Obama, I doubt even racist whites are that retarded.



Then again, white arrogance and stupidity seems to know no limits.



Those secret service people better do their job, or we are talking the L.A. riots, but across the country, anywhere with significant black communities.  Hell even all the uncle tom black people may even jump in.



Again, they better leave that man alone, and let him do his job.



Personally though, I don't know if Obama was elected because the U.S. truly has changed and its people has changed, or if that election was set up to give him an easy win to change the U.S.'s world image.



I'm not getting conspiracy theory here nor am I pointing fingers regarding rigged votes; however I am saying that, considering Obama's opponents, it almost seems like he was set up to win.



Come on, an old guy, a no charisma turd supported by the now unpopular "has been" chuck norris, and finally, a hated feminist, hated by women even.  In the middle of that crowd, a handsome black dude with african and white ancestry who graduated from harvard who is in even better shape than Kennedy was when he took up the presidency come on now, Obama was set up to win.



Again, consider his opponents.  Not saying the man doesn't deserve it, but still saying that given the way things work in Washington D.C., if you want someone to win the presidency, just see to it, by whatever means possible, bribes, black mail, whatever, that rival political parties choose an opponent they know no one in the U.S. will vote for, or not a significant enough number.  Within your own party nominate someone even more unpopular and boy they're a shoe in.



Is that REALLY democracy?



Not saying he doesn't deserve it, I'm just saying, was he put there to make the U.S. look good as far as world images are concerned, or because the U.S. people have REALLY changed?  That is what I'm asking here.

Admit to yourself that you have done bad things and try to make amends to those you have hurt.  Then you can try to become a better person.  Simply accepting that one is a bad person is a disincentive to behaving properly:  One simply accepts that one is awful and can't do better.  Trying to become a better person is much more effective.

Never! You must never try to pass a judgment on yourself quite like this. You have not solitary right on your life, the life that we have by the reason of many other lives around you, lives that have been before you and the one will come after you. This is the reality of each human life that stops us from becoming autocratic even in the matters of our own affairs. We must think for others even when we think entirely for the good of our own purposes. This is not possible anyway to cast a world full of people out of our thoughts and stay normal.



This therefore is not for you alone to decide as what sort of person you are, have been or will become in the future. This has never been a decision for you to make and will never be. If you look carefully into your own opinions and beliefs then you will realize that all you know about yourself is to a very great extent dependant upon your interaction with the people in your life, on their opinions, general conduct towards you and general response to your demands and requests. This therefore is not possible for you to reach any final conclusion about your person, which is a terrible thing to do anyway if you do it against what might be decisive good in you.



But if you do somehow manage to convince yourself that you are a bad person indeed then you will be waiting for this ‘verdict’ to be over thrown and overruled by the new knowledge you will gather about yourself, as you will definitely making all people in your interaction make nearly equally bad, which most of them are not going like. You will be taught anew as for instance how to respect people, including yourself, love them and respect them when goings on are not as good.



I wonder why there are so much pain and suffering in some people’s lives. May be certain people get too harsh and judgmental on themselves? May be people who form rigid opinions and view, about life, others and themselves, are people who eventually come to mend their views, or suffer a breakdown of some sort?

NO, because to be a bad person, you have to be a stupid racist egomaniacal stuborn whore named Natalie Portman who tampered with the DNA tests of someone looking for his parents and then dug in her heels resigning herself to never apologize, say she was sorry or take responsibility even though she knows the wareabouts of the parents of said individual.  Not only that, but for 3 years straight she spent her time tormenting him online and never responding to any of his requests to take responsibility, even though he sent numerous e-mails to himself (which she hacked and read) asking her to please stop being such a f*cking whore.



However for 3 years now, 3 whole years, 3 years of his life that he will never get back, 3 years, wasted, in total lack of productivity, unemployed, alone, and without a family, at the mercy of a psychopath when he should not have been, she STILL refuses to say she is sorry.  And what does she do instead?



She takes expensive shoping trips to London, exotic vacations to Paris, she campaigns for world hunger but she doesn't do jack crap for that dude whose life she basically destroyed and whose dreams she basically shattered.  In those 3 years he could have gone to art school while living with his folks, whom were taken from him when he was a baby.  In those 3 years, he could have gone to Japan and worked as a game designer, or at least a part of the "line" office workers, something small.



In those 3 years he could have made something of himself, being able to go to a school only his wealthy parents would have been able to afford, and even though she basically destroyed that opportunity and now he is way too old to do anything in the working world the f*cking whore has the nerve to send Monstrek Trak emails so that in her b*tch way she says "get a job."  So, she has the nerve to say "get a job" when she basically destroyed all chances he ever had, of making something of himself.



Just goes to show the true nature of the Jewish whore, Jewish whores are freaking whores who whore all day because they enjoy whoring the whores of the whores whores whores whores who whore.  Especially ashkenazi women.



You want to know what a "bad person" is?  Go look at an ashkenazi Jewish b*tch.



How can evil be defined?  Simple; the enormity of the universe.



Daoists say the following; "can a man compare himself to a mountain?  Can a singer sing as sweetly as the wind, and can even the most loving mother caress as gently as a warm spring?  What is man, intelligent as he is, strong as he is, compared to the nature that surrounds him?  What is man's accomplishments, buildings that crumble, knowledge that is forgotten, compared to the ever lasting sky?  Given the enormity of nature (the universe), to be self important, is to be evil.  If "good," is what lies within nature, that is, nature is as huge and powerful as it is, because it is 'good,' and no part of it is selfish.  There is no part of nature that lives for, or loves only itself, hence it endures long.  That is why therefore, to be self-important, is to go in contrary to the nature of nature, the nature of existence..."



Daoists are basically arguing here, that truly evil people, are people who love and live for, only for themselves.  Benjamin Franklin even warned "he who loves only himself will have no rivals."  If Evil then, is said to be pride, arrogance, a supreme belief that one is so important, they can basically do whatever the f*ck they want, or, they have a sense of self-importance placed there by their parents, and society at large, then it stands to reason that the most vile, cruel, and evil form of life on this planet, is the ashkenazi Jewish woman.



I mean, if I was a woman, and my c*nt was the ticket to the most exclusive country club in the world f*ck man I'd have a pretty big ego too, I would not have any semblance of humanity towards anyone except they who I thought were on the same level as I was.



Even though he has pleaded countless times, typed hundreds, tens of thousands of e-mails pleading, begging her to stop, to be a damned human being, she still stubornly refuses.  For 3 years.



I guess the victim of Natalie Portman has no recourse but to join the French Foreign Legion.  March or die baby.

unfortunatelly now a days our conceous ont allow us to think about "m i gud orm i bad" if ur concius is allowin u to do so , thn admitt it , n try to remove the cause which is tendin u to think so ...
my personal thinkin is tht very one is gorgeous in his or her own ways, every one is a gud person the bad are  the circumstances ....
the point is tht if ur soul is sayin to u tht u r bad man or u hav done somthin realli wrongthn there is nothin wrong in admitin tht , coz i knw by my very own experences tht confession is more hard thn persuin crime , n if u r doin ths thn surely u will goona feal change in urself , soon will find urself gud in many ways .........

What do you think this means?



My Philosophy teacher handed a piece of paper to each of us today- and then left.  He had written on the board:  "Read the paper, tell me what you think it means."
I know what I think it means... But I'm curious as to what you think it means... Let me know.  Here it is:



"Salvation needn't come at the cost of faith,
Love needn't die on the steps of hatred,
and One need not feel the pain of Death whispered.



I fear no man, nor God.
I fear not plague, nor death.
I fear only one-



I seek what I fear.
I fear what I seek.
I seek only thyself."



So what do you think it means?
I'm open to any answers... really.
Thanks.

<question>



Is this any reason to give a friend the silent treatment for a full month?



My friend is Bipolar and we've been intimate. I'm trying to make a very long story short:



1. My friend posted a myspace bulletin which said he got a new job at mcdonalds, and he posted the exact location.



2. Naturally I was thinking he posted the bulletin , which gave the exact location of his employemnt to ALL his friends, for a reason...because he wants his friends to visit him at mcdonalds.



3. I visited him at mcdonalds to surprise him and say hello.



4. He basically gives me the cold shoulder and ignores me



5. I write an email apologizing for the unnannounced visit



6. He accepts my apology with a two word email: "It's cool."



7. Ten days later when i dont hear from him i send an email saying " i miss you" and i ask "are you mad at me?"



8. He writes back "We cant talk anymore", then blocks me from his myspace , and removes me as a friend.



9. He ignores all my attempts to fix things (email, messages, text, voicemail, calls) for over a full month, a total of 35 days



10. We're friends again.



11. He claims the reason he gave me the "silent treatment" was because his new "boyfriend" was going to call the COPS on me for "stalking" him because I visited mcdonalds ( a public restaurant) just ONE time and for only 5 minutes.



11. It's not stalking if you only see someone ONCE and never do it again. Plus I apologized for the misunderstanding and he accepted my apology.



12. So it begs the question: Do you think he gave me the REAL reason why he gave me the "silent treatment" for 35 days?



We're friends now and I dont think it would be wise for me to "revisit the past" to find the "truth" because I value our friendship too much to lose him again.



</question>



<additional details>



they're no longer together now anyway



maybe thats why we are friends again

Assuming you're giving us the whole picture, and ignoring the moodswings that may arise with your friend being bi-polar, the answer seems rooted in his new "boyfriend", who sounds jealous of you and manipulative of your friend.



It's good you're friends again, but I'd advise you refrain from making any digs towards his boyfriend as it will get back to him and confirm his suspicion that you're a threat

A person is NOT synonymous with being a human. There are copious examples (even today) of human beings considered to be other things than persons - most often property instead. 'De-personing' someone is, in my observation, one of the most common ways of justifying behaviours that would otherwise be completely unacceptable if they were performed on another person. America de-persons criminals, terrorists, and enemies in war rather regularly.



Nor is a person a thinking being. A human who is mentally incapable may still be considered a person even when a genius is not. I can recall cases of people born without a brain having their rights staunchly defended and genius slaves being oppressed more BECAUSE they were smart.



I think we should take a cue also from children. Sometimes a child will insist on having a beloved stuffed animal given a place at the dinner table. And many men (more than you would think) present valentine's day gifts to their cars but not their spouses. What defense does a child give for this insistence? "They're a real person!"  A Hagerty survey on cars showed people spending more on their car than their significant other (60%), talking to it on a regular basis (62%), and even buying it a Valentine's Day gift (29%). Not exactly behaviours we would expect toward simple objects.



This suggests that 'personhood' is a status that we set in our minds. A person is someone who should be afforded rights and status similar to yourself. They are an entity and an individual worthy of a certain basic respect and tolerance. Someone who is NOT a person does not (in the mind of the viewer) deserve any of these things.



Who is a person and who is not, then, tells us a lot more about the being who is making such a declaration than the entities that he is talking about. Being a person is a judgement, not an intrinsic quality.



There are doubtlessly lots of different things people might use to make this judgement.  And intelligence probably helps, as does being alive.  But these are only in a populist sense and not definitional barriers.  My take, for what it's worth.

An interrogator is connected to one person and one machine via a terminal, therefore can't see her counterparts. Her task is to find out which of the two candidates is the machine, and which is the human only by asking them questions. If the machine can "fool" the interrogator, it is intelligent.

Hey, leave the monkey out of this!



It's very obviously just an insult. Constructive criticism is criticism that will help; they provide advice and examples and specifically point out the faults so that the author/artist/whatever will know what is wrong and will therefore be able to change it and improve.



Telling someone they suck worse than a monkey does not help.
"Ok, so I suck worse than a monkey...what now? I don't know what to change! D="



EDIT: We are not "advance versions of monkeys." We are, actually, very close relatives and did not evolve from monkeys, but rather bipedal hominids. We only share 98% of our genes with chimpanzees, and I believe a smaller percentage with other species of monkeys.



More over, you are being EHTNOCENTRIC. You shoud not be comparing and judging another culture's morals and intelligence based on your own. Primates have their own culture and just because they live in the wild it does not mean that they are more "heathen" or "savage" than we are. In fact, they feel emotions just as humans do and are able to solve complex problems and invent tools. They even have turf wars.

The "Art Renewal Center" claims that if you stare at an oil slick long enough, you will think that it's saying something to you. This isn't my opinion, though it rings somewhat true to me. I feel that landscapes, animals, and even small-scale still-lifes can also portray human emotions. And I feel that certain stylizations of these images can also bring even more emotion into the peice. But there's a point when stylization becomes complete abstraction, and I don't like it anymore.



So I think that both purely abstract works, and purely realistic peices, seem emotionless and dead. The real emotions lie between the two.

Freud's Oedipus Complex  ?



Do you see any merits to the Oedipus Complex? (Most would agree that actually desiring sex with one parent and killing off the other is a bit extreme, but could there be a “kernel” of truth in this theory about the way little boys & girls bond and develop early instinctive relationships with parents of the opposite sex?) Since this would be an example of the kind of desire that is “repressed” below the level of consciousness, what kind of clinical evidence might count for or against such a notion. Is a repressed desire inherently untestable?

Who is your favorite philosopher/s and why?



Feel free to add particular texts that may have changed your life.



I would say:



-Arthur Schopenhauer's "The World as Will & Representation", "Parerga and Paralipomena", and "Essays & Aphorisms"



-Karl Marx's "Kapital" and his and Engel's "Communist Manifesto"



-Ludwig Wittgenstein's "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus"

I like your choices - Western as they are.



Nagarjuna (150-250 ce) is a favorite for me because he previsions so many Westerners.  Nagarjuna describes findings of modern physics very accurately.



A direct parent of Marx, if you ask me....



"Nagarjuna's philosophy represents something of a watershed not only in the history of Indian philosophy but in the history of philosophy as a whole, as it calls into questions certain philosophical assumptions so easily resorted to in our attempt to understand the world.  Among these assumptions are the existence of stable substances, the linear and one-directional movement of causation, the atomic individuality of persons, the belief in a fixed identity or selfhood, and the strict separations between good and bad conduct and the blessed and fettered life.  All such assumptions are called into fundamental question by Nagarjuna's unique perspective which is grounded in the insight of emptiness (sunyata), a concept which does not mean "non-existence" or "nihility" (abhava), but rather the lack of autonomous existence (nihsvabhava).  Denial of autonomy according to Nagarjuna does not leave us with a sense of metaphysical or existential privation, a loss of some hoped-for independence and freedom, but instead offers us a sense of liberation through demonstrating the interconnectedness of all things, including human beings and the manner in which human life unfolds in the natural and social worlds."

<answer>



Today a child is learning to walk. She reaches across the table to test the feel of a whiskey bottle tipped over on its side in front of parents who are passed out and unable to know or care about this milestone in her development. The flavor of her first step comes from the drop of whiskey she samples from the fingers dipped in the puddle in front of the bottle.



Today a child is learning to walk. Daddy holds her wavering form patiently with hands ready to catch her from behind as she totters toward Mama whose hands are outstretched and ready to catch her from in front.



The equality of these two children is a principal of civil society one must stretch mightily to conceptualize, much less apply. Their inequalities will characterize their entire lives.

“Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.”



I agree with this quote the most. More often than not, we tend to limit our own potential and capabilities by getting affected by how others view us. If we just let ourselves go on with our lives unfettered by others' criticisms and discouragements, we probably would dare to do things which we thought are impossible for us before.



"I am responsible for myself and for everyone else.”



He sounds like an egoistic freak here. I say he's trying too hard to carry upon the world's responsibility on his shoulders.



"Even if God did exist, that would change nothing.”



If God exists, that in itself would be very much of a surprise already for most people, and wouldn't that be the most dramatic change ever experienced for mankind? Anything could happen then with such a revelation.

This is to the last answer, your statement "One could ask what good is wisdom without knowledge".



I believe that isn't correct, Because one can't be wise without knowledge, Solomon the wise emphasizes this in proverbs. So it's impossible for one to be wise and illiterate at the same time.

One could also ask what good is wisdom without knowledge.



You think the world is in disarray now?  It is a mistake to think that we live in a unique time in history.  Things could certainly be better, but they could also be much, much worse.  The wars of today are nothing compared to the struggles for our very existence against the Nazis & communists last century.  The economic crisis of today is nothing compared to the much higher unemployment rate and much lower standard of living in the Great Depression.



Wisdom, or lack of, is a part of human nature.  We are not so removed from the animals as many of us would like to think we are.  Humans are still quite susceptible to being swayed by their beliefs and emotions, and rational thought is still very much the exception rather than the rule.  We would rather be right than correct, so we cling to religions and political ideologies in spite of the chaos, strife and suffering they so plainly cause.  We are insecure, so we cling to nationalism and other forms of "us vs. them" thinking so that we have one group to feel connected to and another we can focus our more negative emotions on.



Knowledge is a tool, wisdom is how you use that tool.  That tool is certainly less effective if you don't know how to use it properly, but it's still better than not having it to use at all.  Knowledge has demonstrably made our society & civilization much better, despite our less-than-complete use of wisdom.



Besides, what most people call wisdom is really just opinion.  There often is no objectively "best way" to use knowledge.  Even in a perfectly rational world, how we use our knowledge depends on our needs, desires and priorities, all of which differ from one person to the next.

I don't believe beauty CAN be defined.
Beauty is purely an opinion. If there was no living, intelligent being to distinguish beauty then would it even exist?
Some may find something beautiful that others find ugly and so like other things such as "what defines good music", it has no definition.



On the other hand the dictionary defines beauty as "the qualities that give pleasure to the senses" so this definition can be applied separately to each individual but there is no universal definition that can be applied to everyone as a whole as it is purely opinionated.

Character.
Sophisticated.
I think that "character" and "Sophisticated" define beauty better then any other words.
It doesn't necessarily mean sexy or hot...or pretty.
A beautiful person is someone who can be beautiful, but also have a good character towards others.
Pretty and Beautiful are two totally different things.
Beautiful people will do good, nice things for others even though they're are aware of their beauty.
And Pretty people are stuck up and rude!

I see so many lost souls replying to questions here. It never too late to accept the forgiveness of sins any and all until you take your last breath on earth. Please seek God, Tell him if you are upset and why you feel the way you do. Ask him to show you if he is real. He will answer if you are sincere.

i have a different method of engendering my continuing personal quality, a different understanding of the connection that runs through us all, nonetheless despite this difference the result is the same - a life of spirit



thank you for your kind entreatment to seek god, i understand one cannot fail to wish to share the beauty of life once discovered -  but what is good for one may not work for another and i have personally rejected deferring to "god" to bring about my quality as religous spitiuality is not as effective or relevant method of being a good person as I am already using - I feel it would be a backwards step for me, But thank you anyway.

Do you ever feel like the world is full of hate and anger?



I'm an idealist-- I know, I know. I Do believe that there is much good in the world and in people, but am I the only one who's disgusted by what one person can do to others sometimes??  It's atrocious, and yet though there are people who try to make the world a better place, there really isn't a way to stop it.  I think it's wrong to close your eyes to the evils of the world and ignore them.  If you walk past a person in need, but only see someone with personal issues-- well, duh, everyone has their own issues, but walking by with veiled eyes... I think it's wrong.  Experience has taught me that more times than not, that those who you help aren't likely to appreciate it, and spit on you back, but I keep at it because there are people who you can help... those who need it... and are desperate. How is that people can close their eyes to the evils of the world like that-- I just don't understand. I mean, sure, you have your own lives and it may not be a top priority because we have things like families, children, or other obligations, but....

Yes, you can try to help others in the world, quite commendable conduct, but then you cannot carry the burdens of the world on your shoulders. Do whatever you can and do it for love of mankind and God but let your seeds of goodwill fall where they may, it is not for you to judge the outcome because, who knows!, somewhere down the line your small act of kindness will be remembered and just may turn a life around that needs direction. You don't know what or when, just leave that to God who is working through you!  ;- )



Regarding evil, you cannot see the beauty of a sunset if you're always looking at the ground, true? Nor can you see the Christ if your mind is dwelling on evil, so-called. You need to take time to connect with the higher energies, the Universal Consciousness, so that it can flow through you the individual and create a spiritual awareness in yourself and others.



There's another matter as well, all souls in this physical realm have certain lessons to be learned in one shape or another. Those who have been unjust in one life will likely be reaping the result of their previous actions in this life, that is, of experiencing unjustness this time around. As fellow human beings we can do our part to help humanity but certainly we cannot save the world! And it was not meant for us to do so. Try to find a balance somewhere in all this.

it is only because people are good in general that bad things stand out more than the good things.



all of the hate, anger etc. balances the rest out, as in my opinion, without the bad stuff, the good becomes meaningless as there is nothing to compare it too. It also serves as a reminder that humans aren't perfect, that is something that we need to be reminded of sometimes.

I definitely feel like the world is full of hate and anger. You can see a lot of it on the Internet, just by considering how people use this thing.

IDEALIST:

IDEALISM:
A theory that ultimate reality lies in a realm transcending phenomena; a theory that the essential nature of reality lies in consciousness or reason; a theory that only the perceptible is real; a theory that only mental states or entities are knowable.



Yes, I feel that the world has a lot of anger in it. You say you are an idealist, but I don't understand why you are telling us in this question, "but am I the only one who's disgusted by what one person can do to others sometimes?? It's atrocious", yet you answer depraved questions in a substandard category? (I saw it in your profile). It doesn't make sense.

Yes, there is a lot of hate and anger in the world, I use to give homeless people money all the time, but I found out after volunteering in a shelter not to give them money- but to give money to the shelters, american red cross, places like that- so they can actually help more people-some of the "homeless people" were con-artists, and sometimes you have to close your eyes to it because it is depressing- homeless people, abused people and animals, I think it is because the devil is alive and well living on the earth and doing what he can so more people can blame God for their problems. There is a lot people can do, even collecting old blankets for the animal shelter or coats for the homeless. But I have found that by volunteering I can do my part to help.

Their can only be one answer to  this question and that's yes you have to believe that everything will be alright.With out rain there can be no  rainbows.If their are no bad times how would we know or be thank full when the good times arrive.To not believe them is to admit defeat, to give up when their is a really good person who truly cares is wrong.If they can spend their time and energy supporting you then the least you can do is believe in them as they do you

I don't like or trust myself some days.  I guess that is a form of betrayal of self, whom I sometimes don't really love.



What I speak of, is when we look inward and don't really like what we see.  Not all the time, but on a given day.  There are times when we let ourselves down by failing to achieve, behave, or deport ourselves as we should.  We don't reach our "ideal" role model we have set for ourselves.



A betrayal of self by self, when you fail to love yourself for whom you really are.



I believe, also, we sometimes assume "possession" of others, in our mind.  A process wherein we find a friend and feel attached, or that we have a special relationship, but find they have other interests, and other friends.  Even though we assume the same privilege for ourselves, we can feel "let down" when we find we are not the center of attention of the other person.  Sometimes that comes as a shock to our ego.



We feel "betrayed", but is it by them, or is it by ourselves?  We love ourselves more than the other person, yet perceive "they" betrayed us!



Have we assumed too much?  Failed to take a realistic look at what is?  Not considered how our ego sometimes replaces common sense?  Lacked understanding of what "love" really is?



Strange, but very human behavior.

Yes, that's possible.  When we enter into friendship along with that comes an expectation that we'll get certain emotional needs met.  Sometimes we think the other person feels the same level of commitment to the friendship as we do, when actually they don't.  When something happens to bring that fact to our attention we feel betrayed.  We feel our "friend" has misrepresented him/herself.  We feel betrayed.

Yes, I think it is.



It is possible to be betrayed by anything and anyone. Perhaps betrayed isn't the right word, but we don't have a better one at our disposal.



For example: there is a boy I like at school. I by no means love him, but I think he's pretty cool. recently, he told me he likes one of my closest friends. I felt completely and utterly betrayed. And of course, poor guy, it wasn't his fault - life doesn't work like that (one person loves someone, the someone MUST reciprocate genuine love), but it was still an incredibly painful experience anyway.



I think betrayal is something we as individuals, and as communities, have to come to terms with, because, often, it is inevitable. Yet we SHOULD all try our utmost to make sure we can prevent any betrayal that we can. It's all we can really do.

The first person below stated it nicely.  Clearly this is about trust.



Thus a long term business associate with whom you have had dealings with and trusted will if he does something that hurts you by revealing secrets, stealing property, etc betray the other person.



Even a one time business transaction with a reputable firm that betrays your trust and cheats you will make you feel betrayed justifiably.

Wisdom does not always necessarily come with time or experience.  Wisdom comes to those with open hearts and open minds, and those willing and eager to learn.  I know of young people who are wiser than those decades older than them.

Astrological, metaphysical or physiological cycles come and go and we are only here for the ride.  Wisdom comes from accepting things as they are.  I am not so sure if acceptance comes after cycles.  Maybe if the cycle presented obstacles that created non-acceptance then perhaps you have a point.

Good question that ends with a five dollar word.  I almost believe that some do yoga in order to return to laxity they had as a child.  It is said that some village leaders are chosen because of their yoga abilities.  I think that maybe stress and fear cause our bodies to tighten thus making us ridged and unbending in our minds and hearts.

good question, after pondering on it I'd like to conclude that our intellect is something that 'nobody' can take from us. the ability to have 'intellect' is something we were born with and interactions with others simply increases your intellect or knowledge. You can't torture 'intellect' away because it's still stored in your brain and it can't be brainwashed away because 'intellect' allows us to fight back with reason and logic.



BTW just because 'nobody' can take it away doesn't mean it can't be taken away... there are always freak accidents like falling off a cliff to consider.

The mind's will or desire to act is the only possession we truly can have but this can be taken from us by people who threaten or intimidate you physically or psychologically. Giving in to a person who does this is merely relinquishing the sense of control and never truly releases the actual control we have over ourselves. Hypnotic suggestion might be something that might be contrary to this although it is quite possibly another way of submitting our control to another person.

A simple question with a simple answer. Introspection is best undertaken when inspired rather than at a time set aside. In love we look deep within for the soul awakened and alive. In anger we reach into our fury to find the root of our rage and extinguish it or cure. In thoughtful moments of truth seeking we are supplicated sufficiently to probe deeply into the recesses of our psyche for ancient truth closeted within a case of our hidden aspirations, invocative thinking and slumbering love.



Introspection yields in measure of the seekers imagination. A multi faceted being will  approach the side of his tempered admission, and find his reflection therein, reason to be happy, causes for doubt, and basis for fear are echoes of man own orchestrated thoughts, lived, lying latent as sleeping unawakened dreams.

Loyalty is earned. I'll not give my loyalty to someone who doesn't deserve it. Much like friendship, it's also something that once lost, is not easily regained. You have many people who simply don't have the capacity for loyalty to anyone or anything.
I have no trouble being loyal to a person who's earned the honor of receiving my loyalty. It is their job to earn my loyalty, not my job to give loyalty (or honor for that matter) to them.



I am first loyal to my core values. These are nonnegotiable, and are the grounding for my life. If someone can compromise their principals, they're not going to be worthy of much loyalty by others.
In conclusion, "find[ing] it easy to be loyal" isn't the real question here. The question is do you know someone worthy of your loyalty.



Be well all.

I think the "it" is the idea that we are only given one life to live. The body you were born with, the family and friends, the education opportunities and career choices. You only get one chance. Some people feel the need to question if their life as a whole is all they are going to experience as a person.
That raises questions such as "is there life after death?", "have we been here before?" and "is there life away from Earth?"
I think it is human nature to want more and to experience more, and being told that you're only going to get one go, for an average of 80-odd years, with no ability to start again, rewind or fast forward, is not a satisfying thing to hear.
Hopefully you won't ask yourself this question too often and will learn to appreciate what you have and make the most of it, just in case this isn't a rehearsal :)

I believe there is such an epidemic. The only thing that can be done about it is typically when one such apathetic person gets affected personally by something they were once careless about. For example, pain is something a lot of people are uncaring about. When one gets hurt, other say "I'm sorry," or "I understand," when really they aren't that sorry and they don't understand. However, when the apathetic person gets hurt, they expect others to feel sorry for them, and understand them.

What you describe are also symptoms of depression.



People have differing priorities. Because something is important to me, doesn't mean that it is important to you. Labeling it as apathy may just be a difference in priorities. Some might consider me apathetic about the environment. The environement is not a priority for me. Although it is for others. To claim that I am apathetic would be a disservice to what I do feel is important in life.

Heaven/hell/afterlife in general?



Well, I personally am not entirely sure as to whether I believe in the idea of some kind of afterlife, but I thought this could be an interesting topic of debate:



What if THIS life is the afterlife, and we all died in some other life, but just don't remember it? That THIS is it - heaven, hell, whatever you want to call it?



There are probably thousands of holes in this 'theory' (I don't believe myself :P) but it could be true, right? And isn't it ironic that we all spend so much time thinking/worrying about life after death if it turns out this is actually IT? And there is no perfection, or paradise, or garden of Eden anywhere, but that this is as good as it gets?

<answer>



Morality in a virtue of a free will, afforded to the morally conscious



The will can only be considered free when the mechanism or trigger inciting need desire or action is located and controlled. Until man hasn’t the ability to understand why he desires, wants, seeks a specific other than ‘because it is his will and impulse to do so’ , until he understand s what occasions the will, incites the impulse, he is controlled by forces unknown to him, with no great purpose of interest to his long term moral welfare of good.



Morality is not adhered to by fear of reprisals, public condemnation, or fall from grace, rather because it is understood matters immoral, promiscuous or illicit are the path and means to an ulterior end, rather than the goal and purpose themselves. If he chooses his path by reason, than impulsive lust and exploited chance he finds not the love and fals into a habitual search for titillation woefully temporal and transient.



This means man seeks peace, respite from stress, exhilaration, bliss, and the euphoric release of endorphins caused by a heightened state of joy or love. Immoral paths or means are questionable, and temporary in the quest for the end. If man seeks to accomplish the end, a perpetual condition of love and pleasure, his means must ne entirely aligned to his cause, and relegated to a path. If man becomes lost in the entrapments towards peace and liberation, he gains not the utopian state of paradise, rather finds momentary happiness from ill considered and designed places and motives and lapses into aggreivment at his inability to secure a path without knowledge of the end.

The above answer isn't Kantian philosophy.



First please understand Kant re-defined "free" and "will" and choice in his ethical system.  He would have said "NO" to your question, since moral law would be considered absolute and "free will" is derived from the knowledge of a moral law.  In other words Kant was a MORAL ABSOLUTIST.  The famous argument being, it is ALWAYS WRONG TO LIE, even if you are lying to a murderer about the location of his next victim.  In a sense such as the above, can you get the concept of a "free will"?  No, certainly though you can see choice as it relates to the moral law.



The point is Murder from your perspective could be considered a GOOD THING, supposing for an instant that the murderer was constraining your life in some way.  That is one of the problem with ethical systems (namely utilitarian).  Hence Kant's creation or re-creation (I should say) of an absolutist ethical system.

I don't believe in cyclical nor linear time. But, the "Wheel of Time" concept has been around since the Middle Ages, and likely in pre-Christian pagan cultures. (It seems classical to me) The idea that political, social, philisophical and other movements return is how I view cyclical time. Look at the classical art of the American revolution. But, I don't believe this means that one day again there will be an Atlantis, and a disaster, and eventually a return to barbaric, non-scientific cultures, then a return of Egypt, and Greece and Rome, and a fall, and then a new Enlightenment, etc. I don't believe in a direct wheel.

Small amounts of time are measured - in our modern times - in a cyclical fashion.  Twenty four hour clock, 7 day week, 12 month year - all repeating itself.  Long term, however, is measured in a linear fashion - with time literally marching on - adding year after year.



I look at it as very cyclical, in my life - it seems that times repeat themselves frequently for me, and it is more comforting to think of it in those terms....

Here are what some noteworthy people have said of Jesus Christ:



*** gt The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived ***



The historian H. G. Wells said that a man’s greatness can be measured by ‘what he leaves to grow, and whether he started others to think along fresh lines with a vigor that persisted after him.’ Wells, although not claiming to be a Christian, acknowledged: “By this test Jesus stands first."
--Napoleon is reported to have said: “Jesus Christ has influenced and commanded His subjects without His visible bodily presence.”
--Will Durant argued: “That a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the Gospels.”
--As one writer aptly expressed it: “All the armies that ever marched, and all the navies that ever were built, and all the parliaments that ever sat, all the kings that ever reigned, put together have not affected the life of man upon this earth as powerfully.”
--Yes, think about it. Even calendars today are based on the year that Jesus was thought to have been born. “Dates before that year are listed as B.C., or before Christ,” explains The World Book Encyclopedia. “Dates after that year are listed as A.D., or anno Domini (in the year of our Lord).”
--Even a Hindu, Mohandas Gandhi, was moved to say: ‘I love Christ, but I despise Christians because they do not live as Christ lived.’

Why should mankind involve in activities that result in sufferings, terror, hatred, fighting, killings etc?



Suppose the average human life in today's world is not more than 60 years. If you analyse the break-up of activities associated with these 60 years of your life, you can see that it more or less matches with the following:



* 12 Years in Working



* 22 Years in Sleeping



* 04 Years in Routine Travelling



* 05 Years in Eating



* 03 Years in Bathing, Dressing etc...



* 06 Years in Useless Chatting, Gossip



* 04 Years in Sickness & Illness



* Balance ? Only 4 Years



Our only question to one and all is, why should mankind think, involve in activities that result in sufferings, terror, hatred, fighting, killings etc... in the short span of 4 years left to them. It needs to be utilized in a better way by doing all good things, helping others and thanking God for the opportunity given to us in being a human being... Live and Let Live.

First, I'd like to know where you found this info - it is interesting and I'd like to read more on it.
Second, the nature of mankind is violent - we struggle to keep that under control.  Some people succeed, some don't.  The difference in them is hard to really measure - and I'm not sure how we could figure out what makes one person calmer, one more violent (or more angry, or more meek, etc.)
I agree that there are far more important or contributing things we could all be doing.  But that goes for watching tv, going to the movies, etc too, don't you agree.  Mankind is what he is - he will not change over night - he will change over centuries.  We must do the best we can, and then hope others will too.

Are you for or against gay marriage?



I think it is very un-American to say gay marriage is wrong. I think that that makes you a control freak and how would you like if someone told you you cant marry your true love? It would be a Romeo and Juliet story. Or how about the planned marriages some children are born into? Don't you think that is wrong and that that should be up to the person themselves? Or what about in the time period where 13 year old girls were sold to be married to 40 year old men? Shouldn't they have been given the right to say no? How is gay marriage any different? If you say its not right or if its against God or its not natural I beg to differ. If you say its against God first of all not everyone believes in God. And secondly people don't just become gay they are born gay. So if God creates you and you are created gay from the very beginning isn't that God saying its ok because he was the one that let it happen??!!!?? And if you say its not natural lemme tell you this why would males have their "g spot" or access to their prostate in their anus unless your body was created to go either way?? why the hell else would that be there? I really hope people will grow up and stop being childish about this because isn't someone else's happiness more important that your opinion? And life is short alot shorter than some of you may realize and now a days theres so little happiness people experience so why would you want to deny some of the little bit of happiness someone might experience in their life time? What would you do if you weren't allowed the happiness to marry someone you love????????

First let me just say this.  I hope that you will read it and see the value in it, so that we can change the system to something that actually works.



MARRIAGE IS A RELIGIOUS IDEA, historically, it is.  I am not debating religions, I am debating the origin of marriage.  That being said WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT INVOLVED IN THE MARRIAGE BUSINESS????



They need to get out of it and let people do what they want to do.  Hence the above practical application of infridgement of the Establishment Clause.

About me if someone is gay or not isn't a problem... I think that a gay must have the same right of a man who love a women! (sorry for my english... I'm Italian...) But I live in a country where when a 2 boys hang around hand in hand every people watch them and have fear. Americans are luckyer from Italians because in Americn there isn't a pope who say every day that God doesn't approves gay's marriages!

Although i believe in the moral superiority of homosexual love to heterosexual, i am against gay marriage because it sets marriage up as a desirable standard, thereby implying that the more enlightened possibilities available to a sexuality which has never had the institution of marriage.  Rather than legalising gay marriage, heterosexual marriage should be abolished as a legal institution, as it is nothing more than legally sanctioned rape and slavery of women by men.

Love, schmove - civically speaking, marriage is an economic arrangement where 2 people share a household. Marriage benefits are society's way of encouraging that arrangement. That's all the gov't should be concerned with, right? Not their sex life, or their gender. If society is worried about the sex of the 2 people, then it must be interested in encouraging the reproductive success of people in certain economic arrangements. That's not all that unreasonable, actually. I think that's what the anti-gay-marriage position comes down to, for those people who aren't just homophobic. Well, okay, so most anti-GM folks are homophobic and those that aren't, explain their POV as if they were either homophobic, or confused about the roles of religion and state. But I think this is the "real" reason why people resist the idea of state-administered gay marriage.



Personally, I think it comes down to pure sex discrimination. I agree with you; think a person's right to be recognized as a family member of someone they share a household with, shouldn't depend on sex. As long as society approves of 2-adult households and encourages them economically in law, then it should approve them the same regardless of who the adults are. As a society striving to be egalitarian, we have a standard of fairness to uphold. Besides, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that gay people who adopt and raise kids, are somehow a bad influence on society.

he attitude towards homosexuality has varied throughout the different times and between the diverse groups and cultural sub-groups, oscillating between the acceptance (in old Greece), the tolerance (in the Roman Empire) and the absolute sentence (in many western and Eastern societies). Nevertheless, great part of the lack of understanding and the existing prejudices against homosexuality comes from their classification like disease in century XIX. The German neuropsicólogo Richard von Krafft-Ebing considered one " neuropática degeneration hereditaria" that supposedly one worsened by an excessive masturbation. Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud postulated the existence of a constituent predisposition, although also she emphasized the determining effect of experiences during the childhood (like, for example, the lack of an ancestor of the same sex with which to be able to identify itself) and the frequency of masculine homosexual experiences during the adolescence, that considered like sexual deviation. The publication of two studies on the sexual behavior in men and women, that carried out the American biologist Alfred Charles Kinsey, refuted the hypothesis of the disease. Psychological tests realised to homosexuals and heterosexuals showed that it among them were no pathological aspects differentiators. Although some evidences exist - in studies of twin binoculars and that suggest them genes can be a factor in the sexual direction, other theories affirm that it is more probable that the determining factors are the experiences lived during the childhood. In 1973, the Psychiatric Association of the United States eliminated the homosexuality of its list of mental diseases and, in 1980, of the DSM, Manual of Classification of the Mental Diseases of the WHO.

As a woman, do you think an ideal man is the one who wants to be "babied" around as his mother by you? ?



By the term "babied" I dont' mean that he has to be a coward, weak or not man enough to afford his life, family or other usual manly responsibilities. By this terminology, I mean the usual love of a woman towards a man i.e. caring for his food, clothing, his environment, his likes, dislikes, etc. And in return, he reciprocates the same as well by treating her as his ONLY woman out of the 2.5 billion women out there in this world. However, if he does not find any such woman out there, why is it blamed on him to be dis-loyal, multiple flings, playboy and all other usual bad image of a man in front of a moder woman today? From the natural point of view, do you think a woman has more capability, perseverance, strength and endurance to give love to the man as her own "baby" instead of treating him as a stranger for the rest of her life and always so much ready to leave him for any stupid reason? I think true men have this capability to bear all the usual emotional diarrhea of a woman, provided she is "babying" him around as his true love forever. Agreed?

Three types of tears are generated by the human eye. Basal tears protect the eye and keep it moist. Reflex tears flush out the eye when it becomes irritated. And emotional tears flow in response to sadness, distress, or physical pain.



Studies have shown that emotional tears contain more manganese, an element that affects temperament, and more prolactin, a hormone that regulates milk production. Sobbing out manganese and prolactin is thought to relieve tension by balancing the body’s stress levels and eliminating build ups of the chemicals, making the crier feel better.



But this minor physiological benefit aside, the most likely reason we produce emotional tears is because it’s a means of communication. Before babies can speak, they can cry. The only way for infants to express frustration, pain, fear, or need is to cry. Adults may use crying to bond with other humans. Expressing sadness can prompt comfort and support from peers. Different languages can provide barriers to spoken communication, but emotions are universal. There are also culturally acceptable reasons for crying that bring people together, such as at funerals or weddings.

Crying is a way for your body to release emotion. If you think about it, you cry when your sad, happy, suprised, nervouse etc. It's a reaction your body has to all the hormones from emotion it's receiving.



ON a more scientific note, tears are used by your body to push unwanted substance out of your body. For example, if you get something in your eye, your eyes begin to tear, releasing whatever it was that got stuck !



I dont think there have been any life studies but that would be an interesting experiment to conduct. You should try it !

It's an emotional signal to others and it involves the excretion of manganese.  Emotional tears contain manganese but tears caused by, say, onions, don't.  I don't know why.  Contact lenses can become stained pink by manganese if the person wearing them cries a lot for emotional reasons.



Some people, me included, believe that humans went through an amphibious phase in their evolution quite recently.  The only other mammals to cry emotional tears are seals, and whales constantly secrete tears to protect their eyes.  It may therefore be a form of excess salt excretion, though why sweat glands and kidneys aren't enough i don't know.  However, this makes sense to me phenomenologically, as to me, emotional crying feels like excreting sadness and a release, rather like taking a dump to be frank.

Heaven/hell/afterlife in general?



Well, I personally am not entirely sure as to whether I believe in the idea of some kind of afterlife, but I thought this could be an interesting topic of debate:



What if THIS life is the afterlife, and we all died in some other life, but just don't remember it? That THIS is it - heaven, hell, whatever you want to call it?



There are probably thousands of holes in this 'theory' (I don't believe myself :P) but it could be true, right? And isn't it ironic that we all spend so much time thinking/worrying about life after death if it turns out this is actually IT? And there is no perfection, or paradise, or garden of Eden anywhere, but that this is as good as it gets?

If this is the Afterlife, thank God I die...



Immanual Kant said (not exactly but something to this effect).  In order for their to be anything, there has to be JUSTICE somewhere.  We know that there is NO justice here, so it must be in the afterlife.



The problem with "the world" today is that we have lost our absolutes.  There is a MORAL ABSOLUTE.  TRUTH DOES EXIST.  TRUTH IS UNCHANGING.  JUSTICE DOES EXIST.



Because the above is true, even more so if it is untrue here, then we get back to the point of God and First Cause arguments.



Because the above is true, even more so if it is untrue here - I wanted to define this point, because I can't take it for granted that every1 will understand the point:



Mathmatics is a form of truth.  2+2 = 4.  So, we know there is such a thing and have seen such a thing as TRUTH, but it isn't everywhere, but it IS A GOVERNING PRINCIPLE in the universe.  So, if 2+2 = 4, why the hell can't people behave?  That is the point, eventually you get back to God and First Cause arguments.

Dreamer, you're not the only one... No it wouldn't mean that you're mad or wrong. Majority is nothing when it's about truth or lies, right or wrong. If 100 people claim that 2 and 2 make 5, would that be true - no? You've received an enlightenment and gained wisdom. That's why those questions are in your mind. But the tough war is still to face and that is to answer these questions in reality...

Here's your goal, in your words;
"What if I said no to the divisions of the world? What if I said no to intolerance and racism? What if I said no to the selfish and materialistic mind set of today.?



What if I said no and helped someone instead? What if I said no and fed the hungry? What if I said no and took in the abandoned children? What if I said no and loved those who lived differently from me? What if I said no to war and yes to peace?"



To achieve progress toward these goals you have to accept the reality of the system you live in and find ways to work within it to bring about such changes.  You will find that many people agree with this goal but it takes a strong, educated and realistic leader to accomplish this.  And hang in for the long road - it won't come easy and it won't be fast.  But wth the right choices you could become a leader for a better world.

"What if I said no to the selfish and materialistic mind set of today.?



Wouldn't I be the only one? Wouldn't I be the animal? If the majority of the human race thinks opposite to the way I do, doesn't that make me mad? Doesn't that make me inhuman?"



No. Of course not. But suggesting that you're the 'only one' who thinks that way makes you sound a little contradicting to the selfish mindset of society. I don't completely understand why you perceive the world as such a horrible place. Yes, we're corrupted, self-absorbed, judgmental, we make mistakes constantly, we're too easily influenced and all of the above. But if we weren't all that would we be considered human at all? Being human doesn't necessarily mean that we should all strive to be perfect, after all, everybody has different views on what it means to be a human being. I agree that it's absolutely disgusting to see the extent of the damage that we're capable of, but the fact is -- it's inevitable, when you consider the diversity of society.



You can't insist on being the victim here. What I'm trying to say is that we can't help the corruption any more than you can. But although we can't reverse it, we can try to work from it. Don't be so ignorant for a sec. Look around, we ARE helping. We ARE making an effort, and that's what's important right now. Less focus on the damage, more focus on the future.



So, no. Wanting to help doesn't make you any less human or make you an 'animal.' Just remember to also accept that society is what it is, flaws and all.

Turning the page will mean facing the future or even the unknown in life.



Yes, at times it would be so much simpler not to do it, just chuck everything out the window and have done with life's demands! But that's the easy way. Indirectly it also means you prefer to accept failure or defeat instead of meeting the challenge whatever it may be.



There's a saying, "You only fail when you stop trying." Personally, I don't intend to fail, not yet, not while I can stand up and be a living, breathing person! Maybe I'm stubborn but taking on the rough road makes one appreciate the smooth ride afterwards. We'll know the difference once we've navigated through the bumps in the road, true?



Just my thoughts. Oh, and you can turn those stumbling blocks into stepping stones.

I believe that everyone, in at least one point in our lives, go through this phase.  Life is hard and problems will always be present.  It's just a matter of how we would deal with the problems we face.



Sometimes, we're still reluctant to turn the page because we're obviously still not ready to see what's on the next page of our book.  We're still trapped with the present situation and are still finding a way of how to understand the things that are happening in this current page.  But there are times when I feel that this will do us some good.  Because the more we stay in one page, the more we learn and understand about the difficulties in life.  So the next time we encounter them in the succeeding pages, we'll know how to deal with them.



Just continue on your book.  Don't do stupid things and don't waste your life.  Don't be too eager to face death.  We're all headed there anyways.

Piised?....uh Maybe!....the fact of the matter is "Obama got elected,...I could say the same thing about George Bush jr though......The math is irrelevent apparently. The math being pretty much the actual numbers. If you do the math, you'll find that Bush jr. has most assuredly taken this country over the edge of reality and you and your kids will be paying for this for years to come.....Now, Obama?..he just comes after the facts, he inherits all this from Bush jr.......that pisses me off...I don't much care if someone is democrat or republican so long as they do a good job...in this case, OBama will have to do a superb job to get past Bush jr's screw ups.  So Iet me guess,.....since you don't like Obama,....then if you're a person named barack then you can't ever do a good job?....what if your name is George? or Bill?.  why isn't the math important here?

Nope, I'm relieved. There was a lot to like about McCain, but the better candidate won. Frankly, among your list of concerns, I'd only worry about your pro-life views being threatened. You're not going to pay more taxes (unless you're rich), the military will stay #1 in the world, Israel will be fine, marriage will be redefined by the states and not the federal gov't, and you'll still be able to have the guns you want. Ron Paul was the only guy who believed in small gov't, and the GOP doesn't care for him.

Aristotle believed virtues led to happiness. And virtues meant the act of achieving balance and moderation.
He spoke about achieving happiness which is not an emotional state; it is more about being all that you can, fulfilling your potential. The idea is that by living in a way that reaches your full potential you bloom or flourish and so display the best version of you that you can be.



So for him it was the act of living in balance and moderation that brought the highest pleasure. Not in the action itself, but in the way of life. It is this way of life that would lead to the greatest long-term value rather than just a passing amusement.



For him contemplation was the highest activity humans could do. Contemplation is the activity that refines and discovers virtues. Carried out continuously it allows you to reach your potential.

Yes Stige, that is the biggest question now. Will he be able to bring about the change. Lobbies are still there, conservative forces are very powerful, and the country is in deep crisis... but crisis means change.



Politically, he has the Senate and the House of representatives on his side (Democrats). So theoretically, the Democrats should be able to implement some changes. The populaton will also be supporting him for a good while...



So let's wait and see in practice. Given what Obama has been able to accomplish so far, he surely deserves some credit - he has proven his strength and ability as a politician - and the genius of his political team.

Aren't people being unrealistic just because he has broken the colour-barrier?  Expectations are running high as if The Guy is a magician with a wand...Swoosh!  Abracadabra...and all ills disappear overnight!!!



I've really started to worry about him now!  What if he is unable to reverse his country's misfortunes,  the mess created by his predecessors?  Will the colour bias return with doubled hatred?

Obama has the same powers as any president before him. He will face the same challenges, meet the same resistance... and have a population of disloyal Americans who question him... just like any other president before him. He will get just as little done as anyone. And we all will criticize the leadership, and thus the democratic process, just like we do for every president.  And its not necessarily the presidents fault, so much as the government around him and the citizens who fail to support him.  He will get the wrap for prior presidents miserable policies, and take their praise as well for their good works; as it is for every president.  The three years before he is replaced, we will be listing all the things we hate about him... just like we do every four years.  How long will it take for you, and everyone else, to deny ever voting for him?

Jaajajajaajajajajaj. Good question my dear Stige!



It occurrs the same in my country whenever a new president is elected. Even the current one seems sensible, but not his followers, that are pollutionated by Maya, materialism, centered-ego life, etc.



A country doesnt change with a  only man having not approriate followers with his same ideals, assuming that Obama has good ideals, ¿who knows? He says lot of nice things, like all cheap politicians, but, ¿does he "feel" what he says? Lets assume that, ¿what about the three hundred million people completely in the darkness of materialism and sex (¿do you remember  Clinton¨s show off?). The mind doesnt change overnight; it needs a slow procces of time, even during several generations.



In addition, when the frame of economy is weak, and still descending, not even Pericles or Solomon could turn the fate of E.U. Obama has taken a injured patient, and cant do anything about him, just to see him dying.



Tha masses dont change with a only man or woman, but changing the most of them at the same time, and that is really far away from american s mindset, and this applies to all the nations and the word as a whole.

As a woman, do you think an ideal man is the one who wants to be "babied" around as his mother by you? ?



By the term "babied" I dont' mean that he has to be a coward, weak or not man enough to afford his life, family or other usual manly responsibilities. By this terminology, I mean the usual love of a woman towards a man i.e. caring for his food, clothing, his environment, his likes, dislikes, etc. And in return, he reciprocates the same as well by treating her as his ONLY woman out of the 2.5 billion women out there in this world. However, if he does not find any such woman out there, why is it blamed on him to be dis-loyal, multiple flings, playboy and all other usual bad image of a man in front of a moder woman today? From the natural point of view, do you think a woman has more capability, perseverance, strength and endurance to give love to the man as her own "baby" instead of treating him as a stranger for the rest of her life and always so much ready to leave him for any stupid reason? I think true men have this capability to bear all the usual emotional diarrhea of a woman, provided she is "babying" him around as his true love forever. Agreed?

Emancipation has not entirely worked in women’s favour, most work and do household duties and have caused anger and resentment in their relationships. Life is about winning favour and respect from those in important positions in our life, parent’s siblings and above all spouse. A woman will lavish hours of time preparing to go out on a date, but feel brewing a coffee, or clearing up after him a slight upon her sense of equality. The cosmetic industry is a trillion dollar industry, surgical enhancement, lingerie, make up, perfumes, beauty salon treatment. If woman applied their time and effort into caring about their partners and finding happiness in maintaining all their relationships with diligence, they are greater rewarded for less expense.



Unfortunately we are in crazy and madding times, and the struggle for power and dominance in the home and workplace makes for a highly stresses life for men and women. So much knowledge and so little understanding, so much talk, with little effective communication. Mothers counsel their daughters to be wife, mother, PA, cook and best friend, a man so indulged will rarely stray. Yet frictions occur, a small matter is blown out of proportion, and ingrained hatred festers causing matrimony o become not a sanctum but an institution and life sentence.



Pampering some people spoils them, and neglect destroys a bond. Relationships, friendships, and family ties and nurtured, forged with love and sensitivity are likely to be enduring, if one is less than caring or attentive, rifts occur and once distance is set or intrusion by a third party, it becomes difficult to forgive. Emotional intelligence is of equal if not greater value than intelligence.

I have several ideas/theories. I feel we were made by many Gods and Goddesses, not just one god like the Christan's and Catholics believe though. And they made the universe and all the planets and brought life onto one or two of the planets but the other planet(s) that had life on them didn't fare to well. So the Gods and Goddesses put their heads together sorta-speak, and made Earth and created all sorts of lives here. Over a long period of time, like an artist constantly going over his or her work. When they felt pleased with what they had done they left elsewhere possibly to continue it or to watch us as we are now.



Another one is that other forces, scientific ones or not, kind of like...accidentally created all sorts of life on the planet. This planet alone. And so that's how we got the various plants, bugs, animals, and so on. Any number of things could have happened to make us humans so different than all the other animals of forms of life. One could be that we simply adapted/adjusted better and quicker than other animals did. This could be because of the forces that made us.



Another is simply Mother Nature creating life. She's a mother, she wanted something(s) to take care of just like any other mother would. And so she created us humans and the other animals. She could have created us humans to do a job in caring for the other animals that she could not. But then she realized she needed something, some way, to balance it all out and so that's how we got two genders.



But this is all just my thinking and thoughts. Much luck.

I think we came into existence as particles of what the natural elements of Earth produces in the "habitable zone." For instance, the natural elements and gases are indeed made of energy, and I believe when those partials (called cells) formed from the elements, they grew more complex, and over time, developed into all these animals, forests, and grasslands. During lifetime, lifeforms used the energy to survive and keep growing, (like oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide.) After we formed, we reproduced and added more to our existence. That's for all lifeforms. New things are discovered in the solar system, and chances are, they form from simple combinations of the correct energy.

Of course! For one, when you have the sudden realization of what you've done, you then will contemplate your actions and possibly will resent it.



You may also feel hurt without yourself knowing it... As you feel numb in emotions, it may take its toll on your body, on your spirit, and in your mind...



You may burn yourself out or just poorly treat your body as you can care less anymore.



Your soul may dwell in emptiness and bottle you in your thoughts and emotions.



And lastly, it might turn you into a monster. If not that, you'll be more accustomed to having bad habits.



Everything happens for a reason. And there's a consequence for everything.

for example:

"a philosophy of math" would be one particular viewpoint.

A philosophy is a particular way of thinking about the world (or universe) around you. For example: Nihilism (is A philosophy)



PHILOSOPHY is the broad subject of study. For example: I would study (a philosophy) Nihilism in philosophy class (class touching on several different philosophies)



THE philosophy, could refer to many things. It could be the subject of a sentence (in this case a specific study). For example: "Let us go study THE philosophy of ethics."
Or THE philosophy could be referring to the ultimate philosophy. For example: THE tree (supreme, ruling, special) verses A tree (minor, mediocre) - THE philosophy (supreme, ruling, special), verses A philosophy (minor, mediocre)

Truth trees / indirect truth tables ?



may I ask someone to explain very simply, the methodology behind constructing truth trees?



I get the indirect truth tables so I thought that truth trees were the same, but I'm not getting how I break down premises based on the truth tree rules I have in front of me?  Just not making sense, I need guidelines / explanation.

<answer>



All it is is a truth by contradiction proof... except that you take every avenue of possibility at the same time.  You are accounting for the truth value of every uncertainty that exists.  Only in contradiction does a "branch" fail.



This is used to prove the invalidity of an argument.



If you assume the falsity of the intended conclusion and add that to your premises, then you are proving or disproving the validity of the counter argument.  If the counter argument is proven invalid through contradiction in every branch, then you prove the original argument valid.

I don't like coffee, so I have no use for mugs of that kind.



I do however sort my dvd's :)
I have them all sorted on colour, so my dvd's can be compared to your coffe mugs. Although I'm quite sure that looking at them for me is a lot more exciting. Especially when you add a dvd player.



Coffee mug + dvd player = round stain on dvd player
Dvd + dvd player = Fun :)



But on the other hand:



Coffee mug + Coffee = perfect match
Dvd + Coffee = Sticky dvd-sleeves

Heh.  The answer to that question is pretty much the entire essay.  But we can probably summarize a bit more briefly.



Probably the place where he makes the distinction best is where he talks about trying to imagine what it would be like to be a bat.  You can imagine that your arms are wings, that you have webbing between your fingers, or that you can tell where things are by listening to echoes.  But even if you imagine all these things perfectly, you still don't know what it's like to BE a bat... just what it's like to be a human IMAGINING he's a bat.



This difference is what he suggests defies reductionist accounts.  It doesn't matter how much you know about wings, because you can't know what it's like to really have them as part of you like a bat does.

If we have yet to really know what we are talking about then that means that as much as we like to think we know it all there is still more to learn.



I actually like that thought of having more to learn, more mysteries to solve, and so on and such. I don't like science telling everyone that, "This is how it is, our studies and research prove that these are the facts. Live with them!" I don't like that. So in a sense I guess I'm saying I'm okay with not know 210% what I'm talking about, but rather learning as I go what the real truths are about it.



Much luck to you.

Are you trying to torture me with these mind-boggling question?  I know nothing about philosophy.  It confounds me altogether.  i do, however, know what I am talking about and what I am doing.



Zen Buddhism can offer you an answer.  Right now I am having a thought about how annoying your question is.  My thought is the more recent in a series of thoughts.  The thought that immediately preceded it one of how much I would love to see the death of a certain woman and how evil I am to wish she was dead.  I also have had thoughts about the contents of your link.  I have been having thoughts about entropy and evolution and how much it does not make sense that evolution is the antithesis of entropy.  If anything, increased diversity and the growth of freaky species is a manifestation of entropy.  I am not into physics.  However, I do know, and, objectively, I have been having thoughts about this matter, that entropy entails a loss of heat accompanied by an increased level of disorder.  I also have been experiencing recollections of the words of neurotic scientists  A have been making value judgements about the mindsets of these scientists.



Do you think that the French on Yahoo! Answers might turn some of the people over to Mental Health so Mental Health can look after them?  The French love to turn people into Mental halth to be "looked after".  The paranoids who have legitimate concerns about being stalked by rolls and interrupted too frequently by Yahoo! Answers staff taking their coffee breaks get to take the first tranquillizers.  The members of the Guild of Unemployed Philosophers get to take the heavy duty psychotic medication.  I am giving my pills over to Wendy B. even if she is pregnant.

In Plato's "Meno," the fact we have opinions, some better than another, points at the truth. It is hardly contentious that a mechanic knows how to fix cars better than most people, or that a physicist understands celestial phenomena better.



Where the real argument lies is whether or not right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, honorable and dishonorable can be fixed in such a way. Again, the Platonic teaching does not allow relativism, even as it prepares the ground for debate - all societies aim at what is just, and despite their disagreements, some societies turn out to be more unjust than others simply. Nazi Germany was evil - period, end of conversation. People who look up to it usually want to cause harm.



The thing about the opinion/truth relation is that "truth" in moral matters is almost useless because the nature of politics requires expedience. So "opinion" 9 out of 10 times is good enough for us - we put you before the jury, they figured out you were guilty, let's get the sentence carried out.



"Opinion" is usually private, and "truth" is of necessity universal. But there are already complications with this scheme: there is "public opinion," after all. And if someone were a philosopher, their private world would encompass the universe.



That's my two cents. I think truth finally ends up being unique and universal. There's a discussion about how we access the "truth" through our education which might be of use...

The "Truth", as you ask, is nothing more than what you want to think of it as...



If everyone knew legit truth, it would take human beings to a whole other world!



To know how to blow up buildings with just a thought, to know how to telepathically bring things to you and toss them away. To know the infinite knowledge of life and space.



To finally decide what is religion and what is science. To forever live in a world without limitations.



Nothing can destroy you if we knew infinite truth.



However, to be more precise... Truth is what you find more appealing, in most cases. It's majority votes that usually sway us to a favor.

There is individual perception. A broken mind made insane, hears voices, and senses forces and feels the presence of something other s about it do not. Therefore it is a falsehood. But for the hapless sufferer it is an all too real truth. It can be remedied but until it is, it remains the individual’s truth. An individual truth when analysed disclosed many other associated falsehood made true, causing the suffering truth to become false. Some will say medication; this may suppress the problem as will a nasty blow to the head, but doesn’t cure it in any way. Akin to anaesthetising a bully victim to deter overt pain and suffering when the bully attacks, an attack they bully will obviously deny, the bully cannot be distanced from the victim as there is no proof to indicate assault verbal or otherwise. So what is truth. Henceforth I will be championing the cause of the mentally destabilised, in the absence of any God or peace or love or security, we must confront our personal truth ...

this means you disregard how you got there as long as your were happy with the ending.. for example you were aiming for a promotion or something, and in the end you got it, but during the process, you stepped on other people's toes to get there.. something like that, i guess.. :) it's kinda mean..

Actually i don't believe in this statement, i consider it wrong. Anyways, i'll explain it to you. it means that if you have a good aim or goal then it does not matter how you achieved it even if it was an evil way or people were hurt by it, but as long as the end result you want to achieve is a good thing then it justifies how you achieved it. And personally for me it matters how you did it!!

Intersubjectivity.



Ironically, people can be "right" and still be wrong. There was a time when everyone agreed that the world was flat. It didn't affect our ability to sail around the planet, grow crops, irrigate the land, survive, and many other human activities. They were all collectively wrong, but under the belief that they were collectively right.



Intersubjectivity can be more easily detected with the ability of hindsight. It is very difficult to question one's own beliefs as they are likely to be a source of anxiety when challenged.

it depends.  people who are overly melodramatic will shun the thought of being "empty" and cold-hearted and will rather have a broken heart.



its alot easier to live with a "lonely" heart though, and some people cant take having a broken heart so they choose to live with a "lonely" one.



i think a person who has a true individuality and personality can live a somewhat solitary life without being lonely though.

Not at all. In fact, you will die if you stay alone to long. If you never had anyone in your life, you can live in solitude, no problem. But most people are raised by their parents for at least a little while. So, as stated in many biology text books, Love is something a human needs in order to live.



By the way, I don't really see this as being a philosophical concept... Unless you are actually doubting the concept of 'love' itself, anything to do with love isn't really... that worth posting.

Being in love is something nobody should go through life without. It's also a character building experience. People who shun the concept of love and relationships end up being cold, empty individuals with little regard for other people.

I used to want control but then I realised I would never get it because there is just far too much chaos to even contemplate having control.



I used to want to know everything but then I realised that everytime I thought I knew something, something would come along to prove otherwise.



Now I just embrace the mystery and the uncertainty and I have to say, I fall in love with each day that I live because it's like seeing a beautiful girl smile at me each day. Some days I don't want to go to bed because I know I'll never see that smile again but then I think, I wonder what will happen tomorrow and I get exited again.



I'm glad I don't know anything. It makes my heart pump faster and that makes me almost certain that I'm alive.



But that's just me. I realise some people need to feel safe by having what they believe to be knowledge or control and if that helps them sleep at night, then fair enough. Being able to sleep is important. It helps us live longer. Not sure I'd want to live that long if I was doing the same stuff everyday but they must enjoy it, otherwise they wouldn't do it, would they?

my friend tells me about an hour after i was thinking "rick" that she thinks she lost her mind..so i google.."how to talk to someone who has lost their mind.



I clicked on an answer...the most amazing question came up from a guy named ..you guess it.."RICK"



I didn't go out looking for someone named rick..



its odd..the things..that connect one mind to another.



p.s. I do understand the ideas of my example are indeed the sounds of a neive little child but I am well aware of the ever so logical thinker who says those thoughts are just by chance and not of anything other.

Great question! Makes me wish I hadn't already drank myself into a state this evening that does not allow me to participate in this post more cogently. (Damn Gallo Chardonnay!) Carl Jung calls what you're describing "synchronicity"--an acausal connecting principle or a "meaningful coincidence." I'm going to provide the Wikipedia link, but if you're really interested, read Jung's book called MAN AND HIS SYMBOLS. (Overlook the sexism, and the guy's really on to something!)



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronici...

Is civilisation a curse or a human triumph?



We talk of the uncivilised as being lesser beings in the western world but I have thought many times that being civilised is a massive oppressive force which causes deep frustration within us. It's a caging of the beast type ethos but the beast behaves more violently because it is caged. Are we naturally supposed to be as ordered as civilisation makes us or are we supposed to be free? Human beings survived long before civilisation came along so why is it such a great idea? What makes it more vaulable than hunter gatherer times or even barbaric times. I have researched these times in history and there was far less killing involved than we think. They were generally quite peaceful exsitences as far as my research tells me. Civilisation created things like nationalism which has been the most destructive concept in human history apart from natural disaster and it continues to do it's damage as I type.

White men, from Britain, took civilization all around the planet.  Considering the endless string of genocides that they inflicted upon indigenous populations, I can't see civilized as being good at all.  Only a true capitalist society is identified as civilized by the mass-media, after all the capitalists do own the mass-media, so the actual definition civilized is subjective.  I do not define a country that spends considerably more on its military than it does on looking after its population as being civilized: some people obviously do.  The definition of this word, as is forced on us by the State, is not one that many people agree with.  I have said for many years: where-ever civilization goes, genocide is sure soon to follow.  Look in the history books, I am speaking the truth.  Civilization is a disaster, where-ever it appears.

No, this is all superstitious hysteria completely unfounded in facts.  Actually, this 2012 crap is based on the Mayan calendar, but even the Mayans themselves didn't consider 2012 to be the end of the world.  Check out the link below, that guy lays out all the facts.



Oh and to anyone who really, sincerely believes that the world will end in 2012, let's do this:  I have a contract for you to sign which states that as of Jan. 1, 2013, I will own all your money and property.  If the world is really going to end in 2012, then signing such a contract should make no difference to you.  I would love to have the producers of all these pseudoscience hysteria-inducing 2012 TV shows sign this contract!

Uhhh... December 31st, 1999 was the fear of technology failing, not the end of the world.



December 21st, 2012 is the day the Mayan calender ends. Now, there's no evidence at all that this might be true, but they say that disasters are going to occur.



One disaster many have their eyes set on is a Supervolcanic eruption actually. According to scientific data, in 2012, Yellowstone caldera's new "vent" if you will that is slowly breaking free from the magma chamber underneath will hit the surface and break through. Now at first, this was said to be a new hydrothermal vent which they were going to add as another attraction to the park, but later evidence showed that it was a magma volcanic vent which brought concerns that it might be the next vent to trigger a supervolcanic eruption.



Upon further calculation of such matters, they concluded that IF the current vent continues to expand at the rate it is, it will break land by 2012 and that has sparked concern of a violent volcanic eruption in that year. However, these are very rough estimates from USGS and are by no means actual proof that Yellowstone will be awakened by 2012 to cause havok on the world.



Another Supervolcano is Lake Toba which erupted 75,000 years ago and almost brought the human species to extinction. The volcano sent the world into a 10 year darkness according to ash fall data recovered from the bottom of the seat and land deposits.



The 2004, 2005 and twice 2007 Earthquakes of Sumatra were in real close proximity to the ancient Lake Toba vent and evidence has shown that those earthquakes, namely the giant 9.3 2004 earthquake has once again reactivated Toba and the Volcano could be more destructive that it was 75,000.



These are scientists predictions for 2012 that a massive volcanic eruption will occur, but until then, we can only predict and just have to wait and see.

Maybe, maybe not. But the Mayan calendar is a cycle, not a line with an end. The date in 2012 is just the turning of the longest cycle. It's no more an "end" than Dec. 31 1999 is on the Julian calendar.



If it suits you to plan on dying in 2012, you run the risk of making a fool of yourself when you don't die. But if you do die, then you'll have done good. Personally, since I have no reason to believe 2012 is any more special than 1999 other than superstitious excitement, I'm planning on living.

I don't think so. We'll all die when the sun explodes, and that's still hundreds of million years from now. But if we'll "all" die together in 2012, well, it doesn't really matter. No one will be left to mourn or laugh at us 'cause we're "all" dead. And no one will even remember our existence. Well, except for cockroaches.



Most of us are worried of dying because of our loved ones. We want to live with them as long as we can. We want to enjoy life with them as much as we can. But why worry when you can still do the same thing, even unimaginably better, in the next life? Death is just part of the cycle. No big deal. =)

<answer>



KM was not big on philosophy nor logical thinking.



He regarded philosophy as a kind of irrelevant exercise.



He illogically claimed to have proved a universal negative ("God is not"), which is a logical impossibility.



He ignored philosophy and logic in order to promote the goals of the "League of the Just," an Illuminist-oriented group which hired him to footnote its communist program.



When drinking, he ridiculed Communists.  He stated, toward the very close of his life, that he was "not a Marxist."



Since Marx, the philosophy attempting to develop Marxism into dogmatic doctrine has been extensive.



Given some assumptions (God is not, Matter drives evolution, Matter is eternal, etc.), Marxist "philosophers" have developed an elaborate and often-mutated system.



The writings of Lenin and Stalin were treated as scientific revelation, immutable law, during their time.



Adaptations of certain German idealist philosophers provide the most direct antecedents to Marx.  As Engels wrote:  "We German socialists are proud of the fact that we are derived, not only from St. Simon, Fourier and Owen, but also from Kant, Fichte and Hegel."  Feuerbach could be added to the latter three.



Would note that Hegel's method of reasoning, namely, an underlying telic which in-forms prior means (in his case, so-called Spirit of Truth infusing and completing human history), is used by Marx and Engels in the materialist perspective of Feuerbach--the so-called dialectic or dialectical materialism.  In other words, the perfectibility of man is promoted by Matter (Spirit is not perceived).



So, in a sense, Marxism is classical 19th century German Romanticism, i.e., holistic system-building, combined with a kind of Enlightenment (St. Simon, Fourier, and Owen) group progress of man.

well Bentham is a Utilitarianist so he would need to know the outcome of the moral decision in order to make one. because that's all that matters in a consequentialist value theory like Utilitarianism, is the results of the action.



Kant would use his Categorical Imperatives to see if anything led to a contradiction in either the will or conception. of course this is super super summarized. but basically it boils down to this. the outcomes of moral decisions to Kant are not the sole deicding factor in whether something is morally correct or not, unlike Bentham. Kant has, pretty much, a deontological moral theory

<answer>



Marx believed in the redistribution of wealth among other things.  He identified socialism as the transitional phase between capitalism and communism.



Considering America will now have its first academic socialist president, I'd say Marxian philosophies are relevant.

Is everything we do based on selfish motivation?



How often do you do things knowing that you are going to get nothing out of it? When I mean nothing, I also mean that you don't think that God is going to reward you for a good deed or something like that?



Think about this one more carefully. The answer is not as obvious as it may seem.

Many many things that i do are based on selfish motivation. That includes friendships that i maintain and many other things but occasionally i do something totally altruistic like donating blood or paying for the toll for the car behind me simply 'cause it makes me feel good.

I have had this discussion with several people, interesting isn't it? Every action we commit has it's reward, there is nothing so completely selfless that it doesn't have a benefit for us in some way.



What I have concluded is that the term "selfish" implies 'no thought of consequences to others'. Therefore, doing something 'good' for another isn't really selfish. We were created to feel good, doing good.



What we reap from what we do may be self serving, but it isn't selfish if what we do adds to the goodness in life.

Everything that nearly everybody does is for selfish reasons.  Your three F's, fight, flight and f.... procreation, are the basis of human existence.  There are 9 levels of human beings and in human beings. Firstly my safety, than the safety of my family, with or without me.  There after the safety of the clan, country (those that speak the same language) and then the race. (white, black, brown, indigo.)  The thought of getting something in return for my selfishness does nor enter the equation.  It is immediate satisfaction of an immediate action.
Thus, payment is in the selfish action already, and anything else is a bonus, from whom ever, God the church or the neighbors.
Peace.

When I need to get away or escape from ordinary life then going out and partying with the girls or treating myself to spa massage, pedicure, manicure, etc.

The heart can make many mistakes but only the mind can tell it that it has. The mind can make many mistakes but the heart can feel but not know why until the feelings so disturb the mind that it starts to ask itself why and decides to change in order to make the heart feel right. Does that seem reasonable? It's how I feel anyway.

Desire comes out of the heart not the mind, and we all can see from the amount of evil in this world that the heart is indeed misleading.



If you were to ask a pedophile where his desire comes from, do you honestly think he would say his mind? In his mind, he knows it's wrong. But his heart wants what it wants, so therefore, if he chooses to follow the desires of his heart, does that make it right?

The heart has no feelings except what is interpretted in the mind and emotions. These are all connected to give a so called gut feeling. Each person should trust their own instincts because what is right for one is not right for someone else. It is often safer to think with the mind because the heart has no logic and can get you in trouble.

Our hearts don't have a 'mind' of their own... They generally react to desire, to the things we want. Therefore, if we only listened to our hearts and disregarded our consciences, we'd probably all be greedy, selfish people.



But since this is a Love quote, then yes, our hearts often tell us more than our consciences. But only in regards to love.



The heart is connected to the mind. Sometimes what we want, is not always right. It's the mind which gives the heart boundaries. And if we didn't follow our consciences, then what are we but lustful beings who are only interested in ourselves?



Some people suggest that the mind and the heart are one and the same. This is only true for those who believe that they are, without a doubt, doing no wrong whatsoever when they follow their hearts.



If we can't distinguish between right and wrong by our own estimations, then we lack self-guidance. It doesn't matter if the next person has different views on what's right. The beauty of having a conscience is that it's yours. No one can take away what you believe is right/wrong. If we don't follow our consciences, we lose sight of being human altogether. It's true, the mind can make mistakes, but only if you let it.

I never act on emotion, or entent, but a solid foundation of truth. Abiblical, christian Judale value; and morale ground. In this act, I am always satified, with sound, and just judment.

I don't see how religion and science even go together to be honest. I would say if you had science with religion you are not being objective enough to be scientific. So it doesn't make sense. Science is FACT, religion is belief without facts or proof, they just don't marry up do they? I guess lame means disabled and maimed in some way, not perfect or pure. But again that has nothing to do with science. Science is proof of hypotheses / facts. Religion isn't proved and never can be. So I think the quote is nonsense!

I don't give anyone TD's unless they're rude.  Or chain-mailing.  Or unless I really, -really- hate their answer.  But it takes a LOT to make me really, really hate an answer.



I can't stand it when someone gets a TD on a question I ask--what makes anyone's opinion (as long as they're civil and reasonable) more or less valuable than anyone else's?



Sometimes I'll call someone out on a comment that I disagree with when I'm answering a question.  Most of these comments are directed toward ignorance, but sometimes I'm actually curious why they think that way.  If it's the latter case, then I won't give them a TD--it's their opinion.

I think "Kisshoma" is right...you don't know if the asker is giving you "the finger" or some respondent that doesn't agree w/ you.  If it's a responder than it's ok, 'cause like "Alea" said, they're just showing they're on the other side of the fence.  If it's the Asker, then they're probably one of those people who feel, "If I want your opinion, I'll give it to you!" and are asking the question more for validation of their opinion then for getting yours.

This one never knows who has given him a "thumbs down" for his response and so this one often wonders if it was the one who posted or another respondent?



Perhaps it would be beneficial to know who gave a thumbs down but perhaps it might only create bad feelings and there is more than enough of that to go around in the world today...)

The pressure cooker, our true test of faith.



Have you ever seen what happens when you put a lid on a pot full of something and turn up the heat? Eventually the pressure builds up so much that the contents in side spew out because it can no longer stay within its confined space. At this point you see the true nature of what was in the container. “6 For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. 7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. 8 We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed. 10 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. 11 For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body. 12 So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.” 2 Corinthians 4:6-12 (NIV) [2]  For this reason we must not give up even though our little clay pots are boiling over. What spills out is the testimony of our true faith and character. Its easy to play church and say bless God or what ever is your favorite “Christian phrase” when things are going good but how do you respond when things are going bad? Is Jesus’ light shining out of the darkness?

It should improve you as a human being, and it should not be an exclusive country club requiring either blood ties, or pre-requisites.  In many ways, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all country clubs when you think about it, with Judaism being the worst of them unless you think of Judaism as a religious faith intended to preserve the purity of the Jewish people so that the Messiah, the man identical in appearance, character, intelligence and strength to Adam, the first man, may be born, the purpose of Judaism being, so that said man could then rule the world with the preserved wisdom.



Judaism does not seek converts because to do so would be to change the bloodline of the first man.  The whole entire justification of Judaism, is rooted in the book of Genesis.  It is true that Adam had several children, and that he is the father of the whole human race, however also true, only one son per generation within that bloodline, is most like him.  First it was Abel, but he was killed and then it was Seth, down the line all the way to Enoch, from Enoch to Noah, from Noah to Shem from Shem to Abraham and from Abraham to Solomon, and from Solomon to Daniel, the next man in that bloodline, assuming they even exist, is unknown.



The appearance of that man though, according to Judaism, will usher in the end of days.  The word began with Adam, and it will end with the Messiah; that is the fundamental core of Judaism.  Well, the world as we know it anyway.  What makes the particular males in the bloodlines mentioned so special, is because all of them, supposedly, each and every one, is identical to the one that came before.  From Adam, to Daniel, according to the bible, they all looked the same.  It even said in Genesis, Seth was identical to his father.



See though, beautiful as the whole notion of a "true redeemer" as it sounds in the end it does not stop being a country club.  Moreover, the Messiah is supposed to be a male descendant, and God promised that "the bloodline of David would not pass from this earth."  Either God never said such a thing, or the ashkenazim are a bunch of liars, are recently they have been saying that there were never any Hebrews, some even say Abraham wasn't even real.  That is how thin their blood runs.



The Iraqi Jewish people, are the descendants of the Jewish community of Babylon; taking into consideration the breeding racism of various semitic groups throughout antiquity, as well as the later Islamicized Ishmaelite invaders, Iraqi Jews are possibly, after the Hebrew descended Muslims of Medina, the purest Hebrew people on this planet.  See though only Iraqi Jews can reliably claim descent from Daniel, because the prophet Daniel, lived in Babylon until he died.  In Judaism, in its most ancient form, you do not reach full manhood unless you marry, and successfully raise functional children to adulthood, only then are you considered a man.  If you do not posses enough skill in your craft to provide for your family, nor enough wisdom to do that, the ancient Hebrew people, did not consider you a man.



So what then, is a true faith, given all this?  Clearly, it is not a country club; wisdom should be shared with everyone.  What little good it did when Europeans got a hold of it though.



To me, a true faith is something that leaves you emotionally balanced, and resilient, it leaves you "buff" and physically fit, laser focused, and hopefully slightly smarter.  In other words, what makes a faith a faith, is the quality of its adherents; if they are all in shape, and well balanced emotionally then, we have a winner.  However if they are the opposite of that, you can not say it is a true faith.  Look at Orthodox Jews and the sheer number of dysfunctional people they crank out.  Look at hardline Irish catholics and all the alchoholics they produce, although, alchoholism among the Irish, personally, I think was due to the fact that in the "old days" "good Irish girls didn't...."  And because Irishmen weren't getting any, they turned to liquor and hookers.



Ultimately  though I think Yeshua (Jesus) said it best when he said;



"by their fruits, ye shall know them."

Many of the others seem to think that you mean - what is the test for true faith, not a true faith as in a religion, so I'll take that view as well.



I think a good test would be if you had faith to the extent that you would risk everything for it and yet are not treatened by those who do not share your belief.

Whatever could be a ‘true faith’, i.e. to qualify the possibility of a ‘false faith’? A fact is a fact, and faith is faith, even if it is in the being of a little ant, or a person a friend. Why not ask: ‘what is the true test of faith’ instead – ‘true’ meaning here the ultimate as any ‘false test’ would not do. So, if the question is as I understand it to be then, I can say the ultimate of test of faith is life, nothing more and nothing less, a life lived in complete devotion, acceptance, effort and gratitude, in observance of a faith, a journey of hope and noble enterprise.



But the question still seems ineffectual, still waxing the mind, as if asking is the true test of a true faith is an entire life of devotion, sacrifice, and love, and nothing less than that? But if not life, as that might be too general an answer, then what else in life: love, marriage, prayers, goodness of deeds and intentions, elevated thoughts, graceful mind, cleanliness, efforts for a livelihood, or dignity and righteousness of a conduct, or may be some quality like, gratitude, kindness, care, perseverance in the face of adversity, patience, hope, exactly what, may be everything? The true test of faith it seems is nothing less life itself, a life lived peacefully, kindly, happily and hopefully.



However, if the question is exactly the way stand, as it is posted here, then the test of for ‘true faith’ is in all the thing I mentioned above, and more, and also in it is ability to withstand oppositions and critical views of a comparison until it is able to remain a true in the middle of half truths, half lies, r even complete falsehood, until it can survive in the arena of the world by the reason of its truth.

Does quality tend to disappear from computer projects ?



1/change a field from signed to unsigned, to save a small amount of memory.



2/allow the program tape to be recorded onto, supposedly onto blank trailing tape. (curiously the intended code to do the recording is mysteriously replaced by other code that overwrites the program)



A/(by daxbert):
&lt;&lt;Is this a question?



Changing a field from signed to unsigned results in no memory savings unless you actually need positive integers above the MAX value for the signed integer.



The second paragraph makes no sense.&gt;&gt;



To daxbert:



I. Person in question made a special appointment with the document custodian for the project. (Someone had had the foresight to ensure there was a secure copy of documentation -presumably to prevent this sort of foolery). So the secure copy was doctored, changed from signed to unsigned.
Later on it was realised the original design was correct, the signed field was needed.
What kind of person would bypass existing procedures to "save" memory.
Person in question is named Sandra White. May be still on the job. (this was 1979 in Canberra)



II. Program tape for a submarine.
Some fool decided to use the program tape as "black box recorder".
Unbelievable stupidity.
Funny coincidence that the planned code change wasn't the one that was issued. Hard to see how it could get worse than the stupidity of writing on the program tape. But it did. The code change, intended to allow writing, corrupted the tape. Culprits are presumably still on the job, raking in $$$



I never suggested there was a memory saving, or any sort of saving.



Apologies daxbert. In my original post I misspelt "trailing tape" so as you said my question made no sense.

I submit that not only will it result in a resurgence of racism, but it will come from both sides.

I hope I'm wrong on all counts but only time will tell.

Are you kidding. White people, Mexicans.... they hate black people and dont even no why. This has been the game in america, almost since the begining of the founding of this country. All the founding fathers had slaves, and slavery still exsist in this country today. Look at how many blacks go to jail, to prision, convicted of crims, some they never evne did,; incomparison to everybody else. If blacks in America was as horrible as people in this country portraty us out to be, this country would be in hell. We as a people send our kids to school, attend college, pay taxes. And yet, we are not given a fair share of the american dream. They kill a black every day, all day long in this country. And then claim it was an accident, or they thought, or he fit the description of. And how do you think that makes us feel as a people. No one wants to get killed in the streets, or shot down like an animal. I cant even say that any more, because this country treats animals better than blacks. Example, misstreat a dog, go to jail, for up to five years. Kill a black, and get a pramotion, and or a raise. How long do you think we are goin to stand for that. It is so sad, that after all these years, whites have not yet learn to act like civilzed human beings. Its like they are subhuman or something! I dont get it, and am prety sure, I never will, thank God! Racism, stsarts, and ends in the white community. They even teach their children that crap, screwing up young white minds; how sad is that. Blacks never teach their children such things. How to hate, and kill, but may be we should! If this is the only way to stay safe in this damn country; because slavery is over. And we as a people are not going back to the old ways!!!!!!!!!!!! We would die by the thousands, the millions first!

I am writing a philosophy essay on Socrates and I am having trouble please help?



Socrates claims to know nothing, and adds that this is a kind of wisdom that sets him apart from
other people. But there are a number of instances in the Apology and Crito in which he seems to be
making certain knowledge claims. First, elaborate what you think are Socrates’ main claims to
knowledge (focus on two or three main ones). Second, determine whether these claims really do
undermine his thesis that he knows nothing. Can his claim of wisdom be defended? If so, show
how; if not, show why not. In light of your discussion, can Socrates’ life still be considered a lesson? please help me find instances where he makes knowledge claims which could be contradictory to his 'i know nothing statement'

This is a really hard question. I think the place to start with is what he claims in the Crito, without looking at the text - he claims to know that trying to escape is unjust, that he must obey the laws.



Now what you need to do is look closely at that, and see if he is making a wise choice. If he is, then and only then can one go back and see how this stacks up with "knowledge of ignorance," which is really what your teacher means by "know nothing" (notice that to know how people can be ignorant would be the supreme knowledge - knowledge of how things can go wrong and what people are capable of).



I'm linking to a commentary on the Crito below, but my advice is just talk about the texts out loud before going into them and digging for quotes. This is a hard question, good luck with it.

This is one of those issues that makes me lose faith in the american people as a whole.



It takes me back to history class, reading about how blacks fought for civil liberties and it seemed like a majority of people in the country were against them.  A kind of mass racism/intolerance.



The mass intolerance and prejudice is still there it seems.  People can rationalize it all they want, but there is no reason to deny same sex civil unions, other than "you don't like gay people".



Two people's marriage has no effect on your own marriage.  Denying them is a slap in the face, and shows just how far we still are from escaping prejudice.

depends on your beliefs. Westerners believe that people only reincarnate back into people although horses, dogs, and cats can also since they are here to help us but they can be any of the 3. Another less common belief is that we all start as bugs and work our way through different lessons as different animals which means we were all mice at one time.



I would agree with the person above about how cats are independent, they do their own thing. (I can't wait for level 2 so I can give people a thumbs up). They can turn a person off with their personality just as another person can. In this case, the person becomes somewhat of a bigot believing that all cats are the same and have the same attitude and/or mental issue. Their ego my even feel threatened by them. Plus, those allergies don't help the situation either.

Evil is half of the abstract, "moral" dichotomy by which a great many people organize and evaluate their experiences in life, according to some spiritual or metaphysical framework of understanding, which in the case of many individuals may be barely defined other than in terms of this dichotomy itself.



This dichotomy serves a powerful social purpose, organizing and motivating the political activities of individuals all over the place.



This is why it's always around, like religion itself.  Things that serve no purpose tend to disappear you know.  And yet religion's been around probably longer than any other manifestation of human culture you can think of.



Although, as people routinely point out, there's a serious logical problem with the dichotomy of "good and evil:"  What's evil for one guy can be good for another.



This leads to all kinds of wacky mixups, and is at the root of a great many pointless philosophical arguments.

Evil as defined by Dictionary.com is something morally wrong, harmful, characterized by misfortune or suffering. Be it noun or adjective, "evil" is still an issue of value. Although there are "universal beliefs" that are generally accepted by society, there is always something that will have trust in the contrary. We live in a world where we try to understand everything in a binary system. In this system, one thing cannot exist without an opposite counterpart; to have something "hot" we must have something "cold" to compare it to. Just as we have something "evil" there must be "good" when respecting the binary system. Good as evil's counterpart is just as obscure at times. Each person has a different order of priorities which can render the generally accepted binary system more than useless.



I'm the kind of person that loves knowing how everything works, and with having such a grey area in values, I question where I should place my own. I know what I care about and what I tend to show apathy towards, but it just makes it so much more difficult to encapsulate (sp? it's 2 in the morning) "evil."



Looking at it from a more factual standpoint, since really the only thing evil at the moment is my friend that's taunting me, there is something that I agree with. We are all capable of evil..



There are so many things that get blamed for the bad behavior of others--video games leading to violence is a major one, media corruption... I'm too tired to think of others.. But the fact is that the evil seen here isn't caused by the video games or the TV. It may be inspirational, but it's not responsible for the actions taken.



Consider this...
What does a newborn baby want?... Milk, right?
It's natural for us to do whatever we have to do to get what we need/what we want. Babies will kick and scream and bite and grab and claw to get the milk.



Now what if a baby was born with the strength of an adult? It wouldn't be a pretty picture would it?



It is generally accepted by society that someone is responsible for a child, be it the parents, the uncles, whoever guardian, but they are responsible to raise that child and teach them the difference between right and wrong *yay value binaries* and basically turn them into a functional member of society, no?



Essentially we try to alter the child's perceptions. We won't be able to completely rid them of violent capabilities, but we can try to reprogram them and attempt to tweak their settings..
If a child is acting up or behaving poorly, it is commonly blamed on whoever is supposed to be taking care of the child..Meaning something isn't being done properly.. or effectively..



Since the "evil" is already there, even tho it is deduced by logic through unrealistic scenarios, something violent can't make something that's already harmful harmful... it can, however, be counter productive when it comes to teaching values...



I have no idea if I'm arguing evil or video games anymore, but I think I made my thought clear that we're born evil... even though we can value different things as time goes on...



Society tries to deal with it by teaching, and if it doesn't work it blames whatever there is to blame.... and punishes accordingly... or not at times...



Personally I'm content.. But then... I tend to either have high values or... not care... *we're not really goin into specifics here*
.... just because something's different doesn't mean it's evil.... but yea... there are some things that I don't agree with that are... generally not agreed with...



I agree with sleeping right now....

Any person elected into the congress or senate of the United States who's important vote is easily swayed by giving him/her a wad of cash to vote in favor of or against the upcoming bank bailout.



Absolute Evil= The Corrupted Government(corporation) of the United States.



The Banks will get their bailout,those bank Xeos will leave their posts multi-multi millionaires no questions asked. while the individuals in the working sector that retire and try to collect their SSI may find that it will take over 1 yr for a reply that their retirement home is in a prison for answering a question wrong or totally disgards all of your bonified favorable medical records so that they can contrive any results of a medical exam performed by their corrupted for hire medical staff that puts your disability claim in the false light of fraud and will either put you back to work in a fastfood dive and fine you to your grave or retire you to a prison.



How should this be dealt with? With the Bank bailout comes a breach of trust with the people of these United States, the record clearly shows this is no longer a country by the people and for the people,but is a sugardaddy for the Corporations and by the Corporations and paid for by the slaves(you and me) we are not your property!.



Term limits set for all elected officials in Sinate and CONgress.  And a law passed that will allow the people who have paid into SSI to withdraw all monies including interest without question and immediate refund.  leave the people out of your Manifest destiny!

freedom is choice.



The essence of freedom is fearlessness.  Even in a restrictive society one may act and do anything they like.  However, fear of consequences make one not truly free.  When one has choice and does not choose one because of fear of another, one is free.
Freedom is living anew in each moment.

Freedom is being free. Being able to do what you want. Liberty. Like without control, rules, and restrictions. Freedom is something you rarely see nowadays. The world is now covered and blanketed of rules. No one is free. You are free of restraints. Its like exemption and you have a choice. Its something, something so pleasant. We could not find it in this busy, protective and strict world.

<question>



Do the woes of Wall Street signal imminent collapse of Christianity’s eternal life theory?



The Christian Bible says in Deuteronomy 17:13, apostates should be stoned to death; those who detract from liberal capitalist orthodoxy are othered (NOTE: this is not a spelling error) as “dangerous,” or authoritarian or dictatorial. Sometimes these apostates, those who dissent to capitalist orthodoxy or who dare consider alternative approaches to social organisation, die or are killed under mysterious circumstances and are replaced by dictatorships that are friendly to the West – to the United States, in particular. This is what happened, for instance, with Patrice Lumumba, in the Congo (who was replaced by General Mobutu Sese Seko), and to Salvado Allende, in Chile (who was replaced by General Augusto Pinochet); they also tried it in Angola.



When all else fails, these capitalist fundamentalists like to tell us (ordinary people) that we simply don’t understand economics, how “an economy works” or “how markets work” or that we should learn mathematics – (seriously). As if these “markets” and market transactions are devoid of any human agency. As if we, humans, are atomistic things locked in place under a reified “economy”.
A few years ago, one of the West’s most respected capitalist economists, Paul Krugman, a darling of liberals in the United States, suggested that people who objected to cheap labour were simply ill-informed, or lacking in intellectual depth. Elsewhere Krugman hailed the use of mathematics and algebra as the only way to explain economics or “the economy”.



When taken together, his book Pop Internationalism and his praise for the use of mathematics to explain everything, or formalism, there is the suggestion that discussions or concerns about poverty, globalisation and even “the economy” is best addressed through a type exclusivism. This exclusivism is apparently homologous with the Christian variant, in terms of which there is only one way towards eternal life – through Jesus Christ. For liberal capitalists there is only one way to organise humanity – in all its complexity; the economic rationalist way as expressed in mathematical and/or algebraic formulation. Every other way of thinking is “unscientific” or lacking in rigour and should, therefore, not be taken seriously.



The US has now resolved to abandon its policy of “unfettered” capitalist “economy”. Will we soon see/hear of intervention where Jesus will no longer be the ONLY way to eternal life?

The aim in life is to liberate ourselves from bondage, ignorance and malice. We should try to integrate our physical and mental resources for self development and social service. We should try to remain free from wants and worries, and we should treat every one with equal behavior. One should go on adding values and virtues day by day and give a real meaning to life.

The aim of life is the attainment of ever more expansive goals which involve the encompassing of the full realm of our personalities. Goals emerge from gazing deeply inward - truly knowing ourselves and focusing on the horizons of our external world... whether objects, nature, the universe, but more important, other people with whom we can share our love.



with such a journey traced for each of us throughout our lives, if we wish to tune in and become acceptant of ourselves, we can know our own natural elegance, power and abundance.

It is hard to say what someone else's goals in life are because God may lead us on separate paths of life! No one can know for sure what God has planned.  God will only give you what you can handle.  All go through trials and tribulations. The bestest answer I can tell you is to ask God to talk to you. But you have to honestly be ready to listen with your heart!  If you are bored, get out and do something fun but safe.

dear Nicollyne



without firstly accepting your current life the answer to your question will never be valid to you anymore...refusal is a big barrier.



the first question is : do you WANT to have a purpose ?



ok...I suppose your answer is YES.



the second is : do you ENJOY your life?



definitely NO.



you cannot set a target without having a dream...dreaming of better life make you enjoy your current life.



the next one is : do you have a dream ?
definitely NO.



so :



please try to ACCEPT your life as it is and DREAM of better life...then you will be able to ENJOY it...eventually the aim will show up by itself.

One of the most thing you must achieve in this lifetime is balance or equilibrium...inside and out... without equilibrium in your life you'll go nuts...it is something thats quite hard to achieve in this world of turmoil but its up to you to arrange or fix your life, so that in your inner self you will also learn how to balance it. Balance would bring happiness and contentment that would satisfy you....

Self-actualization describes a person able to embrace reality and facts rather than denying truth, are spontaneous, are interested in solving problems which may include personal problems or the emotional conflicts of others, accepting of themselves and others and lack prejudice.
Freedom often ties in with the question of free will or the ability to act in accordance with one's own true self or values.
I think the 2 feed off of each other.



Not necessarily equal but compliment each other.

You do not taste happiness. Or are you asking figuratively. If you are asking figuratively, then.. Happiness is ice cream. It calms you down when your boyfriend breaks up with you. It is there when you fail a test. It is there when you are nervous. It is always there. Sitting in the refrigerator with such creamy goodness. Then, if you're not asking figuratively... Happiness is something that we feel. It has something to do with endorphins. Endorphins make you feel good. Happiness makes us feel good. That means we are happy. Happiness is something that makes us feel good inside. It lifts us up. Happiness is something that makes us live longer. Makes us smile. Makes us laugh. The one that makes us continue living on the earth.

True happiness is not something to be sensed through any physical organ.... it resides in the mind and needs no entry through any physical means. However, if one were to take your question not so literally, then I would say Happiness tastes like a cool and calm sea despite all the salt beneath and all the wind above.

<question>



Is there hope for the future of our world?



Any ecosystem can only support so many consumers before it collapses.  With a global population rising exponentially, stripping the world of natural resources, destroying habitats, pumping pollution in to the seas and the atmosphere, competing for dwindling natural resources and land space?



With continued patterns of aggression between nations and religious groups across the world.



With major economic crises in the West.



As a race, humans seem unable to learn from the mistakes of the past.  What does the future hold for us all on this small planet?



Should we trouble ourselves to think of such things, or feel disaffected, unable to make a difference?  Drown ourselves in material possessions, screw everybody else.  I'm as guilty as many of feeling apathetic and just getting on with my own little life as best I can.  So I guess I'm a hypocrite... what do you think?

The economic collapse is a phantom crisis fabricated by Democrats to win an election.  It will mysteriously vanish Nov 5.



The Dems have been forcing banks make 'sub-prime' loans for ~13 years.  ~1 Trillion dollars.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RZVw3no2...



Now this isn't a good thing but....



What's being called and 'eminent' collapse is 4% of these loans going bad.  With the purchased property being ~70% of the loan value.



So a bank of two will go under.  Some stocks will take a hit, some idiots in Washington may take a bunch of tax money to bail out the companies they victimized.  But that's about it.



The rest of it is mostly bullshit too.  Pretty much media sadists helping Socialist politicians convince you to vote Liberal.



There are genuine problems to fix, but that's just life.



So, spend your life in a state of phantom fear if you like, or open your eyes to the BS.

Fear is a feeling. And Once again, it is not a thing. It is an abstract noun.
And if you're asking figuratively, the shape I fear the most is the triangle. because it might poke or stab you to death. The color i fear is yellow because its too bright. Fear is something that makes us afraid. It is holding us back from being brave. Its something that we all have, literally all of us.

Change my perspective. If I'm feeling down because my job is tedious I remember a time when I was between jobs and even a tedious job was welcome.  If I'm down because my house needs repair I imagine what it would feel like living in a cardboard box on the street. Every life looks different depending where you view it from. When my life starts looking down I look at it differently.

I am lucky to have gotten this chance to endure the unbearable things that will only make me stronger as a soul. I will meet it with challenge and show it to myself so well as I am worth.

just think of all the good times u have had and all the times wen u have been lucky. i m sure it'll make u feel better. do things u like-like surf,chat or u make new freinds.



if ur upset bcoz of a person then go n talk 2 d person of how u feel. if he does nothing n if ur realtionship breaks then forget it n dont grieve for it bcoz that person was not good enof for u n he was going to go from ur life sometime , so y not now??
cheer up u cant be a crying baby all ur life. if u have lost something, then get over with the loss. i know its hard but u will have to. go ahead n do sumthin good in life.



this may sound crazy but it helps: talk to ur plants if u haev ny. b close to nature n observe it. it helps a lot n will make u feel better too.
good luck!!

If anything we will evolve in reverse, because we can live so well now and have children even if we are physically or mentally 'challenged'. But it won't matter because we can deal with it.



I think we will all eventually live in comfort. How long it will take is hard to say. A few hundred years?

Eventually, if Charles Darwin's evolution theory is true and I think it is true. It will come true because us humans evolved from Lucy to Homo Sapien to Human. So there is a possibility that we might gain powers and we might live forever but bibliographically we can't live forever so, we will evolve and we will gain superpowers but we have also ends in our lives.

I would have to say my relationship with a dear friend who played a significant role in helping me become my own woman, face my fears, and walk away so much stronger than before. I know I cannot give this friend full credit, but I am so thankful they were there for me when I needed someone most.  This friend is currently a part of my life as well, and each day we continue to grow stronger and learn more and more about each other.



As they say, sometimes you meet people for a reason.  I know this is true.  They also say some people are in your life for a season ( an allotted time ) or a reason, which probably has the merit to be forever.  I hope my friend is there for me forever!

The inspiration in my life at the present time is one of my professors at the university.  He is my mentor, my research director, my teacher, and my strongest advocate on campus.  I've told him a few times that when I grow up I want to be like him. ;-]  It's funny because we are very close in age and I've been able to establish a personal as well as a professional relationship .... I call him my big brother, 'cause I never had one and always felt vulnerable because of that.  With my professor's guidance, gentle instruction, and positive support, I feel as if I will make it through the program whereas before I was really doubting it.  He's my inspiration because he cares about me as a student and mentoree, and has made a tremendous difference in my life and outlook on life.

It's just so unlikely! That there should be a single conscious omnipotent thing like that running the Universe.

Wherever we've seen complexity before it's either been designed or it has come about by slow incremental trial-and-error steps. Really it would make more sense to think of a race of Gods.

The existence of a supernatural god would violate all the laws of physics that he supposedly created.  Cause and effect, conservation of mass and energy, even ordinary chemical processes go right out the window.

Maybe God has no desire or inclination to exist as God. Maybe he seeks simply to be an ordinary Joe, living in suburbia, mowing his lawn, raising his 2.4 kids, inviting friends and family to dinner once in a while and generally having little to worry about than arriving to work on time.

Maybe the division of power, wherein one group have the wealth, another the reins of power, and a third sector of saffron or religious garbed individuals are assigned pastoral duties to the people. Maybe he has no desire to be second placed or servile, and would rather to his little brood be true.

Maybe he wishes the atheists would apply a little more effort, assert greater intelligence to the eradication of the God concept if they hold the great one in such contempt. Maybe those who feign reverence and declare themselves followers are more loathed by him than those who deny him

So many maybes, so many mood changes, such temperamental erratic behaviour and changeable fickle followers.

Extrapolating this beyond you , me , my country , yours ... and beyond..... can there be a link that links us all together?  Could be . Then what could those links be? Water . Air .

In the Indian philosophy, one of the ideas is that the very existence (as we know) is in fact a weakened or illusory manifestation of being. If God is supposed to be the Supreme Power and Truth, then God can only 'be', and can not 'exist' (the way we understand 'existence' which has a beginning, which undergoes change and which finally comes to an end).

well, if God want it, he/she is so evil, and it's an oximor; if God don't want it, he/she isn't omnipotent, because he/she didn't do anything to improve world situation.
if he/she don't know what is appening in the world, he/she isn't omniscient.
if he/she can't interfere with human activity, isn't omnipotent, if he/she don't want interfere, he/she is evil.

God DOES exist!
1.The complexity of our planet points to a deliberate Designer who not only created our universe, but sustains it today.
2.The human brain's complexity shows a higher intelligence behind it.
3."Chance" or "natural causes" are insufficient explanations.
4.To state with certainty that there is no God, a person has to ignore the passion of an enormously vast number of people who are convinced that there is a God.
5.We know God exists because he pursues us. He is constantly initiating and seeking for us to come to him.
6.Unlike any other revelation of God, Jesus Christ is the clearest, most specific picture of God pursuing us.

If a person opposes even the possibility of there being a God, then any evidence can be rationalized or explained away. It is like if someone refuses to believe that people have walked on the moon, then no amount of information is going to change their thinking. Photographs of astronauts walking on the moon, interviews with the astronauts, moon rocks...all the evidence would be worthless, because the person has already concluded that people cannot go to the moon.

You can believe what you want, but as for me, the awesomeness of this universe is proof enough for me. This world could not have just came into existence. Someone must have created it.

I hope this helps.

theres always more than two sides to a debate



and im going to stretch myself and not argue back but instead think of an answer

my first thought was so there would be less wars.. cos lets face it.. most wars are taken in the name of religion even if they are only using religion as a charade or taking religion out of context

now ive thought about it i think it would also help to unite people. yes religion is about community and love. but there are so many religions. no religion would have everyone in one community

this would lead to acceptance and tolerance and less racism and prejudice and everyone will be seen as equals when it comes to race and culture

im finding this very difficult because now ive thought of 5reasons why god should exist..

You're not asking whether He does exist as some members take you to mean.
You are not even asking a reason why He does (or does not) exist. Each to his own about the gender of God, by the way.
It sounds to me as if someone has asked you (or you have asked yourself) for proof that God exists and the best answer you can come with is, "Well, why not?"
That's the only reason I have ever been able to give for the existence of God and my faith in Him and to me it's the only complete answer. It's atheists that have a hard time of it because they feel have to prove his non-existence. Proving or disproving is an interesting philosophical exercise (wish I had time to go into it right now but I've got to go back to work) but analysing why people have faith in God - or any thing or ideal - rather misses the point, I think. The point is, that people need to believe in something outside of themselves no matter what form it takes. 
Existentialists say, "well, faith in a God is copping out on the responsibility that men should take for their own actions". Well, I would like to disagree with that but, as I say, I've got to fly now - the dishes (among other things) await me.

Evolution is the cause of everything. it was an improvement in quality which caused the universe and inorganic matter to be created  it was improvement in quality which caused life to supercede inorganic matter, it was increase in quality that caused that life to deny it own biological urge to kill and instead socialise, and it is evolution which puts us in the socio-intellectual battleground we are now in as we strive to make a better global society.

now you'll have to decide if i agree with you by deciding if you think this Evolution is natural it changes the nature of things but is that in itself natural? does a man act in a natural way by killing as his unfettered urge might be or is it his improvement in quality ( his evolution ) in avoiding that urge and, not killing but, socialising with his fellow men that should be counted as his true nature?

If I go by logic, I have to disagree if you imply that existence must have been caused...... because I believe that our logic can never log on to any primary or original cause....... everything is a part of a very complex chain of cause and effect which is simply causing transformations and can not be seen logically to create anything out of nothing. Existence of everything therefore must be seen as eternal which is being constantly kept in a dynamically changing state by Nature.

However, I do accept that our logic can not be taken to be foolproof or all-inclusive!!

'Nature' is a complex idea. Anything that is real (and this is everything that exists) is part of Nature. The Supernatural is a side of nature that is hidden from us, until we develp an ability to see a little bit of it.
What's odd and so exciting about this modern period is that people are becoming adept at manipulating genes. Soon we will be creating life forms. This is natural too, as Nature gave us the brains to do it.
So yes, Nature is the cause of everything, if you include humans as part of Nature, and I don't see how you can't.

Yes. The sole cause of everything in existence is 'nature'. Who controls 'nature'. Who exercises influence on nature. There must be a person responsible for maintaining the balance in nature. Who does this? In our human body, we have mental faculty through which we can try to find some sort of explanation. Sometimes nature plays havoc, like cyclonic storm, tsunami, floods, earthquakes, heavy downpour, lightning, etc. Nature consists of five basic elements viz. earth, water, tejas (brightness), air and space. It is interesting to know about these five elements.

In the universe everything is made up of these five elements only. All creations are also made up of these five elements. The universal and individual aspect of these five elements have got some intrinsic cosmic relations. Universe is in macro level and the individual in micro level. If we know how to maintain a best correlation between individual and universal nature, we become highly qualified to lead a happy and peaceful life. The remedy for all individual problems can be found if one can maintain this relation. It is a secret knowledge. But secret never remains secret. Nature reveals it. We should know how to explore this potential form.

Nature is our mother, but who is the father?  At this point in our evolution we have a material body born from the material elements, but because we are conscious, sentient beings as well, our "image" is from the father, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we ignore the fact that we are  conscious living beings  then it may be possible to see nature as the source of everything in this world. Yet we know consciousness does exist and without being conscious observations or speculations about life are impossible. Does a stone think?



So the answer is no. Because nature is not the source of consciousness, the essence of our life, then nature is not the source of everything in the world, what to speak of the spiritual realm where there is nothing but consciousness.

<answer>



Yes, I would suggest the sole cause of everything in existence appears to be attributable to the temporal state of nature. I might be tempted to rephrase the statement "The sole *function of everything in *nature is *existence." The ability to exist more efficiently and defy odds seem to be precisely the qualities passed from generation to generation.

What I think we are talking about here Nietzsche called "the will to power"; which kinda means that which attains most power retains the right to exist. Nietzsche clung to this idea as his most fundamental when he said "The world itself is the will to power - and nothing else! And you yourself are the will to power - and nothing else!" He even went so far as to say that it is the closest thing in nature to aboslute truth.

Even though I cannot say what is true and false in terms of the basis of existence - prerequisite physical or spiritual phenomena, it makes sense that what we can be sure of is the right to exist is dependent on our forefathers ability to defy downfall and facilitate power and subsequently gain: prosperity. If I may use a church as an analogy: the church is there to promote its brand of religion [culture] above others. Therefore different churches compete for the right to exist and outlive opposing churches. Architects compete to find more solid structures to defy weather and gravity and strengthen the symbol of itself. Therefore, I would suggest that the sole function of the church is its ability to stay standing - the sole function of the church in nature is existence.

As you have noticed, I have replaced the term cause with function. This is because 'cause' implies a reasoning that precedes the existence of something. The idea that existence itself requires a sole cause implies that the cause exists outside existence.. something of a paradox.. solvable by spirituality [the creator] or in Niezsches case eternal return. To my mind that is the only queston that will always remain too big to attempt answering.

The soul cause of existence is energy. Whilst energy drives, inspires, empowers will, existence as we know it remains, simply transforming and manifesting in different variants of the life form know as mankind. The function of this will to power and existence is survival. The function of survival is to increase energy mass. The cause is transmission of energy to receptors likely to strengthen this energy.

Positive energy is Love, life giving m rejuvenating and cleansing. Negative energy is toxic caused by hate and the poisonous vigour it creates. These two dual energy forces prolong existence albeit constantly battling for dominance. This war is manifested within each individual, home and society as battle for dominance.

The will to power is mans versatility top adapt to his constantly changing environment whilst retaining cohesion with the underling unchangeable consistency. The ability to increase in measure of positive energy and the power and influence it creates albeit a control of one’s own will and mind, household and fraternity. The dysfunctional chaos degenerated into a high maintenance verging upon the ungovernable society we have at present is caused by a dangerous parity of both positive and negative energies not increasing independently but simply firing one another, neither growing or diminishing. An enduring vicious cycle of pain, gain and loss, birth, death and rebirth without progress or maturing in self sufficiency and the autonomy that creates a perfect society and world.

Indeed the church is evidence of this dual parity of the positive and negative. If any church were adept and competent it would ideally produce a creed of perfect individuals. We would all immediately convert to be party to this perfection yet this is not so. Churches now promote themselves on a singular edict upon which they seek to acquire a certain type of individual ultimately to sell out when failing to do so and adopt an indiscriminate policy, rendering the orginal beliefs defunct thereby.

Brain exists as an effect of blind brain cell activity - as other organs exist as blind cell activity ?



The existence of brain is an effect of blind brain cell activity - yet the affect of blind brain cell activity, infected and dis-eased by the evolution of space-time language, effects so-called consciousness as mind-of-the-out-there looking/seeing and mind-of-the-in-here thought/thinking. The affect of this relentless emergence as blind brain activity effects subject sensation giving the illusion it is an entity/person/agent, existing inside brain/body, consciousness.

This is one of the more astute observation people often are unaware of.  Dr. David R. Hawkins describes this at great length in his books and lectures and is based on the realization ross left for his answer.  It is of great benefit to be aware of this fact.  Unfortunately this is unfamiliar to the majority of people, but Im following you on this.



If I may, I suggest checking out some of Dr. Hawkins work.  It is generally about spirituality and the pursuit of enlightenment, but includes a great deal of information in resolving the age old issues of the limitations of the mind/brain/intellect.

I believe in that, to a point. You truly fall in love, (as in the deep, lasting love, not the short fleeting love that most people experience) once. And if you don't find that 'soulmate' as you call it, in this life, you will not fall in love that deeply as you would if you did find them.

I know this is in the Philosophy section, but I felt like giving some insight from science.

In Physics, it is generally agreed that at one time or another every particle in existance was linked, due to a theory that is involved in quantum mechanics. This leads me to think that it is entirely possible that people can be linked, from means that we don't understand fully. I honestly do believe that some people are perfectly suited for one another, but they can also be happy with others, and therefore will not always find one another. Perhaps this is why some relationships aren't as happy and/or peaceful as others.



For the second question, I will take a religious point of view. Many Christians say that God doesnt appear to everyone, and cure all the worlds ailments because we have to have faith to fully understand him. We would take God for granted if he solved all of our problems, so to speak.

We would do exactly the same thing for soulmates. If we were born into the "new life" as you put it with our soulmates it would no longer be special and we would take it for granted. Thats what makes soulmates special. Finding that one person in the world that suits us, out of the 6 Billion that are currently alive is amazing.

Hope this provides some insight.

What is a soul mate? The question indicates a lack of knowledge as to what Soul is.

For me I have been married to the same wife for 50 years and she is my best friend. We plan on continuing our relationship in the next life and through out eternity.

The idea of returning to this planet in some other body is an ancient view and one which is out dated.



An olden race was especially given to belief in transmigration and reincarnation. This idea of reincarnation originated in the observance of hereditary and trait resemblance of offspring to ancestors. The custom of naming children after grandparents and other ancestors was due to belief in reincarnation. Some later-day races believed that man died from three to seven times. This belief (residual from the teachings of Adam about the mansion worlds), and many other remnants of revealed religion, can be found among the otherwise absurd doctrines of twentieth-century fixed and backward thinkers.

I am not sure I lived a past life, or had a soul mate in a past life.  However, I do feel like I have found a soul mate in this life I am currently living.  A soul mate does not have to be someone you have an intimate, romantic physical relationship with. In fact, most people have soul mates that they are not married to.  A soul mate is someone you connect with on a much deeper intimate soul level.  You understand each other, and love each other just for being the person they are.



I wish more people would seek out their own soul mate, rather than deciding the person they marry must be their soul mate.  It just doesn't work this way.  So many people would find joy in their life to find that soul mate, no matter what the relationship and situation they are in.

I have already met my soul mate. Definitely, there is no more chance for me to look for one. I can tell you truthfully because i married her. She is nine (9) years younger than me. And it is really hard to believe that we will met considering the gap of our age. We now have a four-year old cute daugther. With that, the soul mate will live forever with me.

i'm not sure those things can be destroyed...i'm almost positive but these things are so subjective it's hard to be positive. in my own personal case, i know it's impossible! i feel like those things can contribute, as well as not, to the overall feeling of happiness. but happiness is fleeting, and yes you're talking to a seasoned pessimist. i've kinda settled in to my views on happiness. i don't strive for happiness. i do what makes me happy in the hopes that happiness will come to visit more frequently but i think it's unrealistic to wish for happiness all the time. we have to "come down" at some point. the thing i hope for, have desire for, and a strong will for, is to be able to come out of the downside of unhappiness. nice question...

Well, you can't destroy will, because that was our gift from God.  It could make or break our happiness depending on how we use it.  Desire, I think, is a form of temptation.  There's a difference between what we want (desire) and what we need.

You can't destroy desire because that is a desire, too. But it's this realization by itself where you see that the desire to end desire because you desire more pleasure when you have no desires is a desire is what ends desire, because "you" can't do anything about desire. It's the logic of the mind itself that stops the mind from working so all that remains is just the awareness and the freedom of what is, and so there is quietness and peace from the scurrying of the mind which brings happiness.

Maybe the real question is "Is it necessary to destroy desire and will in order to be happy?"  From what I can tell, the answer is "no."  Thinking that you have to destroy parts of yourself...if it's even possible to do that...in order to be happy could mean that you are operating with less than all of the information about happiness that is available to you.  From what I can tell, being happy is about a decision you get to make about your life each moment that you are alive.  Desire is about wanting things, and whether getting those things will make you happy or not is another thing entirely.  Will is about your freedom to choose.  There is no reason to give up either of these things in order to be happy.  Good luck!

Happiness need not be antagonistic to desire. After all desire is part of Creation/Nature. In fact, true experience of genuine desire ( not greed, not indulgence ) will eventually lead us the absence of desire, ushering in a higher quality of happiness. Key factor is awareness. Anything done with full/total awareness takes us to the choice- less  awareness, a desire -less state. Moreover, when the mind is given something that is more than the happiness due to satisfaction of desires, it moves away from desire. Meditation, often, gives such an experience of happiness that is a-causal, different from the desire fulfilled happiness.

The question could be read in two different ways. Firstly, as if it is asking if we could destroy desire and use our will - if the word ‘will’ is read as a verb - in favour of some greater happiness. If this is what you mean then you have pitched desire against happiness, and by doing this simply meaning that desire and happiness are two things diametrically opposed, as happiness could be had if we, by the active use of our will, could control our desires, and therefore live for the purpose of some higher goals in view, as instead or merely seeking to fulfil the wants of our desire we could reach beyond carnal pleasures of our body to find true happiness.

If this is the case, then I would like to suggest first of all that any such notion of happiness is an illusion, an immaculate dream, unreal and unattainable in reality. I firmly believe that we are where we are, both mentally as well as spiritually, that where we are is where desires are rooted, or this means to say that it is by the very reason of our earthly desires rooted in the reality of our world that we are rooted. It is due to our needs and desires that we find this world a friendly place to live in, and also to live through. This is by the very reason of our nature that we cannot be happy without a reasonable fulfilment of our desires - then killing desire, meaning all desires, would only bring upon chaos and sense of dislocation in the mind. We might then be asking as what are we doing here? There would be no challenge, nothing to do battle with, noting to use to improve, and overcome, no way of knowing what we want, and how are we doing.

I therefore think that instead of killing desires the purpose of life is to find happiness in using them for living, as it is commonly said: not living to eat but to eat to live. Desires are instinctive and natural in the mind. They make us strong the way fuel brings an engine to life. When we come in this world we are all but desires and needs, a purely natural beings. We like to be liked and we like to have what we need and what we desire. But as we live grow older and learn the ways of our world we also learn the use of reason in the methods of fulfilling our desires. We learn to master our will but not become a needless and free from desire person but to become a refined person who would can manage to have desire without losing his sense of purpose.



In this sense, desires, especially when they run riots in our mind, or for the purpose of us seeking to know as what good use we can put them, what higher disciplines could we find to alternate upon them, to keep them in check, for without knowing nothing better then the materialistic objects our desires we would stay trapped in the baser realities of life, we would not know as if we find desires taxing and wasting then for what purpose and by what reason we should sacrifice them. I for instance would not be able to fast and pray - as provided the purity of my intention none of these would fulfil any of my desires - and keep sane if do not do this for some good purpose of my faith. And on the other hand if do not have desire then what would be there to sacrifice and use to make life a better life.

But the question could also be read as meaning if we could kill both desire and will, all in favour of happiness. If you mean this by asking then I ask what would you use to kill desire if not will, and once desires is gone then will would still remains, as just per instance. This way we reach a dilemma as will could only be killed by the use of faculties of the mind that do not need will itself as driving force, which of course is our instinctive urges, needs of desires. This in fact is conundrum of a situation as desires can only be circumvent by the use of will applied for some reason or purpose, and will can only be killed by desires, the it cannot be known as how to kill both without using any thing else, for happiness does not kill anything it only replaces sadness and sorrow.

This is not very clear as what exactly you mean by your questions: to kill desire and use will for the purpose of being happy, as living an idealistic, but desire free, life, or to kill both, desire and will, for the sake of some immaculate happiness, or. I person find more sense in the former, where I have elaborated that desire are fuel of life that could also burn and destroy if not handled carefully and rightly purposefully.

Happiness is the very goal of desire, or it can be said that all our desires are focused on attaining happiness of one sort or another, but desire by itself is but a dream if it is not crystyllized and given impetus by the will.

I think what you mean by happiness is innocence, and that is not brought about by desire at all, it is the very nature of those who have either not yet experienced the world or of those who have gone beyond it, which is not to say that they have 'destoyed' desire. The happiness which is attained by desire does not last - a desire arises,the will is joined to it,and is followed by success or failure in attaining the goal, but either way neither the happiness nor the unhappiness lasts.



That which you are refering to must be uncaused for it not to be a temporary effect of a cause,like the 'destruction' of desire.

If we look a the lives of those who try, we can easily see the answer for ourselves. Many religious/spiritual practices are in favor of suppressing certain desires in order to achieve some spiritual affirmation or resolution. Its quite common for Catholic and Buddhist monks to practice celibacy or restraint from sexual desires. Although their reasoning's may vary, they both agree that it helps to eliminate suffering. But are desires the reason why we suffer? No, in fact desires are the only reason were able to feel happiness.While suffering comes to us by thinking only of our own desires and not of others.

But what are desires? They're something we feel as a lack or a need within us. And only by filling this lack are we given the sensation of happiness. Have you ever heard the expression "a woman is never happy until her needs are met." Well this applies to us all.

Well perhaps you've heard about this before or maybe this is nothing new. But what we so often overlook is how once our needs are met, once receiving the pleasure/happiness derived from filling them, our desire consequently disappears. Thus eliminating the source where happiness can be received.

So maybe the problem is not with our desires, but with how we receive pleasure from them. We go from one desire to the next, because our happiness is always short lived like a fleeting moment. But what if the true problem was in the way we receive or for whom we receive for? Humanity has looked in all fields and sciences in trying to figure out ways to make us happy, but do we have a science that deals with the nature of receiving it? If I receive for myself and my needs are limited, then so shall the happiness derived from them be limited too. But what If I was able to receive for others? Well below, I've attached a link to a short video to help answer those questions.

Cheers!!

As an individual social being you cooperate, coordinate or collaborate sometimes more, sometimes less with social reality.  At any rate you are a social reality although an individual one you are still as much society as society is you although perhaps not the most populous of social activities but then again perhaps you are at the peek of most social activity.  You never stop being social activity just because you are able to isolate the individual social being with isolation chambers.  Knowing that you also realize that the free spirit part is more generalized to the individual social being, a specific level and qualitatively original form of being.  That is where the free spirit in each of us is. In this we are all free spirits.

Nobody is entirely free of society because society encompasses all. Even if you are a vagabond, a recluse, a pervert, a certified lunatic, an out-and-out iconoclast or even anti-social- society has a section of people like you so that individualism does not exist per se.

A free spirit, I suppose, is someone who lives within a society but lives by bending some rules of that society. A free-spirit cannot be defined then as the opposite of someone who conforms to society. Gypsies and cross-dressers, for example, are considered as free spirits but they certainly conform to other codes of society even though they may defy some. Someone who walks about town in a kilt and frilly blouse would be defying society in some aspect and could even be called a free spirit, but he is not someone who does not conform to society altogether.

So, my answer is- I am a free spirit who conforms to society when what I am conforming to does not clash with my principles.

Yes a free spirit Princess
I like to get my priorities straight. A free spirit is not the kind to twist and turn to meet your every need. You'll have to make it simple for them by coming to an understanding of what you want most out of a relationship and asking for that, and nothing else.



Don't sweat the small stuff. Things like punctuality, precautions, and any other kind of minor limit or inhibition will be of no concern to an independent mind. They like to flow through life, following their whims - and this often makes them extremely creative and fascinating individuals, which is what probably attracted you to them in the first place. By imposing dams, as little as they may be, you could very well suffocate the qualities that make this person desirable to you, if you don't manage to scare them off first.



Avoid setting rules. Restrictions are like chains, and will send this wild horse running towards the horizon. Get to know the person inside out. Study their tendencies, their quirks, their deepest desires, and their worst fears. Always be accepting and open-minded. Knowledge is power. The better you know this person, the less you'll feel the need to control them. Moreover, he or she will sense this and feel like you're the only person who truly knows them and thus, the only person they can be their uninhibited selves around. To a free spirit, this is the jackpot.

neither.  i go my own way in most things. but i can't call myself a free spirit because i strongly value my independence and that requires earning one's own living and being responsible for all one's own choices. i've always stepped back a moment when the crowds are rushing in one direction. hate crowds and rarely excited about anything most people are excited about. on the other hand, the crowd might be rushing towards something really wonderful or away from something awful.  in other words, i don't try to be different simply for the sake of being different. which in my thinking makes a person as controlled by others as following their lead.

Philosophy is like a never-ending journey of discovery, the never-ending story in the making [it's NOT like going on vacation or trying to reach the Moon]; if you set an ultimate goal [a Destination] you have already ruined and tainted the trek.  One cannot do philosophy with a biased mind - the journey IS the reward [the trek is the destination, if you must - just ask James T. Kirk.  :-)].

To simply 'be' is seen to be the only goal for some people. Happiness can't be obtained from attachment to objects, people or goals in the ephemeral world in which we all live.

I believe most philosophers do maintain an ultimate goal - however, dependent upon the philosophical style of analysis - that ultimate goal may be simple acceptance and understanding of the current state. An existentialist, by definition, is not looking for anything other than a marked comprehension of the factors and reasons which make us 'here'. Why, what, when, how, who - are all questions they may experience and investigate to better explain the purpose of our creation, existence and demise. A creationist or philosophical theologian may search for man's ultimate responsibility to god and god's creations.



Philosophy is the why of everything. Omnipotence, while lofty, may be considered the object of a philosopher's ponderings, however, are rarely the outright product.

Finally, I believe you might be hard pressed to find a philosopher who would be content stating that was their endpoint.

There is no doubt if you are biased then the conclusion you've reached is flawed. However you can't have any answers or discovery until you have a goal. Even if you are not aware you still have an outcome in mind . . . . a goal. If you intend on going to NY then that destination is your goal.

True within philosophy there is NO ultimate truth as each person seeks his/her own answer . . .  and we don't always reach the same conclusions. However you can not have an answer until you are focused on a particular aspect ie goal. Over the centuries many philosophers have tried to unlock the mysteries, tried to simply the basic questions; ie
where do we come from, 
is there a God, 
is there a difference between humans and animals,
Is our reality just an illusion,
What leads a person to kill,
etc etc

Each question in a sense is a goal, we must have a question, an inquiry before we can begin seeking answers. If there is no question there is no answer, and then there is simply no concept of philosophy!

The underlying base is 'curiosity, it is our curiosity that leads as to inquire, which then becomes a goal, something we need the understanding of. So among many things Philosophy is also basically 'curiosity' - as it is our curiosity that compels us to seek answers!

I would think a philosopher’s ultimate goal would be to learn and find the truth.
I believe a philosopher can have no ultimate goal if they love learning the truth as other people see it... perhaps they'd be an observer..

A philosopher will have goals  - or at least one, to be a great philosopher, the greatness being in direct proportion to the subtlety of that goal. He who has no ultimate goal is no philosopher; he is an Enlightened One, a Master, a Buddha. The ultimate goal is attained by having none.

Both happened at the same instant.  Laws are not for individuals.  Wouldn't it sound stupid if laws were made only for those who can understand them?  Everything in the Universe (except perhaps, man) understand and obey laws.  (Men are more keen on breaking them).

Laws (of physics) don't have to have anyone to understand them in order to exist. For instance, you could argue that what's the point of, say, radioactivity, when only the dinosaurs existed because they couldn't understand particle theory? But it's still there.

I suppose what we call "laws" are really only "truths", which are always correct and always apply in our universe. The word law indicates that you can disobey it, but are not allowed to. With a law of physics, it is not a question of "may", but "are able to".

So, in conclusion, the laws which govern the universe were created at the same time; one did not cause the other. Perhaps they are, to a certain extent, the same thing? Besides, is this philosophy or physics? Do I need to get out more? These questions may never be answered.

I would say they both began at the same time. Without the laws, there would be no universe to govern. And without the universe, there is no need for laws.

"what was the point of laws when there was no one around to understand them"

I don't think there is a point to the laws of the universe. They just are. But without them absolutely nothing would exist.

The universe and the "laws" (necessities) that govern it are inseparable. Those "laws" are formulations of how the universe works. But the universe is not the subject and the "working" its activity; the universe *is* the working -- it is a *process*.

As to your second question: the so-called "laws" of the universe are not laws in the legal sense, which can be broken or adhered to. The "laws" of the universe can't be broken: they are *necessities*.

Part 1: There are only six possibilities. (a) The universe and the laws that govern it came into existence at the same time, (b) The laws preceded the universe, (c) the universe preceded the laws, (d) The universe exists without the laws -- there are no laws governing the universe, (e) There is, in reality, no universe, just the laws, and (f) There is neither a universe or laws that govern it.

I personally favor (e) or (f). Our concept of the universe is a mental manifestation of our understand of the laws that govern it. Regardless of whether we understand the universe or even accept its existence, reality will go on.

Part 2.  The laws are absolute. Just because  one doesn't understand the law of gravity (for example), doesn't allow (or make them) go floating off into space -- the molecules of his body don't go flying apart due to the lack of any cohesive attraction. Therefore the laws exist regardless of our understanding of them.

they arrived at the same time. the laws are as much universe as anything else. before there was mass there could not have been the laws that mass must follow. though once mass existed as mass is, then it must follow those laws by the nature of its being.

there is no point of laws. the laws just are. it is the way things interact. the laws as we know are just us figuring out the way stuff interacts.

there is no more point to the laws now then in the beginning, though because of the laws we are able to exist as we are know, interact with the universe as we do now, and also use our knowledge of the laws for our own ends.



but technically the universe did not really come into being so much, and yet it wasn't always around, because time is also a component of universe and there was a point where there was no time, no space since the universe was packed as tight as is possible. in this case do you still say there was universe? well yes and no. was the universe around forever? well, yes and no, if it comes from a point where there was no time, then there is no before, no forever, no amount of time, no size no distance, was something there? yes and no.

I guess the same time.
The universe started out as a singularity of enormous heat and density.

The laws of physics work only up to a point.  Once you get to the actual beginning of the singularity, or try to guess what was "before" it, the laws of physics break down.



You get to a quantum level at that point, and we currently don't understand things at that level.  And they certainly don't follow the laws of physics

I always go with common sense first so it would be my head.

But, haven said that: God's Love runs through my heart and as pure as mountain spring water. There is always Love in every decision to some degree.

My heart would always be first with God and common sense God gave me to use both. But, he gave us a heart to love and be loved and a brain to know how to love and be loved.

Amen.

Well, I have to say your heart makes your decisions. 
It's always better to listen to your heart because your head tends to lead to bad things.
For example: If you were dating someone and they cheated or hurt you really bad, your head would automatically say...Tell that person it's over. But your heart, would also have an influence. You might love that person. And love it stronger than a thought.

Hope that helps.

Heart makes a very good decision when the head could no longer decide. There are things in this world that the head could not decide or reason out which  the heart does. It is always at its best if you follow your heart.

I agree with Third P.

Also will like to add that in our daily life we are always being offered several choices for different issues. The heart does not think but it knows what is the best choice and always offers you the best possible choice but it sees no reason to show you why that choice is the best choice because it sees no reason why you would not make that choice. It feels that since this is the best choice then taking that choice must just come naturally to you.

The head on the other hand always want to see were a particular choice is going to lead it to. And often it cannot see where the hearts choice is leading to and so interprets that it may not be the best choice. It wants to take that choice which it thinks gives the greatest clarity of what the choice is leading to.

"Follow Your Heart". Thats what so many have tried to tell us. It means to take the choice that the heart has to offer and have no doubt that that is the correct choice. Clarity will always come as you follow that choice.

But 'following the heart' is also a choice and the head has a difficult time accepting that in the absence of clarity.

I consider myself to be very reliable. I dislike intently people who let you down without prior contact. Lateness for appointments is discourteous and can result in great inconvenience for the person you are meeting. If I say I will do something I always do it and I never let anyone down. I think that is quite reliable and demonstrates good manners.

I think it all depends on the person and situation in which I am to be held accountable. If someone asks me to do something or to be somewhere, and I have no interest in the person or the activity, I might say I'm interested but I simply won't go.



However, if I AM interested in those things, I am highly reliable. I find that it's more of the people around me who are unreliable, rather than the other way around.

To live and Let live happily, 
Get somewhere in life in terms of education, 
Help improve our environment ( the co2 emissions)
To reduce crime
To help spread mankind by getting married and producing children and bringing them up with excellent morals and a positive attitude,
For making and keeping our parents, loved ones, neighbours and the society happy and intact.
For everyone thinking as one rather than each individual self, 
To stop this selfishness and spread love and peace.
For accepting each other for what each individual is.
To stop racism and discrimination for different types of people for their dress sense or because of the religion they follow, and to always remember we all are one and have to live together, we cant blow each others heads off.
for accepting people with different opinions and for spreading truth and minusing the amount of lies people speak.

With all this we all can be happy :)

As someone constantly accused of being a perfectionist, it is sad to learn that it is now considered something of a 'mental disorder'. So what is perfection to me? It is when something achieves perfect balance, or harmony with the rest of its context or universe, or whatever. (And that context or universe is presumably a given that one cannot alter.)

To some, perfection is just an illusion. To others, it exists in the form of their mother, their lover, their role model, their religion, Leonardo Da Vinci’s The Vitruvian Male, a beautiful red rose, 36-24-36, yoga, etcetera. For these people, perfection is not only possible but tangible too. Perfection to me is, therefore, just a relative term whose existence or non-existence you can’t contest.

Will science ever have the same rights as Christianity?



In Creationism according to Genesis, God created the Earth in seven days, yet science says that the Earth was formed over millions of years. The laws of Physics forbid something to be made from nothing, as it happened in Genesis.
At the beginning of time there was only Adam and Eve. Are we all in-bread? Surely evolution makes more sense.

Why don't science and Christianity have equal rights?
The word 'God' is spelt with a capital G, as is Genesis. 
Why isn't evolution spelt with a capital E?
Christianity is spelt with a capital C so why isn't science spelt with a capital S?
Does religion have the 'copyright' for the term 'church'? There are no 'Churches of Science.' I would imagine there would be a big argument if a Church of Science did open.
Do you think science and Christianity should have equal political rights? Will religion always win? Could the two beliefs SOMEHOW be united in your mind or do they mix like oil and water?

The trick to religion is not to read into it. My grandma once knew an atheist who read the Bible cover to cover- and said it was the best story he'd read. Faith is a matter of believing, science is a matter of fact.



As far as rights... Religion has been around a fair bit longer. It's earned some rights of passage. Also, religion deals with higher powers, more in depth themes, and is not truly of this world. Science is of this world in every meaning. As an earthly form, it drops the capitalization.

Because of the age of the religious books, and the fact they were spread by word of mouth, everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Also think of its purpose; doesn't it make God seem more powerful if he created the whole universe from nothing in seven days, forming man with a touch of his hand and the dust of the earth than if we gradually grew from monkeys over millions of years?

If you believe, you don't question. If you question, leave others to believe.

Depends, depends on what you mean.
Ultimately I like the anonolgy of a sparrow building a nest of which it understands well compared to it trying to comprehend a house of bricks and mortar. It is simply beyond it. Some things are simply beyond us.

Of course sometimes your asking the wrong question to find the answer you seek.

And yet theres another approach .. the first guys that discovered the shape of dna did so by comparing lots of data to find the bits that matched up and managed to extrapolate from that, accurately, the shape. They described it as comparing the splashings of paint over an object you couldnt see - but could see the splashes. From that you may be able to work it out. Of course you may never get the proof that it is accurate - but you will have a good idea that is well backed up. It may be enough if its the best you got.

Then of course there is the brute force appraoch - keep asking until you get it.

Yet another is to apply theory after theory until one fits best and you are unable to find a better fit.



There is also the theory that those are better trained in doing something will be more likely to attain a certain result that someone not trained may only produce randomly.

Im sure there are more views, points, theorys etc than that. 
But Im sure Ive given you some food for thought.

I guess a more direct answer is when you are satisfied that you have done all you can to find the answer.
When you are able to accept that you wont find it, then you stop looking.

It depends on the question.  Some questions do not have an answer.



"If a tree falls in the forest and there is absolutely no one to hear it, does it make a sound?"



'Which came first, the chicken or the egg."



This type of question challenges people to think and explore ideas. 
Someone can make up an answer. In both science and philosophy seeking answers leads to more questions and possibilities.  So we all have to live with more questions than concrete forever answers.



The important thing is to live with the questions and enjoy the dilemma of not knowing.  Unanswered questions are what makes life interesting. It is what makes  science and technology possible, Thought is what makes us different as humans.



It is no substitute for enjoying life even if times one really feels that they need an answer like why do we have wars or why does a person die?  .



In short human life is based on unanswered and unanswerable questions. Accepting this and seeking a balance between finding out and enjoying life is to live a full life. Never thinking or accepting bogus answers is a half life.

It's not difficult to live with big questions and I find it quite cathartic and interesting just to speculate about what may or may not be possible.

Also, there is so much awe inspiring information that is available that I know I'm never going to be able to know all the things that I would love to know about the universe are part of. I feel privileged to live in a time where do know so much but I'd love to see what we know in 1000 or even 500 years time.

This is true in our world of change and limitation...it is the mind that moves, dragging "us" with it.  Thus, even if an answer is found, it might be a temporary answer or only suited to a specific set of circumstances.  We must learn to accept Paradox, for it is here that all exists...all inclusive, all encompassing...the absolute All That Is.  Unfound answers are not so dissimilar from temporary or morphing and changing answers...all are suited to the now of Now, tailored to the circumstances of that particular moment.  When we acquiesce to Source as an open container/agent for Its flowing wisdom, we no longer "seek" that which we already are...then, every moment is perfect.  We are no longer diverted or distracted from What Is as it is, struggling to control outcomes, attempting to put an ego-spin on every event in our lives.  Ironic, no, that we all hang out in the Question & Answer Forum?  So, then, is this not the perfect Paradox...that we listen to one another as we sincerely seek answers, or even ask burning questions?  Ahhhhhh...it is as it is.  And it constantly arises and falls away, reforming into new circumstances, contexts, questions, answers...and we cannot run fast enough to catch up, with our chaotic mind pursuing the last or next thing while missing the "current" moment.  Thus, the adage: Go with the flow...in other words, remain current in the current of Life, aware of "this" moment only, harmoniously riding the wave that emerges before it falls away into the Ocean and re-emerges as another unique moment.  This, after all, is all there is...Source is all that is.  Enjoy!

This is a good question because living without answers to questions hardly appeals at all but makes up a large part of this life, so how do you live with it indeed.  Perhaps a part of it is, that we want an answer to questions but only if the answers we find are those we can live with or accept.

There are those questions that have no definitive answer because they are about such things as human behaviour, which I can't speak for others but to me is at times baffling .  The answer to those type of questions constantly changes for me, and just when I think I figure it out I realize I know nothing.

There are those really tough technical questions in subjects related to math or science that no matter how many diagrams or hands on models are used still don't make sense to someone like me with no technical mind to interpret it all with.  Knowing the answer can be like living without it anyway.



So in my opinion it's up to the individual to decide how much of life's questions they can live with unanswered and which key questions they must have answered.  There is worthiness in the pursuit of answers to life's questions.  Answers can further the development of the mind but better yet I hope furthers a shared consciousness in humans.  And perhaps having no answers might foster the opposite but more than likely it fosters the human condition that makes us unable to know others or this existence at all.

For every thought that we have...



...do an infinite number of realties form and then disperse depending on whether we choose to act on those thoughts?

Or is the course of action you choose to take the only one you could ever have chosen because it is based the summation of all your thoughts and experiences, and could only ever have lead you to the choice you end up making?

So free will is an illusion and the only reality that could exist is the one you play out.

You have up to four thousand thoughts a minute.  Off which you only register perhaps 20 and you very seldom react to any of those. If you re-act to 5 or 6 thoughts a day than you are doing a good job. And some of those are more habitual than actual new.  At the end off your life you have accomplised 10 new thoughts plus deeds you are fantastic.

I've changed my mind about the nature of free will a number of times and it's a very interesting and tricky subject. Much more so than Christians would have people believe (see my question on omnipotence).

I think what you do for the most part is a reaction to your experiences and your knowledge, mixed with natural biological functions. It also involves a good deal of luck on meeting the right people who can influence you positively and constructively instead of smashing you down as so many people take pleasure in doing.

I like to think that if you learn to grasp your positive thoughts and learn to ignore the negative ones you can infulence your life for the better.

So yes I don't think things are determined because a lot of things are very much up to chance.

This is a fine thought, which quite naturally leads up to the ultimate questions of the possibilities of freeness of human will. 
Do we have free will? 
Do we choose our paths in life, or just follow preordained courses of our destiny?

The questions invite us to probe the reality of our life, the mind and our interaction with the world. But while considering these interesting questions why not take into account, first and foremost, the fact that we exist at the centre of the activity. We are the ones questioning and then we are the ones to provide the answers. If we are the ones capable of generating and exerting the power of will then there is no question of the ownership of will that is purely ours.

The question is – is there someone else in the world, against whom we might be capable of pitching our will, or whose will we should know and seek, for collaboration?



The matter of 'summation of all your thoughts', of influences and effects of the past in fact is not the matter things the past, but mainly things that are with us now as our being present. The process summation of life into a moment is never complete, until the moment that is yet to come – a moment is forever.



Then does our past is also ‘someone else’, I mentioned in the previous paragraph, that is solely responsible for determining our future? But past is never fixed, but is always in a state of flux, of increase, of growth, so much so that we cannot come to know fully as what exactly past is, as for instance, the moment I think about my past it changes for me, by the very act of my thinking.

Things go on forever without being fully added up to form any fixed form upon which we might fix our sense of reality and say that that thing alone has caused this. The only things we have now are our opinions, and impressions, that two change but while they do they also give us just sufficient amount of guidance to see a little further into things and find the way for our will.



The seat of the government of our moment now for the purpose of all the moments to come therefore is always vacant. This is up to us to have as much of it as we could, according to our ability and will, and participate in shaping the future. If we are idle then things will keep changing by the reason of some unknown will, but if we participate we enter with a rightful claim upon the determination of our future. Mind is a reality in time where it is subjected to an interminable flow and to randomly initiated sequences of events. We are the ones to bring order into chaos, we are the ones supposed to seek to offer answers. I would say that I am free, but responsible, free to jump in but responsible for what might happen thereafter.

Free will is a condition which I have wrangled with...not on a metaphysical level, asking is it inevitable, predetermined...guided by unseen forces, but on a socio/political cultural level, how much of what I think is inculcated subliminally? How susceptible am I to representations, cultural messages from the day I was born predisposing me to 'go down' certain thought processes, form particular opinions all broiled up in the nature/nurture whirl?
I am not arguing that I'm a hapless automaton subject only to propoganda and populist garbage, I suppose I want to cut through all of that so I can achieve the aim of having an original thought/idea! Not one I necessarily want to act on, but to be sure that it is ALL mine.
So, if free will is an illusion, then I need to have confidence in the reality I have forged for myself, while not insisting others adhere to its principles.

This depends on the nature of thought - of which the jury is still out on. If thoughts either originate and/or are materially affected by quantum phenomena then there are many courses of action available.

If there are virtual universes where alternative decisions were made and/or acted upon then the inhabitants of those 'realities' would be responsible for whatever they chose or did not chose. I take the soliptical view on this.

The criminal law courts take the decide that you do have free will (unless you temporarily or permanently lack capacity). Is this right? Is this fair? Yes - you should be accountable for your actions.

I believe that ever since the moment of creation, all matter (including our own material existence) is set up to behave in a pre-determined manner. This merely gives us the allusion of free will. This is the only reality that can play out. I treat life as though I have genuine agency - that I can affect things just because I chose to. Notwithstanding that it is my destiny to choose this as otherwise life would just be too complicated.

Yes, it does.  You're the only one who can't hear it.  The guy on your left sees it falling and jumps back, thus hearing the tree fall.  Although you can't hear your own scream it is heard by the guy on your left who did not see the tree falling and was thus totally startled by the gut-wrenching banshee screams coming out of you that he wet himself.

Unfortunately this guy was carrying the picnic basket which he inadvertently soiled prompting his wife to say, "Can't you do anything right Harold!" which IS a sound, albeit unpleasant.

If a tree falls in a jungle, and there is no one miles around, does that tree still make a sound. Yes, no doubt, just b/c there is no one to hear it does not mean tree didn't make a sound.

Similarly there is no doubt tree falling on your foot would make a sound. Somebody who is blind is unable to visualize or see the sun, but it doesn't take away the fact, that sun as an entity exists. Hence in this scenario 'sound' as an entity exists but only limitation is acknowledgment. Existence of an entity and it's acknowledgment and calibration are two separate issues.



The question somebody who is deaf will be able to hear that sound no. Then simply he/she is not deaf. 
The definition of somebody who is deaf is taken as somebody who is unable to hear, for what ever reasons. In other words something is hindering or blocking the information, which therefore can not be processed.

It's like asking someone who is blind to tell us what red looks like, in the same way a deaf person would not be able to hear, but depending on the limitations, might be able to process the vibrations, hence feeling rather than hearing!

I think more informed answer can be given by an expert in the field or somebody who has some knowledge of physics.

If you do think it's all in your head and that we don't exist then i'm responding to non other than my imagination/dream.

Sound is a vibration that travels through an elastic medium as a wave. The speed of sound describes how much distance such a wave travels in a certain amount of time. In dry air at 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound is 343 m/s (1235 km/h, or 770 mph, or 1129 ft/s, or approximately 5 seconds per mile).

Although it is commonly used to refer specifically to air, the speed of sound can be measured in virtually any substance. Sound travels faster in liquids and non-porous solids than it does in air.

In general, the speed of sound c is given:



where
C is a coefficient of stiffness 
ρ is the density 
Thus the speed of sound increases with the stiffness of the material, and decreases with the density. For general equations of state, if classical mechanics is used, the speed of sound c is given by

c = the square root of C over P

Acoustics and noise
The scientific study of the propagation, absorption, and reflection of sound waves is called acoustics. Noise is a term often used to refer to an unwanted sound. In science and engineering, noise is an undesirable component that obscures a wanted signal.

So to answer to your question...YES it does; and so do you (even if the noise of your screaming is unwanted) unless you are mute too.

A seedling grows out of the bleakness of a cold and damp soil but soil is not all that makes it rise upwards for its growth, or something it seeks its escape from, instead, when a seedling senses light and the presense of free atmospheric air it reaches out for both while still keeping to its roots.

All things return to their nature, to their best. The simplest natural reality of our being is that we exist, and faith, at its very basic level, is the assertion this fact. I can say that I realistically believe that I exist, as there are ample evidences for me to believe so. But if I think and ask myself as who am I then I realise that the realistic, of physical, evidence of my existence is not sufficient, then I have to faithfully believe in myself. I would then say – I really do not know who I am, what I am, and what purpose is my existence, or even if I really exist at all. I stop my mind running errand for such queries when I assert my faith, when I focus my mind on things I do, when I realise my will, or when I am in love, for instance.



Faith therefore come from the very the very heart of my being as saying and safely believing that I exist, that then becomes wordless knowledge of myself in my mind. I then find myself inclined to have beliefs of a certain kind, follow a religion for instance, The fact that I need to do this, one way or the other, is the very faith of my that is already their in place, since as long as myself. My faith grows not out of the gloom and doom of despair, but often through despair, and always from the very brilliance of my existence as a realisation of what I really am.

Then this is not strange that when someone finds faith it comes in form of a familiarity, something wee feel, believe and know, is for us. It is like coming home or finding inner peace, sense of exultation, purpose and elevation.

Good question.  People find faith in a variety of circumstances.  However, some people find faith when the chips are down and one is going through difficult times. This is because none of us want to believe that we are completely alone in times of despair.  A common phrase for this is 'Emergency Room Christians (sub any faith here)'.  Faith carries people through good and bad times alike.

I've never found that to be the truth.  Those who find faith in desperate times are more likely to lose it when times get good.  True faith comes in the good times when you don't need God.  It's like our human relations.  Would you rather marry someone who wanted you or someone who needed you?  I think most people would want someone who wants them.

I believe that once you are able to move past the despair through faith your experience widens and you become more confident of times ahead.  When troubled times come again, the past experiences will allow your faith to be stronger and you will move past despair quicker and stronger each time.  Our faith grows when we hurdle over the obsticle of despair.



Many other negative things such as indifference or hate can also grow out of despair, so it really depends how someone deals with it.

We have a strong tradition in the Christian faith of pain and suffering serving as the catalyst for spiritual transformation.  It seems to me that if everything was heavenly in our lives then we would not rethink our basic assumptions about God.  I am grateful that I came to the light through the long dark tunnel.

i suppose the faith that may grow depends on the despair that makes one turn to faith in the first place. if you have done a past deed, that was not the most acceptable, you will probably turn to a faith that will forgive you of it. if you wanted revenge on someone, you would probably turn to a faith that could give you the power to do so. there are other cases in which you have a misfortune and try to blame your faith. it can be either way, depending on the person and how they think/feel things.
i hope i answered the question okay! Have a good day!

Actually that's what I'm planning to do in the next few months. And in the  plan it is including leaving my current job, selling or renting my current house, etc. And I do this to get a diploma in some course when I already have a bachelor degree in other. I go there with student visa which means I can only work 16 hours per week at study time.

What would I do? Find a place to live. Find some job for sure, any job will do. And only then perhaps try to get a better job.



Can I make it? Well God help me, I do hope I can make it, lol.

I'd find the very cheapest place I could say that had running water. Ensuring I was suitably presented, I'd go to a pub/bar where I might expect to find some local english speaking people and talk to people. If there were no suitable people there I would still drink some nasty cheap alcohol and smoke nasty cheap cigarettes and contemplate plan B, C, D though to Z-23F.
Eventually, I would find an ex-pat community or take advantage of global stereotypes to get a job of some sort that could sustain me. I'd look for clerical or administrative positions over manual labour (however I wouldn't exclude that as an option) on the basis that there's more of an opportunity to talk to people and discover opportunities.
Sure I'd get upset that I lost my pension (which probably isn't going to be worth anything anyway), property and sentimental trinkets, but ultimately I'd find the experience quite an adventure.
In short, I wouldn't choose it, but if I were to find myself in that situation, I reckon I'd throw myself at it with gusto and not die or get arrested in the process.

8 yrs ago i was offered a job in Cyprus as a holiday rep I accepted.
I worked the summer season then stayed the winter without work then decided I wanted to stay in Cyprus permanently. I found an apartment and a full time permanent job and this is where i am now all my family are in the UK I met friends here and it's been a struggle but I am happy at long last. Don't have savings what I get as salary is all i have so as you can imagine at times it's been hard like when I got sick and had to go into the clinic. I have survived because this is what i want out of life and i believe if you want something enough you make sacrifices to get them.

Get a place  to atleast call home for a few days.  Perfect my resume and cover letters and attack places that will hire me...for me labs, tech comps, and universities...and seek any job that can temporarily pay the bills.



Once I'm safe from money restraints...the rest (friends, family concerns, etc) will follow.

I wish I had a nickle for every time that has happened to me!

Assuming I couldn't speak the language, I think that would be my greatest obstacle. But many people who have immigrated to our country have experienced the same obstacles and were able to get some initial help from other immigrants (e.g., housing, work, educational support to learn the language and develop a skill). Not easy, but accomplished by many.

Without such help I would have to rely on my collection of nickles.

Almost certainly.  I was brought up to be a survivor with a father (who left school at 12 to start work and sold newspapers on a street corner) who had the philosophy "if you want pocket money, get out and earn it".  I did - I had 3 paper rounds, morning before school, evening after school and a 4-hour Sunday morning one;  I had more money than any of my friends! 
I have no friends in this Country so I wouldn't miss that, my kids have emigrated, I would have no problem scrubbing floors for a living if I had to.

IT means identify what your true self is Know it not guess not think about it but know it. You are not your thoughts but you are because they are not separate from you. You are not your body but you are because it is not separate from you. So what are you? You are You, the only definition of you is what you make it. You are not the world but you are because you cannot exist without the world. So know they self means to know existence as a whole. Know the whole being which you claim as self. Know it but dont just know it after the knowing seek understanding of it and then live in accord with it.

I believe that one's entire life is a journey towards self-discovery. Everything you do and every experience that you have changes who you are, your perspective of the world and your place in it. With everything constantly changing, figuring out who you are can be a challenge. Here are some steps that can help in knowing ones self: have a set of beliefs, learn from past experiences, expand horizons, gain perspective from others and be be open to changes.

We must start from getting to know this great-little soul we own, in order to adjust to environment the best way.

But, I believe, it is the essence of being Alive.

I sometimes use the phrase when someone is being a hippocrite - critizising another's weaknesses but failing to notice that they too have the same faults.

Once we realise we are all capable of thinking, feeling and acting in the same way as others and see that the good and the bad we notice in others is just a reflection of ourselves then we can begin to say we truly know ourselves.

People search their whole entire lives looking for something but in reality if they got close to who they truly were their lives would not be as complicated.  Everyone is different we are all special and everyone has gifts from God we just have to realize and believe and love ourselves enough to see them through :)))We must question everything in life and our feelings and emotions and reactions to why we feel this way to the external forces of life and situations and people that begin on the inside know thyself.......................

At a practical level, knowing myself basically implies knowing what I really want. That is what is the most important thing one needs to know about oneself. It is what we want that determines what we do with our life. The trouble is that we never seem to know well enough what exactly we want, which is what gives rise to regrets. We pursue an aim with full sincerity, commitment and belief, and no sooner do we attain it than it suddenly looks less important than something else. The whole exercise of having toiled for something believed to be the most important, turns out to be a waste of time and energy. Therefore, knowing oneself is all about finding out what one really wants in life.

At a deeper philosophical level, the Indian Philosophy talks about searching and knowing self in the context of 'permanent happiness' (Sanskrit word "aanand"). The idea is that once you begin to search your own self, you convert your subject self into an object self, so that you can look at everything concerned with yourself in an objective manner..... this would lead to conquering attachment to self and eradication of the 'rogue' ego..... and that indeed is the formula for the kind of permanent happiness that remains unruffled and unaffected by any events or happening..... this state of being that is unattached to self and self interests, implies true liberation. That is why pursuit of knowing self is considered one of the important means of Moksha or Nirvana. Meditation is the recommended way for such pursuit of self knowledge, because that separates and removes us from all objects around us, so that we can concentrate entirely within our own self.

Here's my two cents:
This is a policy of relentless self-analysis. It requires you to note all your ego's defenses (denial, distortion, fantasy, projection and so forth) and to penetrate them all so that you can see what is really you and what is the false you. Then the task becomes fostering the strengths of the real you. Aristotle believed that self-improvement was a moral duty.

Knowing oneself is a journey of learning and understanding what lies deep within our subconscious, our psyche. We cannot truly comprehend why we behave, think, and react in the manner we do if have no knowledge of what lies deep in the recesses of our minds.

First, I dont know if you are asking this question after having understood that the soul is immortal or if you are still wondering and trying to figure out the answer. It is possible that you are asking the question after having understood that soul is infact immortal but you think that you had a difficult time reaching that understanding or you reached that understanding quite easily in your experience but cannot believe that other people around you are having such a hard time understanding that what you have understood.

I say this because it is interesting the way that you have put the question. If you have not found the answer yet then it is possible that the way you are putting this question is  in itself hindering you from reaching the answer.

Maybe you can try changing your approach a bit. Perhaps instead of asking "Why is it difficult to understand the immortality of soul ?", you may ask "Is there an easy way to understand the immortality of the soul ?" Feel the difference in your own feelings when you ask the same question in the first way and then in the second way. I think that deep down you have come to an understanding that soul is indeed immortal but you now want to 'know' it as well.

If you have asked the question for yourself then take this new approach and try it for a few weeks. And see when, where and how the answer comes.

You will surprise yourself at how easy it really is to know.

So to answer your original question "Why is it difficult to understand the immortality of soul ?" - it is because you are perhaps asking the question in a way that is not allowing yourself to see the answer.

Edit : And then when you do get your answer, know that it is your knowing, your truth... for you to keep. There is never ever a reason to enforce your understanding on any other person and you wont do that when you understand that everyone is also searching for his/her own answers from his/her own perspective. Although it is always exciting to share your truth with others who dont mind listening but when you know that the truth of the person standing next to you may not be the same as your own, then you will not be affected by anyone's negative (or even positive) responses to your understanding.

Then you will be really really really free.

And also know that there will always be people who can see the truth almost as you see it !!

Because any belief some of us have (or lack) isn't strong enough to acknowledge the immortality of the soul.
Admitting this immortality is based on belief alone, there is no proof so we find it too difficult to understand te concept.

For no one alive has ever told its magnificence. To understand the immortality of the soul, you must lead a life of virtue, of faith and purity, of honor and dignity.



You will truly understand the immortality of the soul when you have gone to the afterlife, life after your death.



That is when your soul will become immortal and only you can know its magnificence, no one else, for that is your OWN soul, and no more can you go back to earth to tell others about it. Even though you are given a second chance, say, you become a restless spirit, you cannot tell others about the immortality of the soul for you have be to IT to UNDERSTAND it.

Religions that advocate that there is someone we know him as God who has all the answers for our problems. No matter what we do he has the final authority to forgive us regardless of our bad karma. This is the most simplistic approach to a very complex issue. If the soul is immortal then it carries over all good and bad things a human does during his stay on this earth and there is no escape from the bad karma- Not even god can save us from the consequences. This thought goes against the two major religious teaching in the world namely Christianity and Islam.

Because science is at a primitive level.

The field of consciousness as an evolving system that survives the body is only the result of the evolution of the massive human cerebral cortex.  If you have no memories of past incarnations, you would naturally doubt this possibility.

Yet, human egos are conditioned, defensive software systems that keep the mind/body alive.  Learning to fear death - and becoming attached to beliefs of a soul receiving afterdeath punishment or reward is comforting for many people.

"You don't have a soul - you are a soul.  You have a body"



I really have no idea why the souls immortality is hard to understand.

Looking at the world around us, everything seems to go in cycles, round and round.  There is nothing that is not part of a cycle - and a cycle has no beginning or end.  Energy does not seem to arise out of nowhere, nor disappear either, it merely converts.  Why should the soul be any different?  If energy is unending, and everything is made up of some form of energy constantly converting, why do people think the soul 'arrives' out of nowhere and then 'disappears'?  If anything else was described in this way (just appearing out of nowhere and then disappearing again) nobody would believe it!

I think you ask questions to provoke a thirst you are a very cunning person indeed. Since your question cannot be answered i will choke down your biscuit myself and try it out.

The immortality of the soul as i understand truth to be exactly that and not otherwise, is beyond the defilement of understanding, it doesn't need to be understood it will be the same with or without that. You cannot know it the instant you know it, it is untrue. That is why they say the Tao that can be said is not the True Tao. Once it is said it is not as you say it to be because it is the experience which is and not the definition or the explanation of the experience. A better answer to your question would be I don't know.  But it is not a difficult thing just stop thinking and you will understand it completely it is only the ego (thinking mind) which finds it difficult. Stop stop the truth is not even to think!!

Where have all the barroom philosophers gone?



In former days a trip to the local invariably entailed deeply philosophical concepts and ideas. All we get today is football. Yet football is a prime example of an activity that was once, happy and healthy, but has now become big business. Surely when a player becomes professional he loses the right to be called a sportsman?

I think the two are unrelated. Football is big business now because it's popular.  A large part of that popularity is due to its own popularity; in other words, that's what the other guys talk about, so I'll get in on it to be part of the crowd and belong.



As far as why the intelligent discourse left the barrooms, it's pretty simple.  The more intelligent people who wish to drink realized that it isn't safe to do so in bars, since the threshold BAC for DUI is fairly low, coupled with the potential for violence in a bar that provides violent sports on wide-screen TV's.



Add to that the fact that you can buy a six-pack at a package store for the cost of two beers in a bar, and it isn't hard to figure out where all the barroom philosophers went.



They are at home.  Probably they still drink and philosophize, but not with anyone foolish enough to be in a bar.

Wow!  I've been saying that for years.  Perhaps we should create a new kind of pub, a pub where people can go and talk to each other.  We're having sport forced down our throats because it helps prevent people from realizing that the world is going insane.  Have you ever given a second thought to the fact that the US is currently inflicting two genocides upon innocent populations.  When they make up a reason for attacking Iran, there will be three.  It really doesn't take much research to wake up to the very strong possibility that 9/11 was a false flag operation.

The additional dimension from looking at the matter from a different angle is quite helpful in understanding the knowledge behind difficult subjects.

It is similar to having two eyes to see the slightly off pictures so the brain could rationalize more of the actual condition of reality.

I do it only if I have to protect my friends from making mistakes.
I try to show them (by playing devil's advocate") the opposite view so that they get prepared to face the controversy.  I am just trying to balance their point of view.

Most of the time no, I despise it, I wish it didn't seemingly need such. However too many people feel safe in the cocoon of safety they have sought solace in and this ultimately will be taken from them, only so they may know themselves on a deeper level, and so with that, all karma accumulated, never was. So to prepare the way best I can for that scenario, sometimes devil's advocate is needed.

Unfortunately not - I am not clever enough.



I put all of  my attention into trying to understand my own point of view and others - People being unreal even for a good cause sends me in a spin of confusion and I feel enormously betrayed.

I can see that being congruent in these ironic times is childlike but its the only way that I can cope psychologically.



I can 'get' the humour and good intention in it but like 'teasing ' in the same vein, I  hate having it done to me and feel disrespected - I cant take people playing with my head and would hate to do it to others - so I stay safe.

A dry forest is extremely flamable. It's dry nature has no moisture and no way of combatting a fire. It burns in the same way in which wood would.  With the none existance of moisture it will catch fire in no time.

A normal forest with regular rain fall can protect its self much better with the presence of moisture in the earch and undergrowth.

The highlight here is 'careless'.  It means anything done without awareness can result in unintended catastrophe.  Any match struck in a forest may not cause a forest fire, because the one who has lighted the match is aware of its need and its consequences if left unattended.

It can start very small. Somebody drops a match on the grass and the grass burns. soon, the flames reach a tree, The tree ignites, and eventually it reaches another tree. If nobody is around, a major fire is in progress before long.

Any careless spark can ignite dry brush or chapparal.  The fires that roared through San Diego county were caused by a variety of different kinds of sparks:  electric wires whipping in high winds creating a spark that ignited dry brush, a hunter setting off a flare when he was lost, a migrant worker lighting a fire in a canyon to keep warm, and the most recent was a homeowner using a gas powered trimmer to clear for fire that sparked and ignited dry grass into a brush fire.  Where I live in CA, we have a lot of dry brush, grass and chapparal that has accumulated over many decades and all it takes is a spark to create a firestorm.

Was this immoral of me?



an ex girlfriend of mine has lied to me a lot of times about various things. recently i bought some plane tickets to visit her in norway (as shes working there) but she said she has to work during the 2 weeks that im there, and i cant stay with her. i wasnt sure if she was saying this just cos shed changed her mind about seeing me or something, so i told her i didnt trust her. then she got kind of annoyed and told me i shouldnt be friends with some one i didnt trust etc. (she has a point there.) but i dont know if i should be feeling guilty? cos i actually broke up with her because she used to lie to me, and she just made me lose £55 or so on tickets, and she didnt bother calling me about it to tell me if she could change when she was working. (her excuse for not calling me is that she couldnt afford it, which is stupidly ridiculous.) she also didnt call on my 20th birthday on friday.
so should i feel bad? or is she just being selfish/ manipulative in trying to make me feel bad and telling me im upsetting her and she doesnt want me as a friend?
thank you

It doesn't sound like you should be feeling too bad. Of course, I've only heard your side of the story, but the fact that you seem willing to reflect on the possibility that you may have acted immorally is a good sign. You're displaying a concern for her feelings as well as yours.

If she has definitely lied to you, and has done so on many occasions, then you were not being showed the amount of respect that each individual should treat another with. You cannot be expected to trust somebody who has lied to you on several occasions. It's a big demand. On the other hand, people do reform their ways, and she may have given up the lying habit.

You also need to be clear with yourself about whether you want her in your life as just a friend, or something more.

At any rate, if she still values you, perhaps she should have called on your birthday, and made more of an effort to see you in Norway. Talk it over with her. Be patient, honest and reasonable. Voice all your concerns. If it doesn't work out well, then maybe you should spend your time and effort on a more reciprocating friend.

Hope it all works out ok.

NO, NO, NO, NO! It is not your fault and you should not feel guilty about anything.



First of all, if the two of you are having this long distance relationship thing going here, and you tell her you are coming to see her.... and her excuse is she has to work? Well, I bet she doesn't work 24 - 7, so you can be on your own while she is working, then the two of you can hang out and do anything you want.  Plus, she tells you you cannot stay with her? WTF? That is ridiculous.  In my own honest opinion, it sounds like she has another boyfriend, and doesn't want to get caught.



I am sorry people feel like they have to treat people like this.  You need to let this girl go.  It sounds like you are a nice guy, and she will come to realize this, when it is too late. But you don't deserve to have a cheating GF around the world, who does not want you to come see her.



Oh and she missed your birthday? How selfish of her.  She did not have to buy you big expensive gifts.  I am sure all you wanted was to hear her voice, and have her say it to you.  And if she claims she cannot afford long distance calls, come on, that is a low blow.  A few minute phone conversation on your birthday would have cost her a few bucks. That is it!



I am sorry. I am sure you are hurting in this situation, but you need to walk away and find a woman that is crazy about you.

Thanks for reading!

You do say EX girlfriend. By the way you explain things , I think she is trying to give you a kind sort of elbow.

Sex for love, it has more meaning really, you shouldn't really just have sex for the love, if you love someone it should be expressed by making love among other things.

Not sure I understand the question! Do you mean having sex to gain love vs loving someone for the sexual aspect?



Actually I am not sure I would even say that sex and love are linked. When you think about sexual deviations like rape, there is no love involved, that's about power and domination. I don't think that you need to have sex with someone to "prove" you love them. You can love without sex.



For me love is more to do with respect, care, consideration, compassion, deep friendship, support and a "connection". You can have sex without there being any love and you can love without there being sex.



Without making globalised sweeping statements and stereotypes; a lot of the male species have sex as often as possible, and its nothing to do with love. Men in particular view sex as an "act" and are disconnection from the emotional side women "need" to feel in order for sex to be meaningful. Men don't have the same emotional attachment. (Hence men happily sleep with any old slapper willing!)

I see it like this :  If we use sex for love, it means that our need to be loved is such a thirst, that we "use" lust to get it.  This, I can understand.  Needing to be loved is a strong excuse.
What I do not think is right, is when we claim we are in love just to get sex.  Using the precious loving feeling just to have sex, devalues the meaning of Love.  And it is a lie.  I know, the majority of people, especially men, use this ...how to say... trick, when they desire another person. They pretend they love , or maybe they do feel something like love but it is only their desire to get that other person.  So , for me, love for sex is unethical .

Love is a subjective development.  Sex is the icing on the cake.  Sex without love is no comparison to Love and Sex.

There are a few more fundamental important ingredients to Love for Sex.  The concern and consideration of growing a partnership is the contemplation of Lover for Sex.  Lover for sex is preparation for the integrity of complex relationship.

Sex for love ignores growth opportunities for immediate gratification.  this a simple level of concern.

Thinking that sex for love is better than love for sex.
Love encompasses expressions in all aspects whether mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically. We are all bound to love by expressing it through any of these entire aspects. As human beings sometimes love can come so earthly. As physisical love or sex is only a part of a common expression in a romantic love.
Where as love for sex is stating such condition wherein merely lust is contained. That the presence of the spirit of real love doesn't truly seem to exist.

What do you mean 'better'? More enjoyable? More moral? More pleasurable? More constructive? More acceptable?
Better not to care, but to experiment and find out what is most appropriate for you at this time (hopefully without upsetting other people in the process).

Global warming? a simple mistake, or a reality?



so ive been believing for a while now that co2 (produced by humans) will cause global warming, but ive just watched a documentry on youtube that contradicts that using scientific methods.

it sounds right and it makes sense to me.

argument is that weve been going through lots of ice ages, and rising and lowering of climates, and humans arent playing much of a role in encreasing temperature.

one guy was saying that some places were just too cold to be affected by only co2, and that in fact co2 would increase the ice in east antarctica because it would create more humidity and make it snow more.

have these new theories been refuted by more respectable scientists?
because it seems the conclusion these people are coming to arent the same as... everyone elses conclusion

"Global warming" is a figment of Al Gore feeble imagination. Actually, it's a pretty clever scam. Governments use it as an excuse to squeeze more money out of sheeple in the form of "carbon taxes", "congestion fees", and other absudities like that. It also gave Gore the fame he lost when he got "cheated" out of the Presidency. I mean, look...he got the Nobel Peace Prize (you'd think they'd take it back after it was disclosed his "green" mods on his house uses 10% MORE energy than before).

Global warming is a half baked idea based on theory with no absolute proof of its existence.  It is full of anomalies and contradictions, and fails to take into account too many variables that are crucial to the calculation of the effects of human activity.

There are also too many unknowns, and as yet no-one has ever dared to say " with absolute certainty " in any documents.  They all say " probably " or "possibly ".  Surely, if they were so certain, they'd stand four-square behind their theories, wouldn't they?

You would struggle to find ANY respectable scientist, i.e one who is not funded by a major oil company or a subscriber of the kind of right-wing paranoia mainly found in the US, who imagines that global warming is not a fact or at least the most plausible theory based on the evidence.  That is not to say it is DEFINITELY caused by CO2, just that the facts fit.  Thus, carbon dioxide IS a greenhouse gas (without any, the earth would probably be too cold for life); it has increased enormously since the industrial revolution and that increase correlates exactly with the increase in temperatures that have been experienced.  Of course, the earth has fluctuated in temperature over eons, but the predictions were that we should be experiencing cooling now, not warming.  The way things are happening do match the predictions made if man-made global warming is a fact and there's not much point in arguing about it.  It is happening and we'd better do something about it.  In fact, if the hugely elevated CO2 levels are causing global warming, things will get worse even if we do change our habits to produce less emissions so the best thing for scientists to do is to find ways of dealing with it - we won't "combat" it in our lifetimes.  The documentary you describe sounds very like the one Channel 4 showed last year and for which they have just been censured by the broadcasting regulators for misquoting scientists featured on it.  Scientists are not making a scam out of this - they have nothing to gain and it is not what science does.  The only scam is coming from big oil companies and their cheerleaders.  If the scientists are wrong, then they're wrong, but they believe they're right and I'd rather believe them than a bunch of dodgy politicos and their usual paranoid nutjobs of followers.

Fact : Are things changing yes. Why not many people know why, but all the oil wont be here for ever so why not go green? Also another thing I know is Temp. is at its all time highs now. I live in the south so we usually get more light anyways and its getting to be really high.

So many times has mankind been told one thing in order to get another thing done.  This too seems to have befallen this.  There is no shortage on either side of the argument of disbelief for the concepts that are constructs developed from logical understanding that sooner or later mankind with his ability to subject reality to his objective will must take responsibility for his actions in nature.  We know that we can do certain things and obtain certain results.  We are evolving at such a fast rate that it is too complex for any one individual to understand each and all of reality as it is today.  What is the truth and what isnt the truth?

Unfortunately, recent human activities are enhancing the natural greenhouse effect. The concentrations of certain greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing, therefore more of the infra-red radiation emitted by the Earth's surface is being trapped. The planet is losing less heat and as a result we are beginning to experience 'Global Warming'. Going back to the greenhouse analogy, it is as if the panes of glass are gradually becoming thicker.



The major greenhouse gases are: water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFCs (and their replacements), and ozone. Some of these occur naturally, some result only from human activity, while others occur both naturally and as a result of human activity.

You know, I'm not even sure anymore.
While I think we should invest and newer "green" technologies/societies, I can't even say how much it'll help anything. No one seems to be telling the truth. It's like a strange place where there is no middle ground. People in favor of global warming will probably want to punch you in the face for this and people that don't believe in it call it nonsense.

It's not that I don't believe that humans are shifting/shaping the world. Just that I'm unsure of truly how much. I mean, most of the people ADVOCATING global warming produce a LOT more co2 than we even do.

I mean, does that mean that they truly aren't all that concerned about it afterall?

As both your question and some of the answers show, this is an unending debate, which (by the way) is making some people very rich and/or famous (Environmentalists, NGOs, politicians, failed Presidents, Oil companies).



But use your own good sense. Take a long hard look at the globe of the world. Nearly a half of it is blue (it's the Pacific) then the rest has the other Oceans. So can one small species, living in a cluster of cities, on a minuscule proportion of the Earth's surface REALLY change its climate? I think not. If there is global warming, it's mother Nature at work, with poor Mankind basically an onlooker - as it has been in all the past cyclical changes.

People are so big-headed they actually think they can change the Earth's climate!

Get real. The planet has existed for billions of years and can get on quite well with or without humans.

The climate has always changed. In my childhood we were warned of the coming ice age, because global temperatures were falling. So now they're rising? Goody! No ice age to worry about!

The main problem we humans have to contend with is our own global over-population, but of course no one wants to talk about that. That's the really inconvenient truth.

Let's say God descends and although He knows infinite Truth, He can only translate it as far as human understanding is at the time. He can't invent words, so He's stuck with the social knowledge and words of the society He is residing. He can use the words available and know what people know thus far, but He can only go so far in advancing their knowledge, which is what He does.

Well, there's the concept of tabula rasa, particularly in relation to the nature vs. nurture debate:

Tabula rasa (Latin: blank slate) refers to the epistemological thesis that individual human beings are born with no innate or built-in mental content, in a word, "blank", and that their entire resource of knowledge is built up gradually from their experiences and sensory perceptions of the outside world.

Materialism, in general, is the belief that nothing beyond matter - the material world - exists; it says little about the nature of the truths it uncovers other than that they will not involve minds, spirits, deities, etc.

I would suggest that the term 'constructivism' comes close to the idea that ideas and beliefs are the product of social conditions, rather than things 'discovered'.

This is called 'Cultural Relativity'.  It is the philosophical basis of the science, sociology.

The roots of it extend back to Machiavelli, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche and existentialism.

Nietzsche is the most difficult to place, because his philosophy has elements of all other moderns.

I don't believe God exists, and as the previous response says, the body of evidence for evolution is so strong as to be as incontrovertible as anything can be.

In terms of whether it matters: I think your own personal belief system is your own personal business until you make it someone else's.  By this I'm referring to things like: criticising others beliefs, teaching your beliefs as fact, acting in a way that affects the wider population according to your beliefs.  Healthy questioning and understanding of all possibilities makes life more harmonious and interesting, as well as bringing us closer to the truth.

By rationalizing, yes. And Creation or Evolution: it's Creation. Nothing could evolve without being created first. And, yes, it does really matter what you believe. For belief -- you may call it "outlook" -- is the foundation of all your action. And the result of your action is cause of all your satisfaction -- which is happiness. Belief in the existence of the Creator is, therefore, important to the attainment of happiness.

I think the only person it matters to is the person who believes or doesn't.  I think people who believe in god and the creation find it to be a very important part of their lives whereas people who don't believe in god and believe in evolution don't really think of it as a biggy.  I certainly don't find myself dwelling on the fact that I'm descended from a monkey.  Actually, I do occasionally bring it up when I'm teaching people about diets, I say "Now come on, how many fat monkey's do you see and they certainly don't eat loads of carbs." hehehehe

Hello,

(ANS) I'm an Atheist and I don't believe in God or in Religions of any kind at all.



No.1 God & religion only exist in the mind of man (no! where else)

No.2 God & religion is a human construct, an abstract idea, a human created concept.

No.3 God & religion invented by humans for humans.

No.4 God & religion remains the "single greatest cause" of human misery, suffering & pain than it ever heals or solves. Look at the crusades of the middle ages or the events of 9/11 for example.

No.5 God & religion has been responsible for more wars, & deaths in the last 5,000 years than anything else.

**I firmly believe in Darwinian Evolution through the process of natural selection. This is firmly proved as factually accurate by the evidence in the fossil record.

**I firmly believe in the idea that the earth & entire universe was created 37.5 Billion years ago from a single event called the Big Bang.

**That life & the Universe is FAR far more mysterious than we humans will ever know. That at the core of our existence is a mystery but of course humans hate not knowing, and hate mysteries, we cannot seem to bear that.

I think the proof of the existence of God comes to me from my realisation of my own existence. Since I know that I am not alone, I therefore, realise that I exist - as if I was all alone in the world, I would not have realised that I exist at all, I would have taken all the world to be myself. Then if I can exist, and others like me exist, the there is possibility in my mind the God can exist too.



I really do not appreciate thinking on this matter any further this casually, as this is important not to talk about God without due care and reverence of an enlightened self. The matters of faithful beliefs are not same as the matters for common philosophical discussions. It would do no good if the concept of God were brought to common discussions merely as a fodder for the mind without having a solid and properly conceived purpose in view.



Then the question of evolution of creation is the matter of the nature of human mind, and not merely that of physicality of our existence. I realise that human mind extends far beyond the fulfilment of physical needs. Where evolution is as the process of natural evolution is the way of all things in the physical to be in time, creation is the concept conceived purely in the mind.



Creation is not a scientifically valid concept, it us purely spiritual that is best defined religiously. It is not possible to see any proof of anything being created if not the entirety of all that exists. In a natural world all things have their causes and every cause its effect. It is things alone that change into other things. But the question remains as where has all the things, in their entirety come for, the life, the universe, thoughts, ideas, absolute concepts, where do they have their origins. Then all the answers to such question necessitate for us to contemplate upon some act of creation as a reality above and beyond the physical nature of the world.

Then the third part of your compound question is about all that I have already said. There are things that we do not understand but there are things in the mind that we never understand unless we develop a sense in the mind by which we are able to retain knowledge. Without beliefs our mind would be like a run away train, unable to stop and form beliefs, it would then go on an on purposelessly. This is all too natural in the mind to form beliefs and thereby get to know things, especially things that are beyond the grasp of our physically sensitive mind.

People want to know why we are here...so they search for answers...God and Evolution are both answers to this question...there are others as well you know???
What you believe isn't important what is important is that you always question why you believe it?  If you only believe in God because you were constantly dragged to church and told that it was the answer without ever questioning it and looking outside of that mentality I'd say you aren't a true believer...and the opposite is true as well.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter. To those who believe, may their faith be unshakable. To those who speak, may they have mercy. To those who are ignorant of one way or another, may their God be with them, for in the end whether we suffer the Laws of this land or the next, it is their choice whether to come and go. I agree with Simply Respect, casually talking about this subject is disrespectful, but I do pray that at least someone may get what they need out of this conversation and then my job (and perhaps yours, if you want it) will be done. Thank you for being patient with me and to those who don't understand what I say please do not slander me, I speak with respect and do not incite any type of negativity.

You might be stretching the remit of Y!A here in asking that! I've tried to restrict myself to asking for unknowable answers to questions like: "How do you drive a Triumph Herald quickly around corners?" and "How do you solve the credit crunch?" and they weren't that successful.
That said, to try to answer your unanswerable questions on the meaning of life:
Does God exist? It's currently impossible to prove otherwise however no empirical evidence has been suggested for his existence. It's therefore unlikely.
Creation or evolution? Whilst there are huge arguments about this, my personal feelings are that relatively rapid historic evolution is possible and the simplest explanation for complex life. More complicated options involving previously developed life and subsequent creationism is possible. I suggest Occam's razor as something to cling to.
Does my belief matter? To me it does. To my family, less so. To you? insignificantly. In the grand scheme of things? Either in a universe that expands into dark black nothingness or contracts back into a tiny spot of huge mass, I doubt it. Apparently it doesn't stop me trying.....

The problem here for me is defining God. If God is everything [some kind of binding force of nature] then clearly God must exist. If God is what ever [force] created the Universe then assuming that time and space began at a point then God must exist. If God is an intelligent being who created the Universe I would say that its likely he does not exist. If God does exist there is to my mind no reason why God needs to be all loving, all judging or even all knowing.. in the sense that we may think. There is no particular reason why God should be easy to imagine or be accessable to us or even to organised religion. No two religions have independently painted the same picture of God which suggests that logically we cannot know a whole lot about him/it. The suggestion that God may appear in different guises seems to me a way around the problem and not a satisfactory solution. For example if God and the devil could appear in different guises how could you tell which it was?

Evolution on the other hand is not so problematic. Evolution is inherently logical and only potentially difficult to imagine over the extremely long time periods which really showcase its limitless potential. Evolution is the unifying theory of biology and the first unifying theory of the sciences. There are details that still may be argued over regarding gene selection and cooperation [and so on..] on a mechanical level but this type of stuff is trivial to the main idea. The only problem with evolution is that it appears sterile and mechanical.. that emotion is merely a gauged response to a given scenario.. but we dont need to think like that in our daily lives. In fact evolution neednt be so cold as it doesnt conflict with the idea of an initial creator. It may be assumed that the vitalist believes in a creator and the mechanist doesnt but this is not true. I think its important to note that the mechanist can believe in a creator and the vitalist may not. Evolution doesnt explain our origins but goes some way towards explaining everything since our origins [as gene based lifeforms at least].

If thereoretically God is real then does he/it need us to believe in him for our own sake? Is heaven an achievable goal or a self delusion? I sure dont know but remain skeptical.

If evolution is real and God isnt [or doesnt care what we think] then the question is which is of greater evolutionary benefit, belonging to or abandoning an organised religion in favour of scientific belief? The problem there is that question is only answered by one thing: faith or faithlessness. God truly is dead for the faithless and whether that is of evolutionary benefit only time will tell.

First off, I'm an atheist.

Second off, anyone who says God exists is lying to you. The truth is that, while God may exist, there is no empirical reason to believe that he/she/it does exist. The only reason why people do believe in God is because they have faith in his/her/its existence. It's similar to someone believing in aliens without seeing any physical proof that they do exist.

As for whether it matters what you believe...that depends. If you live in America or even certain places in Europe, then no one really cares what you believe, as long as you don't try to seriously impact the political system (or something similar) with unsubstantiated ideas.

On the flip side, however, there is scientific evidence for evolution whereas there isn't for creationism/intelligent design. Given that the only way humans can ever truly discover anything unequivocally is through science, denying evolution makes a person sound about as intelligent as denying the usefulness of science altogether. Put another way, if you're willing to deny evolution, you may as well deny the success of science in developing personal computers, cell phones, cars, etc. because all of them (including evolution) were discovered via the same basic process: the scientific method.

My overall point is that you can believe anything you want; it's certainly your right to. However, if you want to come across as intelligent, then evolution is really the only choice. There isn't a single creationist/intelligent design argument that is scientific (despite what some might say.)



If you're interested in some of the logic behind atheist beliefs, visit youtube.com and type in "Richard Dawkins." He's a very brilliant British biologist/atheist who can explain the details much better than I can here.

To me the existance of life is one of the main proofs.
I can not believe in the theory of evolution. Matter could not simply explode and make life because even then where did that matter come from. Someone had to make it. Nor can I believe that a monkey turned in to a human. Another thing that proves the validity of the scriptures in at least that they are the same scriptures from when Jesus was here on earth are the dead sea scrolls. Read about them online. In 2000 years only 3 words of no importance have changed from the manuscript found. Another major reason that I believe that he exists is bible profecy. Read Mathew 24. It describes how the world would be in the last days, and it is exactly how it is.4Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you. 5For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,[a]' and will deceive many. 6You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8All these are the beginning of birth pains.



9"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.



But you, Daniel, close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge."
Daniel 12:4-I believe that there is definitely more knowledge and we spend our lives running to and fro. 
There are many such profecies that have been fufilled.

It does matter whether you choose to believe in God or not because that will determine your eternal destiny. If you are wrong you will have lost out on eternal life and happiness.

There are 2 things
1. INDEPENDENCE DAY- the aniversary of the day a country achieved/ was granted/ affirmed to the world that they are a republic, not a territory of another country

2. INDEPENDENTS DAY- I have not heard of one yet, but independents are people who do not rely on their parents anymore for food , shelter, clothing allowance and rides to go anywhere. I guess these teenagers celebrate their yoke of having to earn their own living on this day.

Freedom is not free. We got to pay the price= we've got to sacrifice.. for our liberty.

If you mean Independance Day it's two things.

One a crappy film with Will Smith ( hee hee)

Two. America was owned by England. People went to America to check it out. They decided they wanted to stay there and create their own community. England didn't like it. So there was a huge fight. Then America became independant documents were signed to confirm it. All happened on July 4th

I haven't a clue why England celebrates it as well. It makes me sick

This sounds like an extreme kind of deja vu, which is usually caused by being over tired. Basically your what you see around you is being stored in your memory and then recalled as memory before you perceive it happening in real time. This makes it seem like what you are experiencing is already in your memory, and in your case as a dream, but basically it is just your brain perceiving things very slowly.

Are you over worked, over stressed or over tired a lot?

There are tablets that you can take to resolve this problem.  However, they do many other things that cause more problems than they cure.  This is a gift that you have been given, use it as such.

I thought 3D meant (not necessarily in this order) height, width, and length. 3 dimensions required to make a 3D object.

For example, the way I thought of it was that a line is 1 dimension, a square has 2, and a cube has 3. The "4th dimension", even though you didn't ask for it, is sometimes considered to be time.

This may be too pragmatic and over simplified for your question but saying something is 3 dimensional is to say it has length x width x height.

This is a difficult question to answer as it challenges not only all that we see but also all that we have to see with, our way of perceiving things, our sense of physical reality. I think that our three dimensional perception belong only to our perception of a physical world, where our imagination is our faculty that feed on out realistically perceived images that then are molded, metamorphed, and fantastically transformed into our weird and wonderful dream and notions. I do not think that the realities within our mind beyond its realistic sense need any dimensions for them to exist. Things can come to existence out of nowhere, and then disappear into nothing.



I think the physical world appears to us three dimensional only for the purposes of our physical perception. Where the basic fact is that our thinking is linearly sequential, i.e. we think in processions of thoughts and ideas interconnected somewhat logically, and that we cannot have more than on thought in the mind at once. We have our visual sense that we make the best of to perceive the shapes and sizes of objects that when is developed in the mind enables us to imagine and visualize things, but we cannot say our visual ability allows us to visualize things in how many dimensions as they are almost conceptual in their nature.



Now, as we can think about only one thing in any moment, and look at just one object in a glance, we cannot know what is behind us, on the right hand side or us, or on our left hand side. This basic handicap, which is fact is all too natural to us, I think necessitated the mind to perceive things in their multiple dimensions right from the beginning of natural evolution.

The original reality of soul I believe is that of a state of unison. I can feel connected to more than one thing simultaneously, but there would be only one thing that I would be attracted to at one time, there is always that best of everything in my mind as the absolute concept of one kind. I believe in truth but I have faith in absolute truth, fairness, justice and beauty. My personal reality has two dimensions, as me and the world; the physical reality of my world has three dimensions; temporal reality has one more dimension added to it the reality of time; whereas the reality of my mind has countless dimensions of countless dimensions that it wants to explore and tends to seek all the time; however, the spiritual reality of my being, or the ultimate reality, I believe, has just one dimension that my soul wants me to seek.

Dimensions are mathematical spatial concepts, so you have the wrong idea about this. A point has location in space but no dimensions. If you extend a line between 2 points, it has only length, the first dimension. If you have 3 points, you can make a plane with 2 dimensions, i.e. length and width. If you have 4 points, you can make a plane with the 3 dimensions of length, width and height. There is no proof that souls exist, so you are on the wrong track here. The universe has 3 dimensions and maybe more, but they are not mind or fantasy stuff, e.g. souls. String theory says there are 11 dimensions. Please study mathematics and learn what the dimensions really are before you invent fantasies about them. I have a degree in Art and Philosophy, so my mental images are 3-D for certain.

0D Spatial point (No dimensions)
1D Length (Line)
2D Length / Width (Shadow)
3D Length / Width / Height (Box)
4D Length / Width / Height / Motion (Space Time)

Time as in a clock is not 4D but a measurement of 4D.4D is Earth rotating on its axis and orbiting the sun. Earth is 3D and its continuously in morion 4D which we measure in years which at its lowest measurement is seconds.

These are the 4dimensions seen by our eyes
The rest have to be discovered elsewhere
String Theory are other dimensions yet to be questioned I believe there are infinity amount of dimensions we will discover them soon. String theory holds the notion that there are other worlds which we cant see or travel to but are right here.

there is no true answer to this question, and the answer is different among varied philosophies. so i'll answer this question using the existentialist perspective, because it is the philosophy i live by. existentialism is the belief that an individual must create their own meaning in life, and that no higher power or master plan that decides it for them. one can do this either theistically or atheistically. so one should just live life to the fullest, and live it the way they want, free from the influence of others. the second part of your question also has no true answer, and is impossible to answer.  this is due to the uncertainty of every living being's inevitable demise, unless one is committing suicide.

Life is a journey that God is traveling.

The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean of Knowledge, Power and Bliss were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.



Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.



The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in water conversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.



When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.



So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.



But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.



Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms), it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."



Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path, and there are as many ways to God as there are souls.

Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.



The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."



The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite with infinite Knowledge, Power and Bliss. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.

You never realize you are about to be in the death bed.  When I was 13, I thought 21 was old.  Most people today think 50 is the new 30, 60 the new 40, and so on.  People are doing more at older ages and most people only feel as old as they act..  I know elderly people who act like they are much younger and are having more fun than most younger people...  why would anyone dwell on death?  Actually, I think I thought about death more when I was younger..  just around that age when you first begin to realize it is inevitable...  once you get past that, you don't look at it the same way...



get the most out of each day and don't dwell on things you have no control over.

I do think that everyone has a different purpose for their life, we are all different after all, and created to be different, so we can't expect everyone to go after the same goals in their lives. Everyone needs to discover what their purpose for being here is, everyone has an entire life waiting for them.

That being said, I do believe that there is an ultimate MEANING, not purpose, for every humans life. A meaning which ultimately encompasses everything that we should strive for, that will fulfill our lives, and that no matter what the purpose for our lives is, we all need in order to be truly happy.



Of course, there are many different answers to this question, people have been contemplating it for all of recorded history, but here is what I believe is the true meaning of life.

Love.
Love for our selves.
Love for our family.
Love for our friends.
Love for the people we meet.
Love for the people we don't meet, all humans.
Love for our enemies.
Love for our beautiful planet on which we live.
Love for all of the amazing creatures with whom we share this world.
Love for our entire and spectacular universe.
Love for what we do.
Love for our hobbies.
Love for our treasured possessions that carry meaning.
Love for our experiences and memories.
Love for knowledge and wisdom.
Love for beauty, music and art.
Love for all that is around us, all that we do and all that we are.
The love that we recieve back from all of these people.
Love of life.

And most importantly, love for our God, our Creator, our Provider, our Protector, our Father and Friend. To experience that amazing love of God and to enter into a loving and close relationship with Him so that He may lead us to our purpose in life and, in the end, spend all of eternity with Him living and a perfect, harmonious and loving world. Because ultimately, God is love.

This is what I believe the true meaning of life is. You may not agree, but I think we all believe that love is what makes everything better, it is what makes us want to get up in the morning, what makes us want to help and spend time with other people, to sacrifice our time and money to make another persons life better, not out of responsibility but out of love for that person. Love is what keeps us going through the hard times, it is what helps us to come out of those bad experiences stronger and to learn from them, because we want to keep on giving and recieving this love.

I just want to give you this verse that I love from the Bible, I don't believe you need to be Christian to appreciate what it is saying and it always speaks so deeply to me.

1 CORINTHIANS 13:4-7

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

According to The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy:

"Jainism



One of the three heterodox darshanas or branches of Hinduism. Jainism traces its origins to Vardhamana, a successor to twenty-three previous ‘fordmakers’, or teachers who enabled the faithful to cross the stream leading to release from the cycle of existence. Its practice demands a monastic life of extreme austerity; for example, one sect is the Digambara or ‘sky-clad’, perhaps identical with the gymnosophists (Greek, naked + wisdom) reported by the companions of Alexander on his conquest of Northern India, who practise nudism. The Buddha practised Jain asceticism before realizing that it did not in itself contain the key to the radiant release from the cares of the world that he was seeking."

Great question!!

Freedom without discrimination is like power without responsibility...... it can not be sustained...... it would backfire and prove ultimately harmful rather than beneficial even to the person who enjoys it. No wonder then that even God is not supposed to be free to send good souls to the Hell indiscriminately!!

If we are free to choose each - choice is a disrcrimination. "race discrimination" means the word "discrimination" has very negative conotations but it's jsut a word - a discrimination is nothing but a choice.

so no i don't aagree that freedom will be blind with no choices

Freedom will always discriminate - Choice is its power to seek out what is best. .

quite the contrary. Real freedom means fully controlling ones mind and senses. In that state of being the eternal living being within this body and mind takes the reigns of the mind and and controls the senses. The simplest and most practical way to control the mind and sense is to practically engage them in the Loving service of the Lord. IN this way one only eats pure vegetarian food offered to the Lord, one only smells things that have been offered for the pleasure of the Lord, one only dances and sings in Love of the Lord and for the Lord, and one only tries to hear words about the Lord and anything related to Him. This process is called Bhakti Yoga and is the perfect process for engaging the mind and senses in the Loving service of the Supreme Lord, Also known as Krishna, Allah, Jehovah, Vishnu, Rama, etc. In this way one fully controls the mind in pure consciousness and one is fully free form bondage. 
Eternal Peace to you !

No it cannot cure a soul, but it can help sooth it. It can put to sleep a restless spirit and it can wake up tired mind. 
Healing is and has always been a joint effort. Just like all great things music is a team effort. Doing it is not about the musicians it's about who's listening.

I believe that music can help to cure our soul, if indeed our soul needs curing in the first place.



The music that is inside of us has to be (at least in part) the soul and therefore it is our inner state of being in its most enlightened form. A surge of pure altruistic emotion (like joy, happiness, knowing something deep down right) tells us that our inner being accepts and knows things that our conscious minds do not.

I can only describe the experience of this is two ways (needless to say our reaction to it no doubt is very unique and personal)..



1. is pure untainted blinding great light accompanied with a bubble burst of complete utter happiness

2. Is a grey hill where no one else exists but we all are there, waiting to be reborn (i think) communicating effectively together without saying a word and then just all disappearing into dust.

The music inside us in other words is ourselves at the closest possible point of interacting with our creator.

Hope this helps.

Music is a universal source of pleasure, even joy. I do not think it can save a soul, but it can certainly cross all barriers- languages, politics, sexual orientation, race, creed, religion.



As to what is the music within us is- it is whatever yo wish to make it. We each have fabulous possibilities as new babies, and with the right guidance and encouragement, nearly everyone can uncover a hidden talent in some area of music. It is simply unfortunate that many do not have their potential developed, either due to socio-political contraints- such as no access to instruments or money for lessons, or due to parents forcing them into other activities such as sports.

There are children in various elitist academies around the world today who clearly display this potential, by playing to a high standard, and even composing at very young ages- three or four years.

The music inside you is whatever you wish it to be, but you need to find the way to express it. This will become easier as various music software becomes more user friendly, but again, this will depend on access to equipment.

I personally find that even my bad strumming on my guitar, and singing some of my favourite songs is a very cathartic and relaxing experience. I would recommend the pursuit of musical skills to all, and the earlier in life the better.



All the best.

<answer>



In my humble understanding, music opens the doors of ordinary human perception like nothing else; music impersonates the rhythmic beat heart and takes it further along some desired moods of a feeling, or a thought. This is true that music reminds me of good old times, and of times to come, of longings lost, and of promises to keep, of my deep emotional familiarities, and also of my sense of being alone, much lacking in love, lacking in life. The promise of the music is such that it fulfils both, human heart and mind together, all at once.



Music can spark the fames of passion, nurture our sense of belonging, and kindle our hopes for yet another love. It fulfils life and with life a world around us. The highly evocative nature of music becomes highly effective in inspiring the mind, in galvanising human spirit into action, and in instilling sobriety in our sometimes-chaotic feelings. This is why we feel so occupied with the songs of our delight, with the anthems of our choice, they take us all in, lure us into their world of soothing assurances and promises, that all will be right this way.

Then I must also remind myself here that music is nothing more than masterful artistry of sound purposed to play upon our emotional thoughts, to inspiring us, yes, but music can take us just so far, however lot farther than our words, sights and thoughts, but never all the way to spiritual fulfilment, as you have wondered.



This might be true that music is fantastically made up of sound for it magical and enchanting affects, but the cure for spiritual turmoil is not be found in music alone; music can make it easy for someone who has some spiritual objectives of soul enshrined in the purpose of making music, as devotional music in many of the religious traditions of the world, but own its own music can also be deadly, it can misguide and create emotionally memorable hooks for the mind so that it may stay lodged somewhere, whatever that might be.



The mental faculties music play upon, our thoughts and emotional, are by no means of consistent nature, whereas soul seeks permanence of ultimate in faith, soul, if you do not use the word leisurely meaning in fact meaning heart, is the ‘divine spark’ or the essence of God in man that seeks to resort to its origin in the world hereafter, and also in this world with utmost devotion and longing. Where beats, may that be of our heart or of musical rhythm, signify harmony, as constant state of yes and no, of doubt, as the requites for matter to exist – there is nothing permanent in the world all things changes and they change within the instances of two consecutive beats, when all things, including human heart, rest for insignificant length of a while.

In a thoughtless and quite world of unchanging sense of belonging, devotion and unison where soul finds its peace and its divine pleasure of being there cannot be any music but the music of soul, of its being, and of the being divine.

Certainly God - or any other deity, come to that - seems to be a necessity for some people. They seem to need the sense of security that imagining some benign being watching over them brings.



God is not "necessary" in my life. I can cope with the knowledge that I'm alone, have no particular significance in the scheme of things and that when I die I will cease to exist.

So, I think God is necessary for some, and not for others.

Oh man i love this question. Heres my view. Atheism is just as bad as religion. Religion separates people, and atheism is just another religion. My definition of religion is the absolute belief (faith) in something. If you are an athiest, you are absolutely sure that there is no god. And you consider anyone who tells you otherwise to be wrong. Therefore, atheism is just another religion.

Religion is both beneficial and harmful for obvious reasons. My preferred "religion" is spirituality. That is where i believe (have faith) in not having faith. I know i am wrong. And i like it. I do not want to be right. I think there might be a higher power, there might not. I don't care what it has to do with us. I dont need to know that "Jesus loves me", if he does, great. If he doesn't, i haven't missed much. If i'm going to hell for saying so, i would rather say so then go to heaven.

Perhaps, but atheism can be just as dangerous as belief in God.

Often the major problem with a belief in God is that we all believe He is on our side when we do things; so it doesn't matter how evil we go because since its God "telling" us to do these things, its not evil.  God gave us the right; or so the reasoning goes.

But it does also provide a "watchdog" of sorts; in hopes that even when we are about to fail morally because the benefits for us outweigh the moral complications in our mind, the thought that God remembers and will "remind" us in not so pleasant ways can also be beneficial to the species overall.  In addition to fear of reprisal, there is also someone to continue doing right for even when we don't want to do it ourselves.

God is both a agent of fear and an agent of love, depending on how you look at Him (whether real or not).



With atheism, there is no one else.  If no one is there but the one person having to make the decision, they may fail since they are the only ones there to care.  They may go ahead and do wrong, since they don't expect consequences.  Of course, it does also mean they don't have that pesky belief that no matter what wrong they do God is backing them up (this shows up most often in war and in genocide); so fear the other side is strong enough just on a man-on-man basis may be enough to stop war.

Both have benefits, both have detriments.  Overall, if people actually followed God's commandments (regardless of religion, they all preach peace but almost none follow it to a T), belief in God would be better.  But since they don't, either one has its good points and its bad points.



Of course, there is always the possibility that our belief is wrong; God's existence will continue if He does exist, whether we believe in Him or not.  His absence will continue whether we believe in Him or not.  Our belief is technically irrelevant to anyone but us.

i love nietzshe, and i have every book he ever wrote, but bear in mind he died in a mental institution lol, i dont think god is a necessity for everybody, as god is something weve created, its a concept tht allows us to defer blame and gives us something to believe in.if we are above this need to believe in something other thn our selves thn god is insignificant. atheism allows us to become more, to be ourselves rather thn a slave to society. we are effectivly above any social constaints, just like Nietzsches superman concept. but, god is necessary for the "herd" as he liked to call thm, if not god, thn somthing similar...hence the idol worship of hitler and stalin, both of whom had greatly restrained religious worship. some ppl have the need to follow something, to have rules placed on thm by another, that way, nothing is ever really thre fault, life is easy tht way, kinda like orwells 1984. everything is controlled by a higher power....

God is a necessity to people who need the 'security blanket' of an easy unquestionable answer. It is also of benefit to comfort our egos to suggest that when we die we go to a heaven, rather than just disappear from existence as if we never existed.



Atheism is beneficial in terms of meaning there is no easy unscientific answer blocking scientific discovery and progression. We are free to think, develop, and create and debate over new theories.

However, atheism and science are to some extremists what God is to Christians-followed religiously, they do not account all to often for presence of anything other than matter, and so the world becomes very materialistic, and spirituality and philosophical answers remain unanswered or unquestioned properly as we always ask it from the science point of view.

You need a balance between atheism and being open to new ideas.

NO it is not beneficial, although every person must be able to judge freely for themselves, religion is a very personal belief.

God is a necessity, i used to go to church every day until i was about 20 and for whatever reason i stopped, i still made a sunday service but i was drawn towards another non-christian religion but i have always prayed to God, sometimes openly and others silently.

I no longer remain attached to the alternative religion and have been  seriously considering joining the 'mormons.org' church as i can relate to their teachings and simple way of life, however i still have reservations about joining because my family say they are eveil and i have been gay for many years, also i dread having to give up 2 cups of coffee a day but meanwhile i have my beliefs, God truly means a great deal to me.

I don't think that atheism is innately harmful, although I do find that most atheists have anger issues, and it seems to me that being enraged at the tooth fairy or her apprentices seems monumentally silly.

Science has found that we have sections of the brain specially set aside for faith and for god as experiences, similar to the way we have a section of the brain designed for face recognition. This suggests that there was at some point an evolutionary advantage to being a believer.

If believers do so because they have a biological imperative, why do so many atheists act as if believing is stupid or dangerous. Some things we are hardwired for have become obsolete, like eating bone marrow, a remnant from our scavenger-hominid days; who can say that eating the marrow out of your chicken is now inappropriate? Same for belief.

By the way Nietzsche was an idiot and a lunatic and his writings were hopelessly mangled by his sister after his death to exaagerate their appeal to angst ridden teenagers and sell more books. So you would do better to base your ideas on Holden Caufield or 90210.

Atheism benefits none. The Almighty Father, Supreme Universal Spirit, he who is known as is attained by diligent endeavor, stealth and a lifelong quest. The receiving of Gods Spirit, and the incumbent faith and wisdom are the greatest gifts accorded to man, the highest goal of accomplishment.



Atheism is a modern day subversive anarchy.  Atheists having observe the receipt of God’s grace by ordinate souls, feel they have a right to *demand* evidence of Gods existence. ‘Evidence’ is actually the spiritual awakening and self realization of the world and its creator and is gained by arduous striving than demanded.

God is not a necessity to live life well. Rather love and goodness are essential virtues of living well. God is found where there is love, peace and understanding, therefore he is a necessity. It is the definition of God requiring clarification with precision prior to the declaration of essentialism.



Esoteric belief in man requiring sufficient knowledge to acquire peace of mind and to live harmoniously is fitting.
It is based upon the premise and principle line of thinking that mans need of sciences, religion and philosophy is to gain him the knowledge to facilitate the mastery of his own mind and world about him, towards a control of the same said resulting in liberation from the mercy of worldly elements.

Ultimately man seeks physical comfort, emotional security and to live in loving peace. Thought, thinking, contemplation of the world is the journey towards that still deep universal silence and release.

I am an Atheist and I love Humanity .. I spend some of my time helping others ..  doing voluntary work .. when I can . I care for everyone .. even the ones that committed offenses against their brothers and sisters .
Is Atheism beneficial ? Of course it is .. atheists care about everyone and everything .. although sometimes we are guilty of criticizing Theists .

Religion is for the afraid. Atheism is for the headstrong.

If there's one thing we know in this world, it's that we know nothing. Throughout the times, people have tried to pinpoint where we come from, why we're here, and they've made up fairy tales and called them religions. Think about it. There's hundreds or maybe thousands of religions. They can't all be right, can they?

Atheism is beneficial to those who can live with hierarchy or a "Greater Being." God is needed by those who must co-exist. They need to have a reason for life stuffed in their heads or they will not know what to do with themselves.

Hope that helps.

Please watch this video of a fascinating lecture by Vilayanur Ramachandran who is an eminent Neuroscientist and great speaker.

http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl2LwnaUA-...

This will go a long way to explaining the answer to your question if the answer you want is how the brain works with our imaginations, it is really worth a bit of your time.

having just re-read your question the lecture may be a bit too specific/medical if what you are talking about is visions of society and culture.

So if that's the case I will say that many people have great visions for the future and great ideas that would help society but many things must align for the person to enable the ideas to be transmitted in the right manner to capture the imagination of a receptive audience. Many visionary people are thought odd and even crazy if the social climate is not ready for their radical ideas.

Such dreams and vision are made up of the life that we have capacity for, but that we have not been able to grow up to realise, to live. But if you do not want to see this under the connotations of God then see you must, for then you will be abler to decide if it was really bad.

We through our desires, dreams and ambitions, through our visions of inspiration, guidance and hope, seek to find the self, the purpose of life, we search ourselves in our vision and dreams, but we find ourselves in the reality of our dreams, in the things we achieve along the paths of our visions, in thing we have and in things we actually manage to do.



For some people the search comes to an once a desire or a dream has been fulfilled, but for some others the search goes on, for some people, few fact in truth are not enough, they want to know the truth; people the golden thread of hope lead beyond the reality of their self, to the reality of a supreme existence they come to believe in.

When there are people who capture our imagination with the brilliance of their vision then we know that those are the people who have seen beyond the needs of their physical existence, they have known the self, and through that they have know us, and our world. When we find people who have enabled us to see the visions of the reality of our existence, then those are the people who have seen the reality itself in the communion with the supreme self in existence.



Ordinary minds do not seek beyond the immediacy of their need, where they might find all they want, but not all they need, and if all they need, then not all they could have. This normal for people to develop a common sense of a physical nature, of possessions, of status, of physical power, of resources, and thereupon of lust, greed and avarice, but then such mind stays confined therein, unable to see beyond the wall of their containment, such mind fall victim all the vicissitude of mater, to it natural ebbs and flows of fame and fortune, disease and health.



A mind, that on the other hand, is raised to seek loftiness of its natural capacities, of high dimensions, through its heavenly dreams and divine visions, might live in the same physical world with other people, but will be seen differently.

its close. the love of money is the root of all evil, and the world revolves around money.

look at the crimes and the root of them.
money. and if some say power, isn't money the power in the end.

look at the reality shows where people sign away their life for money and fame.

look at the paparazzi where people will do anything or say anything to anyone to get a story or money.

look at the gambling or lottery system where the biggest contributors to that don't have the money to do this and yet will buy a lottery ticket instead of healthful food for their kids in the hopes of making it big.

if the love of the world the root of all evil, it could be since its not love that makes the world spin anymore but how much money you have, or how you look.

I think you are on the right track.

If that is the extent of the statement then I disagree.  I love the world and I don't feel the least bit evil.  I love it that I can expierence all of the worlds beauty and variety but I also acknowledge that there are dangers in the world as well.  I feel that those who wish to posses the world are evil.  I feel that the world owns me and not the other way around.

Sounds like a neo-christian misstatement. Christ said, "that if you love the world more than me, Meaning the things of the world, money and such, not the planet, there is no place in my kingdom for you."  God or who ever wrote the old testament tells us that we should care for our world and be a good husband to it. In otherwords, when the planet dies you die, and if you believe in all the good book says, then you will do what it says, but you must read and study for yourself not listen to anyone about anything, read it for your self. Spend time reading and less time watching TV, and jerry fartwell, has he went to heaven yet or not?

Inaccurate. Although, not necessarily wrong. In my opinion it is far to vague.



There are two issues I see with this statement.

1 - Evil is subjective. What you call evil others may see as good and vise versa.



2 - What do you mean "Love of the world"? Obviously 'Green peace' may believe that loving the world is a great and good thing. Others will assume that you are referring to materialism, so "Love of the world" means love of material objects and things. Buddhists may take this to mean attachment to anything at all, friends, loved ones, life even death. A Christian, or other theist my take this to refer to mortal life as opposed to spiritual life. A atheist may just think this absurd since what do we have other then this world?



So, it may be better to say, "To longing for materialistic pleasures is the root of all troubles."



After all, in my opinion, indolence, gluttony, bigotry & profligacy are among the leading causes of societies decline and all of these center on 'worldly' pleasures or points of view.

Hope this helps.

Hello,

(ANS) The earth itself has No! emotions and therefore any emotions talked about are distinctly human.



**The love of the world is the root of all evil? No! this is a contraction in terms and makes zero sense.

**Both Love & Evil are human concepts or human constructs they don't exist otherwise.

**Love or Evil denote human behaviors or actions or intentions.

**Human beings are made up & include a rational mind with logical thought processes as well as completely illogical & irrational thought processes, including irrational fears & anxieties.

**The human psyche is "the" single most incredible thing in the entire universe in my opinion. It remains a complete mystery most of the time (thank goodness too in some respects otherwise we would all end up like robots or cloned robots?). The human psyche includes that light & the dark, love and the evil that comes out of the shadow bag.

**We ALL everyone of us has a shadow, please don't say I don't because your kidding yourself. does sunlight cast a shadow? The shadow bag contains ALL the negative emotions & words & ideas we would hold back for fear of hurting others or of remaining half civilized most of the time. The more someone represses their feelings into the unconscious self the bigger the shadow bag we each drag behind us (like a swag bag!). The shadow bag is kept tightly closed most of the time but alcohol loosens the strings that hold the bag closed and so after a few too many drinks the contents of the bag are let out. Hence so much violence after the pubs & clubs close. Think about this I think you will find its true.

**Evil is inside us as humans no where else!! Hitler or Saddam or Stalin were real human beings despite what they did too others. The only difference is their shadow's killed millions of innocent people when let out of the bag.

Ivan.

I believe all who live in this world love, or need to love to live. The world therefore is a place not merely for living, but also for loving. Where else do we go to find love if not in the things chosen from the world we have, in people who we like, and in ideas the tapestry of which is woven, and inter woven, the realities of the world? I therefore would not knock the love of the world as the ‘root of all evils’ I would say instead that when we lack some discipline in loving, we grow futile and vain in our affair with the world.



As a matter of fact I believe that love of the world is the only thing that keeps us sane and happy with our lot, for if we would love nothing of the world we have we would go mad, or simply would die of boredom or with sense of utter alienation. But this is it, as I believe that there in our love of our world are contained possibilities of divine love, the love of God and His entire creation that we are but a part of.



I think it in our capacity to learn to love the world the way it should be loved best, with in view not only what it is for us now, but also what it could lead us to. The physical dimension of the world is what normally remains most obvious to people, and it is most likely for people to indulge into materialistic pursuits of their daily lives, but the salvation comes what we realised spiritual potential of our apparently physical love.

A straw man argument is a weak argument that you project upon your opponent that you can then knock down.  The problem with using this tactic is that it is an argument that your opponent does not actually make.  The tactic is typically viewed as being dishonest.

Staw man argument is a logical fallacy that involves taking another person's words out of context to counter the argument usually an extreme version of somebody's argument

set up example:
Person A takes position P
Person B ignores P and presents Q
Person B attacks position Q
Person B concludes P is wrong

Example:
Person A:
Laws on Marijuana should be more liberalized.

Person B:
No. Work ethic is lost and we would have a more corrupt society when we allow unrestricted access to drugs.



Person A proposed more liberalized marijuana laws, Person B took it to an extreme of 'unrestricted access to drugs' which is outside of the scope of just marijuana and also unrestricted access instead of just more liberalized.

A straw man argument is where you misrepresent your opponent's view to the audience such that it seems obviously false. For example:

bob: We should disassemble our nuclear weapons

alice: NO, OF COURSE NOT! YOU want russia to bomb us to death. You want the world to be ruled by a bunch of reds? What's wrong with you? Does anyone else here want to be bombed and enslaved by another stalin?

Alice just used a strawman. it is a fallacy.

Straw manning someone is a debate "tactic" where someone misrepresents your argument. They'll take your basic argument and exaggerate it so that nobody could possibly agree with it, and then claim that it is your viewpoint and scoff at you for believing something so ridiculous.

Ok lets try this one more time.
Straw man falacy is where you misrepresent your opponants position, or he may do the same to you, thus providing an inargueble possition.
 in discussion of Hillery for president.
A: I dont think Hillery would make a good president
B answers So you dont think  a woman should be president.

Note that B's answer is not only Nonsequiture but it makes A's possition less defenceble and now A has to go back and restate his origional position and deny the Straw man fallacy, before he can even present his agument about  Hillery being president.

A strawman argument is a statement intended to confuse an opponent involved in an argument, where he or she might have to give account for their own point of views. The strawman argument is a dialectical strategy where you take your opponent in his words but just to turn what he says up side down and blow everything out of proportion. The art of demagogy involves the skill of being able to coax your auditorium into believing that to hold some particular point of view always brings on certain consequences. Here is an example:

...At a very well known Swiss resort in the Alps, there is this debate on drugs policies and abuse strategies

A. Doctor Wilbert A. Zimmerman: Let us face it! What is it what we have achieved after decades of fighting against drugs? Is it not about time to address the problem?

B. Spanish politician David Quemacarrada, senior congressman and leader of the league for the protection of the people: You mean we should depenalize, as in making them “drugs” legal? For crying out aloud! With due respect doctor Wilbert, but this is the postulate that will lead us to this free-for-all society you stand for and which you take pleasure in pushing on us? And about the kids, when then shall we start them in it?

A. Zimmerman: As I understand, they are already doing it are they not?

B. Quemarracada: So you want to turn a blind eye on them; are we supposed to let them down so?

A. Zimmerman: It is actually this policy on drugs what is letting our kids down so. Under current legislations it becomes increasingly impossible to work with drug related problems and the so called “substances of abuse”. Men have been using drugs for millennia now and this ban on drugs is not putting any one off doing it.

B. Quemarracada: Prostitution and slavery have also been practised for ages have they not? Shall we then keep a blind eye on them too?

A. Zimmerman: They surely have, but prostitution is consubstantial with human nature as it is whereas slavery is not. What we are saying is “it is possible to free men from these chains”, but that the task cannot be done under current legislation. This society has a problem with drugs, but our proposal is not intended to make up for this situation: it is rather directed to a reduction of gun and knife crime and violence. What we ask for is “regulation”, for we do not like the factual “free-for-all” society this lack of policy is pushing on us. Only if we cut down on violence and crime will be possible to address the problem this society has with drugs, which is rather a medical problem.



B. Quemarracada: So you stand for total anarchy? Shall we then legalize crime as well?

A. Zimmerman: no; it is rather that we want to avoid it, out of fear for our kids. Drugs are at hand, they are everywhere, and it is also under current legislation that is seems to be down to criminal mafias to outline the market or tax the product. It is also under current legislation down to criminals to decide how pure a drug should be, who should be sold to, and what age group. Nowadays it is easier for a kid to buy pot than alcohol, as they usually ask you for ID when you buy it. It is precisely this anarchy for the UK you propose, available at hand as we speak, what we do not like. What do we need all of this blood for?

As you can see, any strawman argument can be turned against your opponent if you know your GCSCs. Please do note senior congressman Quemarracada here represents the political idiot, that is, a person who is well able with words but not with arguments, which usually require a good deal of studying and thinking.

A straw man argument is an informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. To "set up a straw man" or "set up a straw man argument" is to describe a position that superficially resembles an opponent's actual view but is easier to refute, then attribute that position to the opponent (for example, deliberately overstating the opponent's position).  A straw man argument can be a successful rhetorical technique (that is, it may succeed in persuading people) but it carries little or no real evidential weight, because the opponent's actual argument has not been refuted.

Its name is derived from the practice of using straw men in combat training. In such training, a scarecrow is made in the image of the enemy with the single intent of attacking it. Such a target is, naturally, immobile and does not fight back, and is not as realistic to test skill against compared to a live and armed opponent. It is occasionally called a straw person argument, straw dog fallacy, scarecrow argument, or wooden dummy argument.

you supposed to love your god. and your god will provide you with the equal level of your love to him. Life is all about balance

God is our force of energy to stay alive-LIFEFORCE. it is within you.
Protect and understand it and you'll good to go.
Pain and suffering is the result of your sin. Your chosen action didn't match with your subconscious' "set of rules". You fail your God because you lack understanding about it. but God forgives and give you another chance. Seek the truth and it will set you free. you'll no longer identify the feeling as pain or suffering, call it experience of living.

I would like to have a long chat with Jeasus about his "Dad", I reckon he might say &gt; well, sorry about that.
I would reply, you are supposed to be omniprscent.
When a car hit me head on, causing severe leg damage, where was a God ?
Not in Bedfordshire that night for sure.

Would an all-loving God giggle at the dying children in Afican countries ?

Wow, you've just asked one of the most popular question asked by atheist who do not believed that there is a "God". Now here is my answer to you, You either accept God as you're lord and savior and acknowledge that he exists or you spend your whole life coming up with ridiculous theories to deny that he does. The reason there is pain in suffering in this world is the same reason people like you don't believe in God. That reason is free will.

i believe that he cares for you even when it seems the opposite
i mean....God IS love
maybe he allows it to happen because we don't live in a perfect world and ever since the Fall evil and death and hardship entered the world
i mean its like asking God why he "causes" us to die

Why blame God for everything? He didn't tell scientists to let off the Atom bomb or drivers to get behind the wheels of their cars when on drugs or after drinking. He didn't pollute the atmosphere or tell us to go around shooting and knifing each other, and carry out other cruelties. He gave us a brain so we would know right from wrong so it's all down to us I'm afraid, not God.

There are things in this world that can harm us, and that we would consider God's fault. Now I don't believe entirely in a God in the way Christians or Muslims do. Perhaps they are right maybe not, but taking it from their view (and having once thought I was a Christian) I can say that a lot of evil in this world is caused by us alone as human beings. Sometimes us as individuals. Maybe bad weather can kill and animals can slaughter you. But what is good without evil. Were would the sensation of hope be if there was always certainty! We need pain and suffereing to experience joy. It is the sad price we pay to have the good things in life. Life itself wouldn't be special if it were not for death!

God Is Love.  Now that is settled, lets try to answer your question. When God created us out of love He didn't want us to be like robots so he gave us free will. We were little less than the angels of heaven. We were given power over every living thing on earth. Unfortunately we (humans) abused that power. Through greed and lust for power we have caused suffering to our fellow man.  So don't think God is causing pain and suffering to the inhabitants of Mother Earth.  He is not.



It is us.  Yes the likes of you and me.  In fact you may not notice but it is God who brings healing to our broken spirit.  If you don't believe me, ask Him with a sincere heart.
You will be in for a surprise.

Does it bother you that we know so little about life



Think about it...we have no idea about the universe at all, and its mind blowing just to come up with theories 'god created it blah blah' sure that could be the case, but if you truely think about life/after life (if there even IS one) or just how we got here. 
no one truely knows the answer.
doesn't it bother you just a little? don't you just want to know?

It bothers me a little, yes, but I try not to think about.  I focus on what's important now. I also have my own theories that I use for me and only me. I think that's the hard part about being human. We're smart enough to know that there's is somthing around us but not smart enough to figure it out. Perhaps one day we will learn the truth, but probably not in our life time. People us to believe in many gods then one god now people are even questioning that.



And for the afterlife, well again I have my own ideas but just incase there isn't anything after I make the most of what I have becuase this could very well be all we get.

I would want to know but at the same time I enjoy wondering and dreaming because my dreams of the univers and afterlife could be better than the truth.

Nope. We'll never get too much or too little in knowing life or our life. Its all about how u see things in life and how u treat ur life. We'll never know the minimum or the maximum of life, coz we dont have standards about it. So why would u feel bothered? Its all about how u fit in the life given to u, not how they fit in u!

We know lots about the universe. And everyday we're learning more. Scientists are working hard to discover the mysteries of the cosmos and the origin of life, and I have no doubt that we will someday succeed. Saying God created it is to say absolutely nothing. However, scientists are very close to knowing exactly what occurred in the first second of the Big Bang (10 millionth of a second to be exact). There is still a lot we don't know, that is true, but look at how much we've learned in the last two centuries. If you researched any of this you would learn the glorious things science has taught us and where it is headed in the future.



And yes, I just want to know. Thankfully brilliant men and women around the world are trying their hardest to find the answers.

Knowing an answer is not necessarily a good thing. If people knew the answer then there would be no need for Faith. All religions have tried to answer this question, accepting their answers is where Faith is needed. Suppose for instance we could prove God, the afterlife or eternity of spirit, through a mathematical proof. Well then high level math experts would be able to see the truth, but us layman would still have to accept on faith what they deduced. The same is true of  religious people. They must accept on faith what their prophets say. Whether Jesus, Buddha or Mohammed, The masses still have to accept  on faith what these prophets have seen.  About %90 of the world population believes in some sort of afterlife so each man must answer the question for himself. We never truly know anything, we just have a strong probability of truth in all things.

Your assuming know one knows, but there are souls in the world that do know, only they find humanity not to their liking and stay at a distance working on higher planes to help with preserving creation. You can go to India, where they live mostly, and try to find them. They are at different levels of knowing. There are always 5 perfect masters, or God realized beings who are both conscious of God and the illusory world in which we live, but you would have a hard time finding them. It's more that they will find you when you're ready. I knew of THE perfect master, or the Messiah, who had this to say about creation.

This is a synopsis of a book entitled "God Speaks." The book was written in 1955 by Meher Baba and explains the meaning of life.

Life is a journey that God is traveling.

The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean of Knowledge, Power and Bliss were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.



Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.



The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in water conversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.



When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.



So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.



But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.



Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms), it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."



Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path, and there are as many ways to God as there are souls.

Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.



The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."



The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite with infinite Knowledge, Power and Bliss. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.

This is a good example of not knowing what lies ahead it is an example of assuming you cannot know.

I'm here to let you know that all of your questions can be answered by reading THE URANTIA BOOK, on line if you want but if it is to complex for that.

If you wish to buy the book it is about 12 to 15 dollars at Amazon.com

PAPER 92 - THE LATER EVOLUTION OF RELIGION

"Man possessed a religion of natural origin as a part of his evolutionary experience long before any systematic revelations were made on Urantia." Note: Urantia an Ancient name for Earth.

Page 1008 #5  " The Urantia Papers. The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space. While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force and authority of all revelations, the time has arrived on Urantia when it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia."

I believe that God created the heavens and the earth. I believe that if you accept Jesus as your savior and lord, you are going to heaven and if you do not, you are going to hell. But you are right, I could be wrong. Maybe I am brainwashed and live in an un real world, but if I am wrong and when I die I become nothing, then what have I lost? Nothing. If I die and I am Right, I gain the Glory of heaven. Does it bother me that no one knows the answer of life? That no one is sure about how life is really meant to be or what is supposed to happen? No, I am not. It doesn't bother me. I just keep living the way I believe I am supposed to live and when I die, I'll know what the true meaning of life was.

I think its funny how ignorance can cover up such avid truth. You say,"God created..." but instead of giving this credit, you go into biased territory and dismiss it as something that couldn't explain, what it already has.



So I don't think it WOULDN'T be natural to find oneself worried about not knowing the truth, because you have already passed it up. When driving to a friends house out of state(for the first time)I had to follow a map.It led me to an area where it said to turn right at a place 50 miles away from the exit.(it is a very long road) I tried to remember what my friend said it would look like. (it was an unnamed hidden drive) I found it interesting that when I came to about the point he said a road would be I thought,"No, that couldn't be right." (because it isn't at all what I thought it would like) An hour and a half later, I found myself having a sinking feeling in me,"Will I find this, are there any roads not listed in this map?" Only after talking with a local, did I find that I had indeed passed my target many miles back. And all because I dismissed what was in plain sight, only because it didn't fit with what "I" thought it should have been. Never dismiss what is right in front of you, never throw solid instruction aside only because it doesn't "fit" with what you "feel" the truth is, the road I passed, was the correct road, even if it didn't look like it to me.

It's horrible when we dwell too much on the subject. I think the only thing we can do is live life out to our best extent. There will always be questions that cannot be answered. And perhaps these questions are best when remained unanswered. Where will the joy be in life if there was a solution/answer to everything? Sure, you may like it, but in a little while, that type of existence will be a bit boring.

This is something many of us ponder to the extreme.  There is so much literature on that subject.  The psychiatrists are no better than we are.  It's a human condition.  If you're not at least a little insane, you're not paying attention.



View the Barbra Striesand movie "Nuts."  It remains a classic in my mind.  Also, "Girl, Interrupted" by Susanna Kaysen, played by Winona Ryder in the movie, with Angelina Jolie, Whoopi Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, and others.

Sanity and insanity project out of the same origin. Insanity does not come from different origin and also sanity does not come from altogether different origin. It is the way we are able to exhibit, demonstrate or present our mental state.

If you (we) start practicing how to present best part of ourselves in the public eye over a period of time, an image is built in the social circles about us. We become socially appealing. We are able to impress others. We leave a mark of such impressions. I think this is sufficient for your small question but big in its potential meaning.

It is very difficult in a world where insane seems to be the norm. Insane being defined as doing something against your best interests, and most of the time people do not perceive their best interests. So if you can leave every situation you find yourself in and it is always a win win situation, nothing taken, only gained then you are probably sane. In the context you mean though, you are not insane for questioning your sanity, at least you are willing to concede that you are not all there :) Whatever you do though, do not consult a doctor! they are more insane than anybody, they will be convinced otherwise, but a slight discrepency in your 'health' and they will cover their own arses soon as. Hope this helps.

Every one is normal, btu to their own personal degree.  The easiest way to tell is you are insane is if you purposefully keep doing things you don't like for no reason.  If you don't fit in with society then you are socially unacceptable, however if you keep doing the same thing and expect a different result then that is madness.

WHO statistics say that I in 3 of us at any one time has mental health problems that is more normal than blue eyes or red hair.



The bandying around of terms such as the above is a social device to make some people outsiders for their differences. 
It helps the dynamics of  bonding relationships.

I am so puzzled.  Why do some people believe in the existence of heaven and hell?  Why do they suppose that the ancient people who wrote the religious books KNOW these things exist.  Should there actually be an afterlife, which I seriously doubt, I am sure the details of what it is like have never been revealed to any living person.  Perhaps, consideration might be given to the fact that making some-one believe in a hereafter would induce them to obey their lord and masters, and not wish to better their lot in life.

A Question for Atheists, Agnostics and Believers of any religion



Okay combined group, what's your opinion of Pascal's wager? For those who don't know, Pascal theorized that one should believe in God because if God doesn't exist you never know differently and if He/She does it's like an insurance policy, protecting you from punishments given to non-believers.

Would any Atheist readers be willing to compromise their beliefs to follow this? Would any Agnostics make this their great deciding factor? Finally for the religious followers, do you feel many of your beliefs are due to a "fear" of God, specifically in dealing with punishment? Do you fear hell and thus do you believe?

This question has flaws, I know. I just want people to consider the thought. I'm putting it in the philosophy section as I think it'll reach a far wider, more open-minded audience. My owns beliefs in this don't matter, I'm just looking for yours (if you feel like sharing that is).



Thank you!

Good point, I suppose I'll pick whichever God or Gods one chooses. Plus I'm sure there would be no way of lying to God if they really were all-knowing, yet it's a wager, lie or make yourself believe in order to receive potential reward. It's all a bit sticky.



Plus thanks for your answer, I understand it's a silly question, I just thought I'd put the thought out into the world and see what others thought. Thanks!

Which god do you suppose this wager should apply to? All gods or just one? How do you know if you pick the right one?

Assuming god is omniscient, wouldn't he/she/it know you're only "believing" to avoid hell. Can someone truly believe in something solely on the basis of 'just in case'?

Who says god rewards believers with heaven and non-believers with hell anyway?

No I would not be willing to alter my beliefs based on Pascals Wager, and I hope no one else would either. In my opinion, it really is a silly argument.

I will state I am Agnostic and no Pascal's wager is not going to be the deciding factor in my belief. I understand the concept and *some* people do believe in a God because of this reason. Actually, I will tell you I went to church at one time in my life and followed the Christian religion and I will say the pastor sat up on stage and said this exact same scenario. He said and I quote “I am sure going to believe it if gets me to heaven”.  Looking back on it I wonder if his belief was really because he believed in what he preached or if the root of it was fear.



I have a belief that if God existed (and as Agnostic I cannot confirm or deny) and if he created me in his image, then why would I be damned to hell for using my intelligence and reason to pursue truth? I can give an example of this, such as, say with my 10 year old son. Say I tell him a certain *fact* in life and because it came from me he is to believe it without other inquiry and research. I cannot feel any less of him if he decides to use his intelligence and reason and actually look for other substantial probability to support what I told him is fact. Actually, instead I would be proud of him and that is because it would show his independence and the fact that he used intelligence to seek fact and probability to support what I have told him.



In the end if there is a God I just cannot fathom that he would punish me for using my intelligence to inquire and seek truth.

Regarding Pascal's wager, I would put it this way.  Saying you believe, and going through the motions, does not make one believe.  If there really is a God, according to all I've heard they would be all knowing enough to know I didn't truly believe, and therefore I'd be treated no differently than living a life of openly not believing.  I can't lie to my friends, how am I supposed to lie to God?  Basically, you can't hedge your bets when it comes to faith.

Pascal's Wager is a fruitless attempt to convince people to believe in the Judeo-Christian.  The problem is that you insert the name of any deity and make the same argument.

For example:

1.  One does not know whether Krishna exists. 
2.  Not believing in Krishna is bad for one's eternal soul if Krishna does exist. 
3.  Believing in Krishna is of no consequence if Krishna does not exist. 
4.  Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in Krishna.

No.
I don't believe in God's words. I don't believe in his teachings. And if "God" would disown me because I'm trying to live my life in a way I see fit and humble and modest while accepting someone over me that doesn't really believe but is banking on pretending to, I wouldn't want to follow him anyway. Besides, if "God" were all knowing, he would know the person didn't believe in him anyway.

People always ask "is God real" but the real question is if I would want to follow him if he was.
*edit*
and if people truly believed in God, they wouldn't need a present at the end of their lives to convince them to continue believing.

I actually subscribe to a personal variation of Pascal's wager. Where it is reasonable to assume that if god is the creator of the universe and the universe appears to be rational, then it is likely the case that god is a rational agent and in all probability would expect me to utilize my intellect and reasoning abilities to pursue ethical and moral standards, not to irrationally gamble on the odds of a particular religious morality as being the one of which god approves above all others.
Further that as a rational god he would not approve of any religion that does not base itself firmly upon reason and intelligence.
Nor would he expect me to profess his existence where I am unable to reasonably assert that this conclusion is absolutely valid.
Thus to live as though god exists is to rely upon rational thought, intellect and the power of reason.
Pascal had the right idea but he seemed to ignore that if god created the universe then there are some things we can reason about god by extension based upon knowledge of how the universe exists as an example of the works of the infinite agent.

I think you've slightly misunderstood the wager, which doesn't say you have to believe in God, just to ACT as if there were one (any one).  After all, it isn't possible to just believe something merely by thinking it, because you would still know that there is no evidence, let alone proof, and you wouldn't really believe at all.

The question still remains about what acting as if there were a god actually means.  Constant lifelong worshipping and praying or devotion to making the lives of others better?

In the UK satirical/comedy magazine/comic VIZ this month there is a brilliant spoof letter, something along the lines of "'Acts of God' include things like hurricanes and Earthquakes, while 'playing God' usually means doing things like saving people's lives, yet stupid religious people are always trying to stop the latter."  Food for thought.

p.s. I am Dawkinsist when it comes to religion.

Certainty is a difficult issue in philosophy.  Norman Malcolm wrote a book on it looking at certainty from Wittgenstein's point of view.



The object of philosophy is not certainty.  Instead it attempts to eliminate absurdity, nonsense, and silly things that people say and think.  It tries to show the contradictions that some things that people are sure of result in.

People like to be sure of things.  The more ignorant a person is the more they desire certainty.  That sets them up for becoming believers, who think they have absolute certainty and are very sure of their faith.

Yet the closer you are to certainly, the further you are from truth.

Does honesty compel you to turn the one penny or coin too much change that the cashier-clerk has given you, even if doing so means driving back several kilometers or miles to the town where the purchase was made?

Good question!!

My answer is ... yes. Honesty is absolute and not relative.... whether it is a penny or a pound does not matter. And also the cost to maintain honesty can never be treated as too much.

That is the concept of honesty.... no wonder we practical people find it very difficult to be totally honest...... sometimes honesty looks like absence of common sense and at times, wisdom can dictate otherwise, for instance, if telling the honest truth is going to harm the person too much psychologically!!

Honesty is telling the truth. 
Honesty is straightforward conduct. 
Honesty is being sincere, truthful, trustworthy, honorable, fair, genuine, and loyal with integrity.
Accept responsibility for your own actions; don't blame others. 
Be honest about your feelings. 
Face issues as they arise. 
If you are considering lying, try to think of the consequences. 
When confronted with a situation, think of others. 
Honesty is the human quality of communicating and acting truthfully related to truth as a value. This includes listening, and any action in the human repertoire — as well as speaking.

Superficially, honesty means simply stating facts and views as best one truly believes them to be. It includes both honesty to others, and to oneself (see: self-deception) and about one's own motives and inner reality. Honesty, at times, has the ability to cause misfortune to the person who displays it.
Honesty means 
there are no 
contradictions or 
discrepancies in 
thoughts, words, or 
actions. To be honest 
to one’s real self and 
to the purpose of a 
task earns trust and 
inspires faith 
in others. Honesty is 
never to misuse that 
which is given in 
trust. 
honesty is a clear conscience "before myself and before my fellow human beings." Honesty is the awareness of what is right and appropriate in one’s role, one’s behavior, and one relationship. With honesty, there is no hypocrisy or artificiality which create confusion and mistrust in the minds and lives of others. Honesty makes for a life of integrity because the inner and outer selves are a mirror image.



Honesty is to speak that which is thought and to do that which is spoken. There are no contradictions or discrepancies in thoughts, words, or actions. Such integration provides clarity and example to others. To have one form internally and another form externally creates barriers and can cause damage, since one would neither be able to come close to anyone else, nor would others want to be close. Some think, "I am honest, but no one understands me." That is not honest. Honesty is as distinct as a flawless diamond which can never remain hidden. The worth is visible in one’s actions

Be honest..
I think the essence is to be honest to people.. not to words.

if you think the cashier would be worrying about that much extra change whenever he finds his fault, it is well worth driving back .. no matter how many kilometers.

I think the bottomline of all values is not to hurt other people by your actions.. so when in doubt, we can follow this golden rule.

If you drove miles back to a store just to return a penny then you'd be a fool my friend! Far better to pop the extra money in a charity box if your conscience is giving you gyp. Being honest is about personal integrity. Doing what you morality and conscience say is "right" "fair" and "just". Honesty with bluntness or malicious intent is no better than out right manipulation or bare faced lies. You have to have empathy and take other peoples (potential) reaction into account. People who say - I am telling you this for your own good; are never telling you anything you need to hear, its for spite, not your own good. Think before you speak and you shall never go wrong. Do or say things with a good heart and you know you are doing the best you can.

Why not call honesty...the truth as you know it?

We may not actually know the raw truth but if we deliver the truth, as we know it, we are essentially honest, we may just be wrong.

On the coin, I would not drive miles back to return a small amount of change and if I knew that I would again visit a place, I would wait until my next visit to settle up.

I remember an occasion, years ago, in Frankfurt a Main having lunch with a friend and co-worker, we, somehow, left the restaurant without paying and no one stopped us. A couple of hours later I realized that I had not paid. I asked Chuck if he had and he said no. We were across town at the time and returned to pay the check; the manager was profusely appreciative and said that the waitress would be as well since, the amount would have been deducted from her next check.

n this case, not to have returned to pay would have caused a hardship to an innocent person and frankly, would have been...theft by taking.

I believe, all of us are obligated to be as honest with ourselves as our personality can stand and to apply this standard to our dealings with others.

I believe I do this,,,and I hope I'm being honest here!  lol

It may also (and) mean to communicate your value judgment not to drive back to return the surplus difference of the calculation error but to mail it. It could also mean to drive back to return it when it suits your schedule. Rendering a judgment concerning values in consequence can not be and should not be assumed universal as that presumes competence where it is not and incompetence where competency for it actually exists, independent thought.

Honesty is acting in a way as to not hide your true beliefs.

If you are given too much change hiding the fact would likely be dishonest.



A wider definition of dishonesty would be to act as if every action you made was open for all to see.



By  both definitions stealing money would be considered dishonest.

If you accidently act unfairly you should perhaps try to remedy the situation if you want a clear conscience. Gaining from such mistakes is considered by some to be wrong and donating the money to charity might be one way of avoiding gaining from an honest mistake.



Ringing up the person and appologizing, and asking what should be done might be in order if you want to avoid being dishonest.

If you don't care about whether you are dishonest then you can try to intellectualize the issue away but your whole thinking might go down a slippery slide to a way of thinking that turns you into someone you currently would not want to be.

I think to have hope and be let down. Let's face it, that will happen to all of us at some point in our lives. To have no hope at all, seems very bleak.



I don't know that anyone can truly give up all hope. I think that somewhere deep inside we always have a tiny bit of that hope squirreled away . Sometimes we just hide it a little too well.



When you totally lose hope , you give up on life .

Optimism never truly lets you down. If you get your hopes up and something doesn't work out for you, then that is disappointing. However, the happiness, joy, and lack of stress that you get from being an optimistic person in general is far more rewarding than being the type of person who is always pessimistic. Those people, by nature, cannot ever be truly as happy or calm.

To start without hope is to begin a journey weary and defeated.
Why begin it at all?
Always hope for the best, but more important DO what's required to make the trip successful: prepareness, positive outlook, determination. It's a cliche, but true : Failure to plan is planning to fail!

Here's a saying I like that will keep you on an even keel: Hope for the best, Expect the worst. Another phylosophy I have is this; If a problem comes up, can you do something about it. If you can, then shut up and do it. If you can't, then shut up anyways, because it'll do you no good. Generally, speaking, quit your b*tchin'.

It is always better to have hope. Hope gives us a new beggining. To start anew and brings the best from us to do better next time. Having no hope is loosing a new day for me. Hope springs a fountain of goodness.

Thanks for asking. Have a great day!

I guess neither. I hope a lot and usually get crushed. I think it's possible to take pleasure, satisfaction, and happiness from little sunshine moments during the day. Rather than anxiously hoping, place your faith in yourself and open up to the possibility of getting what you want or what you want done. Open up and let success floe like a little stream through you. When you try to stop the stream, your prize becomes routine, nothing special. your success becomes a habit. Prize each little sunshine jewel of a moment, knowing it can never be repeated exactly so.

Hope is healthy, makes you feel better.
Losing hope is sad, but if you spin the sad situation into "I'm learning" then you win both ways.  If your hope comes true, then you win as a victor.

He is not explicit.  You should read Engels' work, 'The Family, the State and Private Property', which portrays the nuclear family as being part of bourgeois society.  Extrapolating this, some Marxists say that homosexuality is a human aberration caused by the nuclear family and will die out in a socialist society.  Others say that homophobia is an aberration caused by bourgeois ideology.  In no societies has homosexuality been promoted as it is in the West today, so it is hard to find historical precedent.  My own view is that today's tolerance arises from the class struggles of the 1970s and was seen as a way to divide the labour movement, along with feminism, environmentalism, and all that other middle class tosh.

You are getting confused because you don't understand that aggregate behavior can create higher levels of behavior that can be useful and have meaning.

For example, if I examined the random behavior of gas molecules I could not predict the concept of pressure, which is the statistical aggregate behavior of those molecules.  And if you just stayed at the level of the pressure you could not understand the concept of the steam engine or of the internal combustion engine.  If you just stayed at the level of engines you could not understand the concept of NASCAR races.  Get the idea?

It is easy to desintegrate the individual social being into some one or more of its more complex specifics such as that of considering it to be a carbon intelligence system whose most complex of activities is the quantum particle activities and that is all.  You could be correct.  No one really knows to what extent we are as real physical activity.  Those "now-moment --continuum's" could be higher coordinated periodicity and evidence shows that indeed it is.  But the reflective parts that must ideate into objective delineation of all pertinent phenomenon and are responsible for the determinations as to how this particular being is going to insert himself or herself in reality objectively enough to maintain the homeostasis of the individual social being.

There are so many happy moments,
but the ones we don't remember are probably some of the happiest.
For example when we were kids, like 3  or 4 when chasing butterflies was the best thing in the world.

Lately, when my mom, my grandma and i hugged each other.
That love filled the room.

Also when I talk to my mom, it makes me happy.

When I swim. When i sing. When i dance. When i write songs.

Life has every day happy moments.

There was one moment in my life when something great happened and there was nothing bad that went with it.  For instance when one gets married it can be an incredibly happy time, but, like having your first child born there is all this stress too.

When I was young my brother and I were bookworms (still are) and when someone won the Spelling Bee I was in awe.  When I was eleven I won the school Spelling Bee.  I stood there on stage, one of the teachers announced me as the "new champion" and everyone clapped for me.  My class gave me a standing ovation.

I was really happy and it didn't have a down side.  That was the one most purely happy moment of my life.

To overcome the four natural enemies
we all must face in our lives

1) fear

we must face our fears head on so we can learn from them
if we run or shy from our fears they win and we cant move 
on to the next enemy

when we overcome our fear we get clarity

2) Clarity

When we get clarity it dispels our fear but it blinds us
it forces us to never doubt ourselves.
so we can do nothing wrong which gets in the way
of learning and either turns us into warriors or clowns
when we overcome clarity we get power

3) Power

you must defy fear defy clarity use it only to see.
power is the strongest enemy and the easiest thing to 
do naturally is give into it and if you give into power
you become a cruel person
you have to learn when and how to use your power

4) old age

when your at the end of your journey of learning
old age is the cruelest enemy of all
you cant defeat it but you can
fight it away

if you soothe yourself in tiredness your lost
if you live a strong life right to the end
you will beat the final enemy

Live a strong meaningful life learn lots laugh plenty

The philosophical question "What is the meaning of life?" means different things to different people. The vagueness of the query is inherent in the word "meaning", which opens the question to many interpretations, such as: "What is the origin of life?", "What is the nature of life (and of the universe in which we live)?", "What is the significance of life?", "What is valuable in life?", and "What is the purpose of, or in, (one's) life?". These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from scientific theories, to philosophical, theological, and spiritual explanations.

These questions are separate from the scientific issue of the boundary between things with life and inanimate objects.
Popular beliefs
"What is the meaning of life?" is a question many people ask themselves at some point during their lives, most in the context "What is the purpose of life?" Here are some of the many potential answers to this perplexing question. The responses are shown to overlap in many ways but may be grouped into the following categories:

Survival and temporal success
...to live every day like it is your last and to do your best at everything that comes before you
...to be always satisfied
...to live, go to school, work, and die
...to participate in natural human evolution, or to contribute to the gene pool of the human race
...to advance technological evolution, or to actively develop the future of intelligent life
...to compete or co-operate with others
...to destroy others who harm you, or to practice nonviolence and nonresistance
...to gain and exercise power
...to leave a legacy, such as a work of art or a book
...to eat
...to prepare for death
...to spend life in the pursuit of happiness, maybe not to obtain it, but to pursue it relentlessly.
...to produce offspring through sexual reproduction (alike to participating in evolution)
...to protect and preserve one's kin, clan, or tribe (akin to participating in evolution)
...to seek freedom, either physically, mentally or financially
...to observe the ultimate fate of humanity to the furthest possible extent
...to seek happiness and flourish, experience pleasure or celebrate
...to survive, including the pursuit of immortality through scientific means
...to attempt to have many sexual conquests (as in Arthur Schopenhauer's will to procreate)
...to find and take over all free space in this "game" called life
...to seek and find beauty
...to kill or be killed
...No point. Since having a point is a condition of living human consciousness. Animals do not need a point to live or exist. It is more of an affliction of consciousness that there are such things as points, a negative side to evolutionary development for lack of better words.

Wisdom and knowledge
...to master and know everything
...to be without questions, or to keep asking questions
...to expand one's perception of the world
...to explore, to expand beyond our frontiers
...to learn from one's own and others' mistakes
...to seek truth, knowledge, understanding, or wisdom
...to understand and be mindful of creation or the cosmos
...to lead the world towards a desired situation
...to satisfy the natural curiosity felt by humans about life

Ethical
...to express compassion
...to follow the "Golden Rule"
...to give and receive love
...to work for justice and freedom
...to live in peace with yourself and each other, and in harmony with our natural environment
...to protect humanity, or more generally the environment
...to serve others, or do good deeds

Religious and spiritual
...to find perfect love and a complete expression of one's humanness in a relationship with God
...to achieve a supernatural connection within the natural context
...to achieve enlightenment and inner peace
...to become like God, or divine
...to glorify God
...to experience personal justice (i.e. to be rewarded for goodness)
...to experience existence from an infinite number of perspectives in order to expand the consciousness of all there is (i.e. to seek objectivity)
...to be a filter of creation between heaven and hell
...to produce useful structure in the universe over and above consumption (see net creativity)
...to reach Heaven in the afterlife
...to seek and acquire virtue, to live a virtuous life
...to turn fear into joy at a constant rate achieving on literal and metaphorical levels: immortality, enlightenment, and atonement
...to understand and follow the "Word of God"
...to discover who you are
...to resolve all problems that one faces, or to ignore them and attempt to fully continue life without them, or to detach oneself from all problems faced

Philosophical
...to give life meaning
...to participate in the chain of events which has led from the creation of the universe until its possible end (either freely chosen or determined, this is a subject widely debated amongst philosophers)
...to know the meaning of life
...to achieve self-actualisation
...all possible meanings have some validity
...life in itself has no meaning, for its purpose is an opportunity to create that meaning, therefore:
...to die
...to simply live until one dies (there is no universal or celestial purpose)
...nature taking its course (the wheel of time keeps on turning)
...whatever you see you see, as in "projection makes perception"
...there is no purpose or meaning whatsoever
...life may actually not exist, or may be illusory )
...to contemplate "the meaning of the end of life"

Other
...to contribute to collective meaning ("we" or "us") without having individual meaning ("I" or "me")
...to find a purpose, a "reason" for living that hopefully raises the quality of one's experience of life, or even life in general
...to participate in the inevitable increase in entropy of the universe
...to make conformists' lives miserable
...to make life as difficult as possible for others (i.e. to compete)-

The mentioning of the end of time in the Bible is to me nonsense which is out of touch with reality. I'm not saying that this world won't at some time in the future come to an end.

We develop concepts about everything of which we are aware. That does not mean that our perception and hence the concept are accurate. The dictionary defines eternity as beginningless and endless time. Anything which does not have a beginning cannot cease to exist. But time is not physical because it is not spatial. It is the constant duration of the eternal now. But there is no past to go to and the future does not yet exist. Yet, there will be a future "now" because the now is not anything physical and therefore cannot cease to exist. All of the ways in which we have to measure time, such as clocks, are actually movements within space (even if it is an atomic clock, it is based on physical changes) which we intuitively along with our nervous system seem to move in consistently regular movements. But those movements are actually changes within time and not time itself. Even if there were no physical movements (changes), the continuation of a perfectly still universe would be during a time period. There just wouldn't be any way to measure that amount of time, because the only way we have of measuring time is anywhere from years (the revolutions of the earth around the sun) to the method of measuring time with an atomic clock (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_cloc... where it is the movement of radiation which is used.

time as in a clock measuring minutes and hours is purely a human concept. time as a universal continuum does exist, if it didn't, we wouldn't exist as solid matter.  if there was an end to time (in the universal sense) it would mean that we would cease to exist. so yes it would matter to humans, but does it matter in the grand scheme of things, to god for instance?  it depends on what you believe.

I believe that time itself is not a concept, but rather the measurement of time IS a concept. Either way the end of time (wether it is time that we see as a universal process or time as a measurement) then the end of time will matter as it will yield any further process. However, when time ends it is not like we can continue after time because we are governed by time. So in another way it does not matter because with the end of time comes the end of our own existence.

The nature of time cannot be contemplated without the physicality of its existence. I for instance would not know what time is, or, if there is anything in existence as time, if I would not have experienced its reality though all things subjected to changes and modifications in time. It seems clear enough at least in human perception that if there is no matter there would be no time, that time perhaps was created alongside the creation of all other things of the universe, as their common characteristic, or a governing principle for progression and change. I think that the thought that time is fallacious. I think time is just as much a reality in the existence of everything as matter is. There would be nothing in place without their specific physical forms, and there would be no thought or a human concept either without the facility of human physical brain to formulate, contain and process.

Then there is purely imaginative side to the matter of your question, as I may ask what if there is no time, as it has just ended? Then I can imagine that it would not matter indeed as there would be no way to realise that it has happened ever. Then from here we enter  into the wild world of metaphysical possibilities and wonder as what a world could be without time, without things changing in time, a world of pure reality perhaps where imaging would be creating, and thinking doing, a world where one could bring into existence entire universes with faith and then destroy them all through doubt. I see then that time is not only the concept but the concept of concepts, if we choose to look at it this way. Time is the reason of the world of matter and of things. It is what we have common with the nature of all things in the world. We can have our timeless concepts that we can conceive, develop and modify in an instant what can be so powerful as to change the nature of our world, where time in unchanging, constant and real, it is the nature the world.

This question is not supposed to be literal.
The point is if it isn't heard, does it matter?
If it effects no one or nothing else, did it happen?

Yes, but it does not make a noise.

Sound is objective, it is a wave of air and that wave can influence other things (say the flight of a butterfly) which can in turn influence still other things, and infinite pattern deriving from a single source.

A noise, however, is subjective and whether something is or is not noisy is entirely at the descretion of the listener.  No listener, no decision, no noise.

Yes it does, whether you hear it or not, whether it affects anyone or not, whether it is recorded or not, or even if a human being never ever finds the fallen tree it still makes a sound. 
It has to, it lives on the same planet you and I and all the other animals with any sense of hearing. We hear because we are in an atmosphere that allows sound to travel regardless of who or what hears it. We know this happens because when you mother tells you to do something you "hear her". If you can hear her on this planet it's because of the atmosphere we have that actually allows sounds to be made, and travel. If that works where we are then you can be sure that it will work in the uninhabited part of the world as well.

if you weren't there to see it fall how do know it fell? One can only assume it made a sound as it fell as one assumes that a tree lying on the forest floor got there by falling.

I needed to get this out:

"If I shout 'I' at the heart of the world, and no one hears me, does it matter?"

What that question is is that of existence, not of logic. Kind of a paradox, if you will. Let's look at it this way:

The world was created by mankind. The world itself is desolate if it is not acknowledged by man. A species of animal never discovered does not exist if it's existence is not acknowledged. The universe would not exist if not seen by man. I exist, am heard, therefore I am.

Sound a little self-centered? Yes, but that's the root of the question. If we do not know about something, does it exist? If a boat sinks in the ocean and no survivors are around to tell the tale, has it ever happened? Would events in history exist if they were not written down and remembered?



And another quote:

"To see something is to acknowledge it's existence. Once that has happened it is recognized, therefore it now exists."

Things that we have no knowledge of happen all the time. Yet if no one witnessed these events, did they truthfully happen? If an animal species that is undiscovered dies out, then have they truly existed?



That is the tree question. If a tree falls and man did not hear it, therefore did not recognize it's existence, did it make a sound? No, because if it's existence is not recognized then it is not remembered. Events can occur, but if no one is there to witness them they did not happen.

However, this question has been around for quite a while. I think the tree that didn't make a sound is forever remembered, then.

Oh God that's a good question....



I would die for someone else's life but in some cases, like with my mum, she's told me she would rather she died because she wouldn't be able to live thinking that she was alive because I wasn't and I can totally understand that. Are we talking like a spur of the moment cliff scenario? If so then I would happily die for someone else's life, I couldn't live with myself if I didn't.

My opinion was my own; until I found that it was baseless i.e without the religion of the god of self; and because only; it could become harmfull to the self. .

In chapter 18 verse 72 of THE SHREEMAD BHAGWAT GITA; LORD SHREE KRISHNA GIVES THE STATUS OF " CONQUERER OF RICHES" TO SHREE ARJUNA.

it means the conquerer of the riches of the mind and the hearts of self; of both the self and people outside;



He gave such status to shree arjuna only because he had delivered to him those qualities and abilities of self which truly make him like wise; and he empowerd and enabled him with such qualities and abilities only; because he knew that such qualities, abilities, staus of self in self only can help shree arjuna achieve and realise the true goals of TRUE SUCCESS FOR HIMSELF; I.E. GOODNESS, VICTORY, GLORY, AND UNFAILING RIGHTEOUSNESS OF SELF FOR THE SELF.



My opinion has changed; and I thank the religion and the powers and abilities of the religion of god for mankind; for same.

The heart desires, the mind acquires.

The mind/logic can't really be conquered.  It's just the part of your brain the figures how to do things.



The heart, is the part of you mind the desires.



If people help you out of love or fear,  they have in a sense been conquered.

So the only important thing is to conquer the heart, because you cannot conquer the mind.

Conquering minds means like once you getting into the center of one system you overcome the whole system.



So conquering minds is the most powerful.

It depends if one is wishing to deceive or be true to their word.
If conquering a person (in a sense) then it must be heartfelt to reach the person on an emotional level, but if it is illogical or confusing in their minds then it can leave a person detached or not completely there.
For example people feel with their hearts, they feel sorry for people but often do not understand them, therefore if you wish to conquer it will not work by just reaching the heart.
Then if it is all to mechanical and no heartfelt passion or anything, all logic and no emotion, then it will also leave a person confused, bored, or un-relating.

In the case of being genuine, conquering both the heart and the mind are equally important because they work in unison, and without one the other will leave the person detached.

Why conquer anything?  Yet the mind is logical and often tells people what they do, but they don't always do it because of the 'human factor'.  Emotions are stronger and more immediate than logic.  Influence the heart and the mind will surely justify the emotions felt.

No, ignorance breeds intolerance. Experience and knowledge does just the opposite. Bigotry, which stems from ignorance, by very definition, makes reference to those who are intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities that differ from one's own. So, perhaps, only thinking one "knows" breeds intolerance.

<asker's comment>



Fundamentally true. But some people believe that once they have enough knowledge that their problems will be solved. That isn't what happens. Some amount of ignorance is always present. Chaos is always a factor, and knowledge is insufficient. Does one embrace chaos or reject it? How does one use it?

Some degree of chaos is present, even in the brain. The problem with knowledge is that it is difficult to come out ahead if one is accumulating knowledge for it's own sake. If I answer every question on jeapardy, do I really come out ahead? No. It is about how one uses the information.



sassychi...



As for reality, it is too big to take. In the words of George Harrison, "It's all too much for me to take.."

Relationships also involve people not knowing the other person fully. The lament, "Nobody understands me" is always true. Wisdom accepts other people without understanding them completely.



sassychi...



Can people be happy knowing that they are somewhat ignorant? Surely, many people condemn ignorance while being ignorant themselves. If a person is always intolerant of ignorance,such people are always in pain, since some ignorance is inevitable.

I don't think so, but it's probably the case that when you take in a lot of information, a lot of it conflicting, you go through a period of nihilism where everything seems relative and there are no truths.

I can agree with you partially that intelligent people pay less attention to things they believe are small and insignificant.

Intolerant of how silly, stupid and actually dumb a society can become I think, is what is meant here.  Yes, to some extent.  When those that step out into the world and find answer or are looking for answers and think they have found them or understand certain concepts of what mankind is capable of, but yet find that the majority of those about them refuse to take upon themselves to search for the knowledge that might resolve some issues, they do become intolerant.



Is knowledge breeding intolerance, perhaps because the old saying "familiarity breeds contempt" certainly can be applied here.  those that actually have what we call knowledge, are a foot up on the rest of us, they know it and they like it and the shove it down our throats.

It depends on who they are. 
It can be hard to accept something, Especially if they'd always thought the opposite. In that sense, the knowledge they find just may make them uneasy. Generally, when you are uncomfortable with something, you reject it, and rejection is a form of intolerance.

It is not so much what a person knows, as how the person decides to act upon that knowledge. There are many learned people who have caused much destruction in the world. But, there are also many learned people who temper their knowledge with wisdom and become a force for good in the world. Knowledge in and of itself is just knowledge. It is a tool. Therefore, how it is used is of crucial importance.

Infinity in "ordinary" usage is generally considered to be an extension of the sequence of "ordinary numbers". Infinity is not a number itself, and can't really be treated as one. So you can't define Inf.+1 or 2 x Inf., meaning that you can't sensibly talk about Infinity+1 being greater than Infinity.

However, as Andrew E remarks, the mathematician Cantor found some remarkable properties about the different possible kinds of Infinity, which can in some sense be compared for "size".

The first kind of infinity is the "countably infinite" kind. This is fairly easy to recognise. For example, the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc are countably infinite. So, too, are the even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and so  on.  By "countably infinite" is meant that you can label each one in turn by a number, without missing any out or running out of label numbers.  Hence

Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
Counted as.....: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

In this way, you can label each even number with a "natural" number, and however far you go, you can always do this. There's never an even number you find between two adjacent numbers that you can't label, or count, in this way.

There are infinitely many even numbers, but infinitely many natural numbers, and though intuitively you might think there are more natural numbers than even numbers, the "size" is the same - infinite.

You can also do this "counting" with fractions, of the form a/b, for example, 1/2, 2/3, 2/4. 3/4, and so on. It is possible to construct a scheme for labelling every fractional number with a natural number, without missing any out. I won't do it here, but it's easy enough to find this on the web.

However, you can't do with with the set of all decimal numbers, that is, numbers of the form 3.14159265... or 1.33333 and so on. It can be shown that if you try to create a labelling scheme to account for all decimal numbers, it's possible to construct a new decimal number between any two others that cannot be labelled by a natural number. It sounds complicated, and in truth it requires a bit of familiarity with number theory to grasp it, but it shows that there is a new kind of infinity, called (naturally enough) "uncountably infinite", which is larger than the "countably infinite" kind.



This is the sort of stuff that Cantor worked on.

The answer is hinted at in Andrew E's first sentence of the second paragraph.



Taking not only any finite number of things from infinity, but also taking an infinity any infinite number of times from it leaves infinity. To illustrate: there is a line with an infinite number of, say, beads strewn all over it. Somebody is allocated ,say,every tenth bead, somebody else every hundreth, still another every thousandth, and so on to infinity. All will have an infinite number of beads, because, in all cases, since the line is infinite, there will be no end to the process of the distribution of the beads, this leaving  the non-allocated beads also infinite.



We can apply mathematical- and philosophical-sounding phrases like: Infinity less Infinity equals Infinity, a fraction of Infinity is equal to Infinity and taking away the Infinite from the Infinite, the remainder is Infinite. l

This question was answered in 1886 by Georg Cantor, who in the process of laying the foundations of Set Theory, also answered many questions about infinity.

Infinity is when there is so many of something that taking any finite number of things away from it (or adding any finite number of things to it) will not change its size.  So infinity is the exact same size as infinity plus one.  Furthermore, infinity multiplied by infinity is also the same size as infinity, so the answer to your question is that all the options you listed are the exact same size.

However, there is more than one size infinity.  In fact, there are an infinite number of infinities.  The smallest infinity is called the "countably infinite", such as the number of integers.  We don't know what the next one is, but it is uncountable.  Cantor hypothesized that the next size was 2 to the power of infinity, but we have since learned that whatever the order of infinities is, we can never know it.  Cantor's Hypothesis was proved to be unprovable by Godel and Cohen in the early 20th century.

I wonder, is infinity endless space & time, or no space & time? Personally, I think it to be the later, a concept we really can not conceive well since we apparently perceive space & time right now.

Technically, if you view an infinity as an increasing number without end or an unattainable quantity, this question becomes a mere illusion.  All three would be the same size.

Infinity is not a number, so you can't add one to it or have an infinity of infinities.  Nor is there any such thing as "an infinity"; that is, it's not a thing.  One could say that infinity is the lack of finiteness, lack of boundaries, though that's not a very good definition either.  It's the emptiness that allows us to perceive something finite.  Finite/infinity go together like solid/space or sound/silence.  We can't imagine or perceive solid without reference to space or space without reference to solid.  Likewise we can't imagine a finite number without reference to infinity.  This is harder to see because it's more abstract, but I think it's true.  And we can only seem to imagine infinity in terms of finite numbers--which leads us to notions such as infinity plus one.  That's really just imagining a very high number and adding one to it.

How do you think the world will be like without death?



So in your opinion how do you the world will be like. No one dies, no matter what happens to them, no matter how poor their physical or mental health is.



</question>



<additional details>



In my opinion the world would be both in chaos and a bit of joy. The chaos part: Imagen if Hitler was still alive. He would probably constantly try to find a way to kill Jews. If George Washington was still alive... well lets say he will be our leader and he'll put a end to the Iraq War. Im guessing we need death/Death. It has something to do with Yin and Yang.

if there was no death, time would be meaningless.
we would have all the time in the world to do whatever we wanted. 
Also, some pain could be avoiding but some pain would still arise. If your 90 and suffering from cancer and will never die from it, but suffer forever that would be horrible.

Human desires I do not think are frustrating automatically, they could however be had in frustrating circumstances. There is time and place for each and everything for it to be of some good to the mind, and this is particularly true in case of desires. Desire I understand are the longings and yearning of our physical being that are made visible in face of some material gains. Desires denote our tendencies of a exuberant self, they signify our need to have something beyond the limits of our natural needs.

Then desires I see are in the mind just the way our dreams, ambitions and aspirations are, but desires have an earthly ring to their sound, if they are borne out of earth, the physical world, and as if they are good only for the physical world that they are borne out of. Where dreams can be heavenly, aspirations can be had highly, and ambitions for a better the purposes of a life overall, it is as if desires have nothing to do with what we dream, aspire or yearn to be, that they desire have a sole purpose of making us happy, us, for wherever, and whichever way we might be at a time. Desires are always homely with our current state of being. One could be in miserable and still nurture pleasing desires that would do nothing to eliminate misery.



Then this may be the reason desires are known to impede our way to a better, nobler and greater life. Where our dreams and ambitions might inspire us to forebear, to work hard, to overcome and sacrifice lowly delights, natural urges and desires might cause us to lose sight of our high objectives, for the purpose of instant gratification and momentary relief, if I must say so. We have desire to feel right and in control all the time for instance, where our endeavours of our faith and long-term enterprises of a career improvement might demand of us to go through longer periods of doubt, whereby our faith and resolves is tested, our desires might put us in need for constant assurance and reassurance in life.

Human desires are NATURAL, they only become frustrating when they cannot be achieved either by circumstances or more often now that the desires ask for the impossible.

with reasonable desires and them being achieved we can gain contentment.  with unreasonable desires and no change of them being fulfilled we gain frustrations.

Desire is an attempt to find the source of happiness
outside of us.In that process we are searching for
happiness where it is not available,so frustration
always follows desire.The source of happiness
and bliss is our inner being.If we forget that truth
desiring and frustration will not cease.

Yes & No. Our desires come from our guidance system. They move us along in our life so we grow as we came to earth to do. Right now I am so content. One thing I desire is more money yet I have never focused on it so I am pretty clueless about how to bring it into my life. So I can understand feeling frustrated but this is motivating me cause feeling content never motivated me. As I go along I am not at all concerned about money but it has lots of lessons for me. My son is more concerned about my finances & so he pushes me about it. I believe it will all work out. So this situation is in my face so I will move forward. If I don't then things will get worst until I desire the situation to change...Usually when we desire something the thing or person isn't what we desire it is the essence that we desire. So if we figure that part out we can save alot of money & alot of times alot of disappointment. This means if I say I want a sports car, I might want one but I might just want to feel exhilerated & cool. I might want to feel more alive. I can get all those things with out the sports car. If I have let my thinking get old & dusty I just need to dust it off & think in a more vibrant way again.

As far as I can see through my own life, our desires are only frustrating if your expectations are high. If you accept that you have tried your best to achieve what you want out of life, it doesn't matter so much if you do not always achieve those goals. In fact I'd go as far as to say that I have found life's contentment is enough to nullify the frustrations for me.

They are only "Frustrating" if you have a desire but are unwilling to work to fulfill it.

I know it's often hard to do the things required to get the things you want. But if you are willing to work hard and understand that there may be hardships along the way you will certainly diminish the frustrations and gain your desire.

to desire something is fustrating so i guess i do agree =]

and ill tell you why too =P

when you need soemthing, its not fustrating when you cant have it but an essence of life and death (if the case is food or water). if you want something you can block it out. you can forget about it and fill your head with different thoughts or you can want it from afar.

but when you desire, you crave, and when your not satisfied you get fustrated. you cant forget your desire. you cant ignore it. you can try, but it will always be lurking in the background. desires are difficult to control. desires normally are fulfilled because its that fustrating.

thank you =]

Last April 2007, my mum who was 78 at the time, was suddenly taken ill. She was diagnosed with pnuemonia, sceptecimia and a perforated lung! We were told that she would not last more than a few days because of her age. In the same week and same ward, two people less than half her age died with only the pnuemonia. After a month in hospital and almost two months in rehabilitation, she came out a bit worse for wear, but very much alive. I personally, have always put it down to the fact that her 2nd great grandchild was born just two months before her illness and my son willed her to get better, watch him grow and be a part of his life. I believe there is always something to keep you going especially where family are concerned. I think my mum is living proof of that. x

I learned that when you are vulnerable that is when the religious people try to get you to buy into their warped belief system.



I learned that there is no good reason to rely on supernatural help, you have to pick yourself up and rely on yourself and to a lesser extent your good friends and family (if your lucky enough to have any) to get through your problems.

I learned that believing in supernatural leaves you open to manipulation by people who don't always have your best interests at heart.



The most important thing I learned that time is a great healer and that even when you think things can never be good again, they will get easier to bare.

My concept of happiness is varied. I see happiness as a progress and level. For example, getting a 100% on an exam could get me an 8 in happiness, while the Starbucks latte brings a 4 of happiness. Happiness to me is content. It is seeing my children grow and becoming successful in areas of their life. It is crawling into bed at night after an exhausting day and falling peacefully asleep, accomplishing a goal in my life that I have set for myself, during the moments of highest ecstasy while having sex, seeing a strangers smile, watching a sunset progress till the night sky bursts with stars above my head, learning additional knowledge and adding depth to my character, helping another individual just to see them succeed in life, enjoying the warmth of the sun on my body as I read a thought provoking book. I could continue on in book lengths because happiness surrounds me each day, I just have to be observant and appreciative of when the moment arrives to be aware to enjoying it for what it is.

A simplistic answer might be the opposite of the alternative.



Concepts are a wonderful thing, in a general sense, and with tolerance, acceptance, and some sense of non degrading, modest compromise, we might all find "levels" of happiness. That certainly relates, individually, and might be as much like a Teeter Totter balancing, as anything set in concrete.



I could have just been run over by that bus, as I hurried to school. Is that a happy thing? OR is it more an alert, that I wasn't paying much attention, causing me a moment of unhappiness in my carelessness.



A gambler. Are they conditioned to HAPPY, just when they win, or don't lose? Are they happy if they lose, but don't lose everything? Are they so happy if they win, that they double up, and perhaps again lose it all? Thinking, "No biggie, wasn't "MY" money anyway.

I define happiness in the only way that I know, which is how I found it in myself in the last year. I had to do so me soul searching, and cleaning out of my negativity on the inside. When I did this, there was my happiness still inside me just gleaming and shining as bright as ever. I have never been on such a high as I am now that I have found my happiness. I wake up in a great attitude, and have such a desire to continue to learn and grow within myself.
I use to think happiness would come when I found a husband. But now I realize, you cannot base your happiness on anyone or anything outside of yourself. You must find it within, and then bring it out and enjoy it each day.

I know that my happiness is so simple in nature, and does not need fancy material items, or certain people in my life to be maintained.

I am happy, because I am human, and that is my living right. And now that I experience it each day, I love it! And never want to go back to how I was before.

Thanks for reading!

There is no rubric or set of rules or definition that would work for everyone.  Everyone has a different idea about what happiness is, just like everyone has a different idea of what love is.  My concept of happiness is that it is an unstable, ephemeral emotion that is the result of achieving some goal, consciously or unconsciously.

Self worth,knowing you always do your best to be your best.
Helping someone even just to smile in times of 
darkness.
Feeling alive and whole as a person, gaining the strength in your struggles for self,being able to adapt to 
the Sh** that is thrown your way,and deal with it.
Remembering Always,how much you have compared to those that have nothing.
Above all Happiness for me is the capability of giving and showing Love,even if it is not returned.

Happiness is what you promise to your shelf to keep living.
Sometimes you know where to find it and sometimes it cames alone.
Sometimes you have to try hard to get it and sometimes not at all.
Sometimes you think you find it but you are wronge.
Sometimes you see it , you feel it and that makes you want it more.

My advice is: try to see happiness to the "small" things because that way happiness would be with you everyday!

I have seen some answers like being the camera man, refusing to do anything and so on, but that kind of response defeats the purpose of the question, the main question is, would you be willing to shoot and be guilty of taking a life to live yourself or be shot and stay innocent?

I think religious people will choose the latter.

There is a small blotch of a shadow in the middle of the picture barely visible in the roughness of an uneven ground. The angle of incident of light in the picture informs us that the shadow is that of the human figure, probably a woman holding a human child in her arms. The shadow, I think, will no longer be there once the drama has reached the finality of its act. I do not think either it is hard to see and realise what impending poignancy is probable to unfold. Whatever it is going to be a moment later, I feel, is more in the way that it is now.



How am I going to deal with this? I am who is weak and vulnerable. I am who is childish and self seeking. I have not yet learnt to see deeper into the proper meaning of things and far enough into the consequences of events. I still need to admit that I become cold, indifferent and senseless in situations, situations that require warmth, courage and compassion. I let things happen to me, and then turn round to blame the world for all its ills. I remain very much in need most of the time, and my deeds are non-productive, they seldom surfeit the wants of my bare necessities. If I am like this through most of the situations of my life then would it not easy for me to be the same here? I think I will be like a child here too, the child.

I therefore prefer to be the child the woman is carrying. Firstly, I hope that the man with the gun would never pull the trigger. I feel I will be saved by the love of the woman, by her unwilling sacrifice of her life, by her being between me and our killer. Then, I hope that the soldier, as that is what he appears to be, would be stopped by his sense of humanity, or by the fear of God, Who will be merciful to me, and I would be left undone.

Who created God?



Something can ALWAYS be halved just as it can ALWAYS be doubled - the human mind has a problem comprehending this as to us there is supposedly always a beginning and an end to everything.
To suit this requirement, the primitive mind of humans (which is perpetually looking for answers) accredits their existence to a superior, infinitely knowledgeable creator.

There is always a bigger fish, lets not be so naive that we believe we are second from the top of all the universe.
Remember a few thousand years ago the Earth was flat and we were the only planet with water on? How many times do we need to be proved wrong before we stop putting such blind faith in unproven theories?

If a God exists; Where did this creator come from,what was their motivation, what gave them the inspiration, and who do they look to or worship?

Irrevocablexenophile I really wouldn't be suprised if you're right!!! It probably was my Mum!



Schtiel12485 - THATS WHY ITS A QUESTION....
Plus God (which for some reason you seem to know is of the male gender (probably because when the bible was writen, men ruled the world) - far more likely to be A-sexual or female) is NOT confirmed (the Bible is not confirmation - how about I right a book about the creators creator; does that give him confirmation NO!) Whether the Creator of a God has been confirmed is not pertinent as there is no confirmation for a God. Completely irrelevent! Dunce!



John W: "Not to be lead by our own understandings but the word of God" SHEEP. Sounds like; Don't follow your own conciousness and opinions, but the word that is written in this book which has been written by men! "The Bible is the word of God I hear you scream" Urgh! There's always an answer isn't there! Tablets from the mountains - bit of an inconvenient place to put them! Not terribly loving or considerate of the Lord Almighty!



"you know" - The only reason I couldn't understand your incredibly complex and obviously factual answer is your lack of correct grammer and punctuation!
Can you not see the hypocritical nature of you reply? I supposedly have the comprehension of a child but the only substanence for this opinion is because it differs from yours. You bellitle me because i believe something different from you. Well if to share the same views as you were to make me as moronic and narrow minded as you seem to be, well then I'm very glad that i don't!
Furthermore to the impropriety of your beloved fallacy, you say that humans are the only species with motivation (thereby proving yourself a complete idiot). Why do you think animals eat - through motivation to survive. How come you can train an animal; due to the motivation of a reward for doing something correctly. And can you please explain to me what an irraTional animal is?
Don't waste my time with you simplistic, narrow-minded, inert veiws.



Most of us are atheists really, we just don't know it yet. The only difference being that I believe in one less god than you!

I'm not going to bother reading crap about something that does not exist.  I mean bigfoot may not exist but that's something else!

God is.. a myth,  you could call him.



Because we created him,  and most of those things you listed which I scimmed through were facts that HE DOES NOT EXIST!

Some *** said to me "We're all gonna die in 2012 when god destroys earth and recreates it",  and I was like "what a loner,  he needs to get laid" right?

God does not exist,  but I wont intrude,  everyone has their own opinion.  We created god,  we created the bible (bible said god was to destroy earth and recreate it in 2012,  what a load of BS) and nobody had seen god to be told all the crap written in the bible.

Your question insinuates that God has a creator. I dont care if you believe in His existance or not, your question is built on an assumption that is not confirmed.

He created all things. He is perfect and always has been. He does not worship but loves all that He creates. He does not need to have inspiration because He knows all. He challenges us with troubles so that we ourselves can become closer to perfecting our souls.

How can anyone not believe in the afterlife? What a bleak future we would have... So we die and just are nothing? Look at me. I have memories that cannot be fathomed. Deep soul imprinted memories. I believe we all have them you just have to have faith and you will remember.

Can not be answered.
My belief is that there is God
Do not need to no how or why, he just is.
God is the creator of everthing, so I guess he created himself as well.

God didn't created himself. He was already here. Yeah, I know your thinking "well that doesn't make sense." It's not supposed to it's called FAITH. and it's not a "who" or "what" question. It's just how it is. Our minds can't go that far. You've gotta have Faith. No questions asked.

that is the atheist argument my friend. the answer- because there is no God. a series or random events (the big bang theory) created the earth and over millions of years life form grew and evolved. the world is very old animals werent just placed on the earth. besides humans werent the 1st beings on earth so that throws adam and eve out the window.

its all stupid, humans just need answers all the time and they need to have someone to put their trust and faith into.



p.s no1 ever did think the world was flat, its a common belief that they did but it isnt true, they always believed the earth to be round...pear shaped i think, but yeah it was never believed to be flat. but yup, totally agree with u

Philosophy question? Theological statements! God is how the primitive perceives natural forces that he cannot control, the sun, the night, stars, the wind, the sea etc. Once the primitive expands their language to include abstract concepts like truth, justice and mercy and also observes the effects of nature on agriculture and housing then these are combined with the elemental forces to create a unit that we refer to as a god (with a small g).

I do this all the time. What made us, but what ever made us had to come from somewhere, and then that had to come from somewhere. It goes on and on. Are we actually here? Did any of us ask to be here? (a much used argument) I think that is there is another intelligent being in the universe then we are meant to be here, if not then we are not. You can counter that by saying maybe we are here to multiply and grow, but with everything there is always another deeper reason that involves another thing.

Are we in a never ending spiral of creations, or is it all in a circle with us creating a being which creates a being which creates us, or thus n variation.

What is the meaning of life - and answer not even the "creator" can answer. There is gotta be more than us. We are nothing in the grand scheme but we believe we are everything.



Maybe I have created more questions than answers, but we need to think of the big picture as a whole, not lots of little ones like we do now, with out realising we are doing so.

If God doesn't exist how was the universe and life formed in general, and I don't mean the BB theory because if you believe that still it came from somewhere.  If you believe or don't believe in a God you still will never know all the answers in the universe. If you do believe in a God atleast you can assume that someone knows what is going on or someone has the answers.

There seem to be a huge variety of religious beliefs involving some sort of supreme being, or beings. All these belief systems seem to be trying for a set of processes to "get along" in the world. None seem to offer concrete proof of the supreme being(s)' actual existence, at least, credible to non-believers of that faith. So my "opinion" would be that humans have created supreme beings, in striving for their own betterment - which does not seem like a bad thing, in and of itself. Of course, being flawed humans, we seem to usually use our "faith" to put down others, rather than to get along with them!

I don't think that's the question your trying to ask. Wishing sounds like something you can't have. The question is...what is your burning desire? What is it you want? Want is more powerful than a wish, but then sometimes you have to put your desire into action. What will you do to get there? Right now my burning desires are to build a professional graphic design portfolio and to make my first cd album. Those fit under the category of success and I am making it happen. Nothing is impossible... because wishing is what you make seem impossible. "Oh, I wish I was rich" More importantly, be grateful for what you do have.

There are many questions out there but I wish that someday, we or our future generation will find out where and how, we animals really have evolved from and what in too.…… Deep I know but my wish is to understand and accept.

Obviously, one can only guess...... I would say we must feel cut-off from this world because of the loss of our physical senses. That may lead to deeper thoughts and revelations, because while we are alive, it is our experience that meditation, which fairly effectively cuts-off our sensing of the external world for the time being, does lead to deeper thinking and ideas.

I am not a morning person and I don't feel very helpful today, but I just thought I might add-- I am almost certain that there are scientific descriptions(that I've read) of the stages your brain goes through while you are dying,i.e, which senses are dying off first,which remain last, some theories on how this procedure may cause Near-Death-Experiences etc.So yeah you could look that up.

it depends how you die.

If you are suffocating or drowning your going to feel lack of breath.
Grabbing at your throat internally everything shuts down and eventually you slip away.

As another person has said, one can only assume, what you feel when you die. An old person who dies in their sleep probably feels nothing, though if you are dying painfully pain will be what you feel.

But death is a mystery,
I know as ive been revived before, that when you die, you can hallucinate and see things that may not really be there, just before you die i mean, you can see things, you arent exactly there its like being in an imagination or a fantasy film or something, its an odd feeling, so many things go into your mind then it all stops and you drift away into blotchy black sight.
But because i was revivied im not too sure if thats counted as death or not.

Ignorance is neither bliss nor suffering....... it is a void that can in certain circumstances prove to be helpful and in other circumstances turn out to be a curse. However, in the longer run, ignorance is more likely to be detrimental than blissful.... the bliss of ignorance is rather temporary, just like a lie that can help us only for the time being in certain specific circumstances, and not for all time to come and in all circumstances. Knowledge and truth, even as may sometimes prove to be bitter for the time being, are the only weapons we can have in order to be assured of ultimately coming out victorious in life.

One may suffer in ignorance, and one may suffer due to ignorance. Sufferance, I take in fact is a forced awareness caused either by our own nature, or by some external agency, for something being wrong within the normal, and natural, formation of our personality in the mind, something being incompatible, inconsistent, imposing, or missing as suffering could also be in the having too much or too little of something. If there is dearth of insightfulness, knowledge and awareness than there would certainly be pain and anguish in the mind trying to come to terms with the realities of life, and if there is too much of some one thing that might cause disproportion resulting upon pain and discomfort, until the time natural balance of things is restored.

I therefore would like to maintain that suffering is in fact awareness in disguise, or it bring with it opportunities of new and better knowledge and awareness. However, sometimes the message is too strong and realisation too sudden and shocking that they take us by storm, and before we develop new abilities to deal with what is happening, they get the better of us.



If our awareness lags behind reality then the moments in between are often occupied with hurts, pains, delights, hopes, and suspense, and finally, when we do start to see things in the light of new reality, we realise that we could overcome our circumstances, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and that light have power to dispel hurt and pain.

No, Knowlegde can be as well.



Depends on how Knowledge or Ignorance of a particular situation affects your life. If knowing the truth about something makes you feel worse off, then Ignorance is better. Unless you put more value on knowing the truth, whatever the cost, over feeling good about things just being the way they are, even if your perception of them is very far off from the reality.

For a start I would like to wake up some place exotic and warm, wake up and look out onto a sandy beach and azure sea... with Lily my dog next to me. Take her out along the beach for a little run and romp. Get home and see my sister waiting for me. We would sit and chill, having cups of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee... go for a leisurely horse ride, exploring... I would then go shopping... kitting myself out with some nice new clothes, get myself a haircut, restyle etc. Have a Thai massage, manicure, pedicure and general pampering.... I would like to go somewhere so exquisitely beautiful it takes my breath away.... and watch the sunsetting.

Before I indulge myself in some fanciful thoughts and start dreaming about a world of perfect bliss, all full of joy, delight and comfort, with each moment a moment of perfect peace and happiness, liveable to the full, assuring for its present and at the same time promising for its future, let me remind you, let me tell you that the concept of imperfection in the mind is what stands right against that of imperfection. For if I attempt to see my life as perfect, then, being it being life as it normally is, I will also see imperfections, and everything more imperfect than normal, as when I will seek all things to be prefect. Your question, however, despite its hinging upon the word ‘perfect’, is valid, as it does invite us to think of the ways of improvement.

I think true perfection is to be found within the normalities of life in general, in its realities, and thereupon, also in our ability to live normally despite our love for idealism.



I think all people, their places and things, can be seen as perfect long as they are seen through their right reasons and use. The place prefect is the place right in the middle of all this, in the middle of life. A prefect life is a life that one could sensibility, happily and sustainability lead. This I think is the underpinning philosophy to use as guidance while trying to construct a ‘perfect’ day of my life.

To do this should be simple if is it has to be any good. It has to be at least as simple as its philosophy is sophisticated. So, this is what I would do to make my day a perfect day:



I would get up early in the morning, and then after some light breakfast, would sit down and carefully plan for the day ahead. I will think carefully, realistically and sensibly as how would I like to spend the day at hand, while making sure at the same time that what I aim for my day is slightly better than my yesterday, is reassuring for now, and is also promising for the day that is to come. Then once all things nicely mapped out, I will set out to turn it into a reality. I would know by doing this that I have live the day that I have had, that I will be able to happily own up to by the evening – perfect, or imperfect, in the eyes of the world, the day has undoubtedly been mine!

I liked the part in 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance',  where the major character says if you want to paint a perfect picture first make yourself perfect then paint away.



I have  found days that are billed as perfect rarely are as too much is hanging on them and I am not perfect.

When I try to play this game I just get flies in the ointment -Leonard Cohen wouldn't be so natural if I paid for his company - etc. so I'll stick with a day in a sunny place meditation centre massage and healing nice walk and simplicity.

Good Q, thanks.

Truth, like a bouyant thing, always rises to the surface of a pond. A lie is the stone that sinks, often dragging us to drowning with it.

That thought doesn't say that Truth sets us free, or won't have painful effects, but it sure means  we can stop lying.

A lie is like trying to dig a hole in dry sand. The "job" can hardly be completed, as the walls of the hole, keep falling back in on the "digger", creating more effort, and even more lies to compound.

You don't. No matter how real something may appear, appearances are deceiving. People used their senses to perceive that the Earth was flat. Those senses proved to be wrong.

What seems to work better is to acknowledge that something may be true at this moment, but in time, you may learn more information that disproves that truth.

Truth is fluid.

It was true that humans were Earthbound. It is now true that humans travel into space.

Look at all the other variable surrounding the words and actions of the statements in question the truth can only be hidden for so long it can never not come out.  A lie can never grow old.......................You can sweep things under the carpets but in the end as you walk upon them and observes stuff starts coming out you just have to be extremely aware and your gut feelings intuitions and the actions of character all come out to play :))

If the issue is important enough, demand proof. If the lie doesn't lend itself to examination by this approach, ask for the details. Ask for more details every other day or so. Very few liars can keep all the details straight, and then you can catch them in contradictions.
One long term method is an austerity from Yoga - this is to never lie yourself, not even for the smallest or biggest reason. This will develop in you the power of hearing the truth.

Transcending the mind/ego, which is incapable of telling truth from falsehood.  This is most commonly exhibited in the Eastern traditions of meditation, contemplation, prayer and devotional service.

Another way is to become proficient at kinesiology and muscle testing.  It is a known fact that body language indicates what is unspoken or used to discern truth from a lie.  Muscle testing with the kinesiology test tests the muscle response in the presence of positive or negative stimuli, or truth and non-truth.  The muscle will respond weak to falsehood and that which doesn't support life and strong to the contrary independent of personal belief

years ago I ignored my intutiion. I started noticing it more when I was going through a hard situation with a family member who was lying to me. I used my mind & ignored by gut. I noticed when I did things & ended up sorry that I actually knew I shouldn't have let him take my care or my credit card. I thought being a nice person & trusting would always bring me good results. I learned the hard way that my intuition was wiser than the beliefs I had.....so I started paying attention. I would get a feeling to stop at the store even though I wanted to go home. I would stop & meet up with someone who was important for me to meet....I learned to not trust everyone except myself....My husband started a business & we would put out money for supplies meaning to get paid back from the person he was woking for. We felt uncomfortable with some people & they ended up being the people who had no intentions of paying us back... Now we have learned to structure things so we don't get ripped off but if we get a bad feelling about someone we will not work for them. We don't attract this kinds of customers anymore. ..I am so tuned into my intuition now that it guides my whole life...I can tell if somoene is lying or some kind of crook no matter who they are. I see people in the political section who are making decisions & they are so out of touch but I can't tell them to trust their intution. They don't even know how at this point but I can tell all kinds of things that happen.It is like I read life like someone else might read a book.

With wisdom. Truth will sing to the part of us that is real in some way. Each may feel it differently, but on some level it will register. Willingness to let go of hearing from the point of view that fills our personal agenda or belief system is necessary. We are masters at deceiving ourselves with lies that fill our ego's agenda.  Being able to have clarity in this world is no easy task but it can be done & must be done. So, if I let go of trying to prove I am right, release my personal agendas, recognize I don't know, I then have a better chance at being open to Truth when it presents itself. BTW, Truth is always presenting itself, we just refuse to see it.
Blessings!

It is possible for people to tell lies most truthfully, i.e. to the best of THEIR knowledge, information and belief, where knowledge, truth and beliefs all can be faulty. It is possible for all people to be sincere hypocrites, i.e. to be living a lie but to be ignorance it the fact. Then even when we are along the right path, that is to say, have right knowledge, correct information and beliefs based upon true principles of human nature, we can falter and misconceived fact only to learn sooner or later that we have been wrong in this or in that. Then the general fact that our knowledge will never be complete to allow us to claim truth, we have to know what we cannot know through faithful believing. And when people believe in things that always remain beyond the rationality of reason, our common sense and comprehension our interpretation of truth remain a matter of dispute among people of different beliefs.

This all makes us an unreliable judge of truth, but then how do we manage? I think we learn to manage in our circles of understanding. And therein we set standards that help us ascertain as if someone is right or wrong. Then we can see that if a person who is right according to commonly understandable criterion of right and wrong is predominantly right then he must be telling what is mostly true, and vice versa.



What I mean to say here is that there is not other way for a truth or a lie to exist but in forms and functions of human life, and there is no way to see a truth unless the person who accommodates it or mediates the facts is known as truthful, and is truthful beyond doubt. In simple words it is character of the people that determines their truthfulness.

I don't - I know that I obfuscate for myself and find myself out later  by understanding a new reality and that the muddying of the waters of clarity is due to my limitations to take on board frightening thoughts; so I am only as capable of congruence as my fear levels dictate.

I can understand that it is the same for others.

I don't try to discern but treat everything as another persons truth in so far as they know it at this moment.

I don't need to know if statements are 'lies' or 'truths' as I wouldn't put my safety into anybody else's version of reality.

Meditation is the key?



Honest to god,i learned how to meditate recently and its one of the best things ive ever done.Only a few days ago,i was depressed and sick of my life.I had been feeling like this for a long time until sombody taught me how to meditate and to my amazement all the negative thoughts i was having have been compressed into possitive thoughts and i dont feel depressed at all now.As with many great things people are reluctant to try it because they believe that there is better ways to solve the problem,the solution to these problems has been around for thousands of years.Take yoga for example allot of people wont try it because it looks a bit silly and they belive they can get a magic pill to do the work for them.I tried yoga and it made my body feel fantastic after only a 30 minute session.Now i know how to make my body feel fantastic and now i know how to open my mind,my mind and body become one.My question is this,does anybody know any advanced levels of meditation? Ive only learned the basic teachings like blocking thoughts and to let them flow around my mind like a river into a puddle.

The more you practise meditation, the more advanced you become in terms of the mental states achievable. The key is to go with the flow, not try and enforce any particular idea, or try to repeat any particular experience. Some discipline is necessary, but mainly the mind does the work itself. The ways and means are inside you, and I suspect they are different for every individual.

Practice makes perfect. :-)

I am really happy for you. Thanks for sharing. Yes meditation and yoga and excellent practices. Keep learning and exploring. Do searches online and read books (books have been my best source of knowledge and inspiration) and u r bound to come across something/someone that will insprie u to learn something new and reach higher. Keep practising. I think it's great to have a simple regimen going. That by itself grounds you so well.

anyway if it is really their,,I would say yes because there are many people around that can do it again...especialy if it will cause your downfall

and if it they..,,i would say it depends on the person's personality..Although you give him/her a second chance,if his/her really intention is still defeat you,,he/she will just repeat what he/she did....but if the person is sincere in making peace to you,,he/she will change and will be your crying shoulder in the future...Just use your instinct if he/she really deserves your forgiveness

"can their betray us again?", did you intend to write, "can they betray us again?"
They may betray us again, in that they can choose to do so.
They can possibly betray us again if the situation and their ability to act so coinside.
Our choice is how we respond and react to the same.
This one will choose loving kindness, generosoity, compassion and caring in mindful awareness.

I , personally, never forget a betray. I always remember the hurt and whatever this person does is under ...suspicion!  On their part, they can definitely betray us - it is something in their personality - but it is up to us to be prepared for a second blow, be careful not to trust them again the way we used to so that we can be protected.

Yes, its possible to be betrayed a few times from the same person. It depends how vulnerable and trustworthy we are ourselves. If we are the kind of person who trusts wholeheartedly and never thinks too bad of people, then we will probably be betrayed a few times. No one can help what their character traits are. Some people are not so forgiving and more wary and may be able to see "through" the betrayal, whereas the majority of us get taken for a fool too often...

To be betrayed, you must give trust.  If you do not give trust, then it is difficult to see how you can be betrayed.



Once a person, or group of people, have betrayed you you cannot or should not allow them the opportunity to re-offend.  Perhaps if they show repentance, some element of reduced trust may be offered.



Eventually they can, if the level of trust is rebuilt.  But I suspect, that the benefits of having trust will be appreciated more than it was before the trust was abused.

So the answer is yes, eventually.  However, people who bear grudges and who do not accept that people have to learn the value of trust, may not be able to re-establish a broken relationship.

It really depends on the seriousness of the betrayal!

And those who have never betrayed us can betray us once.

And once will be enough. A friend said he rated people  at '0' on a scale of 0-10 on trustworthiness on meeting them the first time, I said I give everyone the benefit, and more, of the doubt, giving them a 10, only for nearly all of them to plummet from 10 to 0 with their first shortcoming. With him, people climb the scale gradually, if they do, with time, so he'll have people with all 11 ratings.



My list consists of '0's but for a few exceptions, my '10's are all those I have not yet met.

What if there was no betrayal, and it was only your perception that said it was so, or your borrowed prejudices you have learnt throughout time rearranged so you are the 'victim'. So in that sense I don't think anyone can betray us, however in the more simple context, yes, sure they can! and they will do it again and again! Until we open our eyes, and learn what we are meant to, rather than what we choose to.

Seek therapy or sort out your priorities as to what you want done and then do it. If there are people in your life holding you back, quit associating with them. If it's family, you  can just cut back on how much time you spend with them. If no one's listening, they don't want to hear it, don't care or their mind is made up.

The wonderful thing about this painful experience of life that you sort of are complaining about ...is that you REALIZE it now.

So take that realization and change it in the ways you can. Several folks here have made great suggestions.

IF it would help, realize tha I sense ALL people mature at different speed and in varying ways. The beauty of this, is that this is YOU.
Allow it to happen and give yourself permission to move through your anger. Your anger will only ANCHOR you there ...and yet you need to have the anger a bit. Counceling might help. I have used counceling to move much more quickly through anger about things that upset me.

I find singing or dancing helps me through points of anger. Can't do those things and still be anger for me.

Some suggest that life lives YOU ...not you living life. If that is true, that thought can help get throught the anger of "sense of loss or failure"
It's not something you got to choose. It was established for some reaons you will likely never know. That can let you off the hook too.

Once you establish if YOU really are the one responsible, accept you know the difference now and move on. Why would you want to waste MORE of your life being angry or worrying about what was.
Just don't make the same mistakes, if you see them as that, and move into what makes you happy.

Peacefulness to you as well as Happiness now and into the future.

For me I stopped looking at the small situation I was in and realized that God made me much larger and stronger than my problem.  In this way what evil has happened to me has not affected in the least the way I treat my friends or enemies.  Because I realize also that sometimes it is the common process the parties are in or the nature of the beast we are caught in that causes one to be inhumane to one another.  But that in a different circumstance away from the madness we are able to see each others as human beings.  Those dark situations put us in a state of blindness and perhaps mental or spiritual death.  That when we are free and outside in another atmosphere we see a different part of the person, that we never thought existed.

I hope this helps.  Take care.

Think we've all been there at some time or another.  Instead of looking at the bad things, look at the good.  My partner and I have 'lived on the edge' at times, struggling to make ends meet but we've always pulled through in the end.  The fact is, you've reached the age of 46 and you're still here on good old Mother Earth so you're obviously a survivor.  Have you got any hobbies?  If you don't feel you're good at socialising, try reading or cooking.  You don't have to be rich to enjoy them.  I do online surveys which can bring in a bit of extra cash (or in some cases pay in Amazon vouchers - which is how I can afford books!).  Cooking doesn't have to be expensive either.  I make my own home-made soups and jams (if you go to my profile you'll see links to a couple of articles I've written).

Whenever I'm really down, I look outside and think "well at least I've got a roof over my head and I'm not hungry, unlike so many others in the world" or, if you're near a park or out in the country, try taking a walk out and seeing what beautiful things are out there!!  Believe me, it is possible to drag yourself out of the doldrums.

I read recently that the best thing to do in that kind of situation, is to accept that it is the best possible scenario for you at this moment, it is the best possible thing that could happen to you, and it is the best opportunity to realise something very profound and deep about yourself. Namely that you are not alone and there is no separation between you and your persecuters. You are not your suffering, like you are not your big toe, it is a situation you find yourself in. And it is a situation set up perfectly for you to know yourself beyond what you originally thought was possible.

Hey NOBODY you meet has ever had a 100% easy life. Tho' you seem so absorbed in your own misery that you wouldn't notice another's pain. So try to see how the rest of the world is faring and may be you will feel better about your own situation. And quit brooding... that leads to incurable paranoia. No one's out to get you. So relax!!!!

Existence purely reflects (bijects) existence, which is a part of what we are.  There are additional levels, e.g. "essence."  "The Path of the Higher Self," Mark Prophet, "The Great Divorce," C. S. Lewis, "A Philosophy of Universality," O. M. Aivanhov, and "Expecting Adam," Martha Beck, illustrate this.

okay, true enough (I respect the challenge)...the printing press isn't a discovery - but the use and implications of language is to some extent - it is the extension into the metaphoric from physical abilities that are inherent and had only to be discovered and harnessed

electricity and magnetism and all of those other natural forces are amazing discoveries...but the discovery without the invention of the means to harness said powers is, while still amazing, ultimately without teeth...

evolution is a ground-breaking theory (and one I subscribe too), but it is just a theory that was proposed or hypothesized by Darwin who had discovered certain 'goings-on' in the natural world - he didn't discover it, as a matter of fact, he didn't even prove it (little hard to prove it with a timtable of millions of years)

Guess I'm just partial to books and language...(which is how any of us learn about any of these things in depth or how we are kicking this crap back and forth right now)
so it goes

Well, we didn't discover the wheel, the printing press or the internet, we invented them. And we didn't discover food or sex either. Our pre-human ancestors did.



The discovery of electricity made so many other inventions possible. The theory of evolution is pretty darn important too.  Not practically but philosophically.

There have been three instances in the history of human kind when human mind was demoted, altered, and its fundamental beliefs changed for good, three epoch making times in the history of human civilisation when processes of scientific discovery led up to revolution in thought, i.e. science alone has caused three major shocks to the mind. I call them shocking discoveries. And they are:

The first Shokcing by Nicolaus Copernicus, the first astronomer to formulate a scientifically based heliocentric cosmology that displaced the Earth from the center of the universe. His epochal book, On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres, is often regarded as the starting point of modern astronomy and the defining epiphany that began the Scientific Revolution.

Before this discovery the Earth was believed to be the centre of the universe, thus the term heliocebtric. Galileo Galilei, an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, played a major role in this scientific revolution and through his astronomical observations provide the support for Copernicanism.

The second shock by Charles Darwin an English naturalist, who showed that all species of life have evolved over time from common ancestors through the process he called natural selection a theory that came to become the basis of modern evolutionary theory.



The theory of evolution by Charles Darwin was a massive blow to the the theory of divine creation according to which all thigns were brought to exitence thourgh the act of creation some six thougsand years ago.

And finally the third by Sigmund Freud, an Austrian psychiatrist who founded the psychoanalytic school of psychology, best known for his theories of the unconscious mind as his most significant contribution to thought. Freud called dreams the "royal road to the unconscious", meaning that the logic of dreams is the logic of the unconscious mind.



Before Sigmund Frued it was believed that human mind is based upon reason, but with this new interpretation it proved shocking to know that human mind in its entirety rests upon som dark and unfathosmable ocean called unconscious, the place of wild instanctive foreces and darkes of desires.

Interesting. I cannot see how evolution could produce absolute morals which transcend cultures, but accept that it is one respectable explanation. The other difficulty is that if you accept evolution in Psychology  or Sociology there are no final truths in any meaningful sense.Just survival waste!

We are social because we evolved from primates - that has nothing to do with human rights per se. It is impossible that there are Homo sapiens anywhere else in the universe - our genes are a product of our unique biological evolution.



62,040,610 Idiots



As for a final truth: as I offer, we are granted rights because we are capable of moral choice and that imparts an absolute value to us that is found no place else in nature.

morality is quality is value - i assert that it is an absolute morality that produces evolution not the other way around. definitions are a reaction to quality rather than quality being a propery of that defined.

I would say that in the absence of humans, human rights cannot exist.  So whether they are a purely human construct will depend on your view of humans:  do we have a solely material existence, or do we also have an immaterial immortal soul?

If we are purely material, then it seems to me that human rights are a construct of our material brains.  If we have a separate human soul, then human rights might exist as an eternal ideal regardless of whether they are proclaimed by our physical selves.

For me, it is enough to say that since humans have the capacity for moral choice, we have intrinsic moral value, and, therefore, are deserving of human rights.  It is not necessary that human rights are preexisting, nor are they arbitrary.

Those are some heavy questions and I am trying to see the relation between each of them.

People's dreams cannot be measured by size, nor by time, because the dream world is a world which is not governed by these elements. It often shows us from an inkling to a direct idea, a little of what may be going on inside of ourselves, in our psyches.

The true fundamental of living? I guess one would have to say that certain have classified all things into animal, vegetable or mineral, and since humans fall into the first on the list, a great deal of what is common to us, is common to other members of this group, the main difference being in the area of reason. Spirituality explains this as the ability to reason, to having a conscience which allows us to reflect upon the reasons why... So the fundamental of living would therefore be that we realize we are going to stop living some day, which is what we see happening in others, all forms of life, which makes life become an absurdity if the entire life process would stop at the point of death. This is why, I think, that people aspire to an afterlife, because the real nature of mankind, is not limited to the fleshly body.

As for free will, so many people have not thought this out, that they are not even able to use theirs... I would go so far as to say the majority. Many just "follow." Interesting you would mention obedience to laws. If first individuals would learn the laws of nature, there would be much less need for restrictive laws, because people would do what is good, naturally, or better said, do what is natural.



Is this world meant for the poor? Which part of this world are you referring to? the one that power-hungry people created and imposed on others? It is possible theoretically that there be no poor, but it is the system that mankind has developed, for whatever reason, which makes people poor. But even among the poor, there are many who are rich in spirit.

True judgement? Hmmmm...  everything is relative, depends on motivation, human judges may have difficulty doing a good job, for some of us, only a divine being can be the judge, now it is the responsability of each individual to investigate and reach knowledge of what is expected of us... look at examples around you... and please don't be too hard on yourself. Better days are coming.

One that can be argued using reason alone without recourse to data or experience.

The usual example in many textbook is a variant of "all bachelors are unmarried".  Since a bachelor by definition is unmarried, you need to rely on no data or empirical experience to say all of them are.

Like the answer to a posteriori I just posted, "a priori" has the word "prior" in. Meaning "before". To remember this just think that homework has to be done prior to the lesson - before the lesson. Therefore, a priori can be remembered as before experience.

a priori's require nothing but intuition to know them



time and space are a priori - it is not present in the sensory data you recieve you have to intuit it if you wish to know about it.



without a prior concepts to filter our sensory data the world would appear to be a confusing mishmash of colours and lines

It is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment Hebrews 9:27
Some of you guys are going to get a nasty wake up call. 
Basically when we die we go to either paradise (a park) or hades (abode of the dead).
When Jesus Christ returns there will be a judgment. Depending on how we have responded to His claims, we will then find ourselves in hell or heaven, forever, use this life to prepare for the right place.

heaven, briefly, then we get a fantabulous new body when Christ returns.
this could seem instantaneous, like when you're unconscious and you aren't aware of time passing. But it might not. Either way there's no saying when Christ will return, he said soon but then what's soon for an infinite being? I reckon it could be when the sun explodes if we don't destroy the planet before hand.



I think anyone who doesn't accept Christ into their life when confronted with the truth at this point deserves what's coming to them, which could just be a kind of void, or a different afterlife (but not with God). An alternate theory is that anyone who hates God that much would hate heaven, and therefore heaven would be hell.

Wow.... so many people.  We've all heard of the bright light at the end of the tunnel, seen by so many before being turned back.  "Go back my son, this is not your time!"  There are many books available outlining our transition to the 'other' realm.  How can anybody possibly believe that 'this' is it?  'This' is all we have?



Having died and seen what awaits, far too many have chosen to report their findings in books for the afterlife to be simply discarded as the majority appear to do.  There are too many events indicating that body and spirit are not one to believe that physical death also means spiritual death.  In fact, it is easy to conclude that the spirit lives without ever ending.

This is a very complex issues for which 1000 pages wouldn't be enough to tell you what I know.  You'll have to buy books I'm afraid.
Robert Newton is a good author on this subject.  Danian Brinkley's book is also good.  The religious texts are very good for offering advice and guidance, but for the love of everything: that's all!

Apparently, I'm the only one qualified to answer this question with any authority having experienced an NDE. Yes, I saw the dark tunnel and bright light and was told to return. However, the uniformity of the experience in others, points not to a confirmation of religious belief but a confirmation of how we experience death and the resultant religious belief thereafter.



The dying brain is just now being studied and so far it indicates that what we experience depends on how blood and oxygen leave our brain. If the Cerebral Cortex goes first, things get interesting. All our memories flood out and we begin to relive our life. As death progresses, we see the tunnel, the light and a warm cozy feeling takes over as other parts of the brain begins to die.

If the medulla goes first, we experience instant blackness and our brain dies with no sensation. It is interesting to note that this is in the kill zone of an animal attack. Instant, painless death. Ain't Nature wonderful and even merciful in death?

I don't believe that we go to heaven or hell, but I do believe we carry on after we die. I believe in the paranormal and spirits. When we die our souls are simply parted from  from our physical bodies. I do believe in reincarnation-these are the souls that decide they want to return into a physical body, then there are others that just want to stay in the form of a spirit on the surface of the earth because either they are too scared to move on from there or just want to stay and watch loved ones, and then there are other souls that sink down into the earth to join lots of other souls and become the earths energy.

In the link below I posed my "afterlife" differently by common sense reasoning how that nature shows man that life can exist even if one species dies out while another one comes into existence.



In terms of genetics we are preservation of who are ancestors are.  And if we have children they inherit the genetic material that comes from both their parents.



In terms of the essence of mind and thought we can last forever.  Just as surely as our words recorded in ancient time and are repeated in this time.  \They seem alive.

Personally I do believe in life after death according to the way the Bible teaches it.

It has evolved from text messaging, but on the internet you don't have a limited amount of characters to use so I really don't understand why people have to use abbreviations.  Laziness I think.  I have seen college applications written in "txt spk" and if I was a teacher grading some work that was written in "txt spk" I would throw it in the bin.

Been complaining about it myself.  And what "Totodile" says is nonsense, One letter per word is not much 'type saving' (a new phrase!).  If you type like my secretary/wife at 60 words per minute, you don't need silly shortcuts. Because (coz) I think (fink) I does (duz) not type like that.  When the computer age started in 1983, it was understandable, there was not enough space. Now it is just lazyness and kids that can't spell. It hides their ignorance.

"Have we finally lost the English language ?"

The English language is constantly evolving.  You used the expression "kid" to describe a child, not so long ago people would be assuming that you meant a young goat.

The purpose here is to interact with people, people simple, common, special, known, unknown, all sort, to communicate with them all freely, openly and instantaneously, or to get to the information we need fast. The state therefore is that of a light dream where we know many things could happen merely by the press of our fingertips.



The English we encounter here therefore is not the English of formal letters and printed books, it is in a state of virtual projection, projection to cast an image or avatar, and then, to create a friendly, and informal atmosphere around it. I think we think we could afford to overlook rules and decorum that we normally observe writing form letters. This in my view is the fact that the more we are able to twist the rules of spelling the more exciting our impression is likely to be - this however is by no means a rule of thumb.



But we must realise that this is the for the first time that we have learnt to read the written word electronically, without the use of solid state medium like paper or wood. And this is the first time that we have been able to get interactive with a great number of people who we do no know as who they really are.



Then there is the nature of language to consider: as a dynamic thing, much like a living organism that grows in time and responds to changes in its environment. There is no doubt that the impact of technological revolution is huge on the way we use English language.



However, there is no doubt that the certain misuse does look unsightly, i.e. when rule of trashed for some shallow purposes, as in chat houses. I personal would not stand there long if I realise that I have to use the same banal contortions, compressions, additions and obliterations. I never like to see a word illspelled

You are preaching to the converted, my friend. I spend a lot of time on the poetry site and frequently see offerings in some abominable 'Txt Speak' patois. It really, really jars.

I recently had a huge, almost coming-to-blows-huge, argument with a teacher who maintained that the meaning of a child's writing was the important thing and not the grammar/punctuation/spelling. I replied that without the correct spelling/punctuation/grammar the meaning was lost. Just ask the boy who went for a wee in the Laddies!

I also despise the SpellThick function as it presupposes I am American and/or wish to spell everything in the American idiom.

I feel better for that!

Humans live because if you take a big pool of elements and heat them up (simulating how the earth was when it first formed 4.5 billion years ago), the elements bind together in random ways and eventually over many random occurrences will form what is called a replicator. This is a molecule that creates copies of itself (imagine a cookie cutter (replicator) floating around and creating impressions of itself when it bumps into some dough (primordial soup)). Different replicators form and "compete" for molecules to replicate with. This competition causes evolution, with the replicators increasing in complexity to beat out other replicators. Human exist because we are the latest model of weapon in the arms race of evolution. We are a shell built around a replicator (DNA) with the purpose of creating copies of our replicators through sex. So go find a sex partner, get it on, and enjoy that sweet sense of purpose, knowing that youre a slave to microscopic chains of nucleotides.

if your talking in terms of philosophy. a posteriori knowledge is knowledge from experience so if you apply it to arguments, you are arguing about experiences or you are using your own experience as reasons to argue.

The above poster is correct but another way to look at it is a priori is something that requires no external input.  An a priori assumption would be "all bachelors lack wives".



You don't need to search for data on number of bachelors and number of them with wives, because by definition a bachelor has no wife.  This question can be answered by reason alone with no data.

On the other hane "40% of bachelors over 25 were once married" is a posteriori whether you have expereince of being a married person or even a bachelor yourself.  The answer comes from experience, sure, but to you it comes in the form of data.

By the way I have no idea what the number is.  I made up the 40% entirely as an example.

an a posteriori argument is an argument which is based upon someone's experience of the outside world (through the five senses). it is a way of classifying an argument according to what type of justification it employs.



so an example of a posteriori knowledge would be all goldfish are gold, for instance. you had to get up and go outta your house and look at some goldfish to make that argument.



now just to be clear, a priori knowledge would be something like "2 + 3 = 5" or "all bachelors are unmarried". you didnt have to experience these at all in order to come to a justified conclusion. you can just sit in your house and come to those conclusions. they are a priori. (prior to experience)

If u are talking about organising your own party (which includes guests)......... Start by making a guest list. Then you need to decide if you want a theme or not? formal or casual? nibblies or bbq or both? house or hire a venue? music? It's always best to write out a list of all the things you need to do and buy between now and the party. I always organise my own birthday party every single year. I even make my own cake.I think it is better to organise it yourself, that way you get exactly what you want. Since the party is for yourself, why not make it an event YOU will remember.

Depends on the situation and what would classify as "knowledge." For the most part, denying information is worse. I can't think of any example where I have had "knowledge forced on me" where I thought it was negative. But I have had knowledge denied to me many times and it is almost always negative. Explain your views.

Yes in some contexts. If you deny giving someone life saving knowledge clearly you have committed a wrong. But imagine giving a widow at the end of life the knowledge that her late husband committed adultery. What good have you done? If you're giving information just to prove your superior understanding over another when you know the information is emotionally & personally harmful it is wrong.  This principle, of course, does not apply in the arena of ideas. Someone may find the theory of evolution emotionally upsetting but their emotions are not justification for not discussing it. The only knowledge that is bad to give someone is information that would personally harm them either emotionally or otherwise. Additionally it would be wrong to pass on information about another if it would harm them unless you're trying to stop them from committing harm. Example: Telling a little child that Santa Claus doesn't exist just for the sake that you feel superior. Outing someone as gay if they are not out. Telling a nazis in world war 2 were a jew is hiding. The morality of telling or giving information to another always is decided by context.

Theatre, Theatre and... let me think.... oh yes, theatre!!! that's what makes me very very happy! 
Or... when I feel blue... I use to sing a song, maybe you know it...

"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens 
Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens 
Brown paper packages tied up with string, 
These are a few of my favorite things.



Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple strudel, 
Door bells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles 
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings, 
These are a few of my favorite things.



Girls in white dresses and blue satin sashes, 
Snow-flakes that stay on my nose and eye-lashes, 
Silver white win-ters that melt into spring, 
These are a few of my favorite things,



When the dog bites, 
When the bee stings, 
When I'm feeling sad, 
I simply remember my favorite things, 
And then I don't feel, so bad."

I shout at my husband a lot when we argue and I really should learn to stop it. Its hard though. 
I think it depends on the situation though, someone may be oblivious to what you say unless you shock them by shouting at them - a friend or relative perhaps - someone who is not used to you shouting at them. Still I don't really think that this would solve anything but perhaps lead to an end to it until people have calmed down enough to talk.
In a relationship I think shouting leads to nothing but more resentment. I know my husband never listens to what I', trying to say once I raise my voice. The only times we have got anywhere towards working things out is when we are both calm and open enough to look at things objectively - shouting is about as subjective as you can get!
So to answer your question, no I don't think shouting can solve arguments.

Well depends some people are angry and need to express that, get there emotions out and that really helps. Just remember don’t shout back, don’t tell the person to stop shouting as this can infuriate them further. There obviously angry or hurt about something in the first place and wish to resolve it. If you can keep a clear head and speak back to them quietly it should soon dissipate and then they’ll see that you’re not being confrontational and simmer down. The person who was shouting will listen to the voice of reason after in there head eventually.

Shouting can release tension from both people involved in the argument and it can eventually burn both people out and the argument could end.



But in general it definitely fuels the argument and for some people if they have been holding A lot back and stuff from the past comes forth during the shouting match it could get REALLY bad! Your body gets overwhelmed with emotion and has to be released then it can possibly get physical...they could be a walking time bomb.

If you are going to should at someone make sure you know what their limmitations are and also what you're limmitations are as well.

Some people are much harder at hearing a regular tone so shouting sometimes really work, but mostly not.



Because have you ever heard someone say turned that music down I can't hear it or the T.V. Well the louder your voice the harder it's to actually hear and people tune you out but there are those folks who need a shout like STOP, NO, and BE QUIET.  Say these words in a normal tone most times and see the results.

Hi Matthew,

Yes and no & the reasoning:
Yes- I think shouting can solve arguments--because it will release the frustration your feeling-not to mention it's good for blood pressure (especially high blood pressure).



No-arguments also fuel the fire (of an argument-weather or not it gets solved is totally another matter, you may stay mad for sometime this being not good for any kind a relationship or person you are arguing with. Have a good night. :0)
<additional details>: take 3 deep breathes before the argument that way you have time to think if an argument is even necessary.

It certainly doesn't solve anything.  It can only lead to more dissent which in turn fuels more arguing, more shouting, more hurt feelings.  Like a cat chasing its tail, it's never ending.

read Atlas Shrugged, it has made all the difference.  I guess you have to be ready for that.  I was ready at a certain point to fix what was broken about my personal philosophy. I was taught wrong.  And never questioned it until my life was not working out as it should have.  Now that everything is integrated, things work out as planned most of the time!  That is really good!

If by your definition it were true, fear can be abolished if someone could explain what happens (if anything) afer death.

I liken the explanation to a holistic approach where I return to dust and continue Earth's life cycle. In that sense, I remain fearless. Occasionally I'm afraid but understand that's when my mind lapses into a state of jahiliyya (I could use Eastern terms for descriptive purposes too, right?). From there, I build up my personal philosophies on life over again and it comes up stronger; what doesn't kill you make you stronger right?

Fear is undoubtedly based upon ignorance. Faith in life in others in the world instils courage, fortitude and moral fibre. Death is inevitable, life brings trials and tribulations, as the sun sets and the moon arises, impermanence and transience is the nature of life. So we look upon life as a transitory journey of many paths to two extremes and ends. Having options and choice is gained by awareness and understanding, without such life becomes a thing of dread, hate and uncertainty.

Yes. Ignorance of our real self. If we fully realised and accepted that we are the eternal spirit that is animating this temporary material body which we are encaged in. Then there would be no fear. We would realise that the spirit self, us, is eternal and can never die, can not be burned, nor dried, moistened by water, withered by the wind, cut to pieces by any weapon, is eternal, ever-existing, undying, primeval and eternally the same.
Due to ignorance of the truth about ourselves, we fear so many things that can never even touch the eternal spirit. 
This ignorance is the root cause of our suffering. Due to that ignorance, we are accepting the material body to be the self and therefore are constantly trying in so many ways to become free from suffering and distress, or to try to satisfy the senses of this temporary material body without giving any thought or attention to the spirit self within. Therefore causing frustration and further desires. 
We have to look to the future and act in such a way as to put an end to the repeated cycle of birth and death in this material world. Otherwise we will go on suffering life after life due to ignorance of the real self.
Is it worth the price you pay, that fleeting moments gain, which in another day will only bring you pain. Are you wandering across the earth with no thought of times to come, have you thought of your next birth and all the things you've done?
Take care. Best wishes.

Our ignorance is unable to make us afraid if we are not made aware of it, as I think it would take slightly more than all that we know for us to realize that we are ignorant, or we are in ignorance, but once aware of our ignorance, our knowledge increases, however sometimes merely by means of fear.



What makes us really afraid I think is the awareness that there is some great knowledge that we do not posses. We feel petrified as we think and wonder what things we might not be seeing, or what sights we might be missing along our journey though life, in a out of its various situations, what good and what bad we might not be able realize. We might be rushing along like a blind person, we think.



Now, this is in common experience that when our rivals in thoughts and ideals come up with better arguments, stronger arguments, views and opinions more mature realistic than ours we feel strange. Now, I could not say as, exactly what I mean by strange as I think the feelings would highly subjective in nature and therefore dependant upon their people.



Than if I feel challenged, annoyed, or generally afraid under such situations then that does not mean I have been made afraid of my ignorance, as ignorance was already there, it is just that it never come to light until I met my opponent. I believe fear would come from my realization of how little I know in comparison with my foe, from the realization of my weakness, or from feeling intellectually, or simply argumentatively, inferior.



And this is not all, as I could see that my rival has a better point, his knowledge is greater than mine, but would I find it easy to accept? Would I be able to happily accept that a greater knowledge is at the heart of what I am not? This is the question that unmasking of which puts us in fear.

Do you think it's amazing the number of factors that are essential for life to exist?



Water has many properties that makes it an ideal and perhaps an essential substance to allow for life. Water is the only known non-metallic substance to expand when it freezes, making ice less dense than liquid water. This means water bodies freeze from top to bottom, preventing them from freezing over. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the cellular solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many metabolic processes, acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. Water is also central to photosynthesis and respiration. The conditions which allow the three phases of water to be present here simultaneously, would be far less likely to exist if the Earth were 5% closer or further from the sun than its current orbit; and the water cycle would not be possible.
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...
http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/life.html#co...
The high specific heat and latent heats are also crucial.
The Moon also plays an important role for life on Earth, by stabilising the precession of the Earth's axis. Without the moon there would be an ice age and a heat death too often to allow life. The size of the Earth itself, which determines the surface gravity, and its rotation period and magnetic field strength are such that they allow perfect meteorological conditions for life.
The composition of the early Earth's atmosphere allowed the particular kinds of life forms to develop, that would photosynthesise to produce enough oxygen (again, because of the particular atmospheric composition) for multicellular life. The current Earth's atmosphere protects living organisms from ultraviolet rays and is dense enough to allow complex life.
The tectonic activity of the Earth provides a supply of carbon dioxide through volcanic eruptions and metamorphism of rocks that release gases into the atmosphere. This replaces that amount removed by the weathering of silicate rock by carbonic acid (CO2 and rain water); which eventually form marine carbonate sediment. This helps maintain the Global temperature. If plate tectonics were to cease, then erosion would, eventually, abrade down the mountains. Sediments removed by erosion, carried into the oceans by rivers and streams would eventually lead to a rise in sea level and a global ocean would cover the Earth completely.



</question>



<additional details>



There is thought to be a Galactic Habitable Zone in spiral galaxies, in the shape of an annular ring, within which life can exist. It is determined by the region in which abundance of heavy metals (for nuclear fission at the planet core) can allow the creation of terrestrial planets with tectonic activity.



There's no suggestion of the existence of God in my question. I meant to ask .... for life to have developed.

If you're saying that the forms of life that can tolerate the conditions of the earth would likely have a difficult time surviving in other conditions, I agree...but amazing? No, it's just the sort of prediction you would make.



Fish wouldn't be found on planet without open sources of water, whales wouldn't be found without oceans, and giraffes wouldn't found on a planet with high gravity. All the fish, whales, and giraffes on "wrong" planets wouldn't survive and pass on their destructive genes to offspring, effectively going extinct.

Not particularly amazing at all. Obviously all those factors are important to life developing the way it has here on earth, but on other worlds it's entirely possible self replicating organisms have arisen to suit their particular environments.

It is fascinating to examine how the conditions for life came to be. But, bear in mind one of the laws of Natural Philosophy: That which can be, must be.



Each and everything that you cited is because it can be. It is the survival of events that causes things to "progress" from one circumstance to another. When they all come together, life is born. Just another "progression" in the chain of circumstance. Now life too, becomes a factor in the progression of events.



Note: progress or progression is in the eye of the beholder. All things progress in time, but not necessarily in state. You have devolution as well as evolution.

The amazement might be only for the preliminary stages, as the better we know the better we realise that there is more to be explored and learnt. There might never be an end to what we could explore and learn but at the end of each stage there is a familiarity to be had.

In general life is perfectly logically in place in relation with the rest of the animals, plants, and the environment. Therefore there is no greater surprise in the way life is than in the way it has come to be, it reason to be. The one who would contemplate life’s beginning, its possible end, and its purpose would be able to stand aloof and observe things form beyond their natural folds, the one who would seek to know things beyond limits of time and space.

I say amazement might only be the preliminary effect of knowing as I am sure that there is more to life then amazement. When for instance I see a brick I can understand fairly accurately how it might have been made, i.e. there was a mould into which mortar was poured and let to solidify in time.



However, if I have had no idea as what a mould is then even the simplest cubical form of a brick would have a caused amazement, but since I know the fundamental knowledge about the brick I can now ask future questions, as for instance what use that brick could be for me.



The amazing nature is the amazing mould of a wonderful life, but who poured the stuff of life into moulds of nature and for what purpose is a questions that remains to be answered, as it always has.

Hi dear beholder

It is an affair of of the heart, it is loyal in relationships, and does not seek it's own vices.



It does not manipulate circumstances to the detriment of others. It gives  comfort to others, but does not stifle or suffocate emotions.

Is willing to listen. Does not cast judgement readily, indeed is wise in assessment in all subjects, to the point of re-feral to those who could help in discretion. For none of us know it all, because of our humanity
often gets in the way.

What is the definition of love,.Surely love for one another with added respect not seeking it's own at anothers expense;

Real love is work, hard work to sustain. It is rarely romantic or passionate when it is set in stone. To find true love is rare not because of singing birds, church bells, or meeting "the one" but because for someone to truly love another he/she must first really know himself/be self aware (which probably doesn't happen until adulthood), must love himself (a lot of people don't get here either), there must be overwhelming trust in the relationship (yep...most don't get this), and both people in love must be able to understand that love is not an emotion, it is a will, a choice, and when it is real, it becomes simple and banal...it becomes a fact.

I'm not saying that when I was totally head over heels at sixteen it didn't feel like love, and maybe for the time it was, but only now I know it wasn't real, wasn't lasting, was not "love" as I know it today. As I've grown I've learned that romance and emotion has little to do with love, it sounds harsh, but once you get past the bull****, you realize that love that just is, is the greatest form of love possible.

"For one human being to love another; that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation." Rainer Maria Rilke

That's only one way the material way it has no value beyond your mortal existence which is a waste if you don't survive to life eternal.



The possession of personality identifies man as a spiritual being since the unity of selfhood and the self-consciousness of personality are endowments of the supermaterial world. The very fact that a mortal materialist can deny the existence of supermaterial realities in and of itself demonstrates the presence, and indicates the working, of spirit synthesis and cosmic consciousness in his human mind.

All mortal concepts of reality are based on the assumption of the actuality of human personality; all concepts of superhuman realities are based on the experience of the human personality with and in the cosmic realities of certain associated spiritual entities and divine personalities. Everything nonspiritual in human experience, excepting personality, is a means to an end. Every true relationship of mortal man with other persons--human or divine--is an end in itself. And such fellowship with the personality of Deity is the eternal goal of universe ascension.

I would tell you that you independently need to be able to supply yourself with adequate food, shelter, and clothing.  But having a great life takes more than having lots of stuff or even lots of excitement.
Many people find that leading a useful, productive life, helping others, generally "doing the right thing" is what's most satisfying in life.  Good luck, just watch out for the mass consumerism stuff.

We are all subject to the discipline of making a living. There's not any choice about that.  You  won't be happy if you fail at taking care of yourself.  But, you won't be happy in a  "great job" unless you love your work and get along with the people you work with.

Put your passion first and the size of your paycheck second.  A nice house is a nice house.  Things won't make you happy.

That's right you cannot serve two masters at once. So ... flip a coin.
It is well known that before the coin lands you will know what you want by the hope of what turns up. If you do this and know what side you want to see land? Don't even bother looking at the coin, just go do what you were hoping for in the heads or the tails of the flip.

You see, this is the problem: one cannot have it both ways; one must make choices and learn to live with decisions one makes along the way. This has been my problem too. I too could not make up my mind. I could not see as how, or for what good reason, any of the many equally good things I could be sacrificed for the sake of only one. What if that one turn out to be wrong things?

If you had not had quite a few good things already on your mind and asked me the same question, I would have asked you to go right ahead, and do just that. This nevertheless is a virtue to have something in mind, but this is just the beginning, as things must follow upon things I life.

The reason often is that when we believe we have many option is when we do not have any option. This is confusing … or let me explain: If I mange to convince myself that I have too many things to choose from then I am more likely to be content with such ‘empowering’ belief, as long as I think that I have power to choose but do not choose I feel I am up to few things, which is a from of self-deception.



The fact is the when a ball starts to roll then it can follow only line of motion, however, when it was standing still the possibilities for it to roll along a huge number of lines were there. The best way to make up you mind there is to get up start doing something. If you things you could ‘get a great job’ then time to put this theory to practice is now.



The life that you live sitting upon options is a life of illusion, which eventually would come to nothing. To make like whatever life could be for someone, one must start rolling and avoid feeling great with what merely be optional in the mind.

I once wanted the other life. The one that I was accustom to, then I got married to the RedHead. (Hey, I was drunk okay) Not really. LOL. She got to see what kind of life I had. I think it kinds scared her. Nothing illegal. Just daring and exciting and dangerous as hell. Then I saw that it was not a life for her so I backed away and stopped doing what I had done for so long.
My life today is boring as hell, and not much fame and very little money. Not that the other way of life would have lead to riches and fame. Unless I got really good. But at least I would feel my heart beating everyday.

i am very confused by your question i just dont understand the wording but i will answer it as i see it. just because you are an authority doesnt mean you dont have to follow the rules that are set infact youshould follow them even better because the only reason you should be put as an authority over such things is because you are better at it so you can help make others better at it. i think the only laws that should be set are laws or morality (right word?) we should all behave morally and we wouldnt have a problem but the problem is everyone has different morals and soem do not agree with others so we take the majority and make everyone else live byt them. an authority figure should most definitely behave morally if not more morally than a non authority figure otherwise what gives them the authority to tell u what to do if they cant even follow the rules.

An authority can be seen as " internal", like ones conscience.

Yes, it is possible to behave morally, especially if the only authority one has to answer to is ones own conscience.
When one attempts to "rule over" the behavior of another by asserting laws and such, the ruler starts to feel more powerful than the subjects.
The ruler finds it difficult to behave morally, as Power corrupts.

Its all about evolution.
Each individual evolve. Some faster and become leaders. Or advanced authorities who create rules. Some evolve "further" /in any direction/ and breaking the rules in the name of creating new rules. Morality is very flexible. What was moral 100 years ago is in some cultures immoral today. 
To answer your question, civilisation /some individual members of the culture/ does its best to cut "tall poppies" /requires authorities to comply/ but these /authorities/ are evolving further to be one step ahead of the mob. 
What looks like breaking the rules, is in fact evolution.

I have two passions, people and ideas. I believe it is important to live for the world and as my wise girlfriend once added remember I am also a part of the world. I believe to help people and change their mentality such that they will want to help others is the greatest good perhaps, because if we can do that then all the others changes will follow. Ideas I love as a personal thing. To think is to be in control, to take into account there world around you and inside you. It is using yourself and building yourself to greatest point such that you can give yourself even more. Fill your potential so you have the most to give. 
The way I try to help people is through two things, teaching and entertaining.

Life is my passion. interacting with others, trying to help when I can, relationships. Its all a part of living.Dogs, books and music, are my passions too.A song can lift me up when I am down and a song can make me cry.Books take me into other people's worlds, I can lose myself in a good book.Dogs teach me how to love unconditionally. Just to accept people just the way they are.I wouldn't know how to be without a dog in my life.
 My greatest passion is my relationship with my hubby. He is a gift that i will always love with Passion, and then my boys and their familys.

Is this true or do you believe to see Beauty ?



in others you have to see it in yourself first?(and or to see beatuy in urself it comes easy to see it in others)

I was in the supermarket sunday and I saw sooo many beautiful ppl it was crazy,weird I don't know they seem to all have a glow to them, and it wasn't cause they was coming from church(I don't think so)

Anyway I went shopping yesterday and ppl was really looking at me and seeing my beauty (as I was seeing it in other ppl the other day) Im talking about like whoa, some girl was trying to give me a compliment on my eyes and such, but got tongue tied and just was like your pretty.

I even seen a couple of girls that was pretty but they gave me funny look like she think she's cute and or what I had on (designer from top to bottom) dont think that had much to do with it.

I get my fair share of compliments but yesterday I dont know what was ppl seeing, some complimented my smile,face,cloBeautiful
Do anybody know what it could of been?? and why was everybody beatiful out sunday at the grocery store(lol)?? You would of thought they was hosting the next episode of ANTM.

in my opinion, one must believe one thing is beautiful to see it as is.
everyone says some person is beautiful but to one, all that passes across his mind is the bad experience he had with that beautiful person. so everytime he sees that person, he doesn't see beauty but ugliness prevails in the picture right away.

It like a major theme in Plato's Republic that we should see the true form of things such as getting the true essence of something. It is based upon three factors
What is
What is not 
and one's opinion
clearly most people only see the physical characteristics that define beauty..... others see it in characteristics. But instead of characterizing something as beautiful I'll ask you to define the true meaning of Beauty.

How can I plan out my actions so that they will not fail(like Light from Death Note/like hitmen do)?



What I mean is: Planning out things so carefully and the plan is constructed so brilliantly that it cannot fail, there are no flaws to it.

Like Light/L/Near from Death Note does, or like Hitmen do to guarantee a perfect assination.

How can I become more smart to do this?

The best thing would to perhaps be flexible that way no matter what happens it always "goes according to plan".

You cannot plan for everything you see. You cannot account for every wind current, and ESPECIALLY for humans, we are unpredictable sometimes.

As for how to become more like this... stop watching TV and taking so much from it. It's made up, the creators MAKE it go according to plan because they can control everything in the book/tv/movie/game/whatever. If you could do this in "reality" then it would be easy but you can't so it's not "easy"

Sorry, I don't think reality works like this! You have been watching that killer with the bad haircut in No Country for Old Men!
I believe in Karma or natural justice. Read Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment to see what happens when a student murders and old woman for her money and gets away with it. It talks about his guilty feelings and how in the end he was overcome - not by the police or her relatives - but by himself.

You're bound to fail in this.  Doing things so perfectly only happens in these stories because the whole idea is fiction.  There are other ways to ensure success though; any really smart person would only find a better way to adapt to the new situation, or simply take what he has at hand.  People like Caesar or Augustus.

Well for practical purposes I'd say what you have to do is look at various ways of planing, different processes, try to take all the best aspects from them and develop the perfect process. That way you don't need to be "smart" every time you just need to be able to fill in the blanks.
In philosophically terms I'd recommend the exact opposite. Blast the possibilities wide open, so that no matter what happens you are satisfied. Make your goal to simply try and you're fine from the start. Exactitude is a difficult thing to maintain whereas with complete and total ambiguity you can't go wrong.

Your dad's not right at all but he's probably thinking something else what he couldn't describe to you! Perhaps the baby-goat would be accustomed with the dog & that's behavior in the long run staying close & close---getting the same treatment from your family---thus the goat ultimately think that 'goat & dog' are probably same. 'Thinking' is one thing & 'Being' is different, got it?

For most part i think he is. When an animal grows up with another animal instead of just getting thrown into a situation when its older and already has adopted its character they might not get along. But i'm sure if the goat is a baby, it should be fine. I don't know if goats even really get mean and go on rampages anyways lol.

I see the colour of love being very rosy, red. Not to be cliche but, i see it  as a warm, rosy,red. When you feel like your in love or if you've ever been in love, that would be the feeling you'd get. a very warm feeling.

Red, but it has to be the right red, if its a deep red then that's love, passion, lust and romance. 
Where as the type of red that would be anger would be an orangey red or a brighter red, the reason behind this is because that type or red links in with fire- fire has a rage.

Outlaw Religion! Then Outlaw money! Very simplistic I know and completely unrealistic but think about this.

Religion has caused more death and destruction over the last two thousand years or more than any gun toting President ever could.

If religion could be wiped off the face of the earth think of the harmony. No Arab, Jewish or Christian faiths to attack each other or look to dominate the world.

Money and Greed go hand in hand with power. The more you have of the first the more you want of the second.

Absolutely no hope of either ever disappearing so I think the future is destined to follow the past and fighting over whose God is the only one will continue for ever more.

Is it ethical to force people to be smarter?



Hypothetical situation: You are given a vile with a highly contagious virus that increases that will increase the average infected person's IQ by 20 points. However the virus will die in vile within minutes if you don't infect yourself and in turn everyone on Earth. Would you do it?

Do you have the right to force intelligence on others or is it better to keep the status quo? What if the virus caused the infected to be violently sick and though not technically fatal will most likely kill many who are already weak?

Sorry for that typo



*In response to laxy bum*
Actually viruses have plaid a large part in the evolution of man and might have contributed to some of our more important characteristics. For example, a virus may have caused a mutation that lessens the prominence of our ancestors lessening the strength of their bite. This may seem to be disadvantagious but without the large jaw muscles our ancestors were allowed to develop larger brains and not require our skulls to fuse until full adulthood allowing us to gain brain mass and learn for longer periods or our lives.

Evolution is not set in stone therefore there is nothing to interfere with.

Value is pretty subjective.  YOU may think being smarter is a good thing, but other people may not agree with you.

This becomes clear if you think of other kinds of hypothetical viruses.  Vegans might think it grand to prevent everyone on the Earth from eating meat, theists might hope to force everyone to be faithful, and cat-fanciers might approve of everyone growing whiskers, but it probably goes without saying that most of everyone else would find the act tyrannical and heinous.

Why, then, is it any LESS heinous to force people to do or have whatever it is that you think is good?  That answer is that it's not.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



I guess a better question would be "would the world really be a better place if everyone was smart"? I think so. You should try reading the Ender's Game book series, the last book Children of the Mind has just such a virus in its plot and is where I go the idea for this very question.

20 points- that`s not that much to be worth it. Besides, the IQ measures a very specific kind of intelligence, that has nothing to do with social, emotional intelligence or an overall mind curiosity for example- things that really matter. LSD will increase your intelligence in some ways, but I would never force it on anyone.

any type of an advancement via viral infection or anything else is unnatural and therefore is a hindrance to the natural biological evolution of man.  Anything that is contagious, even if it is intelligence, is immoral to infect others with if they are not willing participants.  Furthermore, people are smart or dumb for a reason, all should be allowed to progress through life in their natural state.

What makes me happy and what makes you happy are two entirely diffrent things. I would say the only 'secret' is to make sure you are following a path that causes you satisfation. The second it doesn't, then you aren't happy, work to get back without sacraficing progress or move forward.

I, too would say find a way to not have to strong of attachments to things, preferences, or your path you expect to get out of life.
Just be happy with you and what you have.  Don't over indulge, but don't deprive yourself of things.  Its the middle path.

Doing what you are interested in - pursuing you passion, that deep burning excitement about something, which some people didn't discover yet, maybe... 
For me that is Cosmology, Physics, Particle Physics, Astrophysics, Theoretical physics. You get it. Science is amazing, but physics is heavenly, it's the meaning of life. To get to know the world, how it works and why it's the way it is. Why I am here, how come I got here. Science is the most exciting thing ever, and weirdest and above all it's the closest humanity can get to truth!!

I haven’t met one such as I, to date, don’t know anyone who is like me, some have some traits, attributes, persona, in times gone by I had thought God hated me so he didn’t create another like me, I don’t resemble anyone in my family, my offspring have little or nothing in common, I am a sole entity.

Meeting someone who is an exact mirror image, nay veritable replica of oneself is heavenly if you have only love and adoration for the mirror, hell if you don’t.

It depends on how you look at it.

It does force you to see who you are but you have the choice to hate your partner or hate yourself. Some people would leave their partner while others just fix what's really wrong with themselves and are grateful that their partner was there to show them their true personality.

Assuming I know they are me, I think it would drive me crazy. I wouldn't be able to ask them for advice because they would just say whatever I would.  What if I'm totally undecided on something and need a second option?  They'll be undecided too.  They wouldn't be able to help me with fears because they would be scared too.  When I got mad at them, I would become mad at myself  knowing I would have done the same.  Them always thinking the same way too would bug me, It would never make for a very interesting conversation, as they would always agree with me. They would never be able to explain a different perspective to me that I'm having a hard time seeing because they would share my perspective.  I already know everything about them so why bother even talking?



However, It would be nice to know someone who always will understand how you feel, and observing them could help you understand yourself better.  I think overall it could work out if you did not know they were you,  they just would not be a positive influence or make you a better person.

Perfection in appearance is a void concept. There cannot be perfection in appearance, as all that appears to be requires a medium for its being and a method in order to cast its impression in the eye. For instance, eye would use light that things reflect in order to see things, but all things cast shadows. Besides, there are dimensional limitations: limitations of time, space and of directions of focus. I cannot for instance see what is behind my head, and all that I see in nature is subjected to time and place: a rose has to come when there is time for it, and there is place for all things that make their appearance in nature.

There however is a second level of thought as when human will is involved in the act of observing. It is noticeable through out human history that there has always been a tendency to give expression to the very human need for perfection. There have been idols, gods and religion to make this possible for us to see in the mind, within widest sense of the meanings, what we cannot see realistically, or apparently.

When we look deep into things and seek to scrutinise the nature of their form, their relation with other forms, and finally the very nature of their matter, we go far beyond appearances and qualities and move into unknown depths of the essence. There is some perfection that has manifested itself in it various forms and their attributive qualities.



There therefore is just one truth, and that truth is perfection. The truth is in the essence of everything. The reason we do not see perfection in all things is once again due to limitative nature of our observations, i.e. we cannot see the full picture in one instance, for if we could we would see only one.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so by my train of thought perfection would be in the eye of ones lover.
 More commonly perfection is in a mothers view of her children.

It has several problems to it.

The first, and most major criticism is that there is no evidence to support his ideas. It is a leap of faith.

Secondly, supposing it is true, it leads to questions about the gradation of ALL things. If Plato believes that we see shadows of only some things (such as perfection) and leads to the idea that we are merely shadows, then it begs the question what other objects do we see shadows of? Are cats just shadows of an ultimate cat? A table the shadow of ultimate table-ness? Does it mean that our "perfect" design of a table mean that it is "less perfect" than the ultimate table which is the most perfect table one can imagine? Apply this to us humans it implies that our perfect actions of perfect unconditional love, perfect friendship etc are not, in fact, perfect at all!

These are just two simple criticisms of the allegory of the cave, There are many, many....MANY more!

Plato's cave denigrates the material world. The myth or allegory sets forth the idea that the material world is inferior to the world of Ideas or Forms. We must escape from the cave in order to find the Good. The Good cannot be found in the sensible world. Another criticism of Plato's cave might be the epistemology that is implied by the allegory. According to Platonism, our knowing is hindered by life in our bodies. The body is a prison for the soul. Therefore, only freedom from this physical body will result in our having that which counts as knowledge. Authentic knowing does not appear to be possible while we're constrained by these bodies.

I think it depends upon what structure Political religious economic social psychological ) you are balancing on - to read the analogy.

I didn't come accross it till I was training as a person centred counsellor and it is a perfect explanation of adapted behaviours and consciousness
of the self.

Given that Plato had pled for Socrates and come up against the might of the state, bent on killing off an innocent man on a trumped up charge out of fear - I am not surprised that he went on to write this enlightening story - Why would it have to hold water for every occasion so long as it helps anyone to understand where they are chained? Maybe a criticism is that he doesn't say how to get the bottle to leave the shadows.

I believe it's an act of pure and deep selfishness because what you PRIMARILY want is to get that person no matter what, however, once you've got him/her, you find your own happiness in making that someone happy, so it is  an act of selfishness that leads to the best example of altruism and humility.

what more is being in love than expecting someone to love you back?

Someone you expect to be by your side and not kiss another, just you.
You manipulate them with your love to get their love.
The expectations and rules you lay out are selfish. 
It makes you happy when someone follows them and it makes them happy to see you happy so they do so.
Vice Versa
It's a game of give and take
It's ownership
it's seeeelfish

But being in love is sweet, it's just not something you do if you want to become a monk or any other religious leader.
Selfishness is a sin, why else are they single?

I think the state of being in love is without consciousness- I always think of it as  neurotic. I guess it leads us to the choice of whether to start loving the other or not - so maybe if I must only choose between your two options, I'd go for  altruism - 
This is  because  it is a shot in the dark at the process of being able to eventually love self and other. Walking into that whole experience probably takes lots of guts - It seems a  bit like childbearing/rearing  if we knew what we were letting ourselves in for we'd rarely  go for it. yes I plump for altruism.

In philosophical sense to love would be an act of self-realisation, but in spiritual sense to love I believe is to live for the purpose of soul. In this sense love is not an act of selfishness, an act merely for the purpose of physical pleasure, emotional satisfaction, or genetic dissemination, but for the higher purposes of human soul.



We witness people sacrificing their possessions, their comfort and their lives for the sake their believes, but if love was merely for the fulfilment of physical purposes than how could they come to do this. This nevertheless is true that love does serve life its physical purpose too, but I think the ultimate objective remains to be spiritual.

One may ask, as what do I mean by soul, and what are its higher purposes? I really do not know, as I cannot explain. It is just that I observe all too often demonstrated through human nature some hunger that cannot be satisfied merely by physical means. Then there are aspects to life that we do not understand the reason of and yet cannot be without. We see that life is all we seem to have but there is no escape from its end, and therefore, no ultimate consolation in reason. It seems that we have ability to excel the limitation of our singular being and merge with other people, and perhaps this way to dodge death and see eternity to feel that life in love is a life forever.

The understanding of love, however, and mainly in most popular culture, has come to mean only passionate love physical union of two people. I think this too is fully reasonable, as what else one could reasonably need beyond the need of a partner, and a family?



The concept of spiritual love however may come to symbolise as some idealistic fantasy, or some form of idiosyncratic mysticism. I without an elaborate and extended notion of love, beyond the domains of reason, it become difficult for many to see as what is the true purpose of life, suffering and death after all, if not for the sake of some purpose that extends beyond life we know?

It is an act of selfishness. I suppose at some deep level it is desire to ensure the survival of our genes. The love bit is just how this desire manifests itself at a conscious level. I am not sure I completely buy this in so far is this would not explain love between people of the same sex. However, I do think our sexual drive is basically an evolutionary imperative - pleasure from sex being the motivator as it were.

As one of the other responders has noted this ultimately selfish act can lead to acts of selflessness toward the object of our love. There are many recorded cases where one person has sacrificed their own life to save the live of a loved one - literature is littered for such stories. So although our love maybe selfish it can engender acts of great altruism.

It may be both, but if you believe in love or the concept of love, you are someone who believes in 'value judgements' and non-material reality. I think there is a lot of rubbish talked on this point of altruism vs selfishness. Even if one accepts that physical love has some kind of evolutionary basis, I do not see that one has to go into 'evolutionary Psychology' mode or kiss the feet of Richard dawkins. I believe that the physical and spiritual meet in love and we are not in an either or but rather 'both/and mode'. That is part of the indescribable, but completely real mystery love presents us with.

Of all of God's Creations that I've seen, only one straightaway and by far takes first place. 
And that is mankind.  I mean, we've done some bad things in the past, but we've also done great things.  Which other creature has the intelligence to do bad and good, but chooses good?
And on top of all of that.. what other creature is capable of even asking which is god's finest creation?
Surely, us, as mankind, capable of rational thought, of creating masterpieces, of worshipping god, of loving one another passionately and placing others ahead of ourselves, is his greatest creation.

Genesis Chapter I Verses 28-31
28 God blessed them. He said to them, "Have children and increase your numbers. Fill the earth and bring it under your control. Rule over the fish in the waters and the birds of the air. Rule over every living creature that moves on the ground." 29 Then God said, "I am giving you every plant on the face of the whole earth that bears its own seeds. I am giving you every tree that has fruit with seeds in it. All of them will be given to you for food. 30 "I am giving every green plant to all of the land animals and the birds of the air for food. I am also giving the plants to all of the creatures that move on the ground. I am giving them to every living thing that breathes." And that's exactly what happened. 31 God saw everything he had made. And it was very good. There was evening, and there was morning. It was day six.

Would a safety-critical project normally possess automatic test software which is validated by a manufacturer ?



and used to develop and set to work a subsystem ?
Would there be a high risk that someone on the team will misconstrue his own job, and doctor the automatic test software so as to agree with the subsystem under test.



(His intention may have been to then seek accreditation for the modified test software).

As is the people so is the Nation.  A cultured, refined good citizentry can produce the best govt. which in turn makes a good Nation.  If we select the best as our leaders, we get a good governance in a democracy.  A corrupt leader is the product of a downcast group of people.  In the light of the above facts, we can define the leader as well as the Nation.  The best Govt. is which governs the least.  For that we should have very good citizens.  Democracy has the obvious disadvantage of counting votes instead of weighing them.  We should weigh the quality of our candidate and then elect them.  If we have good representqatives in our democracy, we can expect good governance.  No nepotism, no bribery, no fenaticism, no suppression of the down cast.  Intelligent people can define their leader and their Nation by observing them

Its the people and not the leaders because leaders are those who come from the people. 1 among the mass becomes a leader, so its the people. people r the identity of any nation. people consists of a group of individuals and the group shud hav a strong attitude 2wards country.It is the group behavior that determines its standards and leader is the 1 who comes from such a well behaved group or society. He wud b having all the instincts of the group and his immediate environment,so if the people r gr8 they produces gr8 leaders too...for example gandhiji was influenced by his father who was a staunch disciplinarian and swami vivekananda was inspired by his guruji..both of them r gr8 leaders..in various aspects.. they were influenced by their immediate surroundings and people and not that they r born that way...so public determines the character of a nation and its leaders !

Who thinks that people like Thomas Nagel makes philosophy seem silly?



I just did Thomas Nagel's reading on the Absurd. I must say, that for a philosopher and a professor, he is rather wordy.  The points he was arguing were silly, and his replies or conclusions were poor.



Basically his 14 page reading was about how our lives only seem absurd if we view them that way, and a way to tackle this absurdity is with irony...whatever, see it's people like him that makes me hate philosophy, who cares!?! Who cares if our lives are absurd or not? Who cares if some people have or want meaning in their lives? I don't, so rather than waste his time (and mine) writing 14 pages of argument debating whether our lives are absurd or not, why doesn't he write about more important things like, cultural differences, or how we can achieve world peace? A philosophical perspective on those issues would be nice.



I think his own reading was absurd!



Honestly he makes Nietzsche's work look like they were written by a god compared to the drivel he was on about.



That's my two cents worth

I feel this way about Bertrand Russell and Ann Rand, but to each his own. I guess if every philosophy were for everybody, then there would BE no cultural differences or impediments to world peace. Ironically, and you will pardon the word, it is our inability to tolerate one another's ideas that MAKES cultural differences and prevents world peace. So your dislike of Nagel is an example of the very things you want to avoid. What an, if you will pardon the word, absurd situation to be in.

Sometimes a postulate in one branch of philosophy can offer you a fresh perspective in a different category.
So that looking at personal meaning and who a particular philosopher reasons about that topic would give you insight into how the would look at more abstract issues, like cultural differences or a way to achieve world peace.
It may not seem like there is a connection, but existential philosophy is often closely linked to morality and ethics.
I find that most good philosophers are not so much addressing an audience with their arguments but instead are detailing their own reasoning as objectively as possible so that they know why they think the way they do about some other philosophical inquiry and that if we are both inclined to be in agreement about some other fundamental point that I am willing to forgive minor deviations in how one reaches a particular conclusion.
It may also be that you are not connected to the philosophy in the proper context. Historical context, the prevailing attitudes of the time the work was composed also provide insight into a philosophers analysis.
It sounds like this fellow is attempting to rebut absurdism.
But I have not read his work so I do not know the way he attempts to refute it.
It also sounds as though you have already decided on a stance regarding the answer to the question of meaning for human existence.
Unless you read the work objectively it is not surprising that you were not able to take away much from it.
It may be that instead of analyzing the arguments you analyzed only the conclusion.
This is not a reliable way to determine the strength of an argument and I would caution against this form of hasty rejection.
For instance I would be inclined to agree that seeking to find some ultimate purpose for the existence of consciousness may indeed by a pointless endeavor with regards to objective reality.
But the simple fact is that humans do this almost instinctually and so there is likely some benefits in doing so.
Also I do not extend my nihilistic attitude about the existence of intrinsic value regarding the ultimate meaning of consciousness to other branches of philosophy.
I am not an epistemological nihilist for example.
Nor am I a social anarchist.
Based on the length of the work you sight it is likely that a great many things are assumed to be known to the reader and this might also make the work seem less coherent if it turns out that you are not well read in philosophy.
But I do not often encounter works that I consider "silly".
And I certianly do not consider philosophy itself to be a pointless endeavor.
As for a philosophical perspective regarding cultural difference's and world peace.
I am willing to bet that you should be able to hazard a guess about the authors thoughts by the work.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_...

"Christ was the head of the body of which they

Seems to suggest that Mystic Jesus is the only one who gets to get the big Buddha mind meld with the all pervasive spirit of the universe. Implying there's no point in chasing enlightenment, unless like Christ you are the mystic type, you are not going to get it. If you are the head then you are the head, otherwise you are fingers, toes, limbs and such - all God's creation.

That's quite the stereotype. I'm very pro-life and have been active in the cause for 20 years. I have maybe met 10 hunters who are pro-life and maybe two who hunt and are in favor of the death penalty. You'll find most of us are normal, everyday people who don't believe abortion is safe (particularly for the baby) and "mother's rights" are not particularly inalienable. When she chose to have sex, she knew it was possible to conceive. Had she tried to prevent the pregnancy, she probably would have been successful. But abortion isn't "just another form of birth control" and the baby who was conceived is a human being who DOES have inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I'm sorry if you disagree, but cut the stereotypes and realize that our opinions are completely well thought and based on an ethical morality that extends farther than the moment of "I don't want to be a mom right now". That's where adoption comes in.

Great question.  George Carlin (RIP) had a great riff on this very topic:

"Here’s another question I have. How come when it’s us, it’s an abortion, and when it’s a chicken, it’s an omelette? Are we so much better than chickens all of a sudden? When did this happen, that we passed chickens in goodness. Name 6 ways we’re better than chickens. See, nobody can do it! You know why? ‘Cause chickens are decent people. You don’t see chickens hanging around in drug gangs, do you? No, you don’t see a chicken strapping some guy into a chair and hooking up his nuts to a car battery, do you? When’s the last chicken you heard about come home from work and beat the s**t out of his hen, huh? Doesn’t happen, ’cause chickens are decent people.

Thou shalt not kill. Murder. The fifth commandment. But if you think about it, religion has never really had a problem with murder. Not really. No, more people have been killed in the name of God than for any other reason. All you have to do is look at slavery, the Middle East, the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Holocaust, and the World Trade Center, and you'll see how seriously the religious folks take "Thou Shalt Not Kill." The more devout they are, the more they see murder as negotiable...it's negotiable. It depends, you know? It depends, it depends on who's doing the killing, and who's getting killed."

You really shouldn't generalise - yes I know you used the word usually. I'm pro - life. Abortion is murder whether you agree with a womans right to choose or not. Unborn babies should have equal rights as the mother. I'm a zookeeper and very into conservation, environmental and animal welfare issues so very against hunting. I'm also against the death penalty. Even murders deserve a chance at redemption.



I disagree with your statement. In my experience the people that I know who are pro life tend to extend those rights to life to criminals and animals. However I cannot make assumptions everybody is different and has wildly differing views on these issues so you simply cannot generalise as you have done.

It's probably because they're looking at it from a Christian standpoint.  The Bible says that the animals were put on this earth to be killed and eaten but that murder is a sin.

There is a saying in sales that goes "It is always easier to ask for forgiveness than permission" and it is used to close someone when they say they have to ask their husband or wife for permission.  The salesperson is supposed to use that line to overcome the objection.

both seem to have fault in them, permission requires that someone else grants you power to act, and forgiveness seems to force you to apologize for sometimes a real reason, but mostly out of exploitation (in other words someone forcing you to feel guilt). I would prefer will power to either permission or forgiveness, because with will power you can have a mind and action of your own.

Is there anything more to risk than the possibility of loss?



In other words, is risk never anything more than an evil to be eliminated or avoided?



I really think that many Americans, in particular, think that there is something positive that attaches itself to risk just by the nature of risk.
Needless to say, I think that they are wrong.



I think that it is impossible for the wise man to avoid all risk (to quote St. Augustine), but I think that some are positively attracted to it.

The ability to risk anticipating a positive result is the mark of industry and growth.  Jump in the water to learn swimming, but don't get drowned.  That is the modus operandi of risk taking.  For achieving success in any field, one should be prepared for a change and this change has the inevitable risk attached to it. Dare develry had been the  mark of success.

State your opinion on--Designer Babies?!?



"New reproductive technologies are giving would-be parents more options -- if they can cough up enough money. One day, some experts say, parents might be able to order blue-eyed, academically inclined, cancer-free kids."



Frankly, I'm utterly appalled! I just finished reading this online article about how parents may someday be able to create their own super-kid, features including: choice of some physical traits and personality attributes, such as hair color, level of optimism, if they are athletically or academically inclined etc etc.



Does anyone else agree with the fact that this is sick and twisted?!



Now I agree that the advances in technology and science can be wonderful. For example, helping parents have healthy children without birth defects. However, allowing wealthy adults to be able to create their own robots or monster is not fair to the child! It's not up to the parents to literally force their decision on what another human being should be like. I mean, parents now have an influence on their children, but they can't scientifically alter them to be their perfect child.



Now, I know the whole nature verses nurture theory will, of course, take affect on any child, whether they are a creation of just the parents, or a creation of science; that even though a child may be programmed one way, the things that happen in their life will make them individuals. It’s just...I do not believe that we should be able to change someone to our liking before they are even born.



Your thoughts?

Also, I know that mothers are already capable of affecting a child before birth with their own life choices, such as drugs or alcohol or diet. I know this will affect the child in many ways. Parents are one of the main influences in a child's life after birth as well, and affects who we are today. But that is a discussion for another time.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Every parent (every competent parent, at least) wants the best for their child.  This really is no different than choosing which school your kid goes to, what TV shows he watches, what hobbies he gets interested in, whether he grows up to be responsible or irresponsible, etc.  Parents "force their decision on what another human being (their child) should be like" all the time; it's what parenting is all about!



I must very strongly disagree with your contention that "designer babies" would be "robots or monsters."  Actually I recall that the same thing was said about the first in-vitro babies.  Genetically modified babies would in fact be exactly the opposite of robots or monsters, having been given all the _best_ qualities of humans.  (BTW, there's no reason a child couldn't be academic _and_ athletic.)  If you could tweak a gene to make your child more creative, would that make him more, or less like a robot?  If you could give your child a heightened sense of empathy and compassion, is that turning him into a monster?



Genetics is not playing god any more than giving chemo for cancer is.  There is nothing divine, magical or supernatural about genes; they are just another part of your body like your pancreas or that wart on your hand.  Tweaking them is no different than using glasses to correct your vision or working out to increase your strength and health.  You said yourself that genes are not all there is to a person, that their upbringing and environment can also play huge roles in shaping a person's identity.  Gene therapy & modification is just another factor out of many, so why not put it to beneficial use?



Also, who says this will only be for the wealthy?  Like computers or plane trips, it may start out expensive early in its history, but as the technology matures and becomes more efficient the price will fall considerably until most anyone can afford it.



You might want to check out "Liberation Biology" by Ronald Bailey at your local bookstore or library.  It's about the coming revolution in biotechnology, and has a whole chapter devoted to the subject of designer babies.  I think you may find it quite interesting to read.

While creating super-humans seems like it's asking for trouble, it's really just speeding along evolution. I'm not one to say we should mess with nature, but as long as we use it just to rid children of cancer and not to give them super-strength, I think it will be alright.

The human race has been doing exactly that for YONKS,flower. Disposal of deformed babies,the halt and the lame left to die,the retarded used as entertainment,so forth. What scientists are attempting is one way of eradicating that trait,or,as some see it,that necessity,out of human nature.  Wether it's right or wrong,it's here. The problem is,once invented,attempted,or thought of,an idea cannot be UN-invented or UN-thought of. So we'd better get some parameters set PDQ,if we're not going to travel down the route toward Uber-kind for the favoured few,and make certain any benefit from such manipulation of nature is precisely that. A benefit to mankind,and not a toy of the wealthy.

Senseless, purposeless wandering has often produced great insights for me........... may be the following way how it happens.



When we are doing something senseless, our mind is sort of unattached to whatever we are doing and free to do anything its own..... this I believe generates the possibility of a lateral thought or idea...... a seed so sown can perhaps be polished and developed later in a serious way to produce something great.

Everything is interconnected. Our genes carry so many factors that make us who we are today.  The way the DNA is composed on you and I are different hence we are different from each other.  But there are many similar genes and that is why we both understand language and maths and science etc.  We have the ability to comprehend them.  What I think you are asking about is more about the "collective unconscious" .  They are archetypes, or universal mental dispositions which are not grounded in any experience.  They are common in all human beings and connect all of us.

DNA functions like a  computer program, so in a very real sense it has 'intellegence'



And gist of Evolutionary theory is that Random Mutation & Natural Selection  behaves like intellegent design.



So one could say the interaction of DNA with Natura Law (Logos) constitutes intellegence.



But the assertion that mutation requires communication is wildly innacurate.

The article you cited is an absurd and dreadful misunderstanding of DNA (among other things). I'm just hoping that the original authors were joking or under the influence of LSD or similar.



The notion of DNA mutations requiring communication is inherently flawed at its core. DNA mutations are the result of damage, for example from radiation or the sun, or can be the result of copying errors. Symbolic "communication" can occur within the cell, however these are the result of signalling pathways, as opposed to some linguistic property. The cell does not say "Oops! We're no longer at homeostasis! Someone fix that please!" The conditions within the cell trigger a cascade of enzymatic reactions, which can then restore homeostasis through the generation or degradation of proteins.



Even if we do assume that the alkalines of our DNA,which is a strange statement, I could understand basic nucleotides, but alkalines?, is true, it does not necessarily follow that language developed from that.

No.  Genetics have no consciousness and there is no form of communication required for mutation because it's not a collective activity.  Any genetic mutation is completely random and survives only if it causes a reproductive advantage in it's phenotype (i.e. the creature that the DNA makes up part of).



I think at best, the author of the article has misinterpreted whatever evidence they have read.  I tried to follow the link they have posted as a reference but it dosn't work.

Man is created with the "mind". It is the mind which give credence to man. Think about any man bereft of the mind. All the achievements of man in this world is because of the thinking capacity of the 'mind' with which he is endowed with. Sairam.

Would a safety-critical project normally possess automatic test software which is validated by a manufacturer ?



and used to develop and set to work a subsystem ?
Would there be a high risk that someone on the team will misconstrue his own job, and doctor the automatic test software so as to agree with the subsystem under test.

Generic stooge "counterspy" persists particularly well in a talentless vacuum because legitimate inquiry occurs, most generally, elsewhere. Turgid mantra is thus fundamental to reinforcement of the dubious project: instead of writing ad copy for an external product that can be regulated by society, counterspy employs the specific technique to relentlessly reinforce, but not specifically exposit, and so accidentally corrupt, the general view (Gk. doxei) that the particular communicative medium is legitimate (not questionable). While I do not question the legitimacy of the generally accepted view, per se, I do indeed question, as an individual with no self-interest, the pernicious techniques employed by the conscript YA stooges to manipulate the target audience, i.e., regulate the general view as a means of avoiding regulation.

Philosophy is actually (historically) the foundation of science, look at all the philosophers of the classical times, they observed, and then formulated a theory on how this works, and supported this with their arguments. Science nowadays has more tools to determine the cause of something, so it is more accurate.
But all the sciences (Biology, Physics, Chemistry) started with people philosophizing about natural phenomenons.

Philosophy thinks science and religion, in the form of epistemology and theology. Science and religion are objects of the philosophical thought and commentary, but philosophical discipline doesn't lead to science (which is a very specific field of knowledge, very specialized) and doesn't lead to religion either, for religion is based on faith, living experience of the divine, and thought, whereas philosophy implies doubt, research and reason. Some philosophers were believers though, but they never confused their philosophical work with their personal faith.

Such things as philosophy, science and religion do not have to be in conflict.  In fact, it's possible for all of them to "work together."  It just could be that many of us are considering the same things, but we're approaching them from different viewpoints.

Boredom is ignorance. Nobody is bored unless they don't actually understand the situation. If you could do whatever you wanted you would never be bored. You get bored because you choose not to do whatever you want to. You choose to NOT do whatever you want to because you are afraid. You are afraid because life is a dangerous place. Who stands in a hungry lion's cage and yawns from boredom?



Boredom is stupidity, and a lack of imagination. Only very very boring people are bored. Too dumb to see the lion coming at them.

That depends on your definition of evil.  Can an evil act only be considered evil by those who do good?  Would this mean that any who are bored wouldn't view an evil act as being evil, but view it as something different to do?  I'm not disagreeing with you, just making you think :)
But no.  I don't think boredom is the root of all evil, I think jealousy is the root of all evil.

Not really since many undemocratic regimes were founded on certain philosophies. However, since the advent of modernity, during the French revolution, democratic regimes have believed in the Enlightenment philosophy of universal rationality expressed via the vote. Undemocratic regimes have rejected this Enlightenment notion, which makes those regimes seem anti-philosophical. They are actually anti-enlightenment not anti-philosophical (however, some really are anti-philosophical).

Philosophy is an area of inquiry, not a specific viewpoint.  As such, no, undemocratic regimes are not "anti-philosophical" because there is no such thing.  Plenty of philosophers have put forth proposals for systems of government that are absolutely not democratic.  Nietzsche, one of the greats, is AGAINST democracy.

Exactly.  Humility is a very valuable characteristic to have.  Usually with humility, you always know that there is room to improve.  Prideful people tend to be the opposite.  They live life as if they know everything and as if they are always right.  Humility is the highest virtue.  It is the most humbled person who tends to have the loudest unspoken voice.

Humility is a very nice admirable virtue to posses. BUT as the word  derives from Latin HUMILITAS... meaning submissiveness and lowliness. These are qualities which have to have one other quality in toe: assertiveness. If these qualities are not reasonably well matched, one might land up being walked all over and not being heard at all. So be aware of when to show humility and when to be assertive.
There are so many different walks of life were one needs to apply both qualities in almost equal measure. Hope that helps a little.

Literally it means that being humble is the best characteristic you can have.



I think it's also making a more sophisticated point that if humility is the highest virtue then it is wrong to brag about any of your other virtues/talents.  Even if you were say, exceptionally courageous and told everyone this, the person who said nothing (and was therefore more humble) would be more virtuous than you.  So I think it's really making the point that just because someone is humble and doesn't brag about themselves does not mean they are worth any less than someone who makes their virtues/talents known.

Maybe you have to go around doing something in a way most people wouldn't.  More than likely you did something risky in a solution some people would consider off or a waste of time.  When I bought my house the previous owner painted over natural oak in several places of the house.  I decided to strip it in some areas and not others, stripping is time consuming.  So everyone says, it takes forever just buy new, which is what most people do.  But I stripped it and the end result was worth it.  But basically, it is there to make sure that before you decide you want to do something make sure the outcome will be with your risk or time.

The best way is to become as aware and enlightened as possible.



For example, one of the most important things is to live in the moment - and, "BE HERE NOW!" You still plan for the future but you must live as much as possible in the moment.
Learn from the lessons lived from your past, but do not dwell there - especially upon negative events. The past does not really exist except as a somewhat fuzzy, faded and distorted memory. It exists in your mind alone and it is you that always brings it back. It is usually a vast waste of time and energy.



The same with the future, it is always unfolding into our NOW moments, but we can never know or see them before they happen. Worrying is not only a great waste of time and energy, it actually shortens life.



Live life to the fullest, enjoy every day as if it were your last and savour every moment of you eternal NOW moments.



Finally, get outside of "self" by focusing and loving others unconditionally.

i'd like to cite a little text:



"Once there was a man, who was always happy, you never saw him worry or be sad. All the people around him wanted to know his secret, so they asked him.
He said "When i'm sitting, i'm sitting. When i'm standing up, i'm standing up. When i'm walking, i'm walking. When i'm running, i'm running."
All the people where rather disappointed and weren't really happy about this answer. One man said "But when we're sitting, we're sitting too! but yet we aren't as happy as you!"



So the old man corrected him:
"Your wrong, young man. Your problem is, that when you're sitting, you're thinking of standing up. When you're standing up, you're thinking of walking. When you're walking, you're thinking of running."

Genius is within us waiting to be released. i don't think you are exorcised if one possesses this quality. Genius is the action of reason and imagination. It possesses us and is never inherited.

Question i'm still pondering...?



G'day mate..
a question i been ask,but i still can't found the solution...
here we go..
Thirteen teachers are in Paradox, New York attending a math conference. When they arrive at the Enigma Hotel to check in, they are told that only 12 rooms are available. Since their school had made reservations for 13 rooms, the teachers are a bit upset that they will have to find another place to stay. As they are preparing to leave and find another hotel, the manager comes out and asks if there is a problem. When she hears of their situation she assures them that the Enigma Hotel has enough space to accommodate each teacher in his or her own room. She takes two of the teachers to room #1 and promises to come back in a few minutes and take one of them to another room. She takes the third teacher to room #2, the fourth teacher to room #3, the fifth teacher to room #4 and so on, taking the twelfth teacher to room #11. She then returns to room #1 and escorts the extra teacher waiting there to room #12. All of the teachers are now happily settled in their own rooms. Is this possible? Why or why not?

The quote is in direct conflict with the concept of national pride. To be proud to be from any nation, one must consider themselves 'better than' those of another nation. The quote suggests that we are all equals and not to treat each other as equals has its consequences.

depends on what philosophy is to you? on the whole philosophy is not a subject that we can improve or enhance, it is what it is. But personally you can improve or enhance your view of the world by being more open minded and being to able to shift angles and tuning your mind for better understanding of this world.

Good question. Try to look at the facts objectively, try to look objectively at your own and other people's thoughts, feelings and actions related to those facts, and make unbiased conclusions about how our minds, emotions and reality interact. Think of what you observe, in other words. And compare your conclusions to the existing phylosophy. And maybe you can improve it. In any case, you will improve\enhance your own understanding of what the guys before you were talking about, which is an advantage in itself.

You don't see a point because you have not yet found your purpose. In other words  what is your purpose and how are you going to contribute to the betterment of mankind. Don't despair just because you have not pin pointed it yet, I'm 22 and I haven't really figured out if I want to feed the world, take care of the sick or redeem people's belief in the magical world of fantasy through art. Don't worry about it yet, we are young and worrying about it will not help. Channel your energy to finding the solution instead of focusing on the problem.

You might feel this way because you could be bored with the redundancy of everyday life.  Always the same expectations.  Nothing new under the sun.  Kinda makes you view life as chasing after the wind, never able to catch it.  My advice is to not focus so much on making sense out of everyday life.  Just be a spectator.  Amuse yourself at the everyday imperfections.  The world is one big circus show.  Get yourself a big bag of popcorn; sit back, and be entertained.

You need a purpose? Hum? Guidance could be a good thing in anyones life. I lacked good moral judgment from my past religion. I'm 47 and without a good moral and ethnic type of a religion, I lost a sense of direction in my life. I was easily persuaded doing drugs, drinking alcohol, hanging around people that just didn't care. So forth & so forth, I lacked not having a good job and this swirled me into more less undesirable actions.



I found a better direction through the bible, because it is life, and through Christ we can have purpose. I had a bible study about a year ago with a popular book called the The Purpose Driven Life, this could help you in reading the bible if you never have read it. Drugs are not good, staying sober is much better and your whole body is always fresh and alert.

Not necessarily.  The most rewarding form of acquiring experience is through trial and error.  If life came with an undo button, then there would be no lesson left for others to learn from.  Repeated experiences, whether good or bad become redundant and uninteresting after awhile.

Darwin proposed that Evolution would select for organism and creatures whose genes would enable them to best cope and adapt to the changing environment around them. Those that survive or were more adaptable would thrive and past their genetics onto their offsprings and those offsprings would thrive and populate in the new environment.
In simple terms "survival of the fittest"



Social Darwinism is a perversion of Darwin's Evolution concept, "Survival of the fittest" and applying it to people via social status class, race and creed, and financial-economic stature. It had nothing to do with genetics nor actual evolution, although people who used it try to pretend to be scientific in their excuse.



Examples:



a rich wealthy person deserves to live longer than a poor person, hence access to health care services and organ transplant should be given priority.



a white person should not marry someone of a different color, culture or creed, because he/she would be diluting his/her superior genetics.



a man is superior to a woman, women process weak whimsical genetics that make them incapable of wise decisions such as voting and politics.

Social Darwinism is a theory that principles of natural selection and survival of the fittest that apply to individuals and groups (villages, states, countries, etc.) also drive social evolution of the species in the groups.



In generic sense, it can apply to all sociable species but most often it is used in reference to human species. After all social evolution of human species is the most advanced and interesting to study. Social Darwinism expands the study to social aspects like politics, economics, ideas/ideologies, cultures, etc. even morals and values.



There are many other theories on social changes but Social Darwinism has a unique characteristics derived from Darwin's biological evolution principles. For example, it theorizes that the social evolution may accumulate/enhance physical and mental strengths of individuals in the society that over a long period of time the species themselves could be considered changed.

Why do people continue to preach the Bible on non-religious questions? ?



Is there any reason to continue these lengthy sermons in writing with quotes from Bibles on the Yahoo Answers? Why are they preaching?



Is it for themselves? Or their own insecurities? Or boredom? Has Bible Bumping ever resolved our problems?

I think some use biblical quotes because they are comfortable with how they interpret them, and they expect everyone else to interpret them that way too.  I think others use them as a shield, in order to protect themselves from the questions of sinners and sycophants.  I think the most common answer might be that they just cant think of a creative answer on their own and they might need some help or inspiration.  Not to say they aren't able to answer with their own words if they tried, but they might think they needn't try when the bible says it better?  I don't know, to be honest, I would never quote the bible to anyone who didn't quote it first, and typically I wouldn't quote it then wither, unless it truly proves some point definitively, which if you've read any of the bible, it typically doesn't, lol.

When I ask about Adam and Eve, people quote Darwin at me. But nobody quotes Darwin when I ask about Romeo and Juliet. It seems that people have religion and science all screwed around in their heads.



Also if people are spamming you with irrelevant religious quotes, VIOLATE them.



But, many people have had dramatically improved lives from Bible study. Others have had dramatically improved lives from learning about science. Neither one is a substitute for the other but both have their charms and benefits. Just those who push one at the expense of the other seem much less charming and benificent.

My existence and experience is to question.  Who am "I"? My way of thinking, My personality, all things that are intrinsic to Me... do I own them?  During my birth process, what if there was a slight change in my genetic make-up? Who would I be then? Would I still be Me? Or could I be YOU in the case that you were never born?

Your inner self lives in your mind and if your mind controls you then you are what not yourself.

Because we are all born that way. We all have a demon inside of us wanting to do harm to ourselves and to others. It is our morality that kicks in, our conscious that leads us to do good things instead.



Like in the Bible, it explains we are all born sinners and we all have a wicked heart. It is just of matter of what we choose to nurture, either the wicked desires we have, or we can force ourselves to do good things and reap the benefits of that instead.

Whether your Inner me is your friend or enemy is a decision that you get to make about who you are and how you live your life.  If you believe we have free will...and I do...then you get to make all kinds of choices and decisions about your life, and you're doing it all the time.  Deciding that your inner me is your enemy sounds like you are pretty down on yourself.  You might consider spending a bit more time looking at the roles that such things as love, compassion, gratitude, forgiveness and so on play in our life.  You can turn that enemy into your best friend and greatest ally...if you're willing to do that.  Best wishes.

Not enough evidence for that. On any government project progress can be obstructed via red tape. It's the nature of the government beast.  Not to say there is not an office powerpath, it's very common in government jobs. Crazy people, like an office powerpath, seldom see themselves that way. They can do the same behavior, bother people, ask the same pointless questions because they are an office powerpath and hence crazy.

words can be bad, not because of their consequences (they are like all words in that they are simply a string of morphemes put together and assigned a particular meaning). In the case of a bad word, its 'badness' is intrinsic to it, coming from the meaning assigned to the word, not because of what happens when we say the word. The consequences of saying a bad word come *because* the word is bad.

Well, yes.  There are two main types of ethics: consequentialist, and non-consequentialist.



The consequentialists are the ones who look at outcomes--those are the utilitarians, the hedonists, the epicureans.



Some non-consequentialists look at moral authority, such as Christian ethicists or Kant's moral philosophy.  Others fall into the "virtue ethics" category, where they presume that if a person simply possesses or cultivates the proper virtuous traits, the consequences of the person's actions will be proper; Aristotle and Phillipa Foot contribute to this category, along with the absolutely untrustworthy, self-indulgent, un-virtuous William Bennett.

This is at the core of the dispute between the absolutists and the relativists. For the absolutists, something is good because God said it was, and wrong for the same reason. They won't take into account consequences - if it is morally right in their view, the consequences don't matter, even if it means that hundreds of thousands of people will die.
Relativists deny that morality comes from God. The Relativists have a somewhat flexible view of morality. Times change and people change, and relativists take this into account. For them the results matter a great deal.
However, both sides have serious problems. The absolutists tend to be crusading fanatics, whereas relativism can slip into the view that morality is all a matter of opinion. Since one person's opinion is as good as anyone else's, the whole thing is a tangled mess, so why not just live for yourself?
For thinking people these arguments are quite a knot.

Of course! Actually, whether something is good or bad does not even rely on its consequences.



I mean, you cheat in a test and don't get caught and do alright. No bad consequences! But is that "good" then?



You pick up money on the ground and return it to the wrong person without knowing. The consequence is bad - someone lost their money, but does that mean that the action of returning money is bad?



So I don't think anything can be judged by its consequences.

Any action or deed can be either good or bad. Good or bad is decided based on the intentions and motives behind each action.



For instance, a knife is being used by a Surgeon Doctor for curing the patient and removing certain unwanted substance in the body or rectifying the area. The same knife is used by a murderer to kill. The action in both cases ins use of knife.



In the first case the intention is clearly to cure  the patient. In the second case, it is for ulterior motive. So, any action can be either good or bad based on the intentions and motives behind that action.

Yes. What is more considerable is the intention of the doer or the intentions a thing can make a person do. Marijuana is a thing, the result is bad but it is all up to the doer if he will intend to use it to harm others or use it for health purposes.

Good question!!



It is indeed consequence that defines good or bad...... that is why good and bad are always relative to the obtaining circumstances that have an impact on the outcome. Does that mean that good and bad need to be determined only post facto? That would be evaluation of the result rather than the action itself. In order to avoid this dilemma, we decide on the basis of expected outcome which in any case is based on past experiences and our conviction that the cause and effect relationship is inviolable. Incidentally, I have answered for good and bad in the general sense as applicable to any individual rather than in the moral or ethical sense that relates to the wider social context.

I think that in so far as anything exists, it is good.  What are the consequences of being a molecule or a mountain or a man or the Divinity itself?



I've heard that good and evil are in human acts and the consequences of those acts.  I also know that Kant argued that the only thing that is good in and of itself is a good will --- although Genesis mentions that God looked at everything He created and exclaimed that it was very good, whereas the human will to know the difference between good and evil caused a ton of evils, including death as the consequence of that desire/will to know the difference.



So what can I conclude?



Shouldn't a fella at your level of Answering questions, be answering this question, rather than asking it?

<answer>



When I think of good/bad, the most obvious bad action is killing someone and the most obvious good action is being kind to someone.



When i think further, i think of actions as good/bad as defined by society and the law. but sometimes, in the grey areas, im forced to use my brain to judge.



and when i judge, i dont judge of the consequence alone. i consider all points: the intention, the action, the consequence.



for me personally, i always think the intention is the main big difference that can change the good/bad standing of the case. reason being my intentions are usually good (to help somone) but i normally balls thing up with a consequence being somone not talking to me. obviously i went wrong somewhere, but that doesnt make the action bad. just very poorly conducted.



so on a personal level, yes. things can be good or bad without referring to consequence. simply refer to intention.



many muslims believe that we will be judged on the day of judgement by our intentions.



thanks for the thought =)



but to judge intention, we need to base it on something. i normally base it on what my morals and logic tell me. i dont rely totally on religion or the law to tell me if something is right or wrong.



and where do i get my morals and logic from? well that would be the world around me =)

I think that if you are loved than someone feels some need for you. I don't think you can separate them that easily. When I feel loved, I feel needed.



as for my personal preference would I rather be loved for being me, or needed for the sake of providing for someone, than of course I would rather be loved.

This is about ethics....



Ethical egoism is doing something that maximizes your own happiness, and self interest.



Ethical relativism is only considered right/wrong depending on the culture.



Mills have said something is right depending on the motive.



i'm mainly confused on what is utilitarianism? Is it when you do something that's good for yourself and the welfare of others?



and what is categorical imperative?

If morality included animals, what are some 'immoral' acts made by animals?



The first part of my question is debatable, contractialism excludes animals, however, animal activists argue otherwise.



I just want some examples of animal nature that may be viewed as 'immoral'.



For example, a female preying mantis eats her partner after mating...if a human did that she would be charged with murder, because killing is immoral

Hilarious question dear... Animals act directly through their instinct. They will do whatever their instinct tells them to do... We don't need to justify their action when they commit immorality for they don't have reason. Everything always falls in part of humans. If an animal commit immorality then it is our decision matters.

I just can't, in my mind, say that something an animal does is immoral.  Because it is just nature.  I can't put these together.  They are like 2 magnets of the same charge.  They look th same, feels the same and act the same.  But can't go together.



Saying that an animal doing something is immoral would be saying that nature is Immoral.  And it isn't.

no, some peoples bodies are trained to be the weapon and everything else.is also a potential weapon.  Guns, have you ever had to listen to your dog scream not yelp or whimper but screaming in pain?  Guns are not bad its the people using the tool that causes a negative or positive effect.  Gambling,  So much for banks buying homes jobs so on and so forth, investment is a form of gambling.  Alcohol, again its the people that cause negative or positive effects.  All things have a double edge, it can be used for great good or great evil it is the people that decide those factors.

I love it!  I would just get a gun somehow and rob a bunch of banks.



Why? Because all weapons are illegal.  OooooOooOoOhhh whatcha gonna do? mace me lady? wait... mace can be used as a weapon, better put that away before the coppers with no protection try to cite you.



Wait... if our hands can be used as weapons then do we have to cut them off?



Sarcasm aside, outlawing gambling and alcohol isn't so bad.  But any type of weapon... that screws the good people and gives the bad people a big advantage.



Cause hey, if someone wants a gun to hurt someone else, he'll get it.  Somehow or another.

I want revenge, but I just want this biatch to go away, what do I do?



So there's this girl that I've never even met who texts me anonymously things like "You are ******* sad and pathetic" and "You're myspace picture is awful". I can laugh at it now...because I know it's so childish, but she won't stop sending me texts messages and I want to get revenge, but I just want her to go away. The only way she knows me is because I dated her boyfriend 3 years ago, and she hunted me down on myspace and stalks me. I haven't even TALKED to my ex in over a year, and at that it was friendly comments or emails, nothing that should have pissed her off. I refuse to change my phone number and trash my myspace because that's probably what she wants me to do......and I don't know her phone # to tell her to piss off because her texts are anonymous

Ignore her. You have the satisfaction of knowing she has no life stalking and annoying people she doesn't even know. You can be proud that you are above her childish behavior. She has no right to judge you when she doesn't even know your character.



In addition, you can call your phone service provider and ask them to block her number, they might be able to pull out and trace the number despite being anonymous.

OR if you do just want her to bug off tell your cell provider to block her. i know the whole finding out what her cell is may be complicated, but it will be worth it.

Descartes Proof Of God?



I think I have to be the worst philosophy student alive!  Lmao.  I think I must read Meditations over a thousand times and I still don't get it this one part. I even went to a weekend workshop that how bad I am. But all they did was read it over but really explain it in detail. Which Is what I need. So I'm asking all you smart people here on Yahoo Answers.  You helped me name my son and decorate my new bedroom apartment so why not this? Lol.



Anyway can someone explain to me  Descartes proof of God's in his 3rd and 5th mediation. I'm just little unclear. I understand to a point but not enough that I can participate in any class discussion's without feeling like I'm making a fool out of myself. And I'm a honors student here! :(



Thanks in advance. I really appreciate it.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



The Ontological Argument offered to us through Meditations 1-6 sum up to say that God necessarily exists. Because Descartes had the IDEA of God, there must be a God to receive that idea from. The definition of God at such point of writing was "that greater than which can be conceived." In other words, something greater than you can imagine.



Descartes riddles on about God's 'objective reality'--the representational qualities and content that make up the idea of God. God is explained to be infinite, independent (was not created), supremely powerful, supremely beneficient, supremely intelligent, and the creator of everything. All six of these qualities added up to be the idea/concept of "Perfection".



So this brings us back to the Ontological Argument, also often referred to as the "Inheritance Idea".



God exists---&gt;God is perfect---&gt;God is not a deceiver---&gt;Therefore the Light of Nature (God) can be trusted.



It is kind of a bad argument because Descartes does not go on to tell how theories against the existence of God are wrong.



There is also the explanation of the problem of Evil. If God is supremely good, one would assume that there is a supreme Evil to balance it out, right?
However, Descartes explains that: If God is supremely benevolent and supremely powerful, then he wants there to be no evil, and there is non.
Mistakes are false judgments, and free will allows mistakes.



Fuuuuurthermore.



You will likely, (and hopefully), discuss in class something that Descartes mentions nearly obsessively: minds & bodies. Descartes is a Dualist, and believes that the two substances the world is made up of are minds and bodies, and humans are the only creatures with minds.
I'm not sure if it's discussed in the fifth or sixth meditation, but there is a mind-body problem. How are they connected? Unfortunately, all Descartes says about this are that they are tightly joined, yet separate.
Many philosophers over the centuries have tried to come up with the ideas of how minds and bodies are connected.



Okay, I'm tired of writing... so... if you have any more questions, you can email me.

Most people on yahoo answers will pick the answer they want to hear not always what they need to hear, but no matter what, your answer will be seen and it will help someone weather it is acknowledged or not and that has to be enough.  Remember, you are here to help people, not just get recognition.  If all you want is recognition, your struggle is just the beginning.

It means that you are intolerant of other peoples thoughts and ideas. Just because you don't agree with them, doesn't mean they are wrong and that you should get mad about them.
People might think that you are wrong. It's all about accepting what other people think and learning to balance it, look at it with an open mind and let things influence they way you think.
Otherwise you will never allow yourself to learn or to be wise.

Grow up. That's how you manage it. The world does not necessarily think the same way you do. To you something may sound good, but to another it may not. Get used to that, because that's pretty much what life is all about. If someone disagrees with your point of view, there's not a doggone thing wrong with them--or the disagreement. It only means they AREN'T YOU. You're being extremely immature, and if you ever want to be listened to as a reasonable adult, you should learn to tolerate differences in opinions and viewpoints. Otherwise, you'll have this problem for the rest of your life, and you'll be pretty miserable.

A life without love is no life at all



You would still be living but it would be a miserable existence for many.  Love keeps us happy, its a reason to stay alive, it gives us a purpose, it makes us feel like we're wanted, it gives us hope and peace.  Without love we would be lonely, very lonely, especially if you're talking about the absence of a family's love, a husband/wife's love, friend's love, pets love, people love, etc.  There would be no one to share your life with, you want to enjoy the pleasure and joy of life with someone otherwise you're just living for yourself and you're alone.

Till you dont encounter love, life is normal, colors are blurred, but you dont feel that you are missing something.
Once love enters your life, that's when you realise the power of it, and the need of it. It then becomes a necessity and you cant live without it, coz  it adds that jazz to your life.

Life without love is an error in perception. To me, this says that you are not giving love but only expect it to be given to  you. The truth is, (at least I think it is) that unless you give love FIRST you are doomed to not have it returned to  you. Like energy attracts like energy.

Really great question!  What gives me purpose in life is not always the same thing day after day.  My purpose is what I decide it is on any given day.  I have multiple interests that make life worth living.  One of the things I enjoy the most is knowing that opportunity is unlimited.  We just may have to fine tune our vision to be able to see the opportunities that are presented to us.

Well I think for me it would be love, because without it there isn't really any reason to continue living. And with love you can make other people happy and that's how you get to enjoy life. Remember you could be the richest person in the world, but without love all that money isn't worth anything because you don't have anyone to share it with.

First, without desire there would be no goals.  Belief in oneself is the same thing (kind of) as confidence.  You need desire to have goals and confidence in yourself to carry those goals out.  If you don't believe in yourself, you will never meet any of your goals because you will not even try.

I think people feel a responsibility to themselves to believe in themselves because they understand that other people won't....and don't HAVE to. We've grown accustomed to being failed by people around us for whatever reason, so if nobody else is going to push us to achieve our goals or believe that we can do anything, the only people we have left is ourselves.



We can't blame others' unbelief in us for our failures. We can, however, blame our own.

I think that certainty destroys exspression, freedom, chance and love. You might as well live in communist China or somewhere else where your life is already set out for you. Certainty should be the last thing you ever want to confront if your a free living, free thinking individual. I'd say go and read some Nietsczhe and revalue all values, daily and remember survival of the fittest and the Superman. The only certainty is were all going to die. Don't live like a shackled brain dead pensioner whilst you can flip off someone on the way to work or tell some stranger they're beautiful. Live fast....

Yes, because the only thing that is certain in this world are maths. They never fail if correctly applied.
There is no  real way of being certain about something. This same world is uncertain. But I do not mean you should doubt about everything. But you should just be sure that you know nothing.
It's something weird to explain.
Now, about your question, if yo are very sure abot something, you'll be most tempted to defend yor "sureness" at any cost. That's why I do  think being certain is truly dangerous.

Psychologically a fixed position is probably fine whilst your e on the winning side but when  the man made psychological edifice crumbles with the weight of introjects needing support the mind is at risk.



I suppose this could be borne out in the 19th century english social history - when the working class didn't get their political demands met they turned to religion.

Q/"If I am responsible for safety-critical software, do I need an automated tool that will tell me a good set of version numbers of software ?"



A/( by Fortunata's Wisdom )



"The possession of a good indicator software programme assists in navigating through all analytically foreseen factors arising from discrepancies or adjustments. Software programmes usually run with the backing of a support system to collaborate with the smooth running of the software. All such implementations and pre-programmed and subject to intermittent assessment to ensure optimum function."

For those of you who watch artificial Intelligence?



~Is David a person?
~Do the swintons have the moral obligation for the care and well being of David?
~Does society have the moral obligation for the care and well being of mechas?
~IS society justified in the way they treat mechas?
~If you were in the same situation of the Swinton family, what would you do and why?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



~Is David a person?
In the strictest definion no, but, A.I. asumed the "soul" doesn't exist, so, if all it takes for there to be a person is a complex enough brain, by that definition then yes he was.  Within the atheist context of the movie, yes, David was a person, if all it takes to make a person, is a complex enough brain.



~Do the swintons have the moral obligation to....
As a sentient being yes they did; they had no right to just discard him when they got their own son back.  Most white Americans have the attitude of "its mine; I can do whatever the hell I want with it."  Well if we are gonna use that logic; Osama Bin Laden's terrorists are his, he can do whatever the hell he wants with them.  Right?  Its hard to put that logic into words, but I'm sure my illustration made the point clear as to the moral obligation of the Swintons.
~Does society....
Here is my most cold hearted answer; for the environment's sake, yes.  Using and discarding mechas like that created gross amounts of pollution.  Some of the most dangerous objects to the environment, the biggest land and river killers, are none other than computers.  Computers as complex as mechas would do unbelievable harm to the environment and the irresponsible manner in which they were discarded was not just disgusting, it was also dangerous and stupid.  A single mecha probably had enough toxins in it to kill half a forest; the chemistry involved to make just one of those things has to be complex right?
~Society justified?
Am I justified for taking a dump in the glass I use 5 minutes later to drink milk out of without removing the feces first?  Again, this goes back to the environmental issues; more because of an environmental argument, than their, ah, "humanity," I would be for sanitary disposal of the mechas at least, and to satisfy emotional people, painless deactivation.
~I probably would have had David deactivated; knowing full well he would outlive all of my family, crap man, put him out of his misery!  I mean, the argument regarding David comes down to the same arguments regarding abortion; a woman cold hearted enough to do that, should not be breeding to start with so I say let her do it, let women have a choice.  Rather than have the state Penn fry her serial killer son, as evil women raise evil men, it is better if she did law enforcement's job well before any lives were taken.  A woman, can badly wreck the emotions of a man if she has had a lifetime to do damage to him; if there is a blood relation, the damage has got to be unreal.  Me?  I suffered from abuse by a psychotic whore all my life, but I can be cold hearted about it and brush it off, simply because we are not blood relatives.  Now, if it was my own biological mother who did to me what that psycho did crap man, let me tell you, I would probably be hurting, and BAD.  Probably bad enough to be a serial killer; when someone unrelated does something, it hurts, but only a superficial level you will eventually forget unless its something serious like rape, however when a blood relative does something bad and hurtful to you, it can smart for years.  The fact that I am not a criminal psychopath in prison from having canibalized someone is one of the ways I knew, suspected, a long time ago, that we were not related, figuring that if we were, the abuse would hurt badly enough, to make me angry enough to actually kill.  However I have not done that, and I still have my sanity, at least most of it.



I know from bitter experience that sometimes it is better to not be even born, especially with malicious baby stealing ashkenazi whores running around; I swear to God man, ANY ashkenazi woman gives me crap, I will f*cking destroy her, tear her f*cking head of verbally.  After what one of them did to my mom, I am not ready to take bratty b*tch **** from ANY of them.  Israeli and American Jewish men may be big enough p*ssies to bend over and take it, but I sure as hell won't.



My situation, was indeed very similar to David's in fact I think my real name is David.  As someone who can speak for the character, more or less, I say, he should have been shut down.  There are people out there, who would psychologically abuse me, and physically assault me, knowing what happened to me, what was done to my family but its alright though, its alright; I am almost hoping they will physically assault me so that I can cut loose.



Sorry about that; the movie made my blood boil, with me it hit a little too close to home.

No. I am not an expert in Philosophy but whenever I read something related to it and I don't understand the concept, I do my research and it's funny but so far, any explanation I have found, makes perfect sense. Of course, each description of any philosophical word, means something different to each person.

Kierkegaard, anyone?



I think that there's a level of vagueness that seduces the reader, one that makes the philosophy flexible enough to conform to many readers' personal biases.



It's also true that professors like to have big, complicated stuff to lecture about.  How are you going to go on for 50 minutes at a time if the philosopher's primary writings are no harder to understand than a cookbook?



So I don't think that they make NO sense--but that their vagueness does fill a desire for some readers.

Philosophy and Science Students please explain (to) me How (the)Sun do Stuggle (struggles) with his (its) Gravitational force whole life?



i know that sun conversts 600 million tons of hydrogen into 595 millions tons of helium in one second.



COMMENT:
Wow!  If that is a true statement the sun converts 5 million tons of mass completely into energy every second.  Destroying about 4 or 5 ounces of mass blew Hiroshima and Nagasaki out of existence in World War II.  Just think what would happen if the sun's gravity did not hold the sun together by preventing it from blowing apart.  About 8 minutes after our huge "natural hydrogen fusion bomb" blew itself apart, the effects of such an explosion would reach earth and blow earth apart as the atom bombs did to 2 Japaneze cities in WWII.



They weren't even hydrogen fusion bombs.  Just nuclear fission bombs.  Hydrogen fusion bombs are exponentially more powerful.



QUESTIONER:
but i not understand how sun do struggle with his graviation force whole life.



ANSWER:
It's matter of the balance between a hydrogen bomb's explosive outward pressure and the enormous gravitational forces which tend to make our sun collapse into a black hole.  The balanced and counteracting forces result in a nice round hydrogen bomb that does not blow itself apart and does not collapse into a black hole.

Look for self-forgetting below:



Lord, make me a channel of thy peace,
Where there is hatred, I may bring love;
Where there is wrong, I may bring forgiveness;
Where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
Where there is error, I may bring truth;
Where there is doubt, I may bring faith;
Where there is despair, I may bring hope;
Where there are shadows, I may bring light;
Where there is sadness, I may bring joy.



Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted;
To understand, than to be understood;
To love, than to be loved.



For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.



That is my answer: self-forgetting.

Tell them to think of the smell of strawberries and imagine they could see that.



I know that sounds crazy, but I think strawberries smell red.



Does the blind person in question still get some random flashes of "color" in his optic sensory area?  If so tell him that the one that looks like strawberries smell is red.

It's impossible to describe color to a person who's been blind from birth. They have absolutely no reference point you can compare it to.

You then said "hehehe" as if you weren't really serious, but that is a very thought provoking question.



Not having been around blind people I really don't know if that is an issue or not, but how would one try and explain anything visual yet not physical to a blind person?



To try, I would describe red at "hot" blue as "cold"  and such. I do wonder if one who has never experienced sight can even comprehend that. It makes our ability to see something special though doesn't it?

Some people are so finely tuned, they can feel the vibration eminating from the spectrum, strong to weak. Sort of like reflective heat, to us less sensitive souls.
I'd attempt it, by



A: Feel  ..appealing to RED's particular vibration. The blind may attune, in time. After all we only see colour as the ray hits it and bounces back.(crude science, sorry) Red is at an extreme end (my guess is 2nd strongest, apart from white, hence: 2nd longest ray?)...I'd have to swat up on spectrum!!



B: Emotional appeal ..Red is often associated with Warning signs, Fire trucks, Danger, Passion or Anger ,High Energy, Excitement ,Hot



C:Musical ..Note  some people actually Hear colours! WOW I wonder if RED is loud, too?



D: Taste  ..as with C I don't think it is linked, particularly to red foods, again.. I'd have to get my research, right!



Our senses are quite probably linked. We, in general, have probably become more dopey as a species, me thinks.

There are always two sides of a coin. While technology has enabled us to do things faster, as well as communicate with people across the globe, it has reduced our quality of life too. Do you ever notice that because of the efficiency that comes with using computers to do our assignments/work, we put more pressure on ourselves to perform even faster? And do you ever notice that because we are so readily contactable all around the hours 24/7, we get less rest time and get occupied even more?

Yes you do need a thesis.  What you have posted as your question is very confused.  Science and Morality are two separate and entirely different things.  It is not the purpose of Science to save human kind (what ever that means).  Save it from what?  Morality does focus more on human kind but it is more directed at how to live peacefully in a society - again not the 'saving' of it.  Science deals with learning about the natural - meaning the real physical - world that we live in and are a part of.  It might be a true statement to say that Science can't save humanity, but that is deceptive because Science doesn't even seek to do that.  Its like saying the game of Golf can never find the cure for cancer.  That is a true statement, but Golf doesn't seek to find a cure for cancer so what is the point of saying that?

What are the theories of Ontology?



I have a philosophy test today and i hate this class, my professor makes it so boring and confusing. anyways, he mentioned that he is going to give us an essay about 4 Theories of Ontology, i can't find them anywhere, can someone PLEASE help me , thank you

</answer from>



<answer>



Basic theories of ontology
The spectrum of ontology research spreads from account of existence in the world by philosophers to building models of concrete targets by computer scientists. In spite of its wide spectrum, each enterprise needs firm and sound basic theories such as mereotopology, theory of identity, and theory of dependence. All the three theories collectively provide us with guidlines in building concrete ontologies of interest and in investigation of definitions and operation of basic semantic links such as is-a, part-of, instance-of. Thus, the three theories play important roles not only in the basic research but in application settings.



We are currently involved in establishing an ontological semantic theory of semantic links. The following are the current topics of interest:



What is the difference between instance-of and member-of links(a class　and a set)?



What is the difference between is-a and part-of links?



What is the difference between meta-object and super-sub relations(instance-of and is-a)?



How many types of part-of links do we need?



What is an instance of a relation?



Can't the concept of "husband" have an instance?

Im pretty sure something is wrong with your premises.



The only way to arrive at G is is through Disjunctive Syllogism in K∨G with a ~K.



The only way to arrive at K∨G is through Constructive Dilemma in
(~P ⊃ K) • (~R ⊃ G) and ~P∨~R. You already have the latter of the two.



The former of the two can only be proven via Modus Ponens in a true antecedent. But the antecedent is obviously false, since it is a conjunctive statement and N is false.  We know N is false because ~N is a conjunct in your third premise



See that? G is hidden in only one spot... in the consequence of a conditional.  Since the premise is false, there is no way to assert the truth value of the consequence

You may have heard of many people who just believe in ' Doing' not just talking.God has sent us on the earth to perform our duty.
Now the question arises... what performance? one can say that he wants to do  everything for himself (just living for himself) also there is a class of eople who just live for others..they rise form the ashes just to help the needy one. You will find them somewhat rarely.
Now if we talk about the lips that pray... yes they also have a sense of humanity, care, affection but they do net perform. They do not take action.Until and unless one is daring enough to come out and perform he is of no sense.
Ypu may argue that the prayers will reach the GOD and HE will make all the things right. But HE will not do anything because there should be a 'means' througt which HE will perform. Also the problems come to test the level of the feeling to sacrifice for others inthe person...This is how the world is all running & progressing.

It means that actions speak louder than words. You can pray and preach all you want about how you're gonna change the world through your charitable acts, but it still doesn't make a difference in the end when you don't put your words into action. Those who actually get their hands down on the dirt which nobody else wants to touch, and yet speak nothing of it, are those who are the true 'kindred spirits' who are worth a lot more than those people who like to brag big.

~*~ Happiness ~*~
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
"Happiness is like a crystal,
Fair and exquisite and clear,
Broken in a million pieces,
Shattered, scattered, far and near.
Now and then along life's pathway,
Some shining fragments fall;
But there are so many pieces
No one ever finds them all.
You may find a bit of beauty,
Or an honest share of wealth,
While another, just beside you
Gathers honour, love, or health.
Vain to choose or grasp unduly,
Broken is the perfect ball;
And there are so many pieces
No one ever finds them all.
Yet the wise, as on they journey,
Treasure every fragment clear,
Fit them as they may together,
Imagining the shattered sphere,
Learning ever to be thankful,
Though their share of it is small;
For it has so many pieces



No one ever finds them all."

The way you ask the question offers limited options.  Yes, you can pursue happiness, but there's absolutely no guarantee that you're going to find it, and, let's face it, a lot of people don't.  From what I can tell, our lives are works-in-progress, and maybe we're a bit naive in thinking that we should be looking for an end point in which we'll always be happy; maybe what life is about is enjoying the ride, and being as happy as we can with whatever problems and opportunities life offers to us.  If you're willing to unconditionally love, and most people aren't willing to do that, then, yes, you can have happiness with another person forever.  It really helps to love others if you love yourself first.  It's also possible to love yourself, others and everything else that exists in creation.  After all, what do we really know about our capacity to love?

You have happiness, the emotion confused with the phrase "the pursuit of happiness" which means freedom to live your life as you see fit.



Happiness is an emotions, "the pursuit of happiness"  is a social contract. Following your heart has everything to do with the second one and nothing to do with the first one.

I am going to give the most simplistic answer possible.



You walk by Bloomingdale's and gaze in the window.  You see something that catches your eye.  (It may not even be sold there - just a window prop.)



You think to yourself - I want that.  You save up, track the item down, buy it and bring it home.  Do you like the way it looks once it's in your home?  Did you stop looking in the Bloomingdale's window?  Are you satisfied with that item and now don't have to buy anything else ever again?



How many times have you thought you wanted something and then once you had you realized it wasn't what you'd thought it would be?  The perfect guy for you turns out to be not so great after all?  Those shoes that would go perfectly with that dress just didn't seem to really work out like you wished.  That fantastic job became mediocre at best.  That trendy bag stopped being trendy the minute you bought it.  You can apply the same logic to material goods as to deep relationships - sometimes we think or hope things will be better than they truly are.  Sometimes we get bored with perfection and seek out something messy.



It isn't always about fear.  Sometimes the perfect thing today, isn't the perfect thing tomorrow.  Yesterday the perfect meal would have been down home Southern BBQ ribs and pulled pork sandwiches.  Today I'd rather have oyster Po'Boys and a salad.  Tomorrow, I think I'd like Thai food but I'll settle for a tunafish sandwich on seven grain bread (which is what I had today for dinner with miso soup).



The point is happiness is a state of mind.  It is very much a "now" phenomenon.  It doesn't matter if you were happy before.  What matters is how you feel now and what that will do for you later.  That's why happiness can seem so elusive.  It's not something you can plan on in advance.  It either happens in the moment or it doesn't.

I've never heard it put quite like that but it is the truth.  It is a chase and we seldom, if ever, attain it.  I am told that happiness comes from within, which only makes me wonder what happened to me.  Happiness is so fleeting.  I once has a pewter ashtray that said around the rim of it "Happiness . . . Yesterday's Dream . . . Tomorrow's Memory."  That about sums it up for me.

Obviously, some of us do not believe we were "put" on this planet--we believe that there are natural forces (which may or may not incorporate a deistic God) that developed this planet in such a way that we emerged--evolved--developed.



Existentialist philosophy, especially, says that we must work our way through the existential void, once we realize we are in it, to create our own worthwhile purpose for our existences.

i do get fed up, i try and try everyday but it still seems that i am not moving forward, that i just go round in circles doing the same thing again and again. I don't think there is a good reason why i was put on this earth. There are people who can make a real real difference to hundreds of people and that's their reason, but for me i have always known what i wanted to do and no amount of 'you could be doctor or a surgeon if you wanted to be' changed my mind.



I've always wanted to be a teacher and intend to keep studying hard to be a teacher. I know that a teacher can make an incredible difference to a child's life, many teachers of mine did, but i don't think that is my reason for being here. I don't think i actually have a reason for being here and any good that i do is just a bonus.

It seems that all things have their specific purposes, and their own places, among all things: plants, animals, insects, microbes, ocean, land, clouds, wind and rain, all, as though all are connected to one common purpose, to one singular being; as though all forms and their subjective functions are but the manifestations of the purpose of one reality, and all performances, specific duties, special roles, and acts of specific meaningfulness, are within some grand unison of one universal design.



This is as if there are many strings of various lengths, and vibrations, or many keys of various notes, on an instrument, but in the mind of the virtuoso incognito all notes, their tones of vibrations, come together in a single symphonic rendering, of a jingle or a song. Then the jarring effects of natural causes that to human’s ear sound out of tune, barring human senses from its delight and appeasement, to the levels where, ease of thought, of a fantasy or a dream, begins to shatter, and breaks into pieces, the jitters of unanswerable questions, aiming at nowhere and pointing at nothing, but there all the time nevertheless, as the very reality of the mind.



There is nowhere in the universe to be found an existence questioning, perpetually perplexed, dubious, and marred by self-doubt, other than that of Man; all things except have their purposeful capacities, and no room for a questioning thought about what may lie beyond their nature, except for Man. Man would question, the human mind would explore possibilities beyond nature, beyond natural form and natural function of our heart and body and mind. Man alone have additional room for thought, for questioning, and the purpose of questioning seems to be to question all purposes, to find what might we have in us aside what nature has fixedly set.



We seek to know as what is the purpose of our being in this universe, and then with that, what is the purpose of the universe itself, of existence, and of life. These, and the questions like these, even before they are considered for any answering, I think, reveal a great deal about us, i.e. perhaps about the presence of the very thing that we feel is missing, the answers. We need answers, as the reason, of our being, ‘on this planet’.



Ø	We reason: if there are the questions then where are the answers?
Ø	We see that there is nowhere that answers are to be found, aside ourselves who at least have questions.
Ø	Then let us turn back, and meditate upon life, for the questions we have, a little longer.
Ø	As, why only we have the questions?
Ø	May be we are the answers ourselves, i.e. would we not find it amusing if the answer would be looking for itself, with a question standing in the way each time?



I think what hinders our searching is the same things spurs us along to find, the questioning mind that stand in between the mind exploring itself, between us and us waiting to be found, and in this the loftier the questions we ask the higher the expectations become that we have about ourselves. We would never be fed up being here, being alive, and being inquisitive, as all the searches in their ultimate points to us, and all the wildest paths of our searches are laid to eventually lead us back home.

A good reason is to help other people, I think... I am fed up sometimes, but then I think God put me here for a reason and if I succeed in helping at least one person a day, I feel life is worth living... Take care and try to find your peace of mind because life is a real mystery and only God has all the answers... I suppose... God bless you!

No,  I'm not fed up yet!  Though there are times I feel tired when responsibilities seem humongous.  Still never thought of running away from it all.  Intermittent rests do just fine.



Do not have any idea of God's plans for myself.  But since I've been given this human form with all its trials and tribulations,  he must be watching whether I buckle under or sail through!  I feel its a test of some kind.

Not only am I not fed up, I am extremely grateful that I live in a world where such things as love, compassion, gratitude, forgiveness and joy are readily available to those people who are willing to have more of them in our lives.

Poetry is an art form and as such the whole point of poetry is that it simply SOUNDS good. And that is what people are supposed to appreciate. Of course the more impressive the poem is the more emotion it can evoke in the reader who might believe it. But the fact is it does not have to be factual at all.



In my mind, your question would get more nods if you substitute the word "poets" with journalists or politicians.

What makes you say that poets don't write the truth? Often poets express the grievances they face with their countries, such as social porblems, as well as their own issues with their family, culture, identity etc. I think poets are honest through their poems, if they seem otherwise, it is usually due to their deliberate use of sarcasm which seems to indicate the opposite view, even though they may mean an entirely different thing.



But anyway, if your question is not about poets, but it's about journalists, then yea there probably are more of such people in the media who tend to hide the hideous truth from others. But US journalists are pretty honest, I think, since they uncovered lots of scandals. =)

There can be as many identities hidden or manifest of a person as many there are possibilities of interaction with an outside world. I think this could even be more that that, there could also be a separate identity for each things or a person we might have in our mind, as we by our very nature like to imitate to varying extents all things that we encounter, i.e. to see if we can fit in, or if something can in us, if we together can live in peace, is there danger, or a cause of concern, and if we are relatively better, if yes then how, lest we should be worse. These things and countless many more in our mind urge to interact with other things, but before that, observe and measure up.



This, in common sense, is just like the way we get dressed up for various reasons: for parties, for social gatherings, for outing, while with friends, and family, at work or play, we have various different costumes, robes, dresses, gears, kits and outfits that we discretely for different occasions. Our identities that we use for instance here on the net too server our various purposes, of various personas that are all but within ourselves in response to that world that we keep outside. Our identities are in fact aspect of our self that is called by a formal name; this is true.

We don't know for sure whether or not free will exists. So far, no law of physics yet discovered has any conscious intelligence to it. Supposedly, then, the brain is just a very large system of interacting particles, and thus we are complicated chemical automata. In this case there is no such thing as free will. (However, if it is predetermined that a person will commit a crime, it is equally predetermined that that person faces consequences.) Then again, physics is not absolutely deterministic - there is a possibility that the basic element of free will is the uncertainty inherent in particle wavefunctions (viz. the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). What a fascinating possibility! You might read up on "quantum consciousness" if you're interested.



As far as pure neuroscience goes, there are two results that interest me (unfortunately I can't find these papers again):
* The action potential for a movement appears to occur a fraction of a second before the person consciously registers the will to perform that action (that is, the final decision to commit to that action). This suggests that perhaps we do indeed behave exactly as our chemical system is commanded by neurotransmitters and hormones, reducing us to automata - and that the conscious mind retrospectively interprets our actions, making us think that we have free will, or making us feel emotion (e.g. first you punch somebody, a split second later you think that you feel so angry at this person that you've just decided to be physically violent). However, I am not sure that the time at which a conscious decision is made can actually be measured - I would have to consult the literature.



* A test subject is told to randomly decide to either raise the left hand or raise the right hand. Predictably, lefties raise the left hand a bit more often than 50% of the time, and righties raise the right hand a bit more often than 50% of the time. But when an electromagnetic field is applied to the left side of the brain only, the test subject has a 80% chance of raising the right hand. So do we really have free will? Conceivably, a stronger magnetic field could effect mind control (raising one hand 100% of the time).

From the religious viewpoint, there is a free will and a person has accountability for his actions. We are given a free will to choose what you want in this life, whether it is good for you or bad for you. You are given a free will because you are responsible for what you see, to decide upon what goals you want to achieve and thus you are accountable for your decisions.



The scientific study of the nervous systems underwent a big increase in the second half of the twentieth century, due to revolutions in molecular biology, electrophysiology and computational neuroscience.  In terms of the brain and neuroscience, there is a continuing debate on the matter of free will or accountability of one's action.



Good luck to you.

What category does this question fall under in philosophy?



Does the universe have a purpose? Does life have a purpose?



I do not want to attribute these questions to the wrong definition.  Metaphysics has to do with existence and being.  Epistemology has to do with theories of knowledge.



I was thinking my questions fall under epistemology, because it involves pursuing the truth concerning the purpose of life, is this correct?



For those that wanna know why I am doing a paper on these questions and although an A student philosophy is a challenging subject for me, but I really like it.

well im glad you like philosophy.



i think you messed up a bit on the definition of metaphysics. that's not quite what it is entirely. the definition you gave is actually a sub-branch of metaphysics called Ontology. the study of beings or what exists in this world. not even necessarily existence itself as a subjective experience. for that, i think, would be called existentialism. this deals with the typical "what is the purpose of life" type stuff, in trying to give meaning and value to it.



however a very similar question to your first question in dealt with in metaphysics. and that is "why is there something rather than nothing". its a bit different than what you're asking, but close.

I wouldn't use the same standard in the question. Any object can be ascribed a purpose or a function. A rock is a rock. That rock can be used as a tool or as a weapon. We are the ones who describe what the function and purpose of an object.



The universe is not 'alive'. The universe lacks the basic features to be included as life.

We are born to be happy, to enjoy life, to be responsible to ourselves and others, based on the law of cause and effect.  You cannot become happy, for instance, by making another person unhappy.  Orthodox buddhists call this the law of Nam myoho renge kyo...devotion to the ultimate reality through causes for harmony.  This is a question of life philosophy.

Philosophy help please!?



I asked a philosophy question yesterday and was given some great answers. Can anyone help me out with these two?



Consider the following response to a critique: "On your view, you have the same problem you accuse me of having."
I know this seems silly, but what are the strengths and weaknesses of this retort in a philosophical manner?



On a different note, how is 'special pleading' in real life arguments loosely related to the crime of 'lost contrast' in philosphical arguments?

Happiness is a state of mind, and does not equal money. The grease monkey who used to fix my car won $500,000 lottery last year. He closed his shop, went on for extended vacation, spent all that money and back to where he was. Now I am not sure if he is happy at all. Actually, he wishes he had not won that lottery. Money is helpful to  to some degree, but it is not the end all. So be happy of what you have, work hard and you would value what you have earned  more than a wind fall.

If it has to be a choice between the two, choose the happiness.



Money doesn't make people happy, It can only enhance your happiness if you are already a happy person.



It's all about knowing yourself, what troubles you.
Some people have pains and voids so deep, they look to the money and the things it can buy. They try to fill the voids with material things, but these are just temporary distractions and sometimes addictive highs (like food or drugs) and then sometimes crash and burn.



On the other hand, if you are already a happy, joyful person who finds their completeness in other things- like God or education or love or community service etc. etc.- money can give you more of an opportunity to expand your base and in that, you can be extremely fulfilled, but only if you use the money right.



In a nutshell, you have to first find happiness outside of money in order for money to make you happy.



To your question though, I would ask you if you are a happy person already.
If so, you have no need to be jealous. What you have is harder to come by than money. Maybe not the lottery, but if you plan a good idea and work hard at it, you can have money too, and you will actually appreciate and value it more because you made it yourself.

A lot of people jump on this question and immediately say 'I choose happiness'. However, what if you already have happiness? Would you take the money if you won the lottery?



I would. Why not? I do not worship it (and never have), or take it for granted (very rarely maybe done that), or want it more than I want my happiness (who would choose money over God?), but it sure would help a lot of people who have nothing, wouldn't it?



Since I have the natural ability to share, and the knowledge that money (properly delegated) can be distributed to help others create a better life for themselves, I know that God would allow me to have possession of a large amount of money. He already knows what I would do with it. I do not care about 'worldly' anything. My gifts and rewards are waiting for me in a far better place than this!



ps. I am not jealous in the least... I am happy for your friend! If he won it, he probably had a need that God fulfilled with the lottery winnings.

Well it depends on what you believe in. If you believe in the bible and God, then it explains it all.



If not then you can basically look at all the crazy people out there. I believe that is a darn good reason to have rules. If we did not have rules, the world would be a lot crazier then it is now.

Which type of rules do you mean? The ones that say that if you dive off a high cliff onto rocks you won't survive? The ones that say if you chop off a hand it doesn't grow back? The earth, and we as a part of it, are just built a certain way, and our nature imposes rules.



Or do you mean the rules (as in laws or customs) imposed by people on other people? They're there because it's possible for a person who obeys no laws at all to make life unlivable for others. (Obviously, a murderer is an example.) So every society finds it necessary to make rules, and that means it has to come up with some decision-making process (voting, armies, religious obedience, whatever) to decide what the rules are, and then it has to come up with some way to impose them (jail, executions, fines, banishment, whatever).



Whether we're talking about the laws of nature and of physical consequences, or those of governments, religions and social customs, they are necessary tools for survival. Any society that ignored the need for them would not survive; hence, we have rules because we're descended from and part of a society that demonstrated the capacity to survive.

Yes, I often do find it very dull, but only because it is so heavily dominated by people who insist on false assertions as the basis for discussion.



I just wrote a response to someone in Books and Authors who wondered if others saw a similarity between modern society and George Orwell's "1984." That similarity is real, and it's why politics is becoming a dull subject here and now (as it certainly was in Orwell's imaginary future).

Politics may be dull, but that is only because it is politics for all, if politics was an individual thing then a person could get interested in it. Since the politicians have the imposable job of trying to please all the people all the time, discussion is dull for the individual but for a population, political interest where each individual takes a bit, this will make everyone happy.

i only find it tedious when real politicians are doing the talking. by that i mean those involved in politricks. those that speak for image, in order to get elected, that just say what they think you want to hear. this i find boring.



but politics in generali find important and good conversation. not politics in the party sense, in the current government sense, necessarily. but politics as in how the world should be run, kind of politics in the wholesome philosophical, scientific sense.



your philosophy, if it was shared by all those in your country, in a democracy, would result in you being led by evil men.



because you live in a democracy talking about politics is your job and your duty. imo anyways.

Can someone help me generalize this question in philosophy?



Does the universe have a purpose? Does life have a purpose?



I'm a first year philosophy student and lets say I have basic knowledge.  Now my question if it makes sense would be what would I reference these questions to, knowledge or existence?  I am asking because I truly do not know and I'm having a hard time.



So far I've come up with we know that the universe exist, because duh its here, so therfore these questions have to do with knowledge, or Epistemology?  Is this correct?



</question>

I'm not asking people to answer these questions but to categorize them for me.

Maybe the purpose of the universe is to exist the way it present it.  As for our lives, it seems to me that we most definitely have meaning and purpose to our existances on this planet.  In my experience, there's nothing more wonderful, important or powerful than love, and I'm just a beginner in finding out about this subject.  The fact that love is so powerful has led me in the direction of believing that we do have a purpose, and that purpose is to be the best human beings we can possibly be.  If you believe we have free will...and I do...then you believe we get to make all kinds of choices about our lives, including whether or not life has a purpose.  Best wishes in coming up with whatever set of answers work for you!

well the real question you have to ask yourself is how do you know something exist? because you can see it and smell it and hear it and feel it? or does it exist because you believe it exist? 100 years ago the world was flat but we now know this to be false because we now have the tools to measure it. a dream can seem real we can feel it and see it, have you never woken from a dream strewn with emotion, does that not make a dream real? reality is all based on perception, perhaps the universe it self is nothing more than a dream, perhaps the universe is really nothing but a black hole and we are spinning endlessly in it?
The fact of knowing is never really a fact but rather popular opinion.

These questions and your answers are all very different.



A universe existing and a universe having a purpose are two very different things. Your question was does it have a purpose? Ask yourself, what purpose does it serve for you?



Your next question is does life have a purpose? This question is to be answered differently by everyone; those who commit suicide think not, those on wall street believe it is to make the most money, those at home with a family believe it is to be happy. First decide what's important to you, then figure out what you believe your purpose to be.



I hope this helps!

You're on the right track, but you aren't quite there yet. The difference between what you're asking and epistemology is:



"Does the universe/life have a purpose?"
and:
"How do we know this?"



The second question is where you enter the realm of epistemology.

what it is to be human, to be human one must act according to emotion, no other animal on earth acts on pure emotion like a human does. Animals are built to act on Instinct yet humans have lived their life mostly on emotion how does that make you feel? i love her. i am angry so i fight, I am depressed so i sleep. etc etc.
Humans are emotional beings but another human trait is we have choice, to do what it is we want we are not subject to the strongest survive but are subject to our own will.
that is what makes us human.

The only answer I can find that sounds sensible is the one in the bible:



"I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness." (Romans 6:19)



Through our weaknesses as humans, God can transform us from immorality to being spiritually pure. It is because we are his children and He loves us that much. For me personally, He used a manic episode that I was going through which sent me to my knees, begging for help and I cried so much for a long time. I didn't sleep for many nights in a row. I was terribly confused and something happened to my memory. I couldn't remember the simplest things. Afterward, I felt so relieved that the pain was gone. That was my experience. It's different for everybody.

No, forgiveness is something that comes from us, and it in no way implies that anybody is being encouraged to make mistakes or do anything else.  Simply because you find forgiveness in your heart for somebody doesn't mean that you have to give that person the same responsibilities or more ways that they can make mistakes.  If you know the person is mistake-prone, you can forgive them, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be blind to their capacity to mess things up.

After much trying and betrayal and hurt, I concluded that anything "too.." is not right.  Balance to everything is of crucial importance.  Being too good is enemy to being good.  Being too easily forgiving is an enemy to forgiving.  Words and attitudes really lose their meaning when used in exaggeration . Teaching people is by no means punishment.  You cannot forgive someone but you can explain to him WHY you can't do so.  Explain what has really hurt you, explain that we are in all this together and if he keeps on doing evil things he will surely receive such behavior some time in his life..  I believe that the hardest lessons are the ones given with Love.  They are hard but are the only ones that really can make the other person better.



Relationships are not only peaches and cream....  Both parties should know that all kind of behaviors have consequences. The people we love are not garbage bins.  Patience has limits.  People have self respect.  And most of all, Love's color is not exclusively Pink.

Sometimes people need to learn that what they have done really is a mistake, and that they are going to pay the consequences for it. Though it is more difficult in relationships than in governance to discipline/punish without anger becoming a factor, that is exactly what should be done -punishment/discipline should be an indication that they have done something wrong and need to correct their behavior, not an indication that they have angered you (which will only lead them to insure that they don't anger you, rather than correcting the behavior).

My dad is like this and it is extremely difficult to live with someone who is good and loving if you have jealous negative intentions because love literally eats away hate so evil people will decay around good people.  I know this from my own experiences of being an evil person.  You must give up your desires to hurt others and hate and extend love to all.  Love is so powerful that if you love a jealous person you render him helpless - exposed in the light of truth and reality.

I think it's okay to be too good or too forgiving person but then if you're talking about in a relationship or parenting then there's a lot of problems in the relationship or parenting. The question is that why is the child behaving in a that sort of way that the parent have to keep forgiving him/her? same goes in a relationship. Maybe becoz the parents are setting a bad example for the child and they themselves need some help. Maybe becoz you rely too much on your partner or you're over caring which may led your partner to be abusive or carefree or irresponsible.



Buddha and Gandhi did forgive but they also set an good example for their enemy to learn and get a sense of what is right or wrong. Eventually winning them over.

you can only forgive someone who is repentant.  being repentant means you learned your lesson, feel bad about what you have done, ask forgiveness, and won't do it again.
well established boundaries important to prevent one from becoming an enabler.

On the contrary, I think, being forgiving and good sets a good example for others to realize that we are all imperfect.  BUT, it doesn't mean we make ourselves tolerant of other's relentless wrong-doings.  Discipline is one thing, punishment is another.  People always have the chance to learn from their mistakes.  If the mistake made hurt themselves more than others, by chance, they may have already suffered the consequence of their own action. In that case, what good would it do them if we 'lash' them more?  They may be provoked to strike back,..and then what?  We may possibly retaliate,.. and before we know it, the little fire may have damaged more than expected.
But yes, we need people know if they have done mistakes. We can  tell them how grossly those mistakes can affect theirs, and others lives as well...and the call of the grimmest is in no one's hands to blame,...but theirs.

Dear P’quaint, please forgive me if my response is rude or distasteful to you.
I’ll just speak my mind and it’s going to sound contradicting.



Nobody is good enough for everybody, even my beloved teacher the Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi are good but yet not good enough to please the old and the new world.
Not everyone are able to see their goodness and instead their glory have attracted jealousy.



I commit deeds and face its consequence.
Others commit deeds and face its consequence.
There are always penalties and rewards depending on the deeds or misdeeds.
The contradicting part is, I am no one to forgive anyone yet I asked for your pardon if I hurt you. Being good and forgiving are not for expressing neither for impressing.
It’s simply for your own personal cultivation.



Your posted question has been lingering in my thought ever since I was a boy. It has made me quite a hot-temper guy, always ready to judge others, always ready to punish others. I cost me my happiness. And only the recent year have I manage to get out of it.



Who am I to judge, who am I to punish. I am not god.



Lastly, relationships are awarded to us still by means of our past deeds.



Good luck my dear lady.



Here’s one of my experience that I love to share with you.



I was brought-up in a typical traditional family where the young ones have to and must obey and respect the elders. (Sound just?)
My dad is the eldest son of his family, so after my grannies, my dad commands the most respect and authorities. In his 30s’, he’s a rich and successful businessman.



………………..To me, he’s a tyrant, a wife-beater, a child hitter, a drunken, a gambler, a playboy and ….an unreasonable arrogant. (Sound rude??hmm)
My eldest brother evolves as a tyrant too, expecting obedient from everyone younger than him. Taking into account that my dad and my eldest brother both, always thought that they are the wisest and cleverest in the family, if not the whole wide world. In their time, no one dare to oppose them.
Alone came an asshole, that’s me (sound familiar???), who never fail to oppose, argue and challenge them at my age of 9.
You can imagine how much trophy of bruises I have.
I’m not here to air my frustration, but to share with you this cute story.



For Almost 3 decades, my elder brother still insisted that he isn’t wrong. And sadly, his behavior got worse.



You may wish to be the punisher, but be warned of the above mention trophy.
You may wish to be the punisher, but be warned of being trapped in the sea of anger.
You may wish to be the punisher, but be warned that it costs you your happiness.



Oh, please forgive me for parking this story here.

First of all, I'm not sure where you get the idea that friendship is an occupation.  From what I can tell, friendship is a relationship that you enter into with other human beings (and other beings) because it enhances both of your lives.  As we go through life, we meet however many people we meet, and some of them become friends;  viewing that friendly relationship makes it sound like work.  Why would you want to have friendships based on that?

Oh boy, honey no disrespect but you can surely use a dictionary. Your vocabulary is not up to par. Friendship is not an occupation. It goes under relationship. Also pretty should be spelled correctly too. I think you should enhance yourself before "working hard gaining friendships" just a tip I am not trying to put you down. A little constructive criticism is what we all need once in awhile. :)

I think it has a double meaning. One is that, as friends we're obliged to spent our time & money with our friends, whether it's for games, movies, dinner, lending money, etc. Second one is that, it maybe referring to the life-partner as being really friendly with somebody. And being married with someone is sort of full-time occupation.

If you are truly a friend to someone then you have to be there every hour of everyday. It isn't something that you can just do when you feel like it, not if you are true friend to them. If they need you, you have to be there for them.
It's a policy many of us need to adopt because for many of us we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are now without our frinds. I know that i certainly wouldn't be

A friend is a person who fulfills a need in you and one in which you fulfill a need in them.  A friend is somebody who stands by you and believes in you--right or wrong.  A friend is there FOR you, always.  You can call a friend in the middle of the night, even on a work night, and this friend, knowing you are upset over something, will wake up and talk to you, or listen to you talk, or cry.  Whatever the need is.



If a person is truly your friend they are there for you 24/ 7 /365.  No questions asked.  They love you in spite of your faults.  They are loyal to a fault.



THOSE are the characteristics of a true friend.  My mother always told me that you are lucky if you ever have three true friends in your life, and I  have been very lucky. The day she died I lost my best friend.

&lt;Why are we born?&gt;
Because there is a purpose for our being here, whether it is [a] to gain more experience and become aware of our true selfhood, or [b] you can be here as a helper to others. We all serve in various ways to benefit mankind, everyone has a part to play in the scheme of things.



&lt;Why is life the way it is?&gt;
For those who are here to gain experience they must work through the good and bad times, difficulties come into our lives for a reason, and that is to teach us about ourselves. We learn and we grow. Now, if I did all your homework for you, would that make you a better person? Not really, because you haven't worked it out for yourself, so your understanding does not deepen and strengthen you thereby. It is necessary to face these challenges in life and find your strengths and weaknesses, plus to 'burn away' the dross and the sterling qualities will be what remains. It's a long journey we all must make.



&lt;Is there a higher self or a God?&gt;
Yes, you have a higher self and that is what you must discover when all else is said and done in your life. "Man, Know Thyself!"



No, there is no "a God" because that means a separate being, or entity, and God, the Infinite Presence is in no way separated from anything or anyone because He is the basis of all that is seen and unseen. To put it plainly, GOD IS LIFE, and you cannot divide Life. What is there to divide it by?



&lt;Or are we Gods?&gt;
If you don't mind, I'd like to quote the Bible:
"Ye are Gods" (Psalm 82, v. 6; and John 10, v. 34)
As I said, God is Life, and God the Universal Mind has formed us in His image and likeness, and this refers to our creativeness, for we also have the ability to create through our thought process when it is linked up to the Universal Intelligence. And this great Intelligence will consciously bring into your life whatever you hold as the deepest thought in your mind. This is something we have not yet fully understood - the processes of our thinking. And why? Because we've been too caught up in our reactions to life, people and things, and have not developed our inner being, our soul.

I finished off a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of shhardonay,
a bodle of Baileys, a butle of vocka, a pockage of Prunglies,

How to buy Arabic books?



I am in the Army and in Iraq. An Iraqi friend of mine picks up trash on base for a living and has a political science degree. Due to extreme censorship in the middle east he has never heard of common but controversial ideas such as "atheism."



I'd like to buy him something on or by Epicurus, David Hume, Bertrand Russel or Ludwig Wittenstein but I am unable to find any of these books in Arabic.



It is thanks to the Arabians that much of western Philosophy was saved From the Church burning books such as Plato's Republic, or Lucretius Poems. I feel I have a debt to the Arabs to give them modern and old philosophy that their "church" is now burning that we are safeguarding for the world.



Where can I find such books?

Will we survive as we do now for another 50 years? Or will civilization collapse due to global warming, peak oil, nuclear warfare, deforestation, species extinction and / or perhaps a global pandemic (disease)? I'm interested to see what most think...

I don't believe that our civilization will collapse and I'm not afraid of any major disaster that threatens human race. I don't know why, but I just don't believe this stuff. I hope our civilization will mature and in 50 years the world will be a better place for all, not just some.

Yes they do.



But the funny thing is an experiment which some psychology researchers did with psychiatrists --- who are supposed to be experts on sanity vs. insanity.



The researchers recruited pairs of psychiatrists --- both fully qualified and "sane", as well as credentialed psychiatrists.



Then the researchers told both psychiatrists, individually, that they were about to interview an uncredentialed patient who was not a psychiatrist --- but merely "thought" he or she was a psychiatrist.



On the basis of their psychiatric interview of this "patient", who had been given a uniform and a badge that said he or she was "Dr. So and So" (to keep him/her from becoming too agitated on the ward) the researchers would decide whether or not to have this "patient" (who was actually a real "Dr. So and So; Psychiatrist" and not a patient) committed to the institution to "cure" him/her of his/her delusion.



Both actual psychiatrists were told the same "patient" story about the other psychiatrist, then both were told to go interview each other as "patients".  And the more that such actually credentialed psychiatrists interviewed each other --- each supposing that the other guy was an actual "patient" --- the more that each of the real psychiatrists "thought" that each other were "nuts".



I guess it was because "patients" are supposed to answer "the doctor's" questions, while doctors are supposed to ask the questions.  So each doctor refused to answer the other doctor's "personal" questions.



And anybody who only asks questions in answer to questions is considered "nuts" by most sane people.  Hence each pair of actual psychiatrists thought that the other "patient" (actual psychiatrist) was certifiably "crazy".

Anarchists please answer. Does it require a hatred of humanity to belief in anarchy?



I say this because without laws, people would be free to rape and murder and assault without punishment or without any apprehension. As a female, it is hard for me to comprehend why anyone would want it to be okay to do this to people. The only conclusion I came to is that they must hate people. is this true? Or is there a better reason?

<additional details>



Stamps, if you are not white, under an anarchist regime, what's to stop the Ku Klux Klan or a neo-nazi killing you or your whole family? Yes, many laws are unjust and not fair to many races but with no laws there would be no protection for anybody. You've hit a raw nerve here because the one thing I hate most is being accused of being a racist. I work for a department that helps immigrants and defends them against racism. It is my entire life. And being Jewish and having members of my family killed of by racism, I would appreciate it if people didn't just blindly accuse people of being racist- my question had nothing to do with race.



thanks, I actually did objectively want to know the answer, sorry if it seems like I have a "tone" The first guy to post said he hated me (the post is gone now) just because I was ignorant on this subject.

anarchy is similar to a free-market economy.  in a free-market economy (laissez  faire capitalism), the market determines the success or failure of companies, the prices of goods, etc.  in theory, without a government, the society would adjust to deal with miscreants instead of taking an attitude of "it's not my problem"

I am not an anarchist per se.. but I do have an answer for you. Anarchists actually believe in the essential goodness of human beings, and not a hatred of humanity. They think that without governments and a centralized economy people will exchange goods through bartering, and will treat others with respect for the common good. Society will naturally reach a state of order based on mutual respect and the exchange of goods and services without money So no, they believe in the essential goodness of people.. the idea of governments as we have them now are actually based on the idea of people in a way being evil and therefore needing to be controlled by the legal system, the police, and legislation etc....  Anarchists believe that power corrupts (as it did in Stalin's case and as many argue does corrupt all U.S President's.. ) which is why people should govern themselves as they know what is best for them.



So in a way anarchism is Utopian, the goal is a perfect society where people do what they feel is best and trade their goods and services without paying tax etc... and treat each other with respect.

No! "Manner" is a relative word-----my (our) mannerism might not fit with yours. I've seen (read: experienced) so many mannerisms that are man-made or a particular society-product! It's not necessary to follow that manners by all. Probably we do have manners too, made by our men!



It's better to use the word "behavior"------and this word includes many many more qualities that enriched civilization or perhaps increased the speed of civilization towards a day-to-day development. (Civilization, I'm talking about, is not that Greek or Egyptian etc---rather civic sense related something. I've met persons with good manners from an uncivilized class.

MANNERS:
A characteristic or customary mode of acting: custom: a mode of procedure or way of acting: fashion: method of artistic execution or mode of presentation: style: social conduct or rules of conduct as shown in the prevalent customs: characteristic or distinctive bearing, air, or deportment: habitual conduct or deportment: behavior: good manners: a distinguished or stylish air.



CIVILIZATION:
A relatively high level of cultural and technological development; specifically: the stage of cultural development at which writing and the keeping of written records is attained: the culture characteristic of a particular time or place: the process of becoming civilized: refinement of thought, manners, or taste: a situation of urban comfort.



Yes, manners are necessary for civilization, as they are mentioned in both of the above definitions. My own definition of civilization? Everything that the definitions mentions, especially comfort (contented well-being).

Yes of course manners are necessary for civilization. If every one will behave in an unruly manner then then where will the word CIVILIZATION stand. Civilized people will definitely have respect for one another, they will not break the communitiy guidelines they will not do or say anything that will hurt others. Civilised people will always follow the rules laid down by the goverment and not say that rules are meant to be broken. They will try to keep their city clean and when in a jam will not block the road from all the sides so that the traffic from the other side gets blocked.

<question>



For something to exist, does it need a beginning from another source?



A few choices come to mind:
1) God is the beginning of all things. He always existed.
2) Energy itself always existed. It has always been present.
3) The big bang started everything.
4) It is impossible to explain by human logic. It is beyond us.



Now the 5th choice is the one that really concerns and scares me actually. I have this belief that in order for let's say a line to exist, I have to draw it. In order for a tree to exist, it has to get started from something. In other words it is not just there; it has to have a beginning. So someone told me to base my thinking on the idea that the Big Bang is the beginning of everything, that there is nothing before the big bang. Wouldn't the big bang need to begin from something too? And here is the fifth choice:
5) Everything started from nothing.
This is my thought because scientists say that nothing existed before it. It is the beginning. How can something start from nothing. If that was the case, then we as humans originated from nothing. That is also something I am curious about. Is there such a thing as nothing? Is there such a thing out there where nothing exists. Where Atoms aren't present? What would this be like. Any and every thought, comment, idea is welcome.



In my opinion this actually sort of supports the existence of God. Another question is what about God himself. Does the bible say how God began? Like as humans, we began from Adam and Eve. But what about God?



So I guess this whole thing revolves around the thought "Everything has to have a beginning in order to exist?" Do you agree with this idea?

According to the bible, God is the Alpha and the Omega.  The beginning and the end.  The starting point and the end point.  Take the word "nothing" and break it down.  You have " No Thing".  God is "No Thing".
God is spiritual, and existed before the Big Bang event "Thing", which preceeded every "Thing" in the universe. And since we humans were made in His image, we too originated from "No Thing".

The same thing I have been thought and came different views in mind ( first plz ignore my grammar and preposition mistake this is not my mother tongue and plz correct if I made any mistake in writing )  here I will share my views as you described well in your opinion, I will not agree or disagree to you just will show you my point of view, and in my opinion that this universe is not because of a big bang because any big bang due to of some disturbance and if this caused by big bang so why everything is in order? as sun rising sun setting in order  stars, earth movement, human birthing and dieing in under a law heart beating  bloold circulattions, animals way of life plants growing,  see everywhere everything is in order it means that someone  present who is controlling these all law and this we call GOD and where is from beginning and where is from ending this topic is very complicated and as I understood for example we have a software and capacity is 10 GB and we want to save it in space which is available is 1 GB so tell me is it possible that we could install or save this software, obviously not because 10 GB program never be save in 1 GB so I mean that this topic that where is GOD beginning  or starting this is the beyond our thinking so



even some we cant describe the things who exist what is this example we cant describe that what is the depth of space in air or how much huge this universe or how many stars blinking in the sky see in our body and try to understand the system of our body can you understand the all system all nerve system how much wire / veins in brain how kidney filtering our urine why earth is moving around the sun why all universe moving much much question we cant define cant understand this is all thing who is front of us when we cant describe these thinig who made by GOD so how we can understand that where he  came  from see when we feel pain then we say to dr that I am feeling pain and if dr will insist you that show me your pain then I will give you medicine can you show him your pain? Never but you will say that I am feeling and it existing so its better that those thing which we cant understand but these are reality and we admit them so we just obey to GOD pray to GOD and affirm that HE IS, HE WAS, AND HE WILL, leave how, why , when just acknowledge and accept this is my sincere advise to you.

In my view, logic points to the contrary. It points to a strong possibility that there is no creation, that there is only transformation. The constancy of change gives us an illusory idea as though with every change something old is destroyed and something new is created. There is absolutely nothing before us to logically presume that anything can ever be created out of nothing. That is why even if we believe in God as the Original Creator, we have no other logical option but to suppose that God Himself was not created, that His existence is eternal. In my view therefore, the creation logic to support the existence of God is flawed. If God could be presumed to be existent forever, it should be equally possible to presume that the entire existence of everything (we may call it Nature or Universe) could similarly have been forever, never needed to have been created, and ever changing and transforming thereby giving us an illusory idea of a dynamics, which however, essentially amounts to zero creation or zero destruction.



I think that those who believe in God should never make the mistake of testing it out through logic....... if God exists, He is certainly not bound by our limited logic to be properly explained or understood through our logical thoughts.

what do they get from doing e.g Nirmala Srivastava and many other ordinary people whom I have met and they have given nothing else than discouragement, making me feel that i am a failure in life, I mean even I don't understand now that am I really failed in life or they are just trying to discourage me because I am a, little bit maybe, but i think I am a good person at heart

Who am "I"? Can there be another Me?



My existence and experience is to question.  Who am "I"? My way of thinking, My personality, all things that are intrinsic to Me... do I own them?  During my birth process, what if there was a slight change in my genetic make-up? Who would I be then? Would I still be Me? Or could I be YOU in the case that you were never born?

your true identity has no identity. you tack likes, traits, personalities... onto your mind and body when borned. if you define yourself as likes, traits, personality, then I could be you, given the same environmental and biological conditions. if you define yourself further, with brown hair, hazel eyes, likes basketball, and dancing, and in specific spacial-time location simultaneously, then I couldn't be you.

A good example of what you are asking about is in a story written by George Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty Four".  In this story, the world is at war between 3 superpowers.  The people of one nation are constantly watched (BIG BROTHER) and they are constantly told on monitor screens and loudspeakers what is happening.  The catch to the story that stood out tho, was that if the Government wanted to change history to manipulate the public, they did: They changed the story, changed the images and completely wiped out every trace of what happened... then it became just a memory ... then a vague thought ... and then ...nothing.  It is a good story (and not a bad movie)  but I believe that all that has happened in History, actually did happen as the observer believed it did... in the physical world.  The catch is that the physical world is not really what we are all about and it is up to each of us to figure out who we are and why we are here.



But that's another story.



Hope this helps

I appreciate your stress in figuring out life.  For me, I backed off from trying to have "all the answers".  It is a matter of realizing you are just a grain of sand that is on a beach that goes forever.  It is a matter of your "Leap of Faith".  I learned to tone mine way down.  I just trust  (faith) I will have the answers I need to know... WHEN I need to know them.



In the mean time, I try to smell the roses... take in all the nature I can get.  Look at the small things and not worry as much about the big picture when it gets overwhelming.  You will find your way...just give yourself the time (there are no immediate answers).  That is what I have learned.



I drink diet pop around my keyboard... it isn't sticky... if I spill it.

It depends upon whether or not the Pepsi and Keyboard are real Pepsi and a real Keyboard --- or, on the other hand, merely imaginary Pepsi and an imaginary keyboard.



If real use a real damp cloth.  If imaginary just imagine cleaning the imaginary pepsi and imaginary keyboard with a (you imagined it) an imaginary damp cloth.

According to Quantum Physics, you are a collection of molecules, rushing around to give the appearance of a you!  And they are so good at it that you parents, friends and family can recognize the you, you are.
About the pepsi, depends on how much and over what portion of the keyboard.  I had to buy a new one!

Beyond the human idea of happiness, that is what beyond human thought means. The answer is no, but I just wanted to see if anyone would try to argue my point with something interesting. I understand that when it is a human thought that it can't exist outside human thought, but I am trying to see if people believe that a completely human idea can extend beyond the thought processes of humans and yes happiness is just a thought process.

What is beyond human thought? Without human thought, there is no distinct reality. The question, if the answer is yes, means that the void outside of human perception is happiness.

There are many beleaguered souls cast into caves of iniquity that appear publicly with glowing smiles and dewy eyes. Feigned happiness is generated by chemicals in the brain, when emitted over a period of three days to two weeks create an addiction to the state of happiness, whereby the brain is reprogrammed to become oblivious and impervious to anything threatening to disturb this peace and harmony so essential for living life in peace.

If happiness were caused by an amalgam of factors guaranteeing a state of happiness all would pursue it. There are certain prerequisites of happiness, a path toward this nirvana littered with fear of the unknown, hatred on a considered threat or enemy, ignorance of the unfamiliar.



The path lies within and without and the obstacles man made to ensure the ongoing struggle and suffering of mankind striving for emotional security and stability, a struggle creating a negative energy itself feeding the hatemonger’s quest for power.

1270, but I was still drunk from the night before.
590 Math
680 Verbal
On my PSAT's my math score was significantly higher than my verbal, so I suspect alcohol affects my ability to add worse than my ability to communicate. Or maybe it facilitates English Language Skills.



Also I was in high school in the 1970's.

Philosophy is actually (historically) the foundation of science, look at all the philosophers of the classical times, they observed, and then formulated a theory on how this works, and supported this with their arguments. Science nowadays has more tools to determine the cause of something, so it is more accurate.
But all the sciences (Biology, Physics, Chemistry) started with people philosophizing about natural phenomenons.

Philosophy thinks science and religion, in the form of epistemology and theology. Science and religion are objects of the philosophical thought and commentary, but philosophical discipline doesn't lead to science (which is a very specific field of knowledge, very specialized) and doesn't lead to religion either, for religion is based on faith, living experience of the divine, and thought, whereas philosophy implies doubt, research and reason. Some philosophers were believers though, but they never confused their philosophical work with their personal faith.

Science is supposed to be based on verifiable facts, and you can't verify philosophy. Although philosophy tries to base it's logic on facts, it veers off into speculations that can't be verified because philosophy is subjective in the end.



Philosophy can't lead to religion either, since religion comes to conclusions and beliefs that philosophy shies away from. Philosophy can't stay "open to" and keep it's speculations ongoing in it's search for Truth if it comes to a conclusion or forms beliefs. Philosophy can make you act more ethically, for awhile, but your philosophical thoughts die away because there isn't a written ethical code that you're following as in religion.

Yes, life is a lot easier when you are physically attractive. I used to be VERY attractive and had a killer body. I got loads of attention, people treated me differently and my confidence was THROUGH the roof. Since then, I have gained a large amount of weight and my looks have diminished. The men do not give me the time of day, people look past me and my confidence is at an all time low. As much as people want to say that looks don't matter - THEY DO!

It's relative. Sure you may receive bias in your favor because you are more attractive compared to another person. You may be able to land that job, get free stuff or discounts, or get invited to the big party.
But, and this is a big BUT, if you do receive this favoritism (especially if it is female reciprocating from a male) you cannot trust anyone or anything.



Did you nail that job interview based on your talents or because you're good-looking? Is the boss expecting you to sleep with him now because "you owe him"? Did the guy who works at starbucks charge you for a tall when you got a grande because you are a loyal customer or because he's trying to score a date with you?
Sure, you get some perks for being attractive but the loss is that one is objectified and that individual can no longer trust others' true  motives.



Additionally, I don't think it is necessarily a bad thing for a person (esp. women) to exploit their appearance to "get ahead," because in the end the individual will be judged accordingly. If you go into an interview with a plunging neckline, the interviewer might be more inclined to put you in a job position that entitles customer service while the "bigger people do the big work."

Physical attractiveness makes it easier in some arenas of life...the interview, sometimes getting a date. Physically attractive people, for the most part, are more confident and self assured... However, looks fade very quickly. It is equally important to have a strong emotional-mental base on which to stand. One should work on inner strengths as well. Beauty by itself is a snare.



Many women I know use their attractiveness to their advantage. I try very hard not to. How does one know if one is being taken out if its only because of physical beauty... I would much rather be prized for my inner strengths than for my fading looks.

For me personally, I have wanted to be attractive, beautiful, pleasing to my man (and visually to men in general) for as long as I can remember. I've not felt that way (even when I have been slender and in good shape) because I see so many more gorgeous and extremely attractive women (even without enhancements such as makeup or surgery) that I have felt inadequate, even if I do feel good about my inner self. I don't want to be physically adequate, I want to be stunning, strikingly beautiful, perfectly shaped, eye-catching, glorious, flawless, presentable, personable, radiant, and very pleasing to look at as a woman. It is a flaw of mine and difficult to let go of. Thank you Lord for pointing it out to me.



It is only wrong to utilize attractiveness to their advantage if it is done for a negative (absence, withholding, or removal of something positive) purpose.

Absolutely, ask a fat person how happy they are. Women inadvertently use their beauty, as well as men do, to get what they want. People use their attractiveness all the time to exploit others, it's the way of life being an ego in competition with other egos. It's good to be aware, though, that that is what you're doing.

We can look back on the best in a negative or positive way. We can even choose to be neutral about the past, present and future.



Worrying is a type of thinking.

i strongly agree with the 1st and 2nd answers. Especially the part about superficial people only dealing with the present.



I think that has a lot to do with their fears of the future/anguish from the past that makes them deny/suppress those things in order to FUNCTION in the present.

When a pilot flies a plane from one destination to another destination ...he has direction, and destination. He also has a carved path on which he/she suppose to keep the plane on ...however, plane doesn't always stay on that path .....infact there are many big and medium size deviations  ....so pilot keeps aligning the plane keeping it on the path carved by computer ...he/she keep checking over and over and they keep examining their path to destination ever FEW minutes ...



same applies to life ... we can't ignore the past ...we can't stop worrying about future ...but if you keep your eyes on present ...YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY be able to ignore the past and stop worrying about future ....or at least they won't bother you too much ..just keep aligning your path ...and DON'T WORRY too much ...Life will work itself out ...just work hard on your present projects ...Take some tough decisions or risks .... Think Positive ....Be more optimistic and see life's bigger picture ...you are alive, you are healthy and you have shelter, food and clothes ....then we got the first base down .... we can start now ..

Nope. You must not ignore the future or else your future ends opposite to what you think. A person must always be ready for his/her future by learning from the past and use it on the present.

This is an interesting question. The Bible gives an excellent answer to this question:



"For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:38-39)



Can we live for the moment? Sure!

We can do that, but it's not necessary.  The only time that you can perceive the past, future or present in from that time and place we can now and here.  You can absolutely be aware that you live in the moment, but you can also know that the past and future exist, and they are as real as your mind will have them be.

You can try, but since past behavior predicts future behavior, making your present the learning annex, it's difficult to 'forget' that the future will happen. For example: If all your life you have never been loved, no matter how many people you've known...At some point, in your present, you are going to realize that the future is going to be no different. So living in the present will just be depressing, but you will already sense the lack of change that is coming...

I don't think morals have changed all that much, but there are certainly circumstances when morals need to be adjusted.



Specifically how women, minorities and blacks were treated and are sometimes still treated today. Today I think it extends to things like gay civil rights, abortion, stem cell research.



We are not nearly as accepting to changes in society as we should be... I think we'll still be battling with racism decades from now.

Honour, humanity and morality are infinite and eternal, the essence of what is life, living and man. Societal trends fluctuate and change with fads and whimsical fashions, yet the underlying culture of civilisation must remain in some guise for mankind to prosper or exist. Bereft of these basic elements humanity is eroded and destruction, confusion and devastation ensue, in subtle or garish manner, sometimes observed most unacknowledged until the destruction reaches the threshold and door of the sowers of sin.

Fact is, the subconscious was there first! It is aware of all and operates the functions of your body, that is it co-ordinates them, continually throughout your life. It is the conscious mind which is the intruder and has arrived on the scene of life at a later date. Consequently, it is by Meditation that you quieten the conscious mind and allow the subconscious to move forward, take over, so to speak, and this is done in order to contact the superconscious mind, the Christ. There is more but this will do for now.

Challenging question but more psychological than philosophic as there are many doctors doing many amazing things to do exactly what you are asking, trying to reach the subconscious by any means possible.



The answer is No.



You can try sleep therapy. You can try hypnosis.



You can try a treatment that sets up blocks in you conscious to try and avoid it all together. that is a radical idea but it is theoretically possible to train a person's brain to see  anything but reality. Call it brain washing.



The whole answer would be huge to show you all the possibilities but I think the answer is complete in its brevity and points you in the right direction.



You might want to look into post traumatic stress disorders too. there is a lot of research on the subconscious in that area.

Does intuition go from the front to the back and back out? Do dreams come from my conscious experiences only? Is the subconscious mind a piece of meat or does it have its' own internal processes? Where does the energy for these processes arise? Is instinct a conscious drive with subconscious effects?



The subconscious mind is in effect a funnel, a mile wide at the back and thinner than the eye of a needle where it meets the conscious mind.



My conscious and subconscious mind are not separated properly, so I have personal insight into this issue. When I don't drown it out, my every thought is an "echo" of what my subconscious is addressing, and believe me, it comes in from the back, not the other way around.

Yes... It is only through the conscious mind that anything can be understood. All knowledge is gained through the conscious minds' interpretation of the information gained through the senses. Every experience; sight, smell, touch etc, must be processed by the mind to be of any use at all to us. (The eye perceives images upside down and must be inverted by the brain before we can even 'see' anything.)



Because the term 'subconscious' can mean various things in different contexts, there is a tendency for confusion and consequently the subconscious can be sometimes even worshipped/venerated to a religious degree.



You nailed it with, "if you disagree, what other means are there ?" there are no other means...

Whats to say we're conscious in the beginning? Or that there is a subconscious? Maybe there's a meso-consciousness that we all float in an out of. Lets go with there is a conscious, simply because to be knocked out it to be unconscious and everyone who isn't knocked out or in such a state can be counted as conscious.  We may travel into our subconscious in our dreams or possibly our wake fantasies.  We may expose parts of our mystery subconscious in our imaginations and possibly reveal them through expression. But to say we can take a bus ride into the deepest unexplored part of our minds?? Well, first you have to have one, and second...id try meditation. So i guess what I'm saying is yes.

disagree.



how can we even know that there is an subconscious mind?



if all we ever think with is our conscious mind, and a subconscious  mind is something that we don't know that we're thinking with...how would we ever know if we reached it?



because to reach a subconscious mind you have to use your conscious mind, so that when you thought you had reached the subconscious part of your mind, wouldn't it turn into your conscious mind?



it would be impossible to reach your subconscious, or to prove that it exists since for it to be subconscious we would have to have no conscious knowledge of it...

probably the opposite, your subconscious is like a camra recording all your past actions and burning it into the back of your head. it gives us character in a positive or negative way depending on our how well we think we did in the past. listen to your dreams, medatate, spaceout.

<question>



For something to exist, does it need a beginning from another source? A few choices come to mind:?



1) God is the beginning of all things. He always existed.
2) Energy itself always existed. It has always been present.
3) The big bang started everything.
4) It is impossible to explain by human logic. It is beyond us.



Now the 5th choice is the one that really concerns and scares me actually. I have this belief that in order for let's say a line to exist, I have to draw it. In order for a tree to exist, it has to get started from something. In other words it is not just there; it has to have a beginning. So someone told me to base my thinking on the idea that the Big Bang is the beginning of everything, that there is nothing before the big bang. Wouldn't the big bang need to begin from something too? And here is the fifth choice:
5) Everything started from nothing.
This is my thought because scientists say that nothing existed before it. It is the beginning. How can something start from nothing. If that was the case, then we as humans originated from nothing. That is also something I am curious about. Is there such a thing as nothing? Is there such a thing out there where nothing exists. Where Atoms aren't present? What would this be like. Any and every thought, comment, idea is welcome.



In my opinion this actually sort of supports the existence of God. Another question is what about God himself. Does the bible say how God began? Like as humans, we began from Adam and Eve. But what about God?



So I guess this whole thing revolves around the thought "Everything has to have a beginning in order to exist?" Do you agree with this idea?

To cast the spirit of love upon the unscrupulous, immoral and degenerate is to cast love into an abyss of hell. Love prospers and its honour increases manifold when inspired and attendant by the good, faithful and honourable. Love cast indiscriminately to the wind in an attempt to appear generous or charitable is likened to sending your mother to the local brothel so all can enjoy her goodness, inimitable and unshakeable ability to love the otherwise insufferable and deemed unworthy. Not a good scenario or wise act of providence ...

RIGHT.
There are some people who have walked away from their own essence. If you love these people- they are so disassociated from who they are, this love doesn't penatrate their exterior, let alone touch their core. They are blind to true love. (Agape?)



I may love these people, yet be repulsed by, and, despise their actions, to the point of keeping myself at a safe distance. We all have our strengths- some may have the skills, to get closer- without harm.



To love like this, I picture them as an innocent 6month old- 3yr old or sometimes 10yr old to get to their deeper soul. Possibly, the age where tremendous damage was initially done! Having no animosity or fear of them, may rattle them, or plant a seed?



Respecting others, by respecting yourself, too.It is so important to love yourself, be happy in your own skin, walk in your destined path (all good) Get back in touch, with who you truly are. A journey of ones own making.

Love can mean several things.



Innocent child loves another innocent child without any reservation.



A mother loves her child.



A man loves his wife.



The same love can not be meted out in the same fashion at every time i.e. over a period of aging. The way we love our mother at our innocent tender age cannot be repeated later in our life.



We love our body and its handsomeness during youth. When we become old we start hating our own body.



So I think we cannot love everyone on the street. We should be selective.

No.. I don't think we should. I think everyone has something to love(ie good points) in them, but that doesn't mean we have to love them. Or are you saying murderers, rapists, thieves should be loved?



However, we should CONTINUE to love the people we love even if they get themselves into a mess.. because that isn't a reason for love to stop.

I don't think the quote stands alone very well without the overall context of the story. Clearly, in 1984, this quote reinforces the idea that one must blindly follow the party and "love big brother." War is the status-quo for Oceania, the citizens should find that strictly following the party is a freeing experience (a form of ultimate surrender, if you will), and ignorance is definitely a strength for the characters under this fictional regime (not knowing/acknowledging subversive activities and thoughts makes it less possible to commit a "thought crime."



Just my thoughts, anyway. :)

1984 has to be the best book I have ever read. I absolutely love this quote - when I first read the book (I was 12) I didn't understand it but now I realise that this BB quote basically sums up unjust communism's 'victims' and their lives.

Out of the four options you have given i would have to say overcoming your daily problems with ease.
Getting A in your Exams only mean you have a good memory not intelligence. you study for an exam therefore memorizing the topic.
Speaking all the right stuff is a little to vague does it mean knowing every topic you talk about exactly. Or speaking true proper english, which is BS these days. anyway more and more slang is entering the english language every year.



My point for choosing overcoming problems is that every day you are  face with a wide Array of problems, work, home to name a few. these can be big problems or minor yes/no answers to overcome these with ease takes intelligence.



An example i can give is where i work (heavy industry) we can hire the smartest university students that can put and thing on paper you throw at them but give them a hammer and nail so to speak and the have not got a clue what they are doing. they have become conditioned to only one thing and now cannot think out side the square.

There are other choices that would be more right, however, out of these choices, choice 3 is the best.



If you can overcome your problems with ease, that means you can find the easiest way to deal with problems. Humans are smart because we are able to solve our own problems.



Getting all As is only a sign that you exeed in school and acedemics. It doesn't not mean you are able to really survive in real life.



Speaking the right stuff shows a good sign with language, you might be able to say the right things, but can you solve all your problems?



And this question doesn't have a right or wrong answer, therefore one can not really solve this question.

Being intelligent (and mature) means being able to type out "you" with all three letters. But I digress.



Getting A's on all your exams is not all about intelligence. It is part intelligence and part memorization. Memorization is not intelligence. And I get A's on all my exams, but I'm not an intellectual. I'm just smart.



"Speaking all the right stuff" does not make grammatical sense. Therefore, it is not intelligent.  However, being able to put the right words in the right place and thus emitting a sophisticated air dose make one seem intelligent, even if they are only pretending.



Overcoming daily problems is not a challenge for most people with the will to. Daily problems means common problems; common people are therefore able to solve them without problems. Intelligent, by definition, means a stronger, faster, better cognitive process and so is beyond 'common'.



...Solving daily problems does not constitute intelligence. It only requires will.



Solving this question does not require intelligence either. It only requires an opinion and a will and ability to back it up. That is not intelligence; it's human stubbornness. That is not intelligence.



In conclusion, none of these choices can be considered intelligent.

It came forward. He then said, "Go back." It went back.



Then God said, "I swear by My honor and glory that I have not created any creature more beloved to Me than you. I will not perfect you in anyone except those whom I love. I, however, will command only you to do things and prohibit only you from doing certain things. I will grand blessings (rewards) to you only and will subject only you to punishments."

And no I don't think any of this means God is unfair, because I think that this is meant to be our own journey, and that he is not supposed to molly coddle us, rather challenge us. Each journey is our own and so he can't interfere and I think that we make our own fate...

No, in a lot of ways it is not fair. . . discrimination is one of them. . . Prejudice is another.  These are all preconceived ideas without basis in education or learning. . . .What a better world it would be without them. . .When we are faced with unfairness in our lives, we feel cheated, that we were misjudged, to overcome these feelings we have to think of the positives, and use this as a learning experience. Be satisfied and proud of who you are, and many will take that second look.

For questions such as these, it is important to define your terms. By 'life', I assume that you mean human life. Because if you meant all life, then life is never fair because all life occurs at the expense of other life.



But for human life, It is not impossible for life to be 'fair'
(must use air quotes, since defining 'fair' isn't so easy).



But history shows that life is regularly 'unfair' to at least some humans. And perhaps overly 'fair' to others.



As far as 'God' is concerned (should 'God' exisit), it either tells us that how things are is how god intended (what seems unfair to us may not be unfair to god). Or, that God is unfair. Fairness is a traditional attribute of god, so either this is how God intended, or God doesn't exist.

is the concept of objectivity alien to all of you?  clearly, it is.  define "fair", define "justice", define "life", and what does it even matter if we think "life is un/fair"?  the world is going to be the same whether we approve or not.



furthermore, you go turning an ethics question into a discussion that assumes you can understand the character and intent of an infinite, all-powerful entity.  why not just be straight-forward in your question instead of beating around the bush?  ask whether your invisible man who controls everything is on your side.



if everything is in your favor, is that fair?  no, because it is not favoring someone else.  stop being so egocentric and join the rest of the world.

Put simply - people attract what they need in life, we desire love, knowledge,  and creativity.  Trying to get and maintain a balance in life is most important.  Only balanced people can pass judgement on others for it to be fair.  I'm not exactly sure what fair is ? but I think its to do with treating others with respect and respecting yourself.



Fairness is a non-judgemental attitude to others.  A fair person will respect the individual needs of others giving attention when it is needed to particular areas.  He/she will have self-respect and
give guidance to others, by being fair and just to others we are treating each other in the way God envisioned.  Look at the answers above - so many people do not understand what fairness is - it is nothing at all to do with circumstance but is treating others with kindness and love.  We should all be more loving.  There is no one who has been able to be as loving and kind as God but we should all aspire to be as loving as we can.

Life is nothing; it simply is.



its all the @ssholes and b*tches who make it unfair but that crap some people say "life isn't fair" is a pure load of garbage; its not life that is unfair, its people.



Didn't you watch Pulp Fiction's rendition of Ezekiel 25:17, which by the way wasn't even accurate?



Ahem "Ezekiel 25:17" according to Samuel L. Jackson;



"The path, of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities (injustices) of the selfish, and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he, who shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, but I will strike down upon thee with GREAT VENGEANCE, and FURIOUS ANGER, those who attempt to POISON, and DESTROY my brothers, and you WILL KNOW, MY NAME IS THE LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon thee...."



The iniquities of the selfish, and the tyranny of evil men (and women); that is the sad truth of life.



Indeed, "the law," and "justice," are two separate things.  Very, separate things.  Justice, simply defined, is not letting selfish sadists, sadistic sociopaths who enjoy harming people, get away with their crimes.



Revenge, is wishing to harm someone, simply because you are such an arrogant turd, you can't stand the fact that they stood up to you.



Example; killing a KKK rapist of a black girl lynch style, THAT, is justice.



Attacks on Afghanistan by the U.S., that was not justice, that was revenge.



The way the old testament defines justice as an "eye for an eye" is, that if someone did you a terrible wrong, the price exacted to pay for it, must match the wrong inflicted.



White people in the U.S. hunted the native americans to extinction, the eye for an eye law says, someday they too will be hunted to extinction, and the people who do it, will show the same arrogance, apathy, and cruelty, they showed the natives.  They will beg for mercy, but the world will not listen.  They will scream "human rights!  human rights" but their cries will fall on deaf ears.



You think that for all their cruelty, all their malice, that the white people should just walk away like nothing happened, taking the easy way out?  No man.....

Belief in God is a personal matter, it should not be a matter of proving or disproving his existence.. that would be my essay anyway. The creation argument, the design argument, the moral argument and miracles: none prove his existence. There is definitely something intangible and magical about life, Christian's just choose to call that God (and say he is a man?!). Sorry, I know my answer hasn't really helped.. good luck with it.

Start with an intro with some facts like how many christians there are in the world etc. then ask could all these people be wrong? What are the strong arguments for God? Then write out the arguments one by one. If you want a really high level, include the weaknesses of the argument, then disprove them. End with a strong conclusion including all the arguments you have used and a personal opinion. Hope this helps!

Julius is right.



None of the arguments you are supposed to use can actually prove god's existence... just as no argument brought against it can ever prove his nonexistence.



the reason for this is that the matter of god's existence removes itself from any kind of argument. the very nature alleged to god by his believers defies logic or rational treatment.



you can believe or disbelieve in god as much as you like. you won't ever find conclusive evidence one way or the other.



its as simple as that. then again... its just my own opinion and in no way compulsory :)



As for your essay you should first describe the general disagreement between theists and atheists, then give an overwiew of the theistic arguments as you did above.



then you should give a brief summation of each argument, and describe how it is supposed to prove gods existence, and then state and explain your own opinion, wether or not it really does.



depending on your findings you then conclude which, if any, arguments can be seen as proof of gods existence.

u can derive its existence, its presence by faith by Imagination. can any of human being create ocean, sky, air or universe? there are thousands and thousands of miracle in the existence of this world and universe but we don't realise it. u need not try to prove his existence as those who felt it were not believed initially by people. u can read about saints of india and their miracles and their teachings. as much as u read you will get ans to ur que automatically.

The only way to "prove" this, that I know of, it the Cartesian method.  You ultimately end up looking in on yourself, which forces all of us, then, to do the same.  It forces you to accept that God is a product -- though not necessarily a figment -- of the imagination.  It situates God in the realm of "that which cannot be humanly understood but yet logically conclude it exists."  For Descartes, God existed for the same reason triangles existed.  It's actually pretty cool, because it forces you to respect other people's gods . . . but it does not address the "ethics" question.



I'm sure there are Eastern philosophies to this.  Taoism (or Daoism) is quite nice.  But this question seems like it forces you into a Western conceptualization of God and religion.

Well a common answer is "42" as made popular by the radio series, television series, book and movie "The Hitch Hikers guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams.



It's more profound than you think- the meaning of life is different for different people.



But I think you would find yourself fulfilled if you made it your mission in life to be happy- and the pursuit of happiness is as good of a meaning to life as I can think of!

If you have to ask, you do not actually deserve an answer, but in any case, here is it:.........................'You"  You are the life, you are the container for life and the bridge over life.  Without you, and your experiences, there would be no life.  Because your life is the only life there is, or would you like to live your mothers.  What about your alcoholic neighbor, do you want his?  Can you live his?

Probably becasue people assume if you're not working then you must be claiming benefit, and if you're claiming benefit, you should work. But if you're not claiming money from the state, and you can afford to stay at home, I don't see why that's wrong. I wish I could stay at home!

I don't look down at it. But at  the same time, I also can't imagine a life without doing something. But if someone who lives that lifestyle still has something with meaning in their life, then thats fine. But if its just sitting at home all day doing nothing all alone, then I just dont even see the point in that kind of existence. If theres more to it, then great, no issues at all.

Lara is right. But for some, it is seen as lazy. Popular media has made the housewife a narcissistic, childish shopaholic who just wants to spend her husband's money without doing a work. I'm afraid to say it is not all lies. If you are doing your part of the deal I see no reason you should be looked down upon. Kudos to you for standing up for your life choice.
