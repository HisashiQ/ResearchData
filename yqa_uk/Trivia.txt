Does humour differ so much from country to country?



The last time I was in Turkey, we were driving through thick fog. Huge lorries (trucks) appeared at the last moment.
I asked my Turkish companion why they didn't put their lights on. Quick as a flash he answered. 'They think they'll get an electricity bill.'

Yes it does.  Take for example America and Britain.  Words have different meanings so a joke in Britain may not be found funny in America and vice versa.

Yes, it does differ. I am on holiday in London and the other day we went to a local Chinese restaurant for lunch where we are familiar figures. It was towards the end of the conventional lunch time and the proprietor was looking distinctly anxious as he let us in. I quipped: "X, you're looking so worried that I thought perhaps you were closing and we wouldn't be able to have our lunch after all!" He flared up at me and shouted that all customers kept accusing him of looking grim, that business was good and that he'd had enough of the way people talked. If he hadn't been an old acquaintance I would have walked out. I was rebuked by my spouse and told that in Hong Kong Chinese terms making flippant remarks like that was suggesting that business was not prospering. After so many years in the UK, one would have assumed that he might have got used to off the cuff pleasantries.



Turks are definitely more fun to deal with. I can imagine a Turkish proprietor congratulating us on being so early for dinner.

Well it can, but I think it more differs from family to family.

It all just depends on what kind of environment that family grew up in. If they didn't grow up in that good of one, they may have sort of a dark humor or even a sarcastic one.



I think it does differ from country to country because some people may watch television there, which they could get humor from there.

bobs bits wouldnt necessarily provide a warning at sea as seawater is generally cold so bobs bits may not be noticed, especially as they only score 5 from 10

yes, but bobs are worse than bits, but saying that, bobs are better in the red sea, rather than the english sea, but try to find it in the black sea is trying to look for a grain of sand in brighton, but best of all bobs and bits are best together in the north atlantic, when cod are more plentifull than bass, hope this puts your bits and bobs in a good state now, but it can be said that bits and pieces fare well as well

Clint's character Blondie was using a Colt 1851 Navy .36 revolver that had been converted to fire metallic cartridges. Technically, such a gun didn't exist (from a manufacturer, anyway) at the time the movie is set. So much for historical accuracy.

About the closest thing available today as a standard production item is a repro of the Richards-Mason conversion of the 1851 Colt. Cimarron Firearms sells a nice one in .38 special. It carries an MSRP of $529, I think, so street price is probably somewhere around $400-450. It looks like this:

http://www.cimarron-firearms.com/images/...

The main difference between the Richards-Mason and Blondie's gun are that the R-M has had the loading lever (rammer) removed and an ejector installed. Blondie's gun in the movie still has the loading lever and does not have an ejector. If you really want a recreation of Blondie's gun, probably the cheapest way to do it is to buy the Cimarron R-M and have a gunsmith remove the ejector and install a loading lever off an 1851 Colt cap and ball gun.

"Who's your daddy?" is a slang expression that takes the form of a rhetorical question. Use of the phrase implies a boastful claim of physical or sexual dominance over the intended listener. Comedians suggest that the phrase is frequently spoken by men in a Freudian outburst during sexual intercourse.
