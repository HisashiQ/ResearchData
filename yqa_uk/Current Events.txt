Not all kids are bad, its just that the media likes to be negative all the time. I read today where a 13 year old raised the alarm when he spotted an old guys house on fire and they got him out safely. Also a group of kids abseiling rescued a bloke from down a cliff, but not enough of these kind of stories get priority. We have ten children and they have all been brought up properly  and I am very proud of them all. I would not say we are strict but they have boundaries and know how far to push us and we know when to say no!

Parents need to learn parenting skills,part of which is discipline.  Allowing children unlimited tv, video games and cell phone access is just stupid.  Children must earn their privileges, and must have them removed for non-compliance.  Parents must take the time to understand and correct and inspect all school work.  Parents must also be more involved in knowing who their child's friends are and what kind of homes they come form.  As for a child physically assaulting an adult, the adult should treat this as anyone else assaulting them and retaliate vigorously.

why a lots of articles ?  because they are not in discipline.  it is true. They need more and more discipline.  But, it is a pity that more parents are no following the discipline.  When parents are not behaving well, what is the use of pointing the children.  you ask changing your question ''do parents today need more discipline'' ?  why, i say this.  The children will follow the footsteps of their parents. When parents are disciplined, they follow their parents. it is true. Father and mother often quarreling before their children.  Father doing illegal affairs, mother having a male friend,  besides many many divorces, shouting, fights, kicks, blows...then how can you expect children disciplined.  so, the newspapers know the parents, and hence they do their share by writing articles to set right the children.

Nope. And the only reason there weren't riots on the McCain side are three reasons: 1: The unhinged White supremacists don't riot, they just plan assassinations. 2: It's hard for the average McCain voter to riot, while wearing depends and pushing a walker.... and # 3: Moose Hunting season opens today, can't be bothered.

NO. That sound skind of racist to imply that people would have rioted because ihe is half black. When are people going to stop focusing on the color of his skin and focus on the damn issues alone and his ability to handle things?



I am happy he won because I think he is the best PERSON for the job at this time- NOT because he is half black, or half white, not because he is a MAN, but because of his qualifications and ideas for fixing the problems we all face. I also admire his idealism, how he inspires us to be better people and work harder TOGETHER towards making this country get back on its feet again.



I pray that God will guide him and us into a brighter future for ALL Americans, regardless of the color of skin, fat or thin, tall  or short, white, black, asian, mexican, pakistani- whatever, lots of money or not a pot to piss in. We are ALL Americans and should STOP looking at one another and judging each other by the external crap and look at what people do in their daily lives, the choices they make, and how they treat others.

Riots?  In what kind of planet are you living?
I am sure that some people would have protested, but nothing more.
Do you remember the election fraud in 2000 Bush / Al Gore???



And everybody knew in the end that it has been a clear fraud and that Bush did not win the elections, but there were no riots.
Or do you say this for Obama being black and that black people tend to be violent?



I think that your question is a question full of racism…



Anyway, I am Indian, but I accuse my own people as racists in many ways, because many of us do consider dark skinned and black people as inferior.



So this question unfortunately is not so strange at all….



I hate people who are racists and think that they are superior to others because of something so stupid like skin colors, religion, nationality or the roots of their forefathers.



That´s so ridiculous and sad… what a shame!!!

Why do people seem to think Obama is a black man?



He is mixed race, black father WHITE mother, a WHITE woman carried him for 9 months than gave birth to the man, if he can be classed as a black president, he can be classed as a white president. And some people seem to say "look at him", I'm looking and I see a mixed raced man. I know the media preaches all this stuff but the man is not black nor white, if he can be black, he can be white.

Barrack Hussein Obama is black. Reguardless of who his parents are, how he was conceived, and whether he is mixed or not. Ever heard of the "one-drop" rule whereas if you have one drop of African- American blood in you, you where considered black, even if it was your great-grandmother who was black and everyone else in your lineage where white. Black skin is obviously a dominant gene, so the pigment would show. Had he been a slave could he pass with saying "im not a black man, my mother's white?" If it we were 1940 and he'd try to vote in Mississippi, think he'd fare very well? If he'd run for president you think people couldn't see he's black. Wait he did. So you can thank American society and the dominate recessive gene which will usually show pretty well.

WTF Oprah?!? That was so mean! Most of those women were voting for the first time and were really happy about it! They had been clean for a week (good decision #1) and now they were voting (good decision #2) and all Oprah does is break them down!!!

I guess she figures she is above it all.  I wonder how many of the "druggies" were black.  At least they were allowed to vote.  Wait till her taxes skyrocket now that Her Man is president elect.  Might be enough to make Oprah turn to substance abuse.  On another note: I don't think it's fair that non-violent Felons aren't allowed to vote, once they have completed their court imposed sentence.  I have a family member that made some really bad decisions as a 19 year old.  Ten years later, he owns his own company is respected by many...he has one more month of probation. It will be years before he can get his voting rights back.

In the UK, the NHS takes up 75% of our tax.  In other words, a country like ours with no NHS would need to treble the tax take to pay for it.  Obama has inherited a debt of $10,556,177,748,045.  There's no way America can start to afford a comprehensive heath service.  Expect him to chuck a few million dollars at Medicare, but that will be it.

i doubt it, most Americans seem to think it would ultimately lead to being a socialist country, and that's not going to happen



for those that knock the NHS let me tell you the truth,



it has problems, the worse currently being its overstaffed by top fat cats, and that the nurses, doctors on the ground are the ones that suffer.  But by and large its the best medical care in the world. You pay into into it, and when its needed its there for you. You don't have to shell out shed loads of money and everyone that complains has no idea of the unholy cost of Private Medical care.  I have had to use both, and believe me i know where my loyalities lie, and its not with overbown private care.  They are just in it for the money.

I hope not. The bigger question is not how it would impact the country but how it would impact the world.



With no market for health care in the United States, there would be no significant market for health care left anywhere in the world. This would mean there is no financial incentive to develop new medical technologies that don't save money. That would be an incredible disaster for the human species.



For example, any technology that allows premature babies who would otherwise die to survive has no cost savings. So why would anyone develop such a technology? There would be no way they could make money on it and the only source of funding would be the very government that would have to shell out money to pay for it.



Today, developing the technology would allow high-end hospitals to pay top dollar for it so they could brag about having the best. Over time, the costs would come down and it would become commonplace. But with no market for health care innovation anywhere, there is basically no conceivable way this could happen.

The NHS is a bloated,impotent,poorly managed and over funded revenue guzzling monster,with 3 nurses doing the job of one.In other words everything that we would expect a socialist creation to be.



The USA in the current climate simply couldn't afford such a luxury.



Even in Britain,if the NHS didnt already exist it wouldnt be created.It was always a bad idea.Right wing politicians only pretend to support it because the electorate have it in their minds that the treatment is free.

Now that the unemployment rate is hitting 15% (the real rate) and previously prosperous middle classes are living in their SUVs and don't have company paid health insurance anymore, they tossed their leader out and went for a Democrat, because now they too need a lift.  So it could happen.



There are so many people who write this forum looking for answers and help because they have no insurance and cant afford to go to the doctor, not cuz they have bad lifestyles, but cuz things can happen to anyone's health. The first thing the doctor's ofice asks when you call for a new appointment is "Do you have Insurance", It is sad.



There are 6 houses on my street for sale for months where a house never lasted 3 weeks on the market last year.
The hurricane in New Orleans made the US look like a third world country it's becoming, as does our Infant Mortality rate.



And just as fast as people from Mexico are coming in to find work, retirees are leaving to live in Central America cuz they can't afford to stay here.

Good response jigfam. That's the thinking that won the election for the Dems. & more seats in Congress. Let's stop and think about who has controlled Congress for the past 2 years and had all sorts of plans they were going to push through in their first 100 days. Hmmmmm. The Dems. Who has a lower approval rating than GWB? Congress. Who CUT taxes and gave tax relief to families? GWB. BO says he's not going to raise taxes on the bottom 95% but by letting the Busch tax breaks expire your taxes will go up. Nice technicality there. Let's hope his inexperience & left wing mentality doesn't bite us in the ***. If he turns out to do a good job I will step in line to acknowledge the fact.

Obama is going to create a lazy America with his economic plan to spread the wealth.  It goes against our history of entrepreneurship.  Think about it, who wouldn't like to make $250K a year?  If the taxes are higher in those brackets...what's the incentive to further your career or start your own business?  Small business owners are going to be taxed to death, bringing more unemployment.  That's just for starters.



Sure it's a nice idea for everyone to be successful, have healthcare, free this, free that, but the fact of the matter is, it's not possible.  He's never said HOW he's going to do anything, just that "Americans should have a good job, Americans should have access to healthcare, blah blah blah".  Those types of speeches are what got him elected.  He's not going to deliver on any of it.  He can't fund it.  And if you think there's a deficit in the budget now, just wait until he tries to fund any of his promises.  The money has to come from somewhere, and it's going to come from our pockets.



Obama wanted the title of being the first black President.  He's exploited his claimed (notice I say claimed, because he's mixed race) race to suit his purpose.  Too bad so many people couldn't look past the color of his skin and his propaganda machine to see the truth.

Yes, he is half white and half black. It's still historic though. Every single President has been a white European male. This is a HUGE step in the right direction. It opens the door to all other races, women, and all other sexual orientations.



It gives me hope that in my lifetime we'll have a Hispanic President, a female President, a gay President.



It makes me proud of this country that, even though racism unfortunately still does exist, the majority of the nation can overlook the color or someone's skin and see him as a person who can lead this country in the right direction and get this country back on it's feet. It makes me hope that electing a black President can help eradicate racism once and for all!

I'm thinking what a mistake the Republican Party made in trying to capture the moderate vote. McCain was a very poor candidate and failed to get full support of the conservative base. His road to the Republican primary victory was launched in several good sized, historically liberal states. Will the Republican party realize they have left their base and swing back to the right? or will they continue on their road to destruction? I'm also thinking what a mistake the oil industry made in gouging the American people at the pump. This, in part led to dissatisfaction with the Republicans, who were the oil company's best friend. Watch out for rising fuel prices now that the election is over! A whole lot of people shooting themselves in the foot!

Guy Fawkes was one of a group of conspirators who tried to blow up the House of Lords in 1605 on the day of the State Opening of Parliament . Had they been successful, King James I and members of both the House of Commons and House of Lords would have been killed.



The exact reasons for the Gunpowder Plot are uncertain, but were connected to the struggle between the Protestant and Roman Catholic religions that took place in England during the 16th and 17th Centuries. In any case, the plot was uncovered on November 4th 1605, the night before the State Opening. The conspirators were arrested and tried in Westminster Hall in January 1606 for high treason. All were convicted, and sentenced to death.



November 5th was appointed a day of thanksgiving and is still remembered by bonfire parties and fireworks to this day.

They won't. Hasn't he and his followers insisted throughout his campaign that he is not racist, that he is both black and white, and that he plans to reach across racial barriers to unite the country.



If he can do this, it will be a wonderful thing. I didn't vote for him, but as president he deserves the respect that the office holds, and unlike the past 8 years, Americans need to put aside party, issues such as abortion and sexuality (NOT the government's place to be nosing in) and come support our country and our president instead of stabbing him in the back.



No one, not even Obama can do it alone, so I feel that the people who supported him should start supporting and what he teaches, rather than posting pissy little racist questions like this.

Am I the only white guy feeling a little depressed this morning?



Good luck to president Obama.He won fair and square,he is very slick,in fact it reminds me of a movie made of the first US black/mixed race president.He would have filled the lead role very well.But this is real life not a movie.I wonder what he would do if he gets another 9/11 in his first week.Terrorists dont seem to have been mentioned in this election.I would say it will take a regiment of US marines to guard him 24 hours a day (do they have regiments in America?) but you could say George Bush had the same problems after Iraq. I am not American,but I am interested to know why that odd little guy Mccain was picked above the others,and his even odder running mate. If Obama had been against Ronald Reagon it way have been a different outcome? Do you notice Joe Biden was hardly mentioned. In Britain no-one at all seemed to dare to even say anything about Obama.

Is this a turning point in the history of the USA?



I think this is a point that will always be remembered in history as changing the face of what the USA finally stands for.  I for the first time,  like Michelle Obama am proud of my country and will finally have a representative that i can relate to.



Luis Farrakhan and Rev. Wright have been on the right track in training Barrack for this job and now is the time..
What do you think?  Is this a real turning point in history?

Yes I think that we have finally turned a significant corner here.
I believe that you are correct that Rev. Wright and Luis Farrakhan have been training him for this position, but both of those men represent things that I am against..
Obama's trainers are against the USA and for it's downfall, and I think that Obama will bring about the downfall of the USA, if he gets elected.
I can see how black people will be proud and how nice it will look to them when a great majority of our leaders are black, but I really feel that Obama does not have the skills to lead us in a Godly direction as a Nation.



Also I think that some people of color are going to be upset with him unless they are followers of Wright & Farrakhan.

I think that he is representing America as a whole. It's not about skin color, gender, or anything else. That's not the only people he's supposed to be representing. Just because Clinton was white doesn't mean I relate to him. What is important is that he represents the American people. Luckliy if Obama (which is will be it seems) wins, that will be the case. I am very proud of him.

You know...I didn't think so before. I thought, "Geez... If this socialist wins, I am gonna be pissed!" I am conservative. And this election wasn't about race for me, because I don't care for Obama's politics... But, I am also black. And it is now hitting me that there may be a BLACK family in the white house tomorrow... This is going to kick open a lot of doors for a lot of little black kids who wouldn't have thought about it otherwise....



So, yes, this is turning point.

Why are people calling Obama black?



If I were African-American, I would still feel slighted that someone like Obama was getting credit for being the first African-American president. Is he really black? Is Tiger Woods really black? Is this really a great accomplishment?



</question>



<additional details>



If he were elected President in a predominately black country, would he be hailed as the first white President?



If he wasn't part black would he have won? They said this morning his votes were mostly from blacks, mexicans, and women.

Anyway he used all his traits to his advantage to get votes.

We havent died yet, but we are in some serious trouble now. The moronic Obama lovers and the Liberal mainstream media have given America a racist Marxist for a President, and they think that is just ducky.
There has been no conclusive proof he is even a US citizen.....Any one of these things would have created an uproar of epic proportions had he been a Republican, but no problem for the Libs.....



Stand by for developments that are going to change America alright, and NOT for the better.

Because in America today there are sadly more stupid dumb a s s e s than smart educated people. The final nail has been driven into the USA's coffin which was the intended goal when the commies started infiltrating her a few deacades ago. This abomination used every play in Hitlers book on how to overthrow a country and it worked perfectly. They had the working class masses believing that everything was a disaster and therefore they were disgruntled. It didn't matter that they had no idea why they were unhappy, it only mattered that what they percieved. Once they had that catalyst they cranked up the propaganda machines and kept them going full tilt until the end. Now we have a new Furer, and a new socialist/fascist/racist party. Better learn your lockstep and one armed salute. Her Furer Obama's next move will to install an internal police force that will have a ton of power so he can send them out and silence his dissenters. Mark my words, all you lemmings who voted for this facist will get yours soon enough.

Chin up! Whether you voted for Obama or not, he is now your president. If he can achieve a portion of what he has set out to do, then even though I didn't vote for him, I'll gladly give him the credit he will be due.



It's our job as Americans to break the cycle of opposing sides, stop dividing the country, and pointing fingers as we have for the last few decades.

People didn't just vote for Obama because they believe he will rescue them from the party that wrecked America, the Republican Party, but because all credibility for the statesman John McCain dissolved the minute he picked the religious nut job airhead from Alaska, Sarah Palin, to be only an old man's heartbeat away from the White House.



They voted against the legacy of Bush



They voted against the fraudsters and swindlers of Wall Street being pandered to.



They voted against illegal war and torture.



But they didn't just vote against the illegal and corrupt practises of the Republicans that have been in power for eight years;



They voted for investment in their country, a return to making things to sell, not selling money from nothing.



They voted for someone who can restore faith and confidence in America, and improve its image around the world.



They voted for someone they believe can improve the lives of all Americans, not just the elite few.



McCain himself said 'The people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly.'  Grow up and get behind the leader you have, and help rebuild the country you love.

It did not. It was saved last night. If McCain were elected then it would have died. Change happens. It is a naturally occurring phenomenon. We are on the wrong course. Bush and company really did a number on us. If the Republicans were so great and wonderful then why are facing this huge crisis? Why didn't they turn things around? Hmmm??



Give Barack Obama a chance. This is only the beginning. You must do your part to stay informed and make your voice heard. Hold him accountable for his promises. Don't let up. That's being a real American. Stand up for what you believe in. Educate yourself first though.

You guys are messed up. Millions of people are rallying around Obama because they believe he's going to bring the change that our country needs...these are people that want to see America the way she should be, prosperous and riddled with opportunity. It's a good thing that so many people are taking an interest, so step off and stop trying to turn these awesome events into something negative with your racial slurs and ludacris cult theories.

Scary isnt it? If you watched his speech, I was thinking the exact same time: "Oh my God, its a cult" with the crowd saying "Yes we can" after he finished making a point. Just like cults do.



Mark the words: He will destroy America.



And whoever overruns America might just be nice enough to get rid of these crazy liberals that voted for him. And the impressionable teenies who like whatever is shown on TV the most.

I suggest that you first find out what a cult is before you throw the word around with such obvious ignorance.



Just because you dislike something doesn't make it a cult, they are easy to recognise, but need much more investigation than 'they look like a cult'.

I agree.  The masses have been blinded from the true issues.  Over and Over again, we were warned of who and what he truly is.  Not enough people listened.  His associations, his views, his lack of experience, his track record this list goes on and on about why this wasn't a good choice. People's eyes glazed over when you revealed the facts about him.  His own grandmother stating he was born in Kenya and the reluctance to show his birth certificate.  The many "I didn't know" answers he gave about the people he associated with for years. The church he called home for years, he didnt know the preacher was racist against whites and america. So many more... It was shown again and again that people who voted had no idea why they were voting for him except it would be cool to have a black president.  That shouldn't even matter.  People didnt have one answer to any issues that he supported.  For all those who are looking forward to this change, watch out, you are going to get what you ask for, but not what you think.  God is the only way to make it through this situation.  I just pray for this nation of ours and the world.

I didn't vote for him but in all fairness i think no matter who got in the problem with our economy will not be resolved.  You are going to see a one world government come into play called the "New World Order"  Many believe that this one world government will set the stage for a world dictator to very easily control the world.  Biblically speaking this man will be the "Antichrist"  whom many will believe in.  He will seem to have all the answers for our economy, identity theif, and many will be willing to receive a mark on their right hand / or forehead which will contain a micro chip that will have every individual's personal info connected to it.  this will seem to be the answer for identity theif but the bible warns us of receiving this mark.  You will have to make a choice wheather you are for God or for the Antichrist and its world economics.

Well, I can tell you this much.  As far as the american people go in the united states, our vote does NOT count when it comes to electing the president of the U.S.  It's all up to the Electorial College votes.  Our vote only counts for local elections.  If they had based the vote on popularity, McCain would have won.

Registered voters elects their representatives who in turn elect the president.
Normally the representatives vote for the party to which they represent.
If in a state, majority have voted for a particular candidate, then the vote of the entire state goes to that  candidate.  Example: Ohio - a majority of them have voted for Obama.  Therefore, the entire vote from Ohio  has gone to Obama.

Can this country come together with a black president? Some states hate that Obama is Black. What do you think?



Most of the South keeps voting for Republicans no matter what except (North Carolina, Florida , and Virginia). Doesn't that send some kind of message. Also when John McCain was giving props to Obama, the fans booed Obama which was class-less. I hope this country can come together and forget that this is black.

Ben Laden isnt in Iran-hes probably never even been there.
But that being said the day could very well come eventually where something will happen between America and Iran. Dont fool yourselves simply because Obama is President. If it comes down to it he will do what he has to do and launch military action against them. If it happens its Irans fault, not ours. They have taunted America for over 30 years now....been a pain in our side since the late 70s.



This whole thing goes back before Bush was president, before Iraq, before 911, even before Reagan was President Iran has been looking for a fight.

he's got a lot to prove as president OTHER THAN he's the first black president.  and he has plenty of opportunity to do that with the economy, the war, our image as a world leader and the list goes on.



if he can tackle all that and come up with a satisfactory solution to them, then no, he still doesn't deserve a holiday.  becoming the first black president is a huge advance for the country.  but a holiday just for winning?  i think not.  if he brings world peace, eliminates all pollution, finds a cure for AIDS or other "incurable" deseases, then yeah, give him a holiday.

As an Aussie, i cant believe HOW BLOODY LONG the campaign went for. geesh. All i would see on the news was U.S election this, U.S election that. It was said they were campaigning for almost a year or something, and just think how much tax payers money was forked out for this. If an Australian P.M was to do this, i think we would have a protest the size of the Cronulla riots (for u non-aussies, its a town in NSW near Sydney) because of the tax payers funds that were wasted.
Are u glad to see U.S election FINALLY over?



p.s. they will still televise stories bout it for the next month or so though!



p.p.s. It's funny, New Zealand is having an election at the moment as well, and i have barely seen a thing about it!

I'm guessing you can't prove it, but they shouldn't just ignore the fact you found one. Chances are you won't be able to spend it elsewhere and it isn't really right to either. I should think you are meant to report things like that

The Post Office have broken the law by giving you a fake note. They are supposed to check things like that before handing them out. Take it to your local police station or call them (tel. no.s can easily be found by Googling for it.) They should give you some sort of crime reference number. Then write to the Post Office to tell them and give them the crime reference number. They should pay you back.



But whatever you do, don't spend it. It is illegal and you could be prosecuted.

Can`t you take it to your bank and ask them to exchange it, or what you should do. I`m not sure how it works for fake notes.
Not quite the same thing, but my mum was given an old £5 note from somewhere and other shops refused to accept it.



I took it into the bank and they exchanged it, for a new one.

REALLY...THATS THE BEST QUESTION YOU'VE GOT. Of course obama beat him. McCain was not destroyed. He was gracious and kind and is offering Obama a  helping hand. He is doing so because he understands what kind of trouble this country is in, and that any one that takes office is going to need all the help they can get.

Most of the South keeps voting for Republicans no matter what except (North Carolina, Florida , and Virginia). Doesn't that send some kind of message. Also when John McCain was giving props to Obama, the fans booed Obama which was class-less. I hope this country can come together and forget that this is black.

You are an idiot.You think that the south voted for McCain because Obama is half black? First of all, Florida is a vacationing spot for Yankees, so it doesn't count as a southern state. The remaining southern states voted for McCain because it is the bible belt and these states are predominantly Christian. Remember Christianity? It's the foundation that this country was based upon when we went to war with the British in 1776. A foundation that has been disrespected in recent years and a foundation that is fundamentally disrespected by the President-Elect.



The southern, bible belt, states voted against Obama because he is not a Christian, not because of his race.



McCain's supporters booed because their candidate was giving up and they didn't like that idea. They were not booing Obama because of his race.

unfortunately I think there will be some problems that will rise from race. And in response to oe of the other people that disagree with Obama there must be a separation of church and state. Just because you view a specific issue morally wrong that does NOT give the government the right to take away the rights of another individual. America was based on the ideas of life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Everyone should have their own interpretation of these ideas.

All the south knows is that black is wrong and always will be I still live in the south and I still see and feel the affects of my skin color and that's just the way the world is.

I highly doubt it was either candidates intention. People in this world already have their minds made up that gay people shouldn't be married. Which is very wrong. I think what we need is somebody that is gay to run for president. They are the only ones these days that believe in what is right and will fight for it.

what do you mean make progress now.  we HAVE made progress by electing the first black president.  don't expect everything to just change overnight.  it took over 200 years for this and blacks have been around in the US for just as long.  i'm sure gays have been as welll, but not as public as it has been over the recent decades.

if he keeps his word it will be a phased withdraw... which is definitely better than 'maybe a 100 more years' but still... they should come home today..



w/e country has the most problems is none of our business remember folks this war WAS about getting Bin Laden.. now the job is to force democracy? I dont think so.. let them kill each other till extinction for all I care...



the only way another war is possible with Obama as president would be is if we keep sticking our nose where it dont belong..  McCain most likely would have made plans from day one to invade Iran.. a third world country with no navy, and no capabilities to make a nuc for 10yrs.. simply because they threatened 'we will flood the world with cheap oil in the European denomination'.. which would in turn cripple the American dollar... I dont see that happening with Obama tho.. I think he will pull some kind of back door deal to avoid another war.. which isn't perfect.. but we cannot maintain this 'war machine' ideology... for many reasons.

Sorry bout your luck if you thought he was going to end the war in Iraq immediately. It says right on his website that it will be a gradual/slow 16 month drawdown and that even after that 16 months he will need to leave a residual force in Iraq to help the Iraqi army fight small pockets of terrorists. Most people didnt read the fine print.



And even his 16 month plan is subject to change, lately he has been hinting of this. 24 months sounds more realistic to me.

Bet on war, possibly WW3. Everyone writes off Clinton's war in Bosnia, where the side that started it began to lose and called in, as they always do at that point, for UN intervention, and then afterwards proclaimed victory, although troops are still there. Democrats are in office when world wars begin, this time odds are good we will lose because the democrats always weaken us and invite attack. Despite Sandy Berger destroying documents the 911 commission never got to see, Clinton did enable 911 by his incompetence and destruction of our intelligence network. I'm not saying Clinton or Obam personally intended/will do this, but people riding their coatails to power did/will intend to deliver us into the jaws of defeat.

Not his choice. He has already said if she broke the law she must go.
What he will do though im certain is make sure she probably has a good place to go back to and is protected. At least thats what i would do. She really doesnt have to go back to Kenya-but she cant stay here. Why not Canada? Haha.

Why do people think it's about race?



President-elect Obama did not make race any part of his campaign. He was strictly about America - ALL America. Why has his win seemingly scared witless the section of the white population who are bigoted and prejudiced? Are they afraid that he might enact measures against them as they might in his place? I'm in the UK and am looking forward to a more well-rounded America in the world.

Why would you change the name of our Nation's capital building?  The name of the building has nothing to do with color of skin but of the color of the exterior of the building.  This country has far too much history to ever change something in name as long as it doesn't cause hurt or suffering.  The diversity in this country are the have's and the have not's.  40 years ago we did not have the same rights as American's, today we do and what that does is makes all American's white, black, hispanic, asian, natives or any other race have to work just as hard as the next to make their mark on society.  The days of sitting around waiting on hand outs is over, the time for change is now and it starts with the youth of today.

Well, it was only whitewashed to cover up the smoke damage after the British set the feckin' place on fire a couple of hundred years ago.



So how about, 'The "Quick Lick of Paint and Get the Insurance Claim In Quick" House' ???



But seriously, carry on calling it the 'White House'. Don't think you need to change it because of the complexion of your President (which I think is the mischievous point of this question). You never changed it to 'The Freckly, Gingery House' for Kennedy, or the 'Sallow, Perspiring House' for Nixon.... so you don't need to make any changes for the new 'black' President-designate.

OH YES - and they are scary.  If you check out Obama's own website it basically says his stance on foreign policy w/ the Middle East is to "ask" them to stop being/supporting terrorism and if they "say" they will then he will give them money.

Obama said he wanted to meet with the leaders of communist countries, whom we have problems with, (Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, etc.) although McCain said he didn't want to take on that responsibility....
But we still really don't know what's going to happen to our country until we see changes.

Obama, whats your verdict?



Just to say well done to America for voting for change. For voting somone who represents much more that war, small minded views and a general inadequate way with words, like Bush did!



The Americans can now hold their flags in different ways, not just over a battlefield...and now can resume the role of a positive rolemodel for the world for change!, not just for war!



Whats your view on Obamas presidency?

My thoughts on Obama: gay marriages will be legalized in every state, "Under God" will be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance, women will be able to get abortions up to 8 months in the pregnancy, money will be taken from the hard working citizens and given to the ones who sit on their butt all day living off welfare, gas prices will sky rocket, he will form an alliance with our enemies and war will come to the US instead of other countries...what do you think about that??  Is this the kind of man you want serving this country?  Must be because he's there now...

This battle is not over, there is alot to be done, but we have someone on our side, that will fight for us and not lie down and let our country be trampled on. I am indescribably happy today.

Well, let me see.  He has stated he hated America and what it stands for with his friends.  His wife is a racist, because she said if she get's into power she will put "her people" first  ( what happened to American Unity they say they want).  Ayres will be eating dinner at the White house he bombed, and Obama will become "friends" with our enemies.  Did NO ONE pay attention to anything BESIDES the Liberal Media?

Well, are you a poser? Ok then why do you care what she thinks?
I don't see what beating her up would do, but if you do decide to beat her up to make yourself feel better, don't get caught. Don't video tape it and pass it around. Don't sell tickets to it. Don't tell anyone else what you are going to do. Don't have witnesses.



Really, only stupid people resort to violence though. If you were smart, you'd think of something much more witty than that. Plus, it will just make you look like a bully if you beat her up. I wouldn't want to be friends with you if you went around beating up everyone who looked at you funny.



BTW, emo is not cool.

Yes, not because he won but because of all the people over the last 40 years who worked so hard for a day like today.  Where a man of color, half black and half white could stand up and lead our Nation.  It symbolizes what Dr. King wanted even in conservative terms.  Dr. King was a Republican and he believed in equality not social status.



It's a great day for America and though past generations will be the ones who won't see the change the young children and the children yet to be born will be the ones who can say, I don't have to live on welfare, I don't have to go to prison or sell drugs to make a living, I don't have to join gangs or turn to robbery to find my place in life as I have the same right as every other child alive to be what I want to be in life.  THAT is what I cried for and for the people who died to help make our country this way.

Why do people think it's about race?



President-elect Obama did not make race any part of his campaign. He was strictly about America - ALL America. Why has his win seemingly scared witless the section of the white population who are bigoted and prejudiced? Are they afraid that he might enact measures against them as they might in his place? I'm in the UK and am looking forward to a more well-rounded America in the world.

Obama's race mattered less to white people than it did to black people.  It's stupid to choose a president simply because of race, I agree with that.  Yet, 90% of black people voted for Obama BECAUSE he's black, even if he went against everything he said.



I am white and I fear what Obama will do as a President.  Not because he's black but because he's a liberal who has no concept about many aspects of running our country.  Those who thought it couldn't get any worse than Bush will find out just how wrong they are.

Because they are prejudiced.  These people who say that President Obama got the black vote for being black are pathetic.  You might as well have racist tattooed on their foreheads.  Does this mean every white president has been elected for being white?



And think of the amount of money the white house budget is going to save now that it doesnt have to buy in colouring books to keep George W occupied.



Edit - I love that all these 'opinion polls' are saying that 90% of black people have no idea what Obama stood for.  Hmmm those surveys were done really quickly weren't they?

Its not about race per say its just a huge accomplishment to have a black man in office. Obama did a very good job of not making this about race. He silenced black leaders like jesse jackson and al sharpton to no make this a race issue. I am white and I am very very proud to see a young black man in office.

Polling showed race mattered less to whites, but as much as 90% of blacks voted for Obama, race is a big issue for them, it is their crutch, their excuse and justification for everything, even murder. I had two friends randomly murdered for being white by street gang members and know of a third in a nearby town, and they got light sentences because of "political correctness" or maybe the victim used a racial slur. Well rounded? Yeah that's why Vortigen invited in the Saxon conquest. As I understand it their are parts of UK cities that are now "no go" zones for whites or non-muslims, and your government has accepted sharia law in competition to your own justice system, I guess your country is "rounded" all right.



Don't normally on other's comments, but this will save the USA money? LMAO! Obama says he supports pulling the troops out of Iraq (BTW no US deaths this last month, where's the press?) and putting them into Afghanistan, you can count on many more Mogadishu/Bosnia type interventions too, maybe even WW3 unless we are very lucky. With democrats that sank Congress the last term to a historic low, and a democratic President, they are going to throw money around in all directions, that means they will have to print it as no one wants to loan us more. And oil is already going up because they have pledged to stop domestic energy exploration, nuclear plants and use of coal, it will be the Carter energy policy all over again, know what a gas line is?

polling results, whites 5-20% depending on state, blacks everywhere on average 90% said race mattered in their vote for Obama.

I'm more worried about him waging war on Pakistan. Our British press have carefully cut footage of Obama to make him look like some kind of Messiah. I recently saw a full length debate between him and McCain..and he seems to have the same old USA neurosis. Let's bomb anyone who doesn't play our game. Now..I'm glad he won. Because the alternative was that evil ***** Palin getting power when old McCain steps off the coil. I think we need to wait and see. Remember the euphoria of getting Labour into power?

It's not about race, and this is getting on my nerves more than ever.  I don't think a lot of white people who voted for McCain did it because he's white...they voted for him because they believed in his values.  We have a president now who approves of gay marriages, abortions, etc...he hasn't done anything for our country and has no experience.  Like I said in my question earlier on answers...did you vote for Obama because you're a sexist??  We can turn this right around and say you did, but that's not true.  You obviously agree with Obama, thinking that gay marriages are ok, women should be able to get abortions...and maybe you agree that we should take "under God" out of the Pledge like Obama.

That is exactly why he won.



Because he was black.



The Black's came out in droves to vote for him just because of the color of his skin, it had nothing to do with whether or not he could run this country.



If the news had covered him the way he needed to be covered then he would not be in office right now.

You most certainly are allowed to ask.  UK does not have a written consitution and there is nothing to stop anyone becoming prime minister, even a complete foreigner, a person who is not even a British citizen can become PM.  But of course none of this can happen until such a person has raised a political party, been elected as an MP then won a general election.



Far more difficult than it all sounds.



The head of state of UK is NOT the prime minister.



The UK head of state is HM Queen Elizabeth II.



Thus if a despot or some other horrid person were to win an election and thus claim to be PM they would first have to go to HM Queen to ask her permission to form a government.  She might very well refuse.

Well, first of all, Obama's father was black (born in Kenya) and his mother was white (born in Kansas). So, in reality, Obama is only half-black.

It was already factored in.  Last week saw the biggest gain in Wall St history.  Yesterday, the market was up huge.  Wall St is based on speculation.  It rises on speculation and falls with news.



It didn't take much to speculate that Obama was going to win.  Now, the actual news is history.



Nonetheless, if I were you, I would get in the market now.  The market will rise from here over the long term.

Good thing Bush has gone? ?



I couldn't care less about Obama but I think it's a good thing for the USA that Bush has gone as he represents everything people dislike about the USA. He seems to have a brainwashed overinflated ego and talks complete nonsense. Do any Americans think he talks sense, or are any clever enough to see him for what he is? The way he stands there like an idiot and says this is the greatest country, it just reminds me of what he did after Sep 11th and sat in his office saying, we're the greatest, hoping people are stupid enough to think saying that will make them happy and they don't think of any sense.

She has plenty of money and CHOOSES to shop at the places that she does. Its not like she is forced to shop at those places because she does not have the money.  And F-Y-I I am pretty sure that she does not buy her clothes from K-mart, but in fact she says that she shops at J-Crew, and online. Just because she doesn't spend 300,000 on a dress doesn't make her cheap.  She represents the middle class folks and acts and dresses as such, how would it look if she dressed in outfits that costs more than some of our salaries, it would make her and her husband look like liars,hypocrites, oh and "out of touch" with the people.
I see you Haters have Jokes on this wonderful OBAMA DAY!

How do people in the military feel about Obama winning?



I am curious because of the tremendous sacrifice that military personnel  makes.  Since they have served in Iraq and other countries, just want to see what there opinion is and by the way thanks for all you do.

Depends on who you ask. Today, A bunch of the Air force cadets will need to see a counselor. They are scared of Obama and they think the world is about to end. I'm not joking



The older ones will back Mccain to the grave. But 20%+ are secretly glade they won't have to stay in Iraq for the next 100 years.



But some of the officers are happy and will want Obama picture is his office.
PS..an officer that backs Obama said this means that we won't have to stay in Iraq!

I'm not in the military but I lost my brother in September of this year do to this pointless war. So i'm over EXCITED to a see change, and from what i've seen so far Obama does have a heart, so maybe he feels the pain of so many Americans who have lost their love ones due to this nonsense!! So I pray he will stop the madness and send our people home!

Our other issues aside (I'm working on a response to your other point) I heard that there was a voluntary code regarding campaign donations which was supposed to 'cap' the amount received by each party. McCain chose to adhere to this, Obama supposedly chose not to, and as a consequence, Obama received twice as much funding than McCain.



Sorry, doesn't really answer your question, does it? Perhaps in the future, we'll find out that there was all kinds of unsavoury deals being made behind closed doors . . .

General principles for avoiding getting beaten up by a bully:
Never go anyplace where you are alone.  Always make sure somebody else is around.
Always be aware of your surroundings.
Never go home or to school by the same route or at the same time every day.  Vary your schedule.
Act confident.  Don't act worried or scared.
If he does attack you, hit him as many times and as hard as you can.  It doesn't matter who wins the fight; what matters is that you fight back as hard as you can.  He won't come after you again.

The school is legally responsible for your safety.



You could approach the school administration (not your teacher) and make a complaint or at least inform them of threatening behaviour.



That way if anything does happen there is history that you took appropriate action before an incident occurred.



And then, if you get cornered, go for the throat.

Not at all. In fact, I agree with Doris Kearns Goodwin who stated it was sad to see so many black people support Clinton, when he hadn't done anything to help them. He did endorse welfare reform which disproportionately hurt black people, because they are unfortunately more likely to be poor.

word is mightier than the sword. His acknowledgement speech was magnificent. What an orator!. I've never seen so many grown men cry when he was speaking. I think he has touched the hearts of even  the most cynical of people.

Obama has said that he wants to expand the war in Afghanistan and he has said that he would have launched attacks against the Taliban and Al Qaida in Pakistan "a long time ago." He said that on September 26, 2008, in a debate with McCain. He was against the Iraq war, but he is not generally anti-war.

</answer from>



<answer>



I think that since it's so common for politicians from both countries to steal riffs from each other, that it's only a matter of time.



After all, Reagan in America led to Thatcher in England. Joe Biden actually plagiarised a Tony Blair speech, not even bothering to change key details in the eighties.



The British Obama could be of Indian descent, or more likely a Scotsman. But he will appear.  Hope and Change is something the whole world could use.  And the Men and Women who will bring it are waiting in the wings for their cue.



After all, Slavery was ended in America by a war. In England it was ended by a song--"Amazing Grace."  The Brits, especially the Celts have more experience bringing change with words than us Yanks do.



Edit: Some of the African Americans I know are pretty racist too. But the Irish Americans also provided many of the Community Organizers of the Civil Rights Movement of the 50's and 60's.  And while it's true that rish Americans did riot in 1863 to avoid the Draft, they later fought for, raised equipped, trained and led the Black Regiments.



Celts rarely do anyting halfway. When they are bigots, they are the worst. When they are Statesmen, they are the Best.



Us Yanks have fond memories of an MP from Dublin named Edmund Burke. And nearly half of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence were Celts, 14 Irishmen, a dozen or so Scots and at least one Welshman--fellow by the name of Franklin.



And the words of Jonathan Swift, also from Dublin, are still bringing change throughout the World. Good thing US Republicans mostly haven't read "A Modest Proposal" though. I can just hear them proclaiming, "Wow! What a concept."

What do you think Obama will do for the war on drugs?



he has been flip flopping around this issue during his election/pre election. ... I don't want any racist comments, but i am curious, do you think he'll legalize marijuana?? if so, do you think he'll only legalize marijuana or do you think he'll allow any drug consumption?? I am totally in support of marijuana, but i hope to heck that he doesn't allow any drug!

NO!! i didn't ask that because Obama is black!! I asked that because I can predict how hard it would be to legalize marijuana and not other drugs!

Hes preferable to McCain who has his age against him.  nothing wrong with being mature but I think its a young mans job. he needs the energy and get up and go.



But with all the hype about Obama being the first black american president, is it his colour or his values that got voted in?

unfortunately 99% of it was about colour. it must have been. he hasn't said anything particularly radical (anyone can claim they want change when the country is in so much turmoil), but because he was not a middle-class, ageing white man, the ethnic minorities in the country paid attention and finally decided to vote for someone.



but he will do a lot better for the country that Dubya Bush ever did, and i don't think anyone would have benefited from having McCain in charge. So the best man won, even if it was for the wrong reasons.

I believe if we wasn't black, he would maybe have the same amount or even more votes. I have a hunch that many republicans didn't vote Obama because they don't like the color of their skin. If he happened to be white, then he would have appealed to everyone because of the fact that he's actually a great candidate.

Don't be silly - Americans are foolish but not that bad.  Most of the people who voted for him were white (given that they are the majority).  do you really think it was important to them to put a black man in power.  I don't think so - they voted for the man.  Had the majority of voters been black then I think it would be fair to ask the question - doesn't make any sense under the circumstances.

I think Obama was greatly helped by his colour and his personality.



His values are not exactly clear, as he speaks a lot in abstractions.  It's clear, though, that he is on the Left.  I don't think that everybody who voted for him is on the Left.
I don't agree that the Presidency is a young man's job, though.  It is a vigorous person's job; and both Obama and McCain are vigorous.

Consider it this way:  Could it have been the colour?  The black population consists of about 20% of the total US population.  Meaning, if every single black person voted, is 20% of the vote enough to elect someone president?  20% is a good start, but that other 30% has to come from somewhere.



I know when I voted, I did not care about colour.  Obviously, at a minimum 31% of the US agrees with that statement.  I'm not going to say that a few blacks did vote Obama because he's black, but I've also spoken with some blacks who didn't vote Obama because he "was not black enough".



Also, we have had black candidates in the past.  Just like we have had female candidates in the past.  Neither group did well (barring Hillary Clinton).  If it was all about the colour, don't you believe that another black candidate would have done well in a previous election?

Combination of the two, i overheard this young lady talking on a restaurant (she was African American) talking about how in her church (which was mainly supported by African Americans) they were not allowed to tell people who they should vote for by name but her pastor continuously told his church every single day "ya'll know who to go vote for".



Another example, i am currently taking a debate class, the person sitting next to me (an  African American Male) out of nowhere went "CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE FOR OBAMA" my Professor asked him " What do you like about Obama? what is your reason for supporting him? Politically.?

Do you think ex-President Bush is mad that Barack Obama won?? I only say that because this morning on CBS news there was a special report with President Bush talking in the Rose Garden and it seems like the entire speech was about him speaking to John McCain on the phone saying how hes soooo sorry he didnt win. Do you think hes mad because hes black?

Overall - he deployed sobriety and a somber tone.  From that, he appeared aware of the monumental accomplishment, but more, the task ahead.  It also spoke to the fact that this was just the first step - the work is ahead.



He also focussed on the people - and their vital role....both in the decision - but more importantly, of THEIR role ahead.  He suggested sacrifice, work and servie, and how that will be expected of them if the country is to change and prosper.  He left no doubt that one man cannot change it - they will all need to pitch in.



He also made sure that all bases were covered - his campaign strategists, republicans, troops, international allies, freedom fighters throughout history.  He gave credit where it was due, and included them all in the victory.



Overall - I give him an A+ in his content and delivery.

How are you helping the forgotten victims of Hurricane Ike?



Did you know that there are many still suffering in the wake of Hurricane Ike?  While the Houston/Galveston area was hit hard by Ike, it truly pales in comparison to the devastation seen on the Bolivar Peninsula and Bridge City Texas.  In Bridge City, a population of over 8000, only 14 homes did not sustain significant damage from Hurricane Ike's massive storm surge.  What have you done to help and can you do more?

I haven't done anything to help hurricane victims of Ike.



If a great flood comes along and washes away my house and I look sad enough...someone might build me another house.  Just like the one that I was used to.  All cozy and warm and soft.  Then another flood comes along.  Washes all of that away.  Maybe if I look sad again, another person will come along and build me another house.



It's time for me to start building my own house, you see, out of the path of the floods.  It's time for me to rethink the architecture of my home.



I donated money to Katrina victims only to find out much later on that the money never got there...it went to give raises to the people in charge of the "non-profit" organization that I donated to.  If anything trickled down far enough to those intended...it was disbursed on cards and used to buy fur coats and toys.



If I'm going to help a victim I'd like to know that the victim really needs my help, is going to use my donation for something that they truly need, and that 100% of what I'm giving is going directly to the victim and not being pie-cut by an organization using the disaster as an excuse to profit.  ;)

If your a racist, just means its O.K. to read a biology book and learn the difference or even better where life came from.  Or more importantly protect your women, we all don't like watermelon.



If you think you know the economy or history, stop, you just showed anyone who reads this that you don't know jack.  Even better, did you go to college?

If you're so smart being a McCain supporter... why are you on here bashing people you don't even know?  Sounds to me like the "magnitude" of your own stupidity gives you nothing better to do with your time than sit on the computer saying stupid things...



Unless you know each and every Obama supporter personally you're the stupid one for classifying all his supporters as "less educated"  Get a life and something better to do with your time! Some of us are at work and simply like to enjoy intellectual conversation, but you seem incapable of that to me!

I don't see the logic in your question?  How did you come about this or are you just angry that he won?  I know a lot of very educated white people that voted for him.  I can name about 100 off the top of my head that I know and deal with on a day-to-day basis -  mostly professors, teachers, editors and doctors.

In response to your comment that has been made. I would like to say I am toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo educated to even debate with you on this subject and yes Im a woman and black at that and all i can say is YOUR PRESIDENT'S BLACK. LOL Get over it and thank you for your  comment because now my child will be even more EDUCATED than you.



"YOUR PRESIDENT'S BLACK"
"YOUR PRESIDENT'S BLACK"
"YOUR PRESIDENT'S BLACK"



So that statement alone tells you that a EDUCATED BLACK MAN  with only 4 yrs in the Senate is President of the United States. You see were not stupid at all were smarter than before because  we elected a BLACK man as President instead of giving it to  McCain. So dont be mad because were smarter than YOU!!!!!!  HA HA HA HA LMFAO!!!!!! THANK YOU " YES WE CAN AND YES WE DID"



And for those who don't want to accept it so what you think about that  "YOUR PRESIDENT'S BLACK"

I didn't vote for either one this time. I didn't like either of them. However, since Obama won, I will give him a chance. Maybe he is what we need.  He doesn't have that much experiece but look at where we are with a government run by people with experience. He cannot do any worse.



I think that there are people out there that voted against him just because he is black even if they didn't like McCain. That proves how ignorant some people are.  They see color instead of qualifications.  I'm sure the security on this president will have to be extra tight because of the worthless, ignorant racists in our world today.  Even if he does make some good changes, they will hate him because he's black and wish him harm. Total foolishness.

If some stupid, ignorant, racist white people ever try and do such a horrible thing, that could set us back many many decades.  So please, we don't NEED that.

Better health care for sure.
More jobs created less outsourcing.
Gas prices staying down.
A living wage of at least $8/hour
People living on disablity or social security to get at least $1000.month.



Being more selective on who can recieve disablity and welfare benefits; only giving them to those who are truly disabled, homeless or making less than 1000/month.
Welfare reformation.
Price Freeze on all rents, utlities and basic living needs.
No taxes for those making less than 12,000./year.
Bring home troops from iraq.
redistrubition of wealth; meaning not so much money in the hands of the wealthy.
Credit reformation; nothing can stay on your credit for more than 3 years regardless of payment history.
NO credit checks for jobs, housing and cars.



Gay marriage legalized.
More control on big businesses; meaning those credit card companies can no longer charge $35 late fees for being 1 day late or being $1 over your credit limit. No more fake job ads and giving the customer more power over their own bills. A person no longer has to be stuck in a contract for 2 + years just to get lower rates.
Focus more on smaller businesses that provide truly customer based services.
I could go on and on ....



I would say that the most important things are the state of the econmy and brining back the troops.

He did not fight at any time in his life for our great country and he is friends with some "shady" characters.  Get over calling people racists because they did not vote to make history for the 1st black presdent and VOTED FOR MORE THAN JUST VANITY

How long do you think it will be before Barrak Obama mania will calm down?



With everything that's happening in the US ,do you think Obama is mentioned daily by everyone on the planet?
Do you think 1 day his name will be accepted into the dictionary ?
i.e. obamaism - the bringing together of a nation

In spite of ideas to the contrary, if those who dislike him will give Obama half a chance, then I think there is hope. The real division seemed to begin with talk radio hyping the religious right agenda. I think that was the beginning of the real dividing line.



Funny, Obama supporters cheered McCain's name during Obama's speech. The McCain Supporters booed Obama. McCain would have no part of it, and hushed them quickly...
McCain is putting country and unity first why his followers won't shows them to be, well who they are.

Hopefully, it will not.
As I see it, he is a good, honest, hardworking, enthusiastic, driven man.
Above all there's a simplicity and humbleness in him that reminds me of great men that have made history like Gandhi, Carol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II), Martin Luther King and others who honestly tried to make the world a better place.
Obama is made of the same stuff heros and great leaders are made and people sense it.
Mark my words, Obama will make history and I expect it will be for all the right reasons. He has already begun.



And I am not even American to be saying this and obviously I could not vote. I am a Southern European and white.



But I am all for this man.



Politics around the world needs to start equipping itself with good men.
Cynicism and greediness have done enough harm.



Change is welcome :-)

As soon as they realize that nothing is going to change. there will be no health care reform. there will be not real tax breaks for everyday people to even impact our lives. The stock market will still make a slow recovery. people will still loose their houses. The country will still go into a recession.



The $500 check he will send everyone will be spent in a day to catch up on the light bill. that is about it. Then people will still not get it. Why, because it is the large global corporations that have been reducing the quality of life of everyday Americans. Not the government. This progression has been accruing over the past 100 years, it is the raise and fall of capitalism. No one man or government can stop it.



Bring together a nation? I never knew we were apart? Seriously, all has been fine in the last 50 years, what is going on that I don't see? Is there a civil war? Is there riots in the streets? What, gays cannot vote? People are staving on the streets? what? Tell me what is so bad, and how is the country so divided that it needs a revolution? Women cannot vote? blacks cannot vote? Mexicans cannot stay in America after  jumping walls in San Diego? The free press is restricted from printing articles? Freedom of speech and due process is no longer a right? We got attacked so we attacked back, no war is perfect. If we did nothing...well, it was not an option.



The only thing that is wrong is that, a group of people got greedy and sold useless paper to the stock market. And our economy is going through a recession like it does every 10 to 15 years. That is about it. And that is fixed. bush's guys fixed it. and in a little time it will pass. It has nothing to do with Obama or MC Cain.

The markets continue to rise and fall due to economic concerns, not because of who has been elected president. The election didn't wipe the slate clean – the economy still sucks and is likely to do so well into Obama's presidency. He is neither to blame for its failures nor responsible for its successes.



The rhetoric of fear didn't work, dude. Give it up.

Keep in mind our nation is already in an economic time of uncertainty.  The month of October had some of the largest losses followed by some of the largest gains in history.  Each election causes some influence in the stock market.  However, Obama will not be in office until January.  The best thing to do for all of you scared and uncertain republicans that are dissapointed by the election is to take a deep breath and let democracy do its thing.  Everything will be ok.

I don't know for certain which debt to china you refer to however, I suspect this talk of debt refers to the moral debt America owes to past chinese immigrants who were so cruelly abused by the American Government and the American people.



It should be recognised that the Chinese effectively built America.  Had the chinese not built the transatlantic railway system then the progress that followed this huge contribution from the chinese would either have not happened or would have taken a great deal longer to achieve.

In England, we pay higher taxes for those who need the money.
Single parent families get 'Family tax credit' so they can buy their children what they need, like shoes with no holes, and stuff.



People who have been out of work for a while because of various reasons are given money to buy work clothes.



I know people here who need the money. I am glad to help. If you're afraid of being poor, then stop spending your money on crap that you don't need, and help those who need you.



Hopefully there will be more officers to weed out the fraudsters.

His words do not predict positive change and a positive outlook for hard-working Americans. He wants to support those who are too selfish and lazy to support themselves and their families. Let the government do it for them. This is NOT, I repeat, NOT, the change JFK wanted. What happened to, "It is not what your country can do for you, but what can YOU do for your country?" Everyone wants to take, take, take now from those who worked hard and got a good education until everyone gives up, and there is nobody to take from. Be afraid.

I hope he has ACTUAL ideas because (yes I know all votes down but I don't care I'm being honest) I haven't seen real NEW ideas yet.

Do your own research rather than relying on all of the stupid rumors flying around.



Obama was never raised Muslim. His father was, but his father was also an atheist by the time he met Obama's mother. They also divorced when Obama was only two years old. Obama's step-father was a Muslim, yes, but he was ever particularly religious and didn't really attend services, either (think a Christian who never prays or goes to church except for Christmas and Easter--do you still call them a Christian, or would you call them fake?). Obama and his sister were raised in a fairly non-religious household, though Obama did attend Catholic school as a child. Now, Obama is a Christian, his sister, a Buddhist.

<question>



USA continues to "bomb" Pakistan via missiles. Is Obama going to continue doing this, intensify or withdraw?



Do we see any change in current Bush's foreign policies in the name of "war on terror" for terrorizing not only his own people but the whole world out there? Did he really win hearts and minds of American people by promising to invade Pakistan more intensely? Are Americans really in for a war to end all wars started by Bush? Have Americans been bullied into thinking like this against Pakistan by Obama that Pakistan is the real cause of global terrorism out there? If so, how can policy makers be so stupid to equate a nuke nation with one million American-trained troops having ballistic missiles with poor ones like Afghanistan or Iraq? What is really going to happen in the world out there as Obama promissed to bomb Pakistan during his 2-year long election campaign and then retracted his statements "diplomatically" but still insisted for the sake of one guy "Osama". Is Osama really this much important to him just as important it was for Bush? Can this stupidity prevail forever in an educated, advanced, sane and mature-thinking Americans' minds who voted for Obama? Aren't his supporters going to be worse than the Republicans to become far worse Neo-cons for planning bigger and wider campaigns against Islam, Muslims, Pakistan, and other others out there in the name of one person "Osama"? How can 350 million people still be fooled and continue to be fooled by current, new or any other future Presidents of USA? I see a huge connection between the current American Depression with the foreign hatred of America today. Is this what today's American Mothers want whenever they are sending their sons and daughters to bomb, invade, kill women, childern, elders, young (in the name of "collateral damage"). Don't you think 1.5 billion Muslims out there need a sane America for the American sake, not for their sake? Common Muslims in 50+ Muslim countries are having more peace, prosperity and better future out there despite being ruled by Kings, Dictators or sham democracy because of the general Islamic principle of meaning "Peace" whenever saying it. Why can't Americans think for themselves instead of voting for war? Don't you think today's American Economy is WAR ECONOMY? If so, then why do you continue selecting someone who talks and promotes more wars instead of ending them? Unfortunately, American political and election system allows only 2 parties without giving any head or ears to more saner voices arising from within USA. When is the real "CHANGE" going to happen instead of being fooled by another Obama in the years to come by continuing to shed the blood in the name of "Change has Arrived"?

Hey James. Pakistan has told the US repeatedly that it does not have permission to bomb site inside Pakistan. The US does it anyway, then denies it happened. That is a violation of Pakistans sovreignty, and if you want to get technical, an act of war.

If you want to get technical, Pakistan's failure to control the free flow of men and arms in and out of Afghanistan for the purpose of destabilizing the legal government of Afghanistan is an act of war too.



If you want to get technical Bush didn't start the war against fundamentalist Islam. This isn't a struggle that started in 2001. The current problem of fundamentalist Islam has its roots in Iran's overthrow of the Shah, in wars over Kashmir, and opposition to the state of Israel. The problem of Islam itself as a political force of extremism has existed since the days of Mohammed.



If you want to get technical the only fools are those that don't understand the threat that fundamentalist Islam poses against our rights and freedoms and those of countries around the world.



If you think that a change in the Presidency will change the conduct of war then you are sadly mistaken. The President doesn't have enough influence to start and stop wars on a whim. The only conclusion to the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is to allow the legitimate governments to function as democracies by the people and for the people.

I think this was a race based election. Many people voted on the color of skin and not policies. The worst thing I've realized is that Obama used the color of his skin as a platform. There are plenty of people I know who fantasized so much about a black president, that they don't care about Obama's policies. In fact, they couldn't list out one of Obama's plans if you asked them to. Instead of tearing down racial barriers, the election built them back up.



Everyone should vote on policy, as you did. However, many people do not.

Judging by your spelling of "color," I assume you are British, or possibly Canadian.  You are right that skin color shouldn't make a difference, but in the US it still does.  Certainly things are much better than they were a hundred years ago, and better even than they were twenty years ago, but it is also true that it has taken 219 years since the founding of the US for a black man to even be a viable candidate for president, much less get elected.



Every time one of these color barriers is crossed -- black generals, black CEOs, black mayors and governors -- we get closer to the day when race will not be an issue, at least not for the vast majority of people in the US.  But if you have read or heard some of the truly hateful, or at the very least ignorant, rhetoric that has been spouted during this campaign, including on this forum, you will understand that race is still a very important issue for many Americans. Now that a black man has been elected to the nation's highest office, and once people see that he can do at least as good a job as other, white presidents have done, we will have gone a long way towards making the US colorblind.  But we are not there yet.

Doesn't matter, only thing that matters is where she gave birth to him, Kenya or Hawaii, and if his step dad, Sotero, surrendered Obama's/Barry's birth certificate and US Citizenship in Indonesia and obtained Indonesian citizenship for him in order to attend public school, in which case he is not a native USA citizen, and inelligible to serve as President.

They were settlers in the 'Happy Valley' area of the Kenyan highlands.  The hedonistic and uninhibited way of life there made conventional relationships irrelevant, and in later years became internationally famous/notorious.  The young Obama was a product of that communal scene, where Europeans, Americans, Greeks, Lebanese and many locals all associated.  It is pointless trying to make observations about his 'biological parents', as this was not an important concept at that time and in that place.

His mom was white and from Kansas. She passed away years ago. His dad was black and from Kenya. He pretty much left them, and then his mom married an Asian man. His white grandmother pretty much raised him. So whatever his accomplishes are, you should give his white granny credit for it. I heard that she died a couple of days ago, but voted early for her grandson. BTW, she called him Barry.

Why does it seem to be the going concensus that if you are white and you did not vote for Obama that you are racist.



He did not fight at any time in his life for our great country and he is friends with some "shady" characters.  Get over calling people racists because they did not vote to make history for the 1st black presdent and VOTED FOR MORE THAN JUST VANITY

I do not think people who did not vote for obama are racists at all. That may be some people's reason for not voting for him. Honestly I believe that most who voted for McCain were solid republicans who did not want to change parties. If an interracial candiate ran on the republican side; those same people would vote for him or her.

Whomever called you racist for voting for someone other than Obama is the racist one.  I am a Obama supporter.  I voted for him because I believe in his policies. I trust his agenda.  This has nothing to do with race.  If someone voted for Obama purely  because of the color of his skin they have failed themselves and our great democracy.

Sweetie its not about being racist. So what if McCain served our country my father did too for 20 yrs and he's black. If you didnt vote for Obama then that's your choice. What people fail to realize its not about making Black History its about making American History. I can't wait for the day when a child that goes to a all white school,  black school or any type of school will open the American History book and see that electing a African American President is not just Black History but American History.

If you truly believe in the McCain platform, and you voted accordingly, then you are not a racist for being white and voting for McCain.  As for me, the only platform I heard from the McCain side was to tax health insurance benefits one gets from one's employer.  How is that not raising taxes on those who can least afford an extra $300 or $400 taken out of their meager paychecks every month?  If that's not how is would have worked, blame the McCain campaign committee for not explaining any of his platform more thoroughly.  Personally, I voted for the candidate who could articulate and explain his proposals, and well enough so that I could understand which candidate would hurt me more with their platform.

What about the racial comments surrounding our new president.?



If people didn't care what race he was when they voted for Obama, why is it such a big deal that he's now "OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT!" ?



And for the record, I want to ask, since when do you call an interracial man black? Why does he automatically get called black? He is as much white as he is black. I'm sure other presidents have been interracial, but in these days, it is almost a forced racial situation. I am "white", but of Cherokee decent, among other decents, so I am part Cherokee. Does that mean if I were elected president, I would be the first Cherokee President? No!

Lets be Realistic here, its all a hoax, and America is in as much trouble as we all are in.The colour of his skin will make no difference, he will line his family's pockets just like every other politician, look how many millions he spent fighting for his own victory, if he cared for the black race or any american, he would have put his hand in his own millions and give it to the poor people in new orleans. instead he just talked of change. America is more racist than ever, look at the black rich and governors that all said they support him, and only because of his colour, so they are now showing the hatred they have inside of them, after all it was the white americans as well that gave them their chance and put them in the position without any thought for their colour. it also seems every black person only voted because of his colour, boy they are all in for a shock when they notice only his fortune will improve and in politics there is no colour, its all about money. comparing that fake man to jesus is an insult to humanity. by the way i still think that he was a better choice than McCain, as he has really lost the plot. the best person to be president of America should be miss piggy as she had all the qualities that fit in with the Americans.

Is Barack Obama the new Jesus. No The answer is he has been touched by Jesus because through him all things are possible and God saw that he had the ability to lead his people (white and black) to a be better life. If Joseph could lead Egypt then why cant Obama led this country. God has given us a second chance to redeem ourselves and unite For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. Honestly and truly it is not because  Americans voted for him its because God always had this day in his plan. God really got us to take a better look at each other because wheather you accept it or not we are all brothers and sisters in God's house.

Of course racsim still exists....haven't you been watching the mccain/palin rallies?....Although Barack is only half black, it's still a victory for the African American community who less than 200 yrs ago were looked upon as property...and less than 40 yrs ago had to fight for equal rights...But this is bigger than that...This represents the new generation and Obama Symbolzes Generation Y comming forward and breaking Tradition with how they go about doing campaigns ...He represents a new era of baby boomers and young people who up until last night did not have a voice...Although alot of people say  he has a lack of experience...he seems very intelligent and charismatic...change might not come quickly because of this mess that we are in...But by him being elected President heavily symbolizes that America is willing to move forward with fresh new ideas...and look into the future.

Of course there are still racists out there - of every colour and race!  And  his colour is very significant when you consider the history between blacks and whites in America.  It's a very important indication of how far race relations have come and will be a major turning point in the way many white Americans view black people.  Once they see how well Obama does, they may start to remove the blinkers and realise that it isn't the colour of our skin that sets us apart from each other but how we choose to treat others.  This is a major step towards true equality in the States.

Probably because he is indeed the first black (mixed race) president and this is something that wouldn't have happened 10 years ago.
Yes it does matter now because of the world that we live in and the demographics of the US.  Lets hope that soon his colour will start to take a back seat and people will see him as President first.

Because he is the first black president and no it should not matter but sadly it does because there are still small minded bitter racist bigots in the USA.

No i don't think it will decrease, infact initially it may even increase it as there are many people who are unhappy that Obama being president simply because he is non-white.



What it will do is bring racism to the forefront so it can at least be discussed openly. I will also give some people hope that boundaries and glass ceilings can truly be broken.

The United States will never give up their racism . Most would rather have a white President that will destroy the middle and low income  families completely ,until all that is left are the rich and richer .



I've already got it figured out how to heal the money situation in the US .
Take all the politicians and cut their salary in half  or more , let the ex Presidents get a job like a regular person does  stop that big check too.
Do you realize how much money that would involve ? Oh yea they have to donate  ,of course tax free all the extracted income  to the National Debt instead of making all of us middle and lower income people pay for their  ( politicians )homes  ,clothes and utility bill's,  fancy car's ,  vacations  etc

I agree with you, this is ridiculous.
America is supposed to be mature. So many countries don't have the right of democracy like we do, and yet Americans don't respect that. I supported McCain, but I'll stand by Obama any day.

Technically he's still the president until January 20th...He could always declare a state of emergency though, under the Patriot act he can stay in power and congress can't do anything for at least six months. So really he's not gone yet but uh I don't think that will happen so.



Maybe he can do something useful like go off and fight in Iraq like he has done to so many other families by starting a war in the wrong country...what a dumb ***!

Most ex-presidents do very little. He may write a book or conduct lectures. He may be asked to sponsor some charities. If your question is sincere, those are the answers to what he may do.
On a humorous side...
He won't write a book. Heck he can barely read one.



He won't do charity work, because he is a republican and they don't believe in charity.

This is for the people who believe in change. I am very happy and grateful to have been apart of this and it make me feel good to be an american citizen. For all of you John McCain haters do not reply because I have had enough of all of you haters. GET OVER IT HE LOST!!! Obama supporters just tell what you were feeling at that very moment he won and what you are feeling now.

I live in Australia but I am deeply into equality for all and when I saw it, I watched all day here, I just cried. I feel a great sense of pride that finally African Americans and all black ppl not to mention anyone who is oppressed now will know hope the colour lines are down. I feel that finally we as a world are getting things right as God intended and that is that we are all one in the same. And America has set a precedence for the rest of the world to follow.

I sat there watching CNN live and almost cried tears of joy, instead I sat there with my kitten in my arms and had a wide smile spread across my face. Then I ran to the computer, went to my myspace and my facebook and posted "OBAMA WON!! YESSS!!! =D" in my status box.



Right now, I'm so eager to see what will change exactly, and I have a gut feeling that life is going to get wayyy better. However, I am nervous about Bush making some hasty screw-up decison with the 76 days he has left in control.

If Hillary could be President, why not Palin? Hillary never ran anything except the Hotel White House, and in the senate she is as big a pork barrel fiend as the rest of them. Palin isn't gone, she is back in the great state of Alaska, taking the hatchet to the overbloated budgets sent to her by the democratic controlled state assembly. When Obama's Presidency proves a failure (they have no republicans to blame now), Palin could be back in 2012, if we aren't in WW3 by then or Obama hasn't made himself dictator for life.

The only sad thing is, we won't have anybody to make fun of anymore.

I think he is the chosen man for the this time is American history. Only time will tell how he is remembered in history and the affect of his presidency on the world.



Just like every Commander and Chief before him he will inherit the problems of the previous Administration. The good he will be praised for the bad he will be criticized for . But, like he said last night none of it wil be resolved in 1 year or 1 term. It's going to take all of working together to achieve the goal that is set before us.

If only the world could have voted, it would have been 80% for Obama. American studies have shown american literacy and general knowledge  slipping below that of Albania. This is the only reason I can see why the popular vote was so close.



Based on all the information, I think Obama will do well, reach across the isle (as he promised and has done many times) included lots of republicans in his cabinet, and not talk down to the public (see his speech on racial inequality). I think he will be a great president for a great country and an international citizen for an inter-connected world.

the new Provident credit card for use at Argos. In the long term lending criteria of mortgages it would have an APR of 227% That is it is for payment within 6 months. An example on Sky main page is that if you bought a wii for £179.99 you pay back £248.46. Now in the Real world to an average Jo this would represent 72.44% without the calculation that they can reuse the money again. This is still on the high side - BUT - it is designed and sold to the sub-prime market (people who can't get credit anywhere else and often default)
If the whizz kids in the big banks had UNDERSTOOD the prime market then we would not be in the mess we are now.
So why are Sky reporting on it. They have Louis Bond of USwitch saying it shouldn't be seen as anything but a sub prime loan - well Yes! - Could it all be that Ms Bond brought it to their attention knowing that it would be reported as it comes from the NOT so independent company that gets rewarded financially for every switch.
Alongside is details of how to get the cheapest credit cards on USwitch - but - stupidly the ones that get the Provident/Argos card wouldn't get one of them in a month of Sundays.
Isn't it time to kick these so called experts, who are anything but, into touch ?

Christine H. Maybe if you consider the two stories in the bible, in one Jesus kicked the money lenders out of the Temple the operative part here is "out of the TEMPLE"
The other story is the man who gave three sons money and only one eventually came back giving him profit (bit like the sub prime) the others squandered the money.



Bruntslev. Agree far better to be insular than globalised. (think that is what the arab chappie we don't hear to much about now was against-was is Osama or Abama) As far as working the rates out, that is exactly it they have used a B52 to do the job of a F111. (that aeroplanes) and the sites like uswitch give you a different answer every time but get away with it by putting in a couple of questions that have no revelance.

It is the age we live in.  People buy goods on their credit cards without
realising that even when they settle, they are still paying for the privilege.The best answer to credit cards is to cut them up!



The world is now paying for the stupidity of the American money



market.  But the rest of the world have to take the blame for



relying on American markets, which obviously cannot be trusted.



But it is good that someone has taken the trouble to work out what credit cards are costing us.

Why does it matter? No one has banned homosexual relations, I can see the economic aspect of claiming a signifigant other, but most corporations  and of course the government recognize those rights now. The only thing I can see is that gay couples want the right to have government to force churches into endorsing same sex marriages, and that is where it becomes a conflict of church and state, government doesn't belong in the church anymore than church belongs in the government. If a gay person needs the blessing of family, government and church, it tells me there is an insecurity there they can't handle, a doubt they are doing what is right. So why don't gay people just form their own churches to hold their weddings in?



But I find it hilarious that divorce lawyers support gay marriage, especially as they seem statistically, for whatever reason, (Get yer sh#t packed and get out!) more likely to break up.

They can have union or unity ceremonies, but the end result will not be called "marriage", because it will be back to being regarded as a union of "man and woman".  They can keep "domestic partnership" as a designation after they have their ceremonies.

Marriage is defined, both historically and literally, as the union of man & woman in holy or legal matrimony, so gay marriage is simply an oxymoron. Here in England, same sex couples are allowed what is called a civil partnership, which conveys all of the same rights etc. that married couples have, but avoid using a the term

I am a Independent,and i did not vote in the 08 elections.If I HAD to choice to vote for a Republican or Democrat,it will be a Democrat.But,if I HAD to vote between John Mccain or Barack Obama,I would vote for JOHN MCCAIN.I believe that obama is going to do something evil, Joe Biden also said that something big was going to happened in the first"6" months.I believe that George Bush is not evil,he's dumb,but not evil.I think George Bush was meant for the american people dislike him in order for barack obama to win. liberals and conservatives,what do you think?

Bush is okay with torture of citizens in a country that he called to invade, that had done the USA no harm...to me that more than qualifies as evil.



Obama is Bush & Cheney's little cousin, so don't be surprised by anything that happens under his rule. He is just a puppet front-man spokesperson for the real persons in charge.



Fascism will be easier for the masses to swallow when it's coming from behind a pretty face and smooth talk.

your definition of evil and dumb are distorted, i would prefer for a man who came from a working class back round to look after my interests at presidential level as opposed to a war monger born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
Barack will have to spend his first term of office cleaning up the mess that bush made , then if the american people give him a second term I can see some great changes that would benefit all Americans and nationalities that the bush administration have harmed

You probably don't believe everything politicians say right? I mean what politicians like to tell truth in straight forward manner?



But you believe Biden on his "prediction" which he gave no solid evidence for. Biden "prediction" can't be only interesting prediction or claim made in this crazy 08 election.



So you make 2 assumption with absolutely no concrete evidence. 1 is that there will be "something big", ok and 2, Obama is some how evil and Biden sees his future evil deeds.



That's great. Yea we should all just make decisions on a hunch. Like Bush did when going to Iraq. We know how that turned out.

Has "The Dream" finally Materialized, by electing Barack Obama?



Not just with the African American Community but for all who dare to dream to become someone, or do something special.  Please I ask that  you keep this intelligent and respectful.



</question>



<additional details>



I don't think anyone Idolizes Obama like he's a GOD. Remember both White and Black voted for him. The Dream I speak of is that Blacks and White are finally considered equal. People dream to become lawyers and doctors true, but how many young ethic males out there dream to become President, rather than dream to become a basketball player, or football star? I noticed last night that it wasn't just blacks crying and cheering, it was white, brown, purple, blue, you name it they were doing so in unison. The little % on the internet are so small, it's pointless to count them. The majority of all Americans spoke out and said Equality is now.

Yes I think it proves to the many people that anyone can simply strive to be something great.  I watched "The View" this morning and I think the ladies made allot of great comments about this.  Sherrie was brought to tears explaining this great moment in history to her son and now that parents can finally have truth to saying to their young African American children that they can overcome and be anything that they set their mind too.  Whoopie explained that she feels that she can finally put "the worker's briefcase down" as if a job has been done.  Barbara played an excerpt from the MLK speech about to the thought that americans will one day look beyond the color of someones skin and judge on moral character and deeds.  I believe that this election just proves his point so much that it's chilling.  This morning I got up and hugged my boys and I said to them that this was an important event in our history and to never forget this day.  Regardless of what people will say about African Americans only voting for him because of race, you cannot discount the other votes.  He would not have one with just their votes.  I pray for his safety and for his wisdom to be achieved.

"THE DREAM" happens every day in America. Every time an American becomes what they want to become. At least that is The American Dream,



Every time a teacher becomes a professor.



Every time an hourly working becomes a regional manager.



Every time a startup company makes their first dollar.



If you are specifically speaking of Martin Luther King Jr's Dream for equality.... no we are still a long ways from that. Just look at all the hate that President Obama has already stirred up on the internet. The day that race is no longer an issue EVER. Is the day that Martin Luther King Jr's Dream comes true.

Obama is half black and half white. He worked hard to get where he is and attended ivy league schools, raised by his white mother. I'm not an Obama fan at all, and think people should stop idolizing him like he's a God. Race has nothing to do with anything and people need to stop looking at him for his color and rather what he plans to do as president (mess up the whole economy).

Girl Killed in Somalia?



A while back a girl in Somalia was gang raped by three men.She and her father reported the incident to the authorities.She was instantly charged with adultery and detained.
A death sentence was handed out as her punishment.The death would be by public stoning.
She was put into a hole and buried up to her neck,so she could not protect her face.A crowd of 1000 people (men and women)gathered for the spectacle,and watched as 50 people (all men) threw stones at her unprotected face.
She cried out for mercy,but the stoning eventually killed her.The girls age???  just 13.This was the price she paid for daring to suggest males might have committed crimes against her.
Humanity at it's lowest ebb.But should our own government be trading and having normal diplomatic relations with barbaric countries.We do not seem to even exert pressure to have sharia law condemned,so they have no need to make changes. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/...

This is just one of a thousand examples of the backward disgusting societies that Muslim countries are trying to force on the rest of us. I and many others have been trying to tell people for a long time that this is the case only to be shouted down as racist by the moronic left wing liberal majority.



Unfortunately those idiots are in the majority now and they have allowed this disgusting facet of Muslim culture to slowly seep into our country, and they have allowed Sharia law to become fixed in this country. When there were cries of outrage, they were ignored.

Your question absolutely freaks me out, because i know this is happening all over the world.All this air-play and column inches in the newspapers about this Ross and Brand thing to me was obscene because the whole planet is in such a desperate state and every newspaper and radio station could report about nothing else.
The governments of all the countries want our votes and support but none of them have their priorities right.Greed and power are destroying our world.
Trillions are spent on space travel when there are folk on Earth walking miles to find clean water.

What would it take to get an 80% turnout in an election in Britain?



I think it's amazing that the voter turn out in the States has been so high.  Apart from turning the whole thing into a reality show and electing celebrities - what could encourage British voters to give a damn?

Do you know ..it sickens me when people don't vote.



Even if you are pissed off with the whole damn lot just spoil the paper but not to vote? As a woman it galls me even more. It was only in the last 100 years that women had to die to get us the vote and now you have these vapid stupid girls who haven't got a foggy clue about anything apart from the Heat magazine.



I don't think Americans are 'all that' either to be fair ( no offence Skidoo!) It's just the whole razzmatazz and personality race appeals to the American Psyche. I've seen very little evidence of political discussions re the American elections but lots of Personality debates.



In Britain it's all become so 'same old' whoever's in power for years now... and that's created a sea of apathy.

People who don´t vote because they cannot be bothered to educate themselves about issues which directly concern them need a good kick up the ****.



All politicians are NOT the same, all political parties are NOT the same.



So many generations have fought (some literally) to build up a democratic country so a load of ignorant, pringle eating, "Jordan" worshipping, trainer wearing , "Sun"and "Daily Star" readers can moan about the Government whilst knowing sod all about it.



Educate yourselves before it is too late people because Cameron is a Maggie´s boy and he cares not about the little people. You moan you got it bad now...HA! just wait until the working man is funding tax cuts for the rich!!!!

I consider it a duty to take part in the democratic process.  So I personally would like to see compulsory voting to be enforced.  That way we would see political parties elected to government by the real voice of the people, and not just because many of them stayed away from the polling stations giving the winning party an easy and unearned victory.



Such steps would undoubtedly increase the turnout, give the candidates a reason to really earn the votes they do catch and maybe even canvass in a proper fashion to influence those of us who are undecided.



I would love my local candidates to knock on my door and listen to my views, answer a few choice questions, and maybe I could even end up voting for one of them!!



If anyone is still undecided who to place their cross against, they can always put 'none of the above' this would mean even though they hadn't felt confident enough in any of the choices given to vote for them, they have still used their ballot sheet, it will still be counted, and they will, after all have taken part in the democratic process which we all know is a right that has been vigourously  fought for.



That way, who knows, doorstep canvassing may make a welcome return and bring with it a new enthusiasm that is sorely lacking on both sides of the process and most definitely within those chambers of Westminster.



An enthusiasm to get the country back on it's feet and get everybody working to that end.

Oh and a free buffet. You know what some people are like if they think there is free food in the offing (The all you can eat brigade) :) :)
I vote in every election. I think it`s important. Even if you are not sure, i still think you should put a cross on the ballot paper for someone. I think it`s laziness on a lot of people`s part not to vote. It only takes 5 minutes. Mind you, i do think sometimes in local elections, particularly, we don`t get given enough detailed information, on what the candidates actually plan to do. If everybody voted, it could make such a difference to the final result and give a more representative one, at that.

Uh what did I do now , Irish ? Actually I was the one calling him a bag of skin, not Janet . She wasnt calling anyone anything. And australians calling someone a bag of skin doesnt mean we are actually discriminating against him , just a way we roll.



McCain may be a respected candidate but not according to Australians, no , unfortunately.



Yes Irish, Christain did say " Obama is gonna get shot and leaves his children fartherless " -- how is that not wrong ?



ok ok calm down ladies.....Ok " not bag of skin "....that was a bit disrespectful , but I thought he was able to wrongly accuse Obama for being a terrorist and it was shown here in Australia, that was disrespectful towards Obama.



....but still You go Obama!!!



Hey Tiacola....



yeah yayyyyyyy Obama won!!!



Really, everyone is entitled to their opinions, nothing personal here The sheep sayth bahhh .

Obama wouldn't want us saying negative things about McCain, and McCain would not want us saying negative things about Obama. The message I got from both of them was unity.

Yes most of the world is rooting for Obama.
Although I would vote for neither of them.
Mc Cain is like Bush reincarnated and belongs to the Middle Ages.
Obama relies on words and refuses to explain how exactly his "changes" are going to be implemented ( in details) Recently the French president went public and called Obama ignorant, arrogant and totally naive regarding the Iran situation.



Am afraid - hope I will be wrong - that the US is going to vote for a mediocre candidate again (either of them)
Heck...they voted for Bush twice.....



I am very wary of politicians anyway. They always seem to change their tune as soon as they are elected.



OK..am a bit harsh.

My opinion is that you shouldn't call an honorable man a "bag of skin" ; it's beneath you and it's not right, regardless of how enthusiastic you are for Obama. Personal attacks....not even close to related to the issues.



Thanks, Janet and RYAN for at last showing how you really are.



John McCain is a respected state Senator, war veteran, and advocate for immigrant rights for over 40 years. Calling him as "skin bag" is as discriminatory as what you complain about others calling Obama.



Stick to the actual issues, if you know any.



**Christian didn't say anything wrong and it's hypocritical of Janet to scold him.

Because he is going to take away money from those who have worked VERY hard for their earnings and give it to those he sees as needy. (Blacks and the VERY poor.) The entire ideal of Capitalism is to WORK HARD, because you CAN make as money as you want by opening a business that people want a part of and/or need to consume. Small business simply cannot pay for health care for ALL Americans, never mind preexisting medical conditions! A man with AIDS, who has smoked for 30 years and visited developing nations that have diseases we never worry about will legally be entitled to health care.) When you have wealthy paying the for the less wealthy (Obama, at BEST, will let families like mine who make over 200k a year, keep 4 out of every 10 dollars that they earn) the incentive to work really hard goes away. Why not be lazy and get the same salary? Let the government mandated doctors and clinics roll in. But what happens when EVERY rich American says "no"? Who will pay for it then?



EDIT: IF YOU BELIEVE IN SOCIALIST VALUES MOVE TO EUROPE AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. TAKE OBAMA WITH YOU.

To right wing nut cases it is, but Socialism has a long and honourable history, especially in Europe.



In the UK one of the great socialist inventions, the National Health Service, is today recognised as something which makes the UK a better place to live in, and even right of centre parties have pledged to defend it.



Maybe Americans should be less hostile to it, it might just make their country greater too.



How will Obama do it? Well universal health care for all Americans free at the point of delivery would be a 'socialist' policy, but will bring the U.S. into line with all the major industrialised nations where this type of 'socialism' is pretty bog standard.

I have no Idea what his personal plan is.
The reason it's bad is clear. Look at all the European nations that tried that and it failed... after raising taxes to an INSANE amount.
Sales tax in Holland is 18%
Income tax about 48% &lt;&lt; no SS program included
and if you saw a dutch hospital you'd back away. I had to rent a wheelchair to use IN the hospital and it had NO leg rest. My DUTCH husbands leg was BROKEN!  They had NO hospital gowns. NONE.
But the staff was great and served me coffee.



When I went for my mammogram  NO GOWNS AVAILABLE. Because they cost too much! Yes the GLORIES of socialized medicine.



Some fool can get a boob job or a sex change.... but you can't get a wheelchair or a hospital gown



and the socialized medicine here is held up as such a MODEL !!! LOL
god help you!

Mr. Obama is not a socialist.  America has a Socialist Party and I watched their leader in an interview.  He said that Obama is a capitalist who wants to protect the rights of middle-class/ working families to gain more economic benefit from their work and savings.  Our present system protects preserving and increasing the wealth of those already rich, and Obama plans to devise a system where increasing wealth is more accessible to more Americans, removing the net of poverty that many of us live under.

Had I said,

Both. If it's something here on YA, then forward it to the YA people. They will have their ISPs & be able to track them down to wherever they are in the US & report them to the proper authorities.



Seriously, those people need to get lives rather than talking about taking one. Change is now & they need to get over themselves.

US election - why such huge queues? Why not more voting locations?



Hey US people, why were there such humongous queues of people waiting to vote? I've voted at every UK election (local and national) for 34 years, and every occasion has been the same: I walk in, I get given my voting slip, I go to the voting booth and make my choice, put my ballot paper in the box, and go home. Total time taken? Never more than 2 minutes. And I was peripherally involved with an Australian election once - same story.



So why were there these huge lines of people waiting to vote in the US? Is there some valid reason that there aren't more polling stations to cope with the obvious demand?



I'm just curious - it seems strange when the US is a place where the needs of the customers (i.e. the voters in this case) are always paramount

there where a bunch of first time voters who heard of voting from MTV and thought it would be neato to go vote without understanding anything about anything. The average Obama voter prolly didint know hot to vote seeing as how they have never voted before and there wasn't a LARGE CROWD in the voting booth that they could mindlessly follow. so they got confused and had to figure out something for themselves resulting in the whole process geting backed up =)

Where I live here in the US, the voting is smooth and quick as well, even this year. But I do live between 2 voting locations that are only about 2 blocks apart (somewhat ironically, both are churches).



Firstly, the people who operate the voting locations are all volunteer (usually senior citizens, since most people have to work election day if they aren't retired), so you can only have as many locations as you can staff. (We really need to change the election day to be either a weekend or a national holiday.)



But there was also the issue that the voter turnout this time far exceeded past elections, even with a large number of people taking advantage of loosened rules on voting early. We are the laughingstock of most democracies for our ridiculously low voter turnout at around 50%, but this time, it looks like it spiked up about another 10% over the 2004 Presidential election.

How can we let Obama know how many people are out to assassinate him?



I am a strong Obama supporter, and I live in MS. We are a red state and needless to say all of the ppl who voted for McCain are pissed. They are all saying the same thing.... That obama will be assassinated. I would hate to see that happen.



My favorite president in the entire world was killed by assassination. I don't want to see obama end up like John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I couldn't bear it.



How can we let him and his administration know that he is under a serious threat by opposing party members?
I think they are serious threats, not just mad ppl talking ****. I think these ppl might really try and kill obama.

I really wouldn't worry.
The CIA or some other intelligence agency similar to the UK's M15 will be monitoring phone calls, forums, chat rooms, e-mails, if there was a plot to assasinate him and more than one person was involved, or they told people about it - they'd know straight away and stop it !

Really hun, as a VERY conservative voter, don't be worried about us assassinating Obama. We, unlikes liberals, actually respect who is sworn in and would hate to give libs a platform to fight gun ownership on. It would make us as gun owners look terrible, and give Biden extra-incentive to try to smack us down. We are really the peaceful party. Who would be rioting if their candidate had not won"?

There is a good chance that there will be attempted assassinations concerning Obama.
But the US are taking SERIOUS precautions. The victory parade tonight being surrounded by bullet-proof glass for example.
So I wouldn't worry. The US Government know that there are many people out there wanting to assassinate Obama. This just means that they're trying even harder to not have a repeated JFK incident.
I'm sure Obama knows this as well, I don't think he needs to be told that there are people out there wanting to assassinate him.



Hope this helps. :)

We all have different views on this one but he is investing money in Scotland and creating jobs, no word about the beautifull scenery that will be destroyed in the process, have to agree that it would be better spent on a decent rug this would be far more pleasing on the eye than a golf course. I do think that if he wants to invest his money in this country then he could do a lot better things with it that would benefit a lot more people than golfers.

if you guys have been watching the news which you probally have not there has already been two attempt murders or obama by these two white antisemitic Nazi about a week ago. They were both arrested.
One of the main reason Obama was elected was to eliminate racism but because of stupid people like some of the people who answered these questions its made the racisms situation worse. Yes people will try and kill him cause he is black cause people are just that racist, but the government have made their secret services a lot tighter and he will have extra security every where he goes unlike JFK. so dont get your hopes up cause its not worth it, Obama will be a great president.

Perhaps we are more disillusioned, maybe we realise that no matter who we seem to put at no.10, they change their mind and do what they want.
Britain needs a good strong leader, who is not afraid to speak out and make changes, and one that we feel that we can trust.
Maybe we should interview them more, put them on show more, make them work harder to convince us that they can do the job....
Or perhaps its just apathy,  we just accept everything we are told via the television and newspapers.  Later on when things go bad we complain.



To answer your question, the reason why we don't get excited is because we are British we seem to expect very little and that is exactly what we get....very little from the government.
I thank you.

I think the American system allows for a lot more public involvement.  In America, the public are involved in chosing the candidates for each party and then make a decision about which of the candidates is best for the country.  It also helps that there is a clear timetable for the elections, and both parties start campaigning months before the election.



We elect a party and not a leader an we don't know when the next election is going to be so we can't anticipate it.

Think she means whites but she might have meant Republicans and yea it's obvious with the huge African American turn-out, they were voting for him purely because of his colour.
Let's face it nobody can be worse for the world than 'Mad Dog Bush' was, I just hope Barrack Obama is a good, strong, honourable man, o and a non-racist, only time will tell.
Good luck with your new president, I'm just glad it's finally all over.

I didn't see LK but I understand what you mean, see my earlier question, I think Obama is the right choice but why do they have to go on about him being black? Hes the man for the job regardless of colour.
And yes 90% of people in America being interviewed are black, and they make it quite clear that hes their man because he is black.  That is reverse racism isn't it?

Why do some people say Obama is a socialist and is going to turn America into a Socialist country?



I'm not American nor do i live in America so i was just wondering how this little smear campaign started and maybe, if any of you who answer actually believe this, how he is going to do it? i really want to know because it may be the biggest load i have heard since they started saying he is a Muslim and wasn't born in the U.S. "OMG He is going to destroy the world! " (yes i am being sarcastic there)



</question>



<additional details>



See i thought it might be his health care plans but if conservatives weren't so blinded by the fear or the 'reds' then they would see that America is one of the only developed nations that doesn't have a public health care scheme. Me have medicare here in Australia and people aren't shouting 'comrade' on  the streets just yet! XD



I totally agree 'its that guy'. Also the negative connotation that goes along with socialism is a little unwarranted. Sure Socialist governments have done bad things but so have "democratic" governments.Socialism works better in some countries than others, just the same as democracies work better in some than others. Its sad that politicians have created such a fear of ideologies that aren't their own. I'm not saying I support socialism, far from it, but i don't seen why it has to be used as an offensive term.

There's a rule for Republicans.  If you dislike someone, or you disagree with him, then it's okay to call him any bad word you can think of.  It doesn't matter if it's true or not.  You can even make up lies about him and repeat them over and over, long after they've been discredited.



For years and years, Republicans used the word 'liberal' to mean anything they didnt like.  So Hitler was a liberal, Stalin and Mao and Pol Pot were liberals.  And Bill Clinton was a liberal, so the suggestion was that he was no better than the others.  Newt Gingrich, when he was Speaker of the House, said Bill Clinton was the most liberal president in the history of the US.  You would expect better from a guy with a PhD in American History!  All he really meant was only that he didn't like Clinton.



Well after that the word 'liberal' was sort of worn out.  It came to mean nothing at all. So now they use the word 'socialist'.  Anyone who would call Obama a socialist is showing that either they know nothing about Obama or that the don't really know what -socialism- is.  It's just a bad word, and they don't like him, so he must be one.

Americans are much more averse to paying taxes than most other nations.



The fact that the U.S. Army with all its hardware is paid for out of taxation seems alien too them, they would sooner spend their free time reducing their tax bill (and paying specialised lawyers to help them) than actually enjoying their life.



So when something like universal heath care is proposed the people who have a comfortable life start taring it with words like socialism, because they will have to pay some more tax to fund it.



What they do not realise is that they will save on the sky high medical insurance rates they have to pay now, which incidentally does not fund their care 'indefinitely' but only for a certain period.



A 'socialist' heath care programme funds treatment as long as you require it.



They also don't realise that socialism is a democratic choice, people can and do vote for socialism democratically, and they also vote it out. There is a vast difference between democratic socialism and one party state communism, but many right wing Americans are blinkered in their hatred for anything other than their own views.

Isn't Hamilton of mixed race?  I doubt that his winning Formula One is going to change the world!  Obama, though, is another matter, and I'm absolutely thrilled that he won!  I think this is an important day in many, many ways, and may help lead the Western world towards a time when Black people are not considered in any way different (and whites, in the view of blacks of course), and we can start to really believe in equality.

I remember when everyone was talking about change in Africa, in those days they called it the wind of change is blowing through Africa, the result of that change is a festering sore of problems with everyone fighting each other, starvation, refugees on every border, violence every where you look, just look at just one country in Africa Zimbabwe, you have a dictator Mugabe who have ruined the country murdered a lot of the people roaring inflation and most of the people starving. Every time you pick the news paper up or look at the TV another war or famine there, this week its the Congo every one there are killing each other with refugees every where you look. Change isn't always for the better, so watch I think America and the world is in for a very bumpy ride.

Today is election day. Your opinions.?



Today is election day! Who do you think will be the next president? This is my own opinion so don’t let this be offensive. I think that Obama is the best to be the president. Obama had lots of experience. McCain says that he’s better than Obama but he never says the reason. It’s not like he NEVER says any reason but you know. His reason isn’t reasonable. He’s in the 70’s. Do you think he’ll last for 4 years? Also, for the people out there who think Obama is Muslim, he’s not! That’s a big fat rumor. So, what do you think? Who do you think will win? http://isbarackobamamuslim.com/

Well mccain says exactly what he will do every time he speaks, so there you are wrong, and actually obama is the one hemming and hawwing everytime it comes time to say what he is going to do.



OBAMA DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE!  He is the candidate with the LEAST experience!  Even his campaign knows this!



All of the people I hear that go for obama have a very weak understanding of economics and politics.  At least hillary supporters knew what they were talking about.

My (hypothetical since I'm English...) vote is for Obama.



I think he's the best person for it.



It is a rumour that he's a Muslim... but would it matter? No.



He's what America (and the world) need right now.



Obviously with either new leader it'll be all change, but I think with Obama it will be more change and in the right direction!



I hope it is Obama so much. Espescially because I hope to study in the US in the next few years so I think this will affect me personally in the future.
Also, if McCain got in an didn't make it... Sarah Palin as President makes me want to not just avoid the US, but hopefully immigrate off this planet...

I agree racism is always around but Obama is 50% black and 50% white.  Why would his winning the presidency is considered due to racism?



From what I heard, we have around 13% black citizen of total different races in America.  I am Asian and I voted Obama.  So is this racism?  I know people around me as Mexicans, Caucasians, Asians and African-Americans voted him too.  We simply chose the best candidate to be our president.

Ethnocentrism has sociobiological origins and therefore, sadly, will always we with us. However this backward part of our nature has taken a royal trashing with the election of Barack Obama. It is possible that the election of the first african-american will be a watershed in the general publics conscious, at least partially eclipsing raciest tendencies.



Regarding money. I would certainly say that money helped Obama a lot. But I would not say it was 'money-power as usual'. After all, the money Obama spent was not from usual sources. It was from small individual contributions online. He opted out of a broken system. McCain was meant to be constrained by the 83 million dollars in public financing. Was he? No, he spent over 250 million. That is why the system is broken. Obama choose the ethical decision to opt out of the system and this gave him an advantage. 'Ethical' therefore not 'power-as-usual', a phrase synonymous with corruption.

I say good riddance to him he was a man who never thought before he spoke who was a moron and a bully.lets hope he goes back to his farm or wherever it is he must and has a long time to reflect on the misery he caused to men women and children around the world.
He would not be seen congratulating Mr Obama because like John Mcain and his supporters he is a racist and Bible bashing bigot (note I did not say a Christian because I do not believe he is nor do I believe those who support middle class white American gun toting people are they are gutted that a Black American man is at the helm I pray for Mr Obama that he will bring peace to a country who has put it's trust in him.

We all need to stop talking things like this so seriously or nobody will ever be able to tell jokes again.
I'm sure you've told jokes that will offend somebody, if you stop everything that could offend someone you wipe out 99% of humour and comedy programes.



And with that, Faulty Towers, Monty Python, just about every stand up comedian that's every lived, etc, etc.

Have you had your OUTFIT store card letter yet?



Regarding your personal credit report. You have a 30 day free trial with PrivacyGuard which you may cancel but if at the end of that time you don't call them £69.99 annual fee will be added to your store card! What the hell is going on? Back door insurance - i had to read this letter twice - then i phoned G E Money, the company we send the normal payment to and cancelled my card. This is outrageous! Our credit details etc are supposed to be protected by them to start with! How many more do you think will get on that bandwagon?

Why were rural voters more likely to vote Republican?



Example: Check-out Ohio, who voted for Obama yesterday. The states rural areas (which make up the majority of Ohio's area) all voted for McCain. It was a sea of red. Only the cities voted for Obama. Why? This is a trend in all states, but especially the battleground states. Are the rural voters minds different? If so, in what way? What made living in a city change people to identify with more Obama? Why are cities blue and rural areas red?

In less cosmopolitan areas, people tend to be more socially conservative and less progressive; they prefer an older president, they value military experience above higher education.



The cultural issues that concern them are Republican wedge issues, such as abortion and gun rights. They also tend to be slightly more territorial and concerned with maintaining their property and culture against other influences and/or government intervention.



In cities, the population tends to be more ethnically diverse, secular, educated and progressive.

It is about their economic structure.



In rural area, most likely they are relating to raw material or food products. There is little about credit markets. In their mind, the most important jobs is to get rich people to buy their products. It is their desire to drive the economy in cities again.



Of course, this would be similar to the depression period in 1920s.



If Obama can make use that force, change would be possible. For example, Obama government should create projects in infrastructure area such as rebuild bridges, electric grib, fibre optic covering the whole U.S. In fact, a lot of facilities in U.S. are totally outdated. By doing so, he can create jobs and properly consume those exceeding raw material inventry.



He can do so by create loans to all companies at that area and they need to return part of their gain to government.

If you take a look at the bible belt it was a  wash with Red during the election voting summary's on the networks.
They support many right wing views that are shoved down our throats by the republicans, such as supporting the war, anti gay, right to life anti abortionists, right to arms to name a few.
In city's you are more likely to adopt different views due to living in closer vicinities to diverse cultures from a wider range of migrants and visitors from various country's, and more than likely discover that they aren't that different than you or me.

Now that America has elected its version of Tony Blair? ?



Whats the first catastrophe the Yanks can expect?
Obama, like Bliar, was elected on the stance, "i am all things to all people", a policy which has failed spectacularly in the UK, isn't it inevitable that Good Ole Obama will have to disappoint at least some of the electorate?



</question>



<additional details>



Marissa, i just hope that he can fulfill all his promises, Tony Blair was elected pretty much with the same euphoria, but by the end of office, was despised by many - especially the English, who felt betrayed by him, Blair had chosen to satisfy one group (Scots) over another (English) perhaps Obama will face the same dilemma? The wants of the majority, or the wants of the minority?

Honestly I can see very little semblance between Blair and Obama. Presidential (or priministerial, in the case of the UK) generally try to be all things to all people in their campaigns. In order to win in the US (or in most countries), one needs to appeal to many different people.



Yes Obama may well disappoint some of the electorate. Given his relatively big win from non-traditional democrats, that is not unlikely. It seems some "Republican voters" are giving him a chance, because of the desperate times. At the same time, if he pulls of a good economic recovery (and face it, the US as at a low base right now) then Obama may end up being remembered as one of the most popular presidents in recent times.

Obama was elected on the basis of racist votes of blacks as well as the blinkered young voters who are easily taken in by the relative youth and trendiness.
It was almost an identical situation with Blair,boosted by the votes of millions of muslims that stood to gain everything us taxpayers can give them.



No one..and I mean no one  voted Obama in on policy or experience,simply because he has neither.Just pretentious rhetoric.
The US electorate will come to regret the folly of being lured by such romantic imagery.Its a big job.Though Obama will surrounded by advisors,he lacks the vision necessary for direction.The plans that he does have are those of socialist agenda,thus completely at odds with the American values that made the country a flagship democracy and a superpower in the first place.
To quote Enoch Powell,"it's like watching a nation busily engaged in building up its own funeral pyre".



Short term gains enjoyed by ethnic minorities,criminals and the jobless will be at the expense of the bigger contributors and thus squeezing the breath from motivational spirit that may have helped the US recover from recession.
In other words ,Obamas govment will mirror Blairs exactly,bleeding the country dry to buy the support of the electorate and long term the country can go to hell on a handcart.

Your question is absurd.



It's a myth spread by the ignorant that Blair was elected on a wave of euphoria.



Actually he was elected on an average percentage of a low turnout the first time round and had gained the nickname 'Tony Blur' before even winning in 1997.



He managed to gain sky-high approval ratings soon after election by making friends with tabloid editors (and Rupert Murdoch). If anything it shows the idiocy of the British public that they were so influenced by the propaganda spread by the likes of The Sun in Blair's first year.



Obama is a much more intelligent and substantial politician.

Woopee doo, America has finaly caught up with the rest of the world. They have elected a black president and don't we know it. All through his campaign he has targeted the black vote and yes they have come out in their millions to support him and elect a black president. What is wrong with that statement..........precisely, this man has been elected because of his colour NOT because of his policies. The rest of the world couldnt give a toss if he is black, white, female, gay or handicaped its his policies that count and he has no policies. Whilst im no polititian i trust in those that know their stuff and a good sign of what the world thought of Obama's policies was the fact that the world stock markets plummited and the dollar dropped sharply when it was announced he had won.
Tony Blair was elected because the women in the UK thought he was young and sexy..........god did we suffer for that. As soon as Obama gets off his high horse and stops telling the world change has come to America cos its now got a black leader and actually gets on with sorting out the mess America is in, the sooner we will see what he is really made of.

Have you heard of Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Big Pappy, they all make millions . SO whats your point. If you have a person who can fill in the spot because he brings it to the table day in and day out then hell yes he can fill in that spot. African Americans and sports led to Obama being president. They say Obama has a nice Jump shot. Sports and Obama led to the first Black/ or even better Minority president of the United States. This is a proven fact.

It's a pretty big deal here.  Most people voted for Obama because of who he is, not the color of his skin.  But you have to remember that just 40 years ago discrimination against black people was common, even legally required, in some states.  For many of us, to go from such overt racism to electing a black man as president in the space of our lifetime is a big deal.

Sorry, I don't know.  But I just saw them in Seattle, WA USA last month.  If you don't care for their new album, like me, then don't go to the show.  They did play my favorites of theirs, but the show really lacked the funk their old albums had.  Really boring in my opinion.

Does it still get to you to see?



Our athletes winning medals at the Olympics in Beijing?
I know a lot of people are uncomfortable with China hosting it for their human rights record. I understand that, totally. But, we as a country didn`t choose who would hold this Olympics.
But, i still feel such a sense of pride, to see the Union Jack hoisted and how well we are doing in the medals table.This morning, we were No. 3 in the league table, despite being one of the smaller countries.
All views welcome, good or bad. :)



</question>



<additional details>



Shambo - I`m not really watching it. But just making the point, that i feel pride in our competitors doing well. Forget the politics, i am just patriotic.



Steph - Yes, we are doing fantastically well as a country and that gives me a sense of pride.



Haz - Indoor rowing is ok. But at least with outdoor, you get some scenery and company. :)

I absolutely do!  If I thought not enjoying it would change China's record on human rights, I'd try not to.  But I believe that the more exposure China has to the rest of the world, the sooner they will open up their eyes to the problems created by suppression of a particular group.  I believe they have also given themselves a couple of black eyes, what with the pretended ages of their gymnastic team and the sad story of the girl singer.  The government at least will be aware that they haven't fooled anyone and they made themselves look stupid.  Maybe next time they'll think before trying to lie to everyone.

Yes it does, and to be fair I feel proud of other competitors too, when Shelly-Ann Fraser won the 100metres I felt the same for her and Jamaica. Walking home this afternoon I noticed some lads, who I know to be a bit loud and thuggish at times, outside the bar quite subdued with pride, chatting about GB's achievements, they were actually in good humour, I've never seen them less threatening, it appears to have an effect on them too.

There isn't a lot to be proud of in our country right now so, like you Joanne, I feel a great sense of pride for our hard working athletes.  To be third in the medals list is amazing and we should give all the athletes a warm welcome home when they get back.  The location of the Olympics and the politics of the Chinese government really shouldn't be allowed to tarnish what really is an incredible achievement.

Give him lots of money I say and then when he has say £800,000 tucked away under his prison mattress give him brouchures of all the high life but him in the cell can never go out to buy and enjoy them.

When he kicks the bucket we will use the money to have a good national party and dance on his grave.

OR charge him council tax, rent, food, electric, gas like the rest of us then he being owing us money.

He has no right to complain about anything, never mind the trivial crap he has come out with. He seems to have forgotten why he is there in the first place. And as for his comments on the safety of people walking the streets, what the hell does he know of the outside world? The streets may not be all that safe, but they have been that little bit safer in all these years he's been banged up and unable to prey on innocent children.

Should Barry George be made a knight?



Considering that a once great nation of British warriors have now become a nation of nonces, should Barry George be given a Knighthood for beating his rap?
I'm sure that other nonces like Ian Brady and Gary Glitter are pissing in their boots to receive the same press fan fare as "our" Barry received as even today the BBC reduced his rape charges to mere "pestering" and his stalking habits are now considered "following", according to the BBC.
Wonderful!  So with BBC double speak Ian Brady was just "heavy handed" and gary glitter needed his "eyes tested".  So 'cmon Britain let's hear it for BARRY GEORGE FOR PM!!!
Then we can tell the World that the UK is now officially a shithole!
Abu Hamza for Deputy PM anyone?

HIV Cases in U.S. Higher than Thought as new test method can tell how recent infection, esp less than 5 mths??



HIV Cases in U.S. Higher than Thought
By Mike Stobbe

August 3, 2008



http://www.CBNNews.com - ATLANTA - The number of Americans infected by the AIDS virus each year is much higher than the government has been estimating, US health officials reported Sunday, acknowledging that their numbers have understated the level of the epidemic.

The country had roughly 56,300 new HIV infections in 2006 -- a dramatic increase from the 40,000 annual estimate used for the last dozen years. The new figure is due to a better blood test and new statistical methods, and not a worsening of the epidemic, officials said.

But it likely will refocus US attention from the effect of AIDS overseas to what the disease is doing to this country, said public health researchers and officials.

"This is the biggest news for public health and HIV/AIDS that we've had in a while," said Julie Scofield, executive director of the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors.

More Aggressive Testing

Experts in the field, advocates and a former surgeon general called for more aggressive testing and other prevention efforts, noting that spending on preventing HIV has been flat for seven years.

The revised estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the methodology behind it were to be presented Sunday, the opening day of the international AIDS conference in Mexico City.

Since AIDS first surfaced in 1981, health officials have struggled to estimate how many people are infected each year. It can take a decade or more for an infection to cause symptoms and illness.

One expert likened the new estimate to adding a good speedometer to a car. Scientists had a good general idea of where the epidemic was going; this provides a better understanding of how fast it's moving right now.

"This puts a key part of the dashboard in place," said the expert, David Holtgrave of Johns Hopkins University.

Based on the new calculations, officials believe annual HIV infections have been hovering around 55,000 for several years.

"This is the most reliable estimate we've had since the beginning of the epidemic," said Dr. Julie Gerberding, the CDC's director. She said other countries may adopt the agency's methodology.

1.1 Million Americans with AIDS Virus

According to current estimates, around 1.1 million Americans are living with the AIDS virus. Officials plan to update that number with the new calculations, but don't think it will change dramatically, a CDC spokeswoman said.

The new infection estimate is based on a blood test that for the first time can tell how recently an HIV infection occurred.

Past tests could only detect the presence of HIV, so determining which year an infection took place was guesswork -- guesswork upon which the old 40,000 estimate was based.

The new estimate relies on blood tests from 22 states in which health officials have been using a new HIV testing method that can distinguish infections that occurred within the last five months from those that were older.

This is all because when a bullet proof vest stops a bullet, it forces the underwire from the bra into the flesh.

I think it's bizarre.

Are they going to wear bullet proof bras *and* vests.  Won't that be a bit restricting.

They should just consider wearing a non-underwired bra while on duty and think of something else.

Read the article you quoted and you will discover the satellite system is Ukraine's to give, not Russia's.  When Ukraine became an independent nation after the USSR's collapse, Ukraine became a major military power in the global scope. Not only did they become the owner of this satellite system, which Ukraine companies designed and implemented, but they also became the 3rd largest nuclear power in the world. While the nuclear missiles were returned to Russia to be deactivated, all other military systems remained in place.

Ukraine desperately wants from beneath the thumb of Russia, from both their threats and economic influence on their way of life. Ukraine is a viable economic power of eastern Europe providing much of the region's agricultural and raw steel imports.



If this military grade satellite system is an legitimate offer by the Ukraine government, the west would be foolish not to accept it.  Only to accept the offer of satellite access and not provide an umbrella of military protection to Ukraine from a future Russian attack would make us of an lower morality than that of the current Russian regime.

In February 2008, Ukraine was added to Russia's growing list of countries threatened with nuclear retaliation. Russia is the bully in the democratic neighborhood, a supporter of further Cold War type actions.

Western media outlets accuse the American leadership of reinitiating the Cold War but what western government has threatened Russia with nuclear annihilation?

Yes, my son finished his when he was not quite 21.
That's an LLB, Bachelor of Law. You then can study further for a Masters Degree & on you go from there.
So it is quite possible & many do complete degrees when they are 20.
It all depends at what age you finish Secondary School & go to University.
I completed a degree[science] when I was 20, then did further studies later.

Oil companies do pricing by region even here in the usa.  The cost dramatically going up from what we where paying and what lower income families are trying to do to keep up with their bills is why we are complaining.  Also have you noticed how oil is falling yet the gas prices and not falling as fast?

Well you see in America about six years ago it was $1.00 a gallon. Now four a gallon? I mean from 1985- 2002 the price of gas went up 10 to 20 cents. And from 2002- 2008 it went up about $3.00. Thats is ridiculous

America as a nation ( and so are we that live in the UK) is a very wasteful place. For years we have used petrochemicals without previous thought or worry about when it will start to become hard to obtain it. Now that there prices have gone up ( very minimaly) they are starting to feel what we feel everytime we look at the petrol station prices

I think we Americans consume more than other countries. Other countries depend on public transportation, and here more people drive cars and rely less on public transportation, and even if we wanted to public transportation isn't as prominent and accommodating because it isn't in demand. Plus, just a guess, but if your gas is that expensive there, I'd assume that wages are higher as well. If you did a ratio I think it would be pretty similar. And the fact that prices have more than doubled in the last few years, yet our wages haven't, and we can't afford it because our pay sucks and standard of living is so high.

Why do people from the UK and other parts of Europe keep telling us that we should be just like them?  I am in America, and I am tired of paying $3.00 to $4.00 per gallon for gas.  Maybe Europeans are ok with paying inflated prices on gas.  However, in America, we depend upon our automobiles.  When you start jacking up our gas prices, you are screwing with our livelihood.  And that is getting a little too personal.

The US is a newer country and was developed around the automobile. The UK's infrastructure was set in motion long before the auto came into being. Here, we generally have to travel greater distances due to sprawling suburbs and more decentralized development. We've been spoiled with relatively low petrol prices over the years mainly due to our cozy relationship with the monarchs of middle eastern oil producing countries.

I see both sides of the story being American and living in Europe. I think the biggest problem is that America has no where near the same public transportation system as Europe.
I grew up in a small town in the USA and if you didn't have a car then you were out of luck. There was no taxi to call, no bus, no train, no tramway, etc. You had your car and that was that.
Bigger cities are probably not as impacted by the higher fuel costs than rural towns. People from these towns often have to drive to the bigger cities to get to their places of work or to grocery stores, etc.
My father still lives in the small town I grew up in and he says he can't afford to drive any other place except to work and back. If he did drive more than than then he wouldn't be able to afford to have a place to live, food to eat, heat, electricity, so on and so forth. 
Back when fuel prices were cheaper, America was known for having huge gas guzzling cars because they could afford them! More and more now though you are seeing people trade in their cars for smaller and better fuel efficient autos. I saw an article the other day on Yahoo that said the Smart car has a waiting list 10 months long in the USA.
Even more kids are starting to ride their bicycles to school. Long gone are the days of 16 year olds getting their license and very first car, they can't afford it. Instead, they are riding their bikes. 
I can't speak for the UK, because I don't live in that part of Europe but, I do know that where I live rent and grocery shopping is significantly cheaper than America. Also, a lot of apartments (flats) include heating, electricity, and water. My parents have to pay for each one of those things separately.
They heat with oil. My father was almost unsure that they could afford enough oil to last the winter. They were literally faced with the question of whether they should heat or eat? 
In the moment, I am definitely glad that I live in Europe where you can survive quite comfortably on a single income. I hope it gets better for America, I really do.

Because they are comparing the price they pay to countries that produce oil such as Saudi Arabia. They don't think of such things as some of the countries where gas is less than a dollar a gallon the average monthly wage is a 150 dollars. That is if you have a very good job of course most people in reality are on a lot less than that.

Should the Japanese whaling ship be bombed?



The Nisshan Maru, a Japanese whaling ship, is on fire off the coast of Antarctica.  There is estimated to be over 1,000 tons of fuel - as well as other chemicals, which could be highly dangerous to the environment there.



When the Torrey Canyon ran aground off the coast of Britain in the '60,s  the Navy and RAF bombed it before too much damage to the environment could be done.



Should the Japanese ship, which has no crew on board and has serious fires, be bombed before it is too late?

Yes it needs to be treated like the Torrey Canyon and bombed immediately to save the environment. This must be carried out by the government whose waters it is in with the consent of the Japanese otherwise war could break out. This is a dire emergency. Let this be a lesson as to what can happen when any such contentious behaviour (whaling) takes place.

Glad someone appreciates the urgency.  To answer an answer, floating pontoons are put round the ship to stop the spread of oil, then when the ship sinks, the oil is contained and cleaned up.

Yes it should be done immediately.



Also did you know that the Japamese pay the Falkland Islanders millions of £'s each year for Whaling rights in the South Atlantic.



This should be stopped immediately.

They are cruel & barbaric & I say bomb the ship then threaten Tokyo or Hiroshima with a bomb unless they stop their lust for whales & other creatures.

Unfortunately bombing doesn't work as it only burns off a bit of the fuel etc and also causes a lot of air pollution.Best solution(unlikely to happen) would be to tow it out to deeper waters and sink it if the fires couldnt be put out.Possibly the pressure at depth &cold could seal it?

The Japanese seem to be a law unto themselves regarding whaling.  If it is correct that there is no crew on board then by all means bomb the vessel providing it doesn't make the situation worse but lets not use our bombs, let some other country pay for it to be done.

<question>



Would $85 billion help the American people with their higher living costs?



The US government spent $85billion between 2003 and 2007 on contractors for services in support of the Iraq war and reconstruction a report says.



And by the end of 2008, spending is likely to top $100billion a review by the Congressional Budget Office found.



Thats 85,000,000,000 dollars.

Actually you could have given a quarter of the entire US population $1000 each to help them with their higher living costs to get them through the economic problems.



The poorest 25% , 82 million people , could have had $1000 each - to take just a little pressure off them.

Wouldn't that help ?

$85,000,000,000 dollars over 5 years isn't a blip on the screen.

I understand your point is that Iraq was a bad investment but you don't know what the return on that investment is going to be just yet.
According to the irs data in 2007 138,893,908 tax filings were made in 2007so assuming each filer got the same amount back every year for the past five years $145 extra dollars a year. I know every one out their would have used that $750 to fix the world except in Iraq.

Let me tell you something $145 dollars a year to keep Uday and his brother from raping and killing a daughter mother sister or wife was a damn good deal.



And you think $1000 dollars is going to "help" the poorest in the country? How about they work 200 hours of over time they would get more from that. They aren't poor cause the government didn't give them enough. They are poor cause they don't know how to make or keep money.

Muslim separatists who have threatened Beijing do Deadly Attack in China Days B4 Olympics: cover-up reports ??



By Charles Hutzler

August 4



http://CBNNews.com - BEIJING

Attackers rammed a dump truck into a patrol station in China's restive Central Asian border province Monday morning, tossing grenades in a raid that killed 16 officers and wounded others, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.

The attack in Xinjiang province was in an area where local Muslims have waged a sporadic rebellion against Chinese rule.

It came just four days before the start of the Beijing Olympics - an event that at least one radical Muslim group has vowed to attack.

The brief Xinhua account said the attackers drove the dump truck to get inside the paramilitary police compound in the Kashgar area and then exploded two grenades.



A state television report gave a different version, saying the police were attacked while marching in front of a hotel while conducting morning drills.



SO - how reliable are Govt safety 'assurances' ??

Mine are 11 and 7 . The 11 yo refuses to watch because of the treatment of animals.



Have to say we discussed it all way back in chez Haz about whether we should or shouldn't. She makes her own decisions in such matters..!

Youngest and mr Haz and myself are all watching and he is LOVING it. He has many varied problems in learning stuff at school due to hearing/ sound processing difficulties, the side effect of which is he feels stupid next to the other kids, it's heartbreaking.

BUT he is a fantastic swimmer and has been so fired up by all the water sports that he beat his dad ( 6ft) in a two length race at the baths the other day.



I won't go over the reasons WHY we are watching ..I've said my piece through Shambo's questions, but I think they are a separate thing and I would wait till after the games. Let he get fired up and enjoy the fantastic role models..

Yeah my 3 week old loves watching it in the middle of the night with his dad - I think he's particularly fond of the swimming and gymnastics, I'm waiting until he's a bit older before having political discussions with him about human rights.

he also enjoys watching his dad play mario kart on the wii in the middle of the night, I don't think he's fussy to be honest.

My 8 year old loves it. he wants to be a olympian now, he is just not sure in what yet! 
He is aware of some of the things going on but he also knows where the olympics came from and at the time when the games started in greece then no war or fighting would commence. So he understands it to be an event which should unite different nations from all over the world.

I don't have a child so I won't know.

Just a few points about Western's obsession of criticizing human rights in China:

The only reason Westerners keep harping on human rights in China is because it’s the only thing they can still latch onto to make themselves feel superior and smug about their triumph over China.

Westerners see the writing on the wall. Compared to Asia, they’re losing the race in terms of:

- economic growth
- educational quality
- technological innovation
- environmental investment (China invests way more than the U.S. does toward sustainable energy research)
- and hipness (Asia has stopped looking to the U.S. for the next cool trend. Now Asians are increasingly seeing South Korea as the top trendsetter, whether in terms of TV, film, fashion or music.)

China is just a convenient proxy for rising Asian dominance.

If Americans really cared about human rights abroad, they would have started making noise about China 30 years ago. And they’d be making noise about just about most countries in South America, Africa and the Middle East.

But none of those countries are an economic or military rival to the U.S./Europe, are they?

I don't know HOW and WHAT do 2 of those people thumbing up "Proper Shambos" PROPAGANDA post for?

There's enough Western media to demolish the Western mainstream media propaganda to LIE about Tianamen Square Massacre:

........Beijing residents and most of the students had filtered away. The tent city was largely empty.



I don't remember seeing the students leave the monument, although they did -- filing off to the south as a result of an agreement with the PLA commanders

It was later said by some that they bulldozed through sleeping students, but I don't believe it. No one could still have been asleep in those tents after that night.............

and FINALLY:

http://archives.cjr.org/year/98/5/tianan... BY JAY MATHEWS

"as far as can be determined from the available evidence, no one died that night in Tiananmen Square.

“Journalists have to be precise about where it happened and who were its victims, or readers and viewers will never be able to understand what it meant.”



FINALLY WORDS: It is the Western media who has propagandized Tiananmen Square Massacre and it's all the media who has brainwashed every Western citizen but wanting you to believe their words.

The child needs the truth and since Western parents is feeding their child what the Western media constant violations of "pack journalism;" it is unethical.

I am of the opinion that cigarettes are a privilege - he gave up any privileges when he murdered defenceless children with his sicko girlfriend.

He should be shut in a cold damp dungeon and left to rot with stale bread and one glass of water a day.

Tell you what, ask the families of those poor children who had their life taken away (after being tortured).  They never even got to the age where cigarettes could become an addiction!

In my opinion, whatever way it is looked at, human rights are waivered once you take another life.

He declared himself Non-Human at the point where he carried out the despicable murders.

Don't forget he still refuses to give info on where the bodies are buried, thus maintaining the terrible unknown with the Parents.

He is not Human, why is he even being given £25-00.

Lord Longford spent a lot of misplaced time and interest (at his own detriment). The Public continually stated they wanted Brady and Hindley to rot.

I see where you're coming from Stormy, but he doesn't need to smoke, it's a luxury. I don't feel that he deserves the right to smoke, he's a child killer who still won't reveal to a heartbroken mother where her son's remains are buried. He cares little about anyone else but he expects people to feel sorry for him?

Stormy,

You can possibly be the one to bring me up to date on this. Back in approx '92 we had to go to Ashworth to fill in dla claims for ALL the inmates including him. Me being naturally lucky got Owen ward which he was on then.

Are psychi patients still allowed this? I cant see how the lower rate dla mob wouldn't cover his fags.

And as truly abhorrent as it is..yes his 'human rights' must be honoured as much as any-ones. To apply that to a child murderer leaves a very nasty taste though.

The torture of Kevin Davies...?



http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk...
Kevin was tied up in a shed and tortured for over four months until his body eventually gave up and he died in  2006.



During his imprisonment he was beaten several times a day, branded with a hot knife and burnt with some kind of corrosive liquid.  He was found with 10% burns, bruises and fractures all over his body including his ribs and larynx.
At the autopsy they discovered that the only thing he had eaten in 3 days were potato and carrot peelings.



3 people were originally charged with his murder but Kevin was an epileptic, and as they couldn't determine whether the epilepsy played a part in his death the charges were dropped.  They were locked up on various charges for 10 years each but will only serve half that and are due for release in 2011.

His family are desperately trying to overturn this ruling and have started a petition online.

I was horrified to read his story in in my friends copy of Take a break magazine this morning and felt that I had to do something about it.

Please sign the petition...

I remember reading about this case at the time, and it sickened me. There really is no limit to human depravity. These people would have felt right at home in Nazi Germany, or in Cambodia during Pol Pot's reign of terror.

This man's only "crime" was to accidentally damage a car belonging to his killers. For that, they held him captive for four months and tortured him to death.

I have framed my eldest's first painting (he's 23 now and a web designer) and if you look at it kinda sideways it almost looks like a man in a spacesuit !, but maybe that's the mum in me wanting to see a thing of beauty in a truly chaotic work of art. I loved it at the time (he was 1 yr old) and would have walked down the road telling everyone I met 'look - isn't this just fantastic !!!'

I've seen all the talk between US and UK, US offering Georgia humanitarian aid, Russia threatening to nuke Poland...but what does it all mean to the UK? I'm confused because I don't understand it all, and I'm worried as a result..'nuke' isn't friendly to me...please help.

Storm in a tea cup, stirred by the media.. not even headline news today. Russia did NOT threaten to Nuke Poland, a general said if Poland had a missile defence system on it soil, it would be the first target in any conflict.. harsh but true. The media reported it out of context and "sexed" it up to make headlines. 
Most European leaders know that Georgia bit off more than it could chew and got a dressing down from Russia. End of.

I really don't think there's any thing to worry about. But, if Russia attacked any Nato member we would be obliged to defend them. If that came to a nuclear exchange..... Whoops!

Some British company controls an oil pipe in the north of Georgia.  They have had to temporary close it down.  So I'm sure that will mean something to the UK.

Russia has been threatening violence towards Ukraine,Georgia and Poland.All NATO countries are bound in treaty to protect each other,Poland is in NATO.So the threats of Russian hotheads could escalate to a global conflict.The financial and energy systems would collapse and the countless people could lose their lives.The UK has to voice support for Georgia,because the greater the opposition to Russian aggression,the more Russia will realise that they will be taking on a lot more than they first thought.They might back down with so many opposing them.If everyone keeps quiet,then they will be emboldened to invade small countries and take permanent control

Is freedom of speech dead on y answers?.



iposted a legitimate question on why can we believe in religion and the question was removed , it raised valid issues but it seems youcan question any thing except religion., is this the achilles heel of this site and is it of any use if valid questions are to be censored. p.s. i do respect every bodys right to follow any religion they wish to.



</question>



<additional details>



in retrospect i think we should all post questions on subjects we all agree on (if thats possible) and then all go and play with the bunny wunnies in the land of green ginger so we dont upset religious believers when they suddenly realise that all religions might be a sham and believing in themselves or something more tangible might be risky!

It does seem that a lot of religion based questions get removed, but then I guess they have their terms and conditions to follow as well as a team of Lawyers who helped set them up! I have also seen a lot of ok looking sex based questions removed too, whereas others which are very explicit are left on, so there's no saying what they'll remove. People are very scared at present of causing offence and inflaming unstable people, and I expect Yahoo don't want to get dragged into a row. I do agree though that it's a shame in a way, although you can argue forever about religion and never get anywhere.
Personally, although I was brought up as a Catholic, I view religion as the cause of most trouble in the world. I prefer now to be 'spiritual not religious'. I don't follow rules made up by other humans, I just try to do the right thing (I have to say too that I don't know any religious people who are actually nice).

Yes it is dead as far as Yahoo is concerned under the leadership of Jerry Yang.

I don't think the freedom of speech is dead on here. If you saw the amount of absolute garbage idiots and trolls put on here, then you would agree I think. However, the right to make a valid point, question, etc can not only be garbaged by the dimlows that can veto what you say, they give power to trolls to do it too! It's no wonder people ask 'Shall I eat another cake? or, 'I have found a spider, what should I call him?' as they are the only things that you'll get an answer for!
They should change the name.

The irony is that restrictions on the site are imposed just as much by bigots with closed minds who report you at the drop of a hat as by the actual people who run the site.

I think it is a nice little earner.  It can have some use as a safety tool but most of the time it is nothing but another way to earn money.  They don't have to do much except watch the video and send out the tickets.  I guess that saves some of the gas budget.

i have no sympathy for drivers. everybody in the country knows the speed limited if you get fined its your own fault nobody to blame but your own self. slow down if you don't want to line the governments pockets. the government is getting rich off idiots who speed then cry about it when they get a fine. the solution is simple drive slower or if you want to speed pay the fine and don't whinge

I am in the same boat. Life is what happens when we are planning for something else.

The best thing to do is sit down, write what you like about your life, what you don't like and what you want to change.

Then put the list somewhere prominent and start working through it.

And never compare yourself to other people. For all you know they are doing the same and envying how great your life is.

yes, your question is a litle weird, you start out by sounding so desperate and then when I read the details it seems like you are desperate to become a somebody.......did I read that right? in which case, my anser is...you already are somebody. how does the saying go, be your perfect self rather than a second best somebody else...something like that anyhow. By looking at other people and comparing them to yourself, you are skipping over the best bits about you and your life.

The mechanism is of a very simple nature,so it takes only one trial to learn.I know guys who know how to do it.
I think it's the whole "it's-a-woman's-thing" that intimidates them and brings to mind thoughts of complexity of women's ways,habits,etc.
And BTW,most of the misunderstandings between the two sexes-I don't think they have to do with actual great differences.It's all simpler than most people think.Like unhooking a bra.

Should Irish and British and other countries journalist just stop trying to ask questions of aides



Of the two election candidates, what have we truly learned from all these interviews. Iran, Iraq. troop withdrawals and of course rap songs. Over the last few weeks I have heard one ask about such things as. On bridge collapses have mr .... any plan to do about the road infrastructure arising from that bridge collapse. answer given by aide. The negative campaign is going to hurt. 
Here is a list of questions asked by Irish radio hosts over the last few months, our radio hosts seem to be asking the questions not the US media.
What are your plans for the roads infrastructure? 
Has your canidate any plans about tackling the floods that have affected areas of the US?
Would you be pressing for better fire services after the wild fires that have been happening more often?
Has one US host asked anything like these questions? 
They call us socialist Europe, Seems socialist Europe is asking real questions, Is that why the Republican's call us Socialists they hear these questions and don't like outsiders asking questions they should be asking?

I hate them, that's what, and in days of old they would have been hung for treason. We are tolerant in UK, but its gone far enough, these people call themselves British that's one thing they are not. If they had any allegiance its to the land of their fathers.



so people believe its all M16 fault, no it isn't.  a recent poll taken by Yougov in many of our top universities had many young Muslims openly declare that its OK to kill in the name of your religion, so that applies to people in the UK. Does this make me feel bad, of course it does. Not all are like that, but honestly anyone can see that many are being radicalised, many do hate the west and i live in an area not far removed from the central London bombings, and i would never believe that it was our own services that planted those devices that killed and injured so many.

I did my A levels in 1989.

I recently took a look at the A level math papers from then, now and somewhere in the middle and tried to do them.

The older papers were definitely harder. The current ones appeared to lead much more. There wasn't really a need to string together more than one solution to get to the end of a problem, because it led you every step of the way.

So in my unscientific study, yes, A levels are getting easy these days.

---

For the unintiated, A levels are "Advanced Level" exams that British schoolchildred take prior to entering college. It generally serves as the exams you have to pass to get a place in college.

Typically (back in the day) you did three. The course took 2 years between ages 16 and 18. Taking 4 was for the swatty spods.

These days this is still true but there are a bunch more options, AS levels and other things.  People seem to be able to take more of them. There is controversy as to whether they have become easier over the years.

I really don`t know. All i know is that the standard of english has certainly deteriorated. Obviously, there are still younger people who can spell and write well. But, it seems to be the minority. I haven`t sat an exam for years, so it is hard for me to judge. :)

What I've noticed is that teaching gets tinkered with, year in, year out. This is supposedly to improve the teaching.
But instead of saying that it's apparent these changes work when scholars pass more exams, people say that it's because the exams are simpler.

Frankly, it sounds like utter bollocks to me.



If someone can tell me, with a reasonable explanation, what real interest an examination authority would have in simplifying exams, I'd love to know.

I don't believe A levels are getting easier. I believe most teachers are more competent than those who like to knock them would want us to believe.

Of course we work hard, but I suspect they probably are "easier" these days, however, the people sniffing at it didn't have to do coursework. People think that the coursework makes it an easy option, I disagree, it means you are tested the whole way through.

2 of the 4 I'm taking are no coursework though.

If you lot could leave school with the ability to do maths without a calculator and the ability to read and write well, then I wiuld agree that standards are increasing.

However, given that neither of the above is true and the fact that the curriculum board are bringing in a new level (A Star), then I have to believe that the passes are given away.

In fact, the A Star is being introduced so that future employers will be able to determine who really is an "A" student amongst all the dross who are getting it out of a lucky bag.

I feel that as a nation we are becoming more intelligently inclined.

Whether this is down to brain power or computer power, I am not sure.

When I went to school, if you took a calculator with you, it got confiscated. Now you can get detention for not taking one (or so I understand from a 12 year old)

The more we learn about the world we live in, the more we have to teach our youngsters, so maybe more computer power adds to more brain power. The way we learn, in my opinion has not changed over the years, we just do it from different angles.

I currently study quantum mechanics, and without computers I would need to live to be 200 to understand it. However, without computers, the subject would not exist.

I say let teachers teach, pupils learn, and politicians keep their noses out.

Kids nowadays work their butts off.There's been a real push to make kids aware of the importance of a good education and now the competition for University places is fierce so they're all having to pull out all the stops to get into the courses they want.Remember University used to be the preserve of the better off.Working class families are now, not just encouraging but expecting their children to go on to third level education so there has been a real change in attitudes.

One further point,if these kids really were getting dumbed down results, surely it would be reflected in the numbers dropping out of University through not being able to hack it.If that were the case we'd be hearing about it.

I think that in some ways it's harder to work around pretty poor teachers or being in a sink school but I find it absurd to see the high percentages of A's. I wonder how students who can't string a couple of sentences together can manage to pass exams at all.
I was a student in the 60's and  was credited with 5 A's but in subjects that were considered difficult. They were in the sciences, history and mathematics. I was offered a place at Oxbridge but declined to be a nurse instead...we all make mistakes! 
I too feel that we should applaud our students like true Brits.

my view is that to say that they are becoming easier is putting down students who do work hard and deserve to get good grades

however having said that, the government has an agenda to make more people pass with good grades and get them into tertiary education, so you see a huge increase in the percentage in top grades as compared to say 18 years ago when i did my a-levels - and i;m sorry but i dont believe that people are smarter now than they were then (conversely i dont think that they are less intelligent either)

what they should do (and what I always thought they did) is appoint the top percentile with an A, the next with a B and so on - and keep these percentiles constant over time, so if you receive an A - you can say with pride that you are in the top ten percent for that subject and that is a statistic that employers can understand and equate to.

Unfortunately if you award everyone with top grades and a university education - which seems to be the government policy of inclusivity and not wanting anyone to feel a loser, the whole system is totally devalued.

Which ultimately - is unfair on you as an A level student, because I dont doubt that you do work very hard

One word I really hate and that is "Racist", Why do people have a fetish about the Black People ? After all we have all kinds of colours in peoples skins, as they come from all over the World. So why do you think that White means that you are different... because you are not. We are put onto the Planet for different reasons, and therefore there are different colours.....  but we are all on the same Earth. We are no better than the black person... but we strut around thinking we are better.There are  lots of the Ethnic race who are very clever, and have super brains, as you can find them in big business, Finance, and way down on the factory floor.We are all Gods children(no I am not religous) just being fair, so remember that if you sit, work, or have a cup of tea, in the Company of a black person.. remember he is like you ... a human being. Treat him as such.. he could be your boss one day...By the way The Police in New York are not racist, and I should know... I have two Grandsons in New York... both cops.. !! and each and every one is a Copper first, and a person as well. They speak highly of those people they work with. Black or White.

it has come to my attention that there only a few certain users are getting thumbs down,for answering the same  way most of the others do.But the others are not getting thumbs down.
Do you think there is a 'clique' or 'gang' of thumb downers targeting certain users.Or do you think it is just one person with multiple personality disorder.

We damned well ought to! We pay every year in ADVANCE for the services????? we receive from our local councils and now they think they can charge us more for doing less!!!! I don't think so! It's time to be rid of all of those minions in local services who think they are the bees knees! They're stupid, grasping people who's values are those of the swap shop in the name of green issues and carbon footprints! For the love of God, why doesn't anyone read history anymore and recognise that the changes affecting our planet are cyclical? most just roll over and pay through the nose!!! The rest protest or like a lot of our younger friends - EMIGRATE - taking with them years of excellent education and enterprise plus lovely children who should be leading lights in Englands future - now Canada, Australia and New Zealand are getting them and what will we be left with?

Just as a matter of course, what else do we get from these Councils ? Zilch, as it takes them three weeks to even fetch bulk objects which is another tariff. I would like a full explanation of what they actually do with all the money they get.... apart from some of the very high Salarys they pay themselves,

I think it is scandalous that councils can charge you more council tax for doing less



I also think it is scandalous that some people wont take the extra 5 minutes to recycle there rubbish in the correct bins. Im only young, i really dont like doing it but i do anyway because its environmentally beneficial. If i put everything in the right bin i have more than enough room for all my rubbish

i believe in a combination of both.
we adapt as time goes by, but there had to be something that started us. the human body and brain are too complex to just be made by chance. and also our place in the universe and distance from the sun. its too perfect to have been by chance.

I believe we were created. I believe we have a spirit & a conscience...2 things evolution could never give us.
It is more scientific to believe in creation as everything degenerates, nothing improves with time.
When you have a shower take a good hard look at your body & ask your self how such an amazing & complex piece of equipment could evolve?
2 eyes which work together, the whole digestive tract, skin, the amazing reproductive organs, blood is also the most amazing liquid [with solids].
The simple answer is involving a question.
How could humans evolve without a penis & vagina? Impossible, they had to be there in the first place.
So, yes, I totally believe in God who created us & gave us intelligence, a soul, a spirit, the ability to love, even though many of his creatures[this word comes from the same word as creation] have ballsed this planet up, have been bad examples of God & Jesus.
I still believe there is a plan for this place & for each of us.
It's not "Pie-in-the-sky stuff"....it's simple & real, plus makes sense.

If you viewed evolution with an open mind instead of knee jerk "I'm not descended from monkeys" nonsense and actually READ what it is about.

Neither. We are not originally from this planet. We come from space. That's why humans don't quite fit in with the animal kingdom. We have not developed defenses the way other animals have to protect them from big predators. We don't have speed either. No human would last long in the wilderness or the ice no matter how well trained to survive.

No way we are from the Earth originally.

It sounds like a cop out, but my belief is exactly the same as Filya's. Evolution and the Big Bang make sense to me - and I've tried to study it in as much detail as possible, but no matter how many times I ask, or who I ask, nobody can explain just "what" went bang. Therefore, I think it's probably a hybrid. Someone or something made that bang.

Even Richard (Dork) Dawkins defined biology as the study of species that give every appearance of having been designed for a purpose

Simple reason, Dork - as I said direct to him, twice, on BBC Radio Merseyside - they WERE !!

Fellow evo-loopy Prof Richard (Loopy) Lewontin admitted, "It's not that the evidence compels us: we simply can't allow a Divine foot in the door"

I believe in Creationism.  Evolution does not explain how the big bang theory started.  Someone or something as they say caused it.  I believe the Bible even tho there are several who do not.  To many prophecies have came to pass.

Which does one prefer?
Creationism?
With the Book of the Living?
To be a "Better man" as the Son of God?
With success in honouring and worshipping God?
Or prefer evolution?
With the Book of the Dead?
From the graveyards of failures and horrors of the past?
Of different ghostly ancestor's culture and custom with self lack of knowledge?
Being " Reincarnated" as the Dead Mummy?
Risen up from the graveyards of failures and horrors of the past?
From someone else graveyards?
Being created to be Son of a dirty old man from someone else graveyards?
Eerily wailing in ghostly kitchen's dialect with ghostly and deadly words from someone else graveyards?
In kicking the butts of God in not worshipping God?
Living in misery as "I was a cave-men with club on the shoulder" from the twilight zone with self lack of knowledge in different time zone?
Getting kick on the butts as casualty of the dead Mummy in kicking the butts of God in not worshiping God?
With the blind blindly following the blind with self lack of knowledge too?
Luke 8.5-8,10-17
Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49

I have always believed in Evolution, at least as soon as i was able to understand about it. we weren't  taught much about it at school, and that i think as the programme showed, was part of the problem. 
It was informative and i look forward to the other programmes. What surprised me the school children's ideas, that's the parents who have indoctrinated them into their beliefs, as opposed to them being able to make up their own minds, one way or the other.



One thing that disturbs me about people who believe in creationism is their  blind faith, that some God made them, when  all the evidence, and there are billions of examples about how we came to be, is there for the asking. I believe that as scientists who will go on revising their data on the earth and some of its mysteries, we started as said, as bacteria, and evolved through billions of years of the evolutionary process to get where we are today. Darwin was not alone in his beliefs, but he was the one who made it possible for man to step forward, without his knowledge, expertise we would still be in the relatively speaking dark ages as to our history.

i always find it amazing that creationists are outraged by the thought they evolved from apes, but think the idea that they were created from dust is far more acceptable and believable (thats what the bible says, ashes to ashes, dust to dust)

can evolution be proved, it may be flawed - but look up 'microevolution' which supports the theory, evolution is based on the principal that within any population, there are a small number of abnormal mutations and if these mutations are somehow beneficial, these mutations will be passed on to the next generation, if you can physically seperate populations to prevent interbreeding, then these populations will evolve seperately according to the environmental pressures placed upon it.

there was an experiment conducted where they took seedlings frm a relatively neutral saline salt environment and replanted them across the world in a range of different salinities - those that could not 'cope' died, but the surviving seedlings that could cope with high salinity passed on their genes which code for that ability - so within a few generations, the entire population in that environment had adapted to live in high saline conditions, similarly with  other environmental pressures.

The Spartans has a theory that all children should be placed out in teh cold - the weak ones would die so the surviving ones would be strong warriors - survival of the fittest



ok i am an athiest so you may say that I am biased, but evolution at least has some proof and makes logical sense, you may look at the body and say it is a miracle, but given infinite time surely infinite possibilities are possible infinitely

Should Irish and British and other countries journalist just stop trying to ask questions of aides



Of the two election candidates, what have we truly learned from all these interviews. Iran, Iraq. troop withdrawals and of course rap songs. Over the last few weeks I have heard one ask about such things as. On bridge collapses have mr .... any plan to do about the road infrastructure arising from that bridge collapse. answer given by aide. The negative campaign is going to hurt. 
Here is a list of questions asked by Irish radio hosts over the last few months, our radio hosts seem to be asking the questions not the US media.
What are your plans for the roads infrastructure? 
Has your canidate any plans about tackling the floods that have affected areas of the US?
Would you be pressing for better fire services after the wild fires that have been happening more often?
Has one US host asked anything like these questions? 
They call us socialist Europe, Seems socialist Europe is asking real questions, Is that why the Republican's call us Socialists they hear these questions and don't like outsiders asking questions they should be asking?

I still find short stories more fun - to read & to write

If any other regular wannabe writer is out there, I once did a year voluntary service for a global charity publisher/distributor

Boss encouraged me about my way with words

& advised any wannabe novelist to establish ya name & build up readership via doing short stories & features for ya fave mags first, OK?

That was way before the 'Net

See online writers & artists yearbook analyse all mags etc that want freelance contribution @ length, style & subject matter, etc

Then google mag archives & read several issues to get the right feel to please the editor

Google online short story prize competitions - or send sample storyline/script to ya fave TV soap opera producers

& poetry prize competitions

We have been invaded by this trash since the 1970s and now we are seeing the results. Me? I rather watch "The Three Stooges" classic shorts or "The Loney Tunes" cartoons. Not get my mind sick watching trashy gore. That's the culprit.
P.D.: It would have been worse if this fatso and mysoginistic King Henry VIII had movies, television and internet.

Drugs are causing these horrific killings.

The world is still a lot safer than it was.
Henry the eighth had a few beheaded, plus have you ever seen the movie, "Braveheart?" Times were pretty gruesome back then.
Guillotines were horrific also, French Revolution.

A question about neglect! Define neglect....?



Reason I'm asking this is because in your neighbourhood now, can you see children that you would say are neglected...

What would you do if u saw this? What would the social workers do?



In my area at the moment, I personally haven't seen her, but she's about 6 and knocking on doors for food, if the door is open she is going into people's houses and taking food or searching through bags that have shopping in them or she will ask for money..

could this child have mental health problems? if so, it is neglect by the parents to let her out and about on her own.  she shouldn't be going into other peoples homes, especially those she doesn't know.  so yes, whether the child in question is being underfed at home or whether she has any kind of learning disabilities she clearly isn't getting the care she should have.  for her own safety, she should be taught not to go into someone's house without her parents permission.  certainly, if she came to my door, i would call the relevent authorities.

I had neighbors kid who would come knock on my door for lunch when she was little?how do you say no to hungry kid.
Her mother openly admitted she wasn't a good mom.But i keep my house fully stocked w food i have to i have tons of kids.
did she do it cause her mom just didn't have what she wanted or she didn't feed her?who am i to judge?

social workers are overloaded and dont have enough places to put kids now...they will go in and look to see what mother has in the house..maybe there is NOTHING.
she needs to be taken.I would go by the moms house and say hey i was just checking cause the child knocked on my door for lunch...(but then she might get mad at kid and take her anger out)
I would be real nice and kind of go look and judge it has to be VERY VERY VERY bad for them to take the kids away..dealt with this before.I am in fla not sure where you live.

Interesting question Neglect can come in many forms and degrees  Depriving a child of food and water and shelter. Leaving a child alone for long periods of time. Sexual neglect. Physical neglect although the last 2 normally are termed as abuse. You can have mental neglect where the parent continues to scold them or never communicates with them at all. I would guess that the little 6 year old is not being fed and this must be reported to social services ASAP.Never feel bad by reporting Its far better to be wrong than let the neglect to continue. That child needs help NOW. She could be in grave danger by knocking on doors where a paedophile may live.

Not knowing your neighbourhood  one can't be precise, but any 6 year old behaving like that rings alarm bells. If she's knocking on doors I'm surprised someone hasn't attempted to befriend her and try to get some answers. I've never found it hard to make some form of contact with local children who are ready to approach me, and I've been a single bloke for a long time. Why aren't some of the locals being pro-active here? It sounds like plenty of gossip and no action from someone.

I didn't know that sort of thing is still happening in Europe but I see all the time very young children, unsupervised by their parents, riding their bicycles around the block or just playing football on the streets that I just feel like going to the parents and ask them if they have ever heard of the McCann case, and if so do they care !!
That is neglecting one's own parental responsibility... duty of care...
"Neglect" ?  I think it is wilfully failing in one's duty of care for something or someone.

The neighbourhood I work in is very poor. The scenario you talk about actually happened a few years ago. One of the parents came into school to ask what she should do, she had seen one of the pupils begging at doors for food. The girl was 10 and had a brother of 8 and had a baby sister. School contacted Social Services, they visited the family. They found the single mother was an alcoholic, incapable of looking after her children, the eldest daughter was trying to see to everything.The children were removed and help was found for the mother. All the children returned after mum managed to get back on track.

It is very difficult to get a child removed from its parents. It is quite rightly a very last resort, social services will move heaven and earth to keep families together by providing all sorts of help. I work with some families that have had social service involvement for years and there are cases were I wish they would remove the children as they are condemned to following in the feckless parents footsteps.

Do something now mrs s..you won't be signing the child away from it's family you will just put the child and family on social services radar.

My daughter had a friend who was one of 7 ( all under 7 ! ) neither parent worked and the house....well you could smell it from the bottom of the road.

Anyway this poor little mite came to play one time and said to me ' can I see what your fridge looks like?'

I gave her a load of stuff for her brothers and sisters under the pretence it wasn't fair for her to take home goodies without being able to share. But she had still stolen little things like biscuits in her pockets and stuff.

It sounds like events from another era rather than modern day doesn't it?

Would you like to live to 113?



The worlds oldest man celebrates his Birthday today - aged 113.  He lives in Southern Japan and hopes to live another 10 years at least!

Would you like to live that long?  Sure, an instant reaction is 'yes, of course' but I gave it some thought and it frightened me when I thought that I could possibly have no husband, children of brothers/sisters and mother and father left.

I know age and death are a natural progression - but 113? Would you like to live that long?

No, I wouldn't like to see everyone around me die but I wouldn't want to die either. Its sad seeing those old people in nursing homes sitting in their wheelchairs with no family to visit them. I sure wouldn't want it that way. Can you imagine living out living everyone you have ever known? Even your children? I couldn't bear with that much pain.

No. A few years ago this would never have got past the monopolies & mergers commission. What makes it so good now? A bank is in trouble and Lloyds TSB are saving the government from either having to step in (as  they did with Northern Rock) or let a major name go bust. How will this stand further down the line when recovery begins to occur? If governments had  stood firm they should never have allowed so much deregulation-great whilst the markets are up- but a disaster now.They are left to pick up the pieces of the mess they allowed in the hope of a quick profit.

As Gordon Brown appeared to be a decent chancellor of the exchequer (better than the current incumbent), it would reassure me.  As I understand it, the deal had to be done otherwise the crunch would've spiralled even further out of control.

If HBOS had gone to the wall, there would've been even more job losses.



It's a scary time, but i'm not sure what Mr Brown could've done !!!  He's not a great Prime Minister, but i'd still have him ahead of Cameron.

Question for people who know about the housing crisis?



In the past 15 years or so (maybe even longer), I remember hearing both Republicans and Democratics talk about how the government must increase the percentage of people who own homes. Does anyone know what programs the government had to allow people who could not otherwise afford a home buy one? Has anyone heard if these programs are believed to have had an effect on the mortgage crisis?

The government is most certainly involved.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at the behest of Congress and particularly of Barney Frank, made or bought lots of loans made with little or no money down, and when housing prices failed to increase, a lot of these went into foreclosure.  Eventually, all of this will get worked out, but in the meantime getting a housing loan has become far more difficult.

There were loans available during the last 5-7 years that didn't require a down payment to purchase a home.



There were loans available that allowed the seller to contribute up to 6% of the purchase price for the buyers "closing costs".  (Example: lets make a deal, want 6% MORE for your home?  I need closing costs paid...)



There were loans available that allowed more then 6 people to be on one loan, in order to purchase a home.



There were loans that allowed people to purchase a 2nd home (50miles away from your primary) with as little as 5% down payment.



There were loans that didn't ask for income documentation.  And lent 100% of the value of your home!



There were loans that lent 125% of the value of your home.



There were loans available for people with horrible credit scores 580 fico...but allowed a purchase qualifying on the interest only payment only.



There are loans still coming in the mail to all of us... Credit Cards, 90days no interests.  Debt keeps us going right?



Don't believe the hype.



The "mortgage crisis" is not the reason why we are ALL in this mess.  Our government has been "printing" way to much money long before the issue of "risky loans" came into play.

Capitalism is NOT failing; it is simply having the same sort of hiccups that it has had for the past 400 years, when Isaac Newton (not at all a foolish man) lost a pot of money in the South Sea Bubble.  In the 1920's, the bubble was stocks; in the 1990's it was dot-coms; in this decade, it has been real estate.  This has been exacerbated by Congressional pressure (particularly from Barney Frank) for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make more and more risky loans.  That chicken has now come home to roost, and we are now well covered with chicken excrement.

neither of these failed completely. capitalism is not failing. GREED is failing and when we can get it back on track it will work again. checks and balances are what make capitalism work, and they have gotten out of wack lately and no one was looking or caring about it. you have to figure who wasnt doing what they should have been doing.
of course you could vote obama and he will declare himself dictator or king or god, and make a one world government plan. tell everyone to knee down and worship him or be beheaded. 
change is okay, change quickly without regard or without knowledge and research is wrong but what obama is after and about. 
mccain is not another bush. because mccain has knowledge and wants to plan the change.

Don't think so.
Capitalism can survive in time.
But ideology was dead and buried was long gone with time in the twilight zone could not even survive in different time zone.

socialism.

capitalism had many poor but gave people something to look forwards to everybody was poor but was always looking up waiting for their chance to be on top and hard work was merited.

communism had everybody paid and working for the state, life was boring and everyone was like a civil servant. there wasn't enough to go around (nothing fancy) but everyone was more or less the same.
(the idea was life was ment to be like star trek everyone works hard and does their job all eat the same slop the food vendors produce, healthcare free, food free, education free, and respect and authority by studying and hard work in order to obtain promotions!) money wasn't the incentive in communism respect was. that in my opinion was why cosmonaut is synomnous with communism.
why did communism fail? was it greed? was it the need to import materials and produce? dissent? lots of people felt betrayed by the end of communism see the film "Goodbye Lenin" about the collapse of the berlin wall.

i don't have much belief in any other ideas other than communism and capatalism.
unless a halfway house idea was hammered out ie the government communist and businesses private and paying taxes to the government who service the roads to them and provide healthcare to the workers.

<question>



Why does Iran need nuclear weapons, we all know that that is their aim.



So why are they risking setting off the third World war, Israel has the bomb. But The Iranian president has stated he would like to wipe Israel off the face of the map, which only leaves the Israelis with a first strike scenario to secure their country. So my question is should the Governments be made to stay on the surface while the bombs fly, and the people go into bunkers.



</question>



<additional details>



The effect of mutual destruction between NATO and the Warsaw pact kept the peace, India and Pakistan both have weapons which keeps the peace. Only Iran has stated it would like to use one to destroy a country, Israel could have bombed Iraq but it didn't, the trouble with Iran is it could pass on a weapon to extremists and say it was not us. Would you like it if it happened in your childs lifetime for a religous difference.



During the cold war the World was seconds away from armageddon, a Russian officer in a satilite tracking station was notified by a satalite that the Americans had launched a missle, in fact he had five missle launches detected by a rouge satalite. He had 8 minutes to decide what to do, he decided it was a malfunction as the Americans would not launch a first strike. But could you say that about Iran, when the Israelies would have even less time to decide. The 5 countries that had the bomb have all reduced the number they have, as the risk of war has reduced. If Britain, America and Russia gave up the bomb they would be held to ransom by countries like Iran, who don't give a **** about international law. Which is why we have to renew our deterrent, can you see America, Britain, China, France, Russia launching a first strike. No niether can i, which is why i do not trust Iran.



The Iranians have a number of sites where they do their enriching and such, usually under mountains so all you have to do is blow up the mountain and deny them access. The Israelies have already practiced for this in military exercices, which means it could happen. And i suggest that a lot of you try to watch or listen to some factual programmes, on the tv or radio. As the lack of knowledge with some of you does show in your ignorance of todays politics.



And as yet no one has answered the question, you have just all had your say. Maybe it was too hard for you.

It's not clear that the banks are too big, but it is crystal clear that they are very inadequately policed.



The only problem with this is, who do we trust enough to let them do the policing?  One result of the present generation of politicians' blind belief in the mad theories of people like Hayek is that they think bankers are the best people to be running the economy, which is like putting the Mafia in charge.

While democratically or constitutionally accountable control would be best in principle, this raises the question of whether we trust government  (pause to let the laughter subside.)

Perhaps this means that we need to start by cleaning up our political and constitutional machine.

Whats the best way for the young to find a home in London ?



My children are wanting to flee the nest. My youngest has just got into University so will take up student accomodation, but the older two are single and on relatively low employment incomes. What with this credit crunch thingy the rents for private accomodation seems astronomical and the council and H/A's seem to want an arm and a leg in hardship before they have any chance of getting into 'social housing'.

Whats the best way for the young to find and afford a place to live on their own these days ?

well in my opinion they are grown up now and they have to make some steps themselves,but you as a loving parent just have to be there for them helping them out a little,but it would be cheaper for them to move in to a house ith couple of people like rent a full house and live with someone so they can divide the rent and it will be cheaper.

its the same everywhere . not just  in london , and not just the young are suffering. any single person on a low income  is  struggling to find accommodation. what they will get is a scummy bed sit. in bournemouth, even the skankiest bed sit will cost £80  a week. for that you will get a freezing cold dingy attic room. on minimum wage that doesnt leave a lot to live on.

The Council and H/As won't touch you unless you're a pregnant Kosovan asylum seeker with one leg.



They particularly don't want to know if you're an otherwise self-sufficient white native British taxpayer who's fallen on hard times (I was refused any help by the Council when I was 8 months pregnant and we were facing repossession, despite all the taxes me and my hubby have paid to them over the years and the fact that we've never asked them for help before, never even been on the dole!)

So you can forget that avenue.

The only option is to be royally ripped off by a private landlord.  And given that the rents these greedy bastards charge for their slums are pretty astronomical, thats pretty difficult as well.  Its just not do-able on minimum wage.  Even the grottiest bedsit will cost around £400 a month.  And on £5.52 an hour thats not possible if you want to eat and stay warm as well.

I think your children will be like most other young people and have to live at home until they're 30  . . .  Of course, you don't think this Government actually CARES do you?

local councils won't help, as they are not homeless, how about a large shared house, many students do this to offset the costs. On the outskirts of London, you can rent property, inside the centre of London very difficult. A neighbour actually bought their children a flat, but that was absurd in my opinion, as it went for about £350,000.



very often info is available from the Uni, as people post stuff on Bulletin boards there, looking for people to share.

I am a long way off the next level, but, still I wonder if I will be 'allowed' to reach it.
I have just, to my amazement received aTC badge this week.  Then right away I had one of my rare Qs removed. I appealed and it was re-instated. Yahoo said it was wrongly reported by a member of the community!!
Coincidence?  I don't think so.

Yahoo should be telling us who the reporters are, especially in this kind of circumstance.  That way many of the trolls and jealous types would think twice!!
Most of us are friendly, good members who have respect for others but that doesn't seem to carry the priority it should and you are right, there is much unfairness.

The car makers installed black- box voice recorder to determine the circumstances of fatal accidents in the last 5 seconds in a crash.
In most areas of Britain,the last recorded words of the drivers in 65% of fatal crashes were,"oh no"
However,in Sunderland 93% of the final words were,"hold my can of Stella till i shake these cops off....."

Newbie Driver: why are drivers in cities soo impatient and inconsiderate ?



I have only been driving around on my own a few weeks after passing my test and have a very prominant 'P' plate on the back and front of my newly purchased 3rd hand car. But where as I rarely got tooted, honked, shouted at or fingered when cruising  around as a Learner Driver with 'L' plates, the 'P' plates seem to bring out the worst of inconsiderate and impatient behaviour from other drivers, especially in the city areas. Woe betide me if I remain at front on a red to amber light for more that 0.01 miliseconds, or get caught in a wrong lane and dare to indicate to change over !

Cities have lot's of destinations (especially work related ones) in a more confined space.  This means there are more cars per square mile.  This results in heavy traffic and then delays.  People don't like being late for work because then the city dweller does ot have time to cheat on his/her partner after work with their colleagues.

why do they have Ps on new drivers license plates?? i don't see why it matters how long you've had your drivers license and why people should even have the right to know.. but people are impatient when other people GET IN THE FAST LANE AND DRIVE SLOW, so annoying.. or when somebody is going 5 below the speed limit (very annoying) because i usually go 5 over, so thats -10MPH for me



however, IF you are actually going the speed limit or a little bit above it, if somebody starts riding your tail just tap the breaks.. don't slam on them. just tap them so the person will EFF off.. it works

and if they hit you it's their fault :)

Because they are trying to get places on time and the traffic is bad. I went from a small town with paved roads no bigger than a sidewalk and dirt roads where you were considerate and let the other person pass or get over, to a city where there is a never ending line of traffic and usually the only reason I end up getting impatient is bacause people drive crazy and I'm so nervous that I will make a mistake just like yours.

Rudeness is not confined to drivers, those idiots who toot you are rude all the time, they just feel free to vent in the anonymity of their cars.

The most important thing you can do is plan your route before you turn on the ignition and ignore the rude drivers.



Don't let their taunting toots make you go too fast or break driving laws.



They won't be around to explain to the cops why you broke the rules to avoid taunting toots.

Congrats on passing your test ;D

Drivers in the south are generally more aggressive and impatient than those further north.
 I frequently drive up and down the M1 from Yorkshire to Sussex and back, and people do drive differently, for some reason.
Having said that no one in my northern town knows how to negotiate a mini roundabout, all 3 drivers will sit there waiting for the other to go and then all 3 will try going round at the same time. Does my flippin head in.

Because sitting in traffic is frustrating and it is annoying when newbie drivers take ages to do stuff.



One of the most frustrating things in my routine is when you are late for something and have to sit behind a driver (new or experienced) take 5 mins trying to fit into a massive parking space!

Not excusing the behaviour - if it's on a weekend I don't mind, it's just I'm a different person driving during rush hour.

I don't think it will work.  I am a non-smoker myself, and very glad of the ban on smoking in restaurants and pubs etc, but I think this is a step too far and does infringe people's civil liberties.  Also, every smoker I know is well aware of the health implications, but they still smoke because they enjoy it.  I eat too much chocolate and drink too much coffee, which I know isn't good for me, but someone coming up to me in the street to tell me off would not help - it would just really really annoy me!!

Well I dont smoke so dont have to worry! But I think if someone that does is stopped it could be viewed at in two ways; they may be very insulted. Smoking is a matter of choice to people (although I dont like it!) just like when you decide to get married is a choice. So for someone to come up in your face and ask you to take a cardon monoxide reading would be considered intrusive. On the other hand, if people see they have a high reading, or higher than expected, it may make them think twice and think ok I have to give up.

I think that it's the same general idea as the Bible Thumpers who come up and harass people about Jesus and being "saved".

Smoking is a choice....it may be a bad choice but it's still a choice and if that choice is taken away the only thing to follow is that more choices will be taken away. Do we really want the governments of the world to make all our choices for us?

i think its a good idea. the more information you are empowered with the better decision you can make, if you dont give a stuff dont take the test, if you're curious and want to make changes to your life it can only help you give up. i gave up 20months ago and havent looked back, if i was approached at the time i would have taken part as i would be curious as to the results and i'm sure it would of had some bearing on my decision to give up, however i still feel if ppl want to smoke no one should have the right to stop them in their own cars and homes.

the pro smoking lobby is a funny bunch in my opinion, if a company marketed a food product for example, which was shown to cause cancer - you would think that the government should be duty bound to point out how it could harm your health, and yet you object to this

i think smokers - although aware if the facts are living in denial - i smoked for 18 years until i got cancer myself and swiftly gave up - best thing i have ever done

doctor agree that smoking is probably the one biggest cause of preventable death and has a range of long term health problems attached to it - so if you choose to smoke fine, but then i would argue you should pay more contributions towards your healthcare or even be denied some treatments if you refuse to give up

i may not agree with the method they have chosen, but i do agree with what they are trying to do - sadly people refuse to give up until they are actually in the middle of a serious disease which for some is too late

and if that happened to you - i flipping guarantee you would have been grateful for someone to have stopped you smoking in teh first place

Forget all this nanny state bolloc*s, I think this is a great idea and they should go further!

I am a non smoker, and I am sick and tired of people walking past me/standing next to me at the bus stop etc and just lighting up or blowing their fowl disgusting smoke all over me!

What gives them the right to force their disgusting habit on us just because they enjoy it?

How would these selfish bas*ards like it if I decided to empty my bottle of diet coke/cup of coffee all over them, after all they cover me in their smoke so why can't I cover them in my drink? The difference is their drenching wont affect their health in the long term, me breathing in smoke will affect mine.



People will argue 'but its fresh air' or 'we have already been banned from indoors', well boo bloody hoo, and the point is it isn't fresh air any more when you pollute it with your disgusting smoke!



Personally I think I and anyone else should be legally allowed to punch anyone who pollutes my air with smoke, that will teach them to be a bit more considerate!

I did that test at Uni as part of a smoking cessation class. As one of the few smokers I had to take the test, record my reading go out and have a ciggie then come back and do the test again.

It was supposed to prove how much my carbon monoxide levels had gone up afterwards, and shock me into giving up. Trouble was even after 2 f@gs my reading didnt go up at all ;)
So it's a load of bollocks and if anyone stops me in the street I would tell them so

Since it depends on who wins in each riding, a party can win an overall majority of the popular vote, but not enough ridings to become a majority government.

For example, say there are 3 ridings and the results of the vote in each riding comes in as follows:

Riding 1: Conservatives 85%, Liberal 8%, NDP 7%
Riding 2: Conservatives 45%, Liberal 50%, NDP 5%
Riding 3: Conservatives 45%, Liberal 5%, NDP 50%

In the end the Conservatives would have far more combined votes than the other two, but each party still only has one seat.

some of these things you have to chalk up to hard campaigning and others to just not getting it. I will it up to you to make the decision on what you believe. I dont believe his age is a problem any more that obamas race is or palins gender is. obama is just not right for the job not because hes black but because he doesnt fit the position.

If you were "worthy" of joining the elite who are planning a new world order, you would already know that you're a part of the group.  Not invited to Bohemian Grove?  Didn't join the guys when the Bilderburg Group met?  You haven't been asked to join the Council on Foreign Relations?  None of those?  Then you don't get to join.  Welcome to the unwashed masses.

Decode this lyrics " Do you know"
Does one know how to solve the misery of living human kind in time?
Does on know what went wrong out there in time?
New world order is only correcting the mess on what went wrong created back in the past with self lack of knowledge without being aware of it being expose in time.
Does one has a solution on how to nail the dead Mummy risen up from the graveyards of failures and horrors of the past from the graveyards of different ghost;y ancestor's culture and custom back into the coffin?
Is one a qualified ghost buster in time?
Then be looking forward with the solution in going back to the twilight zone in nailing the dead Mummy back into the coffin.
Then will meet at the "Star gate" to go back to the twilight zone.
Coming along?
Have the solution ready.
Then we move backwards  in time.

No they are not the same thing.



The credit crunch is when banks will not lend money, mainly because they don't have it or are scared the the people that they will lend it to will go bust and not pay it back.

A recession is when the economy is in decline for over 6 months. It is possible to have one without the other.

No.  A recession has a generally accepted and precise definition.  A country is in recession when it experiences two successive quarters of negative growth - ie a falling GDP.

The 'credit crunch' is a recent moniker for the current cause of or current economic woes.  In recent years there had been far too ready a flow of cheap credit which was taken advantage of by major financial institutions to be able to offer incredible loans, mortgages deals etc.  It was however a bubble - effectively the money supply was bound to dry up at some Point, which it has done - hence the term 'credit crunch'.  The issue is that many major financial institutions over extended themselves offering products that were based entirely on the availability of cheap credit - and the taps shut off abruptly.  This isn't the same as a recession, but is a major causal factor.

Although they tell us that the economy grew by 0.3% in the 1st quarter of this 2008, the 2nd quarter saw a definite decline, and unless a miracle happens by the end of the month then this quarter will also show a decline. TWO quarterly declines mean that it is officially a 'recession'.

Arguably, that 1st quarter, the figures may well be complete lies and I suspect that they were! Rather like the 1.75 million unemployment figures were TOTAL lies that were released today! And all the other lies that this lunatic govt feed us daily to try to make us feel that everything is swimming along nicely. I've said it for months, the British economy IS in recession right NOW, but hey, you believe what you want to believe.

EDIT. And who the 'eck truly believes that inflation is ACTUALLY running at 4% HA HA HA. That's also a bluddy blatant lie to keep wages down when we all actually know that the things that matter are 10 - 20 % more expensive than last year i.e. fuel, food, raw materials etc etc etc - blah de blah de blah.

A recession is 'in the post'. Although the defn of a (cyclical) recession which periodically occurs in the capitalist economy has not yet been reached ie 2 consecutive periods of negative economic growth, its precursors are in place.
Panic and uncertainty in the international money markets possibly fuelled by predatory speculation against vulnerable banks with undercapitalisation/liquidity, has led to a restriction of credit and combined with high fuel/food prices hence to a decline in consumer spending, thence to a recession. This in turn leads to a rise in unemployment.
The next phase could be depression, which is much more long term and much more difficult to 'spend ur way out of' using monetary policy or indeed any alternative fiscal instrument.

No the "credit crunch" just means that fools can't buy their stupid 42" plasma TVs on finance anymore and have to either save up and or buy a cheaper second hand TV which will make them "uncool" with their mates.

First customer? (as if) That depends on whether she's worth the 20 bucks. If you're driving, is she paid by the mile and capable of giving good directions? Don't forget the GM family discount either. So, which dealership does she work at?

As for myself, no. After two ex-wives, I'm fairly certain I wouldn't get a very good reference. As for now, I'm self employed and disabled. I did meet my first wife in a nursing home though. Don't go there unless you like antiquing.

No but there should be an onus on that person to learn the language within say 18 months.

However the problem of foreigners living in 'ghettos' will remain.

Having lived in Spain (I speak Spanish) and Cyprus (slowly learning Greek) I can tell you that most ex-patriot British people tend to stick together and not even try to become fluent in the local language.

As for cost, I see no problem with making tuition available at a reasonable cost.

Personally I prefer the company of the local people, they are much more friendly and hospitable.

I love Cyprus and will be back there in a couple of weeks, And yes the people of Cyprus are really friendly. I also get by in Spanish and love mixing with the locals, had many a late night drinking and chatting in the local bars..

Ideally yes.  Are you talking about people coming to the UK and being made to learn to speak English.  This of course would have to work both ways i.e. we can't enter another country without speaking the language.  On that basis it would not work as most British people are completely lazy about learning another language believing that everyone should speak and understand English.

Wherever a person may want to live, i think they have a responsibility (socially as well as financially) to learn the language.

Sufi has a good point about asylum seekers. Of course there won't be time to learn a language but once the person is living in the other country, they should do their utmost to learn the language.

I'm not sure it should be a prerequisite for residence, but a person ought to have made a good effort to learn the language before requesting citizenship.

The person wishing to live in the country ought to bear the cost of learning the language.

It should be a requirement to be able to read roadsigns, or important information on food packaging, for example. I think saying you have to be fluent is a bit unfair, it takes years to become fluent in a language. But definitely, basic knowledge of a language should be a requirement, it's common sense and would help the person to better integrate into the community.

Saying that though, and as many people have pointed out, few Brits would be abroad if that were the case. I was on holiday in France in August, and my neighbour there, who lived next to my rented holiday bungalow, was speaking very loudly in English to a waiter in a cafe who had trouble stringing two words together in English. Imagine the uproar if that happened here.

how are you going to take an active part in society if you can only converse with the people who speak the language of your old country?

if you want to continue to speak the language of your homeland then why not just stay there?

I think it's just common manners to try to learn the language of the country you are staying in. Although i won't be staying in Egypt where my husband comes from, i am learning Arabic as i go out there so much and like talking the locals language.



How many immigrants here have come and not even bothered to learn the language, so we have to pay to have interpreters in schools, and in work places. Surely it would save money to have English classes for them. If you are going to work in this country you should not be given a job unless you can speak the language.
I work as a nurse in a dementia unit. Nearby there is a nursing home, where they have employed  some Polish women. They speak very basic English, and the the patients get confused because they can't understand them. My friend works there and tells me the Polish carers lose patience with these elderly patients because they can't understand their broken English. Now i'm sorry but the needs of our elderly are paramount and the homes should only employ full English speaking people. I am British and sometimes I can't understand my patients when they start to slur their speech, so how is someone who can't talk the language properly supposed to? You have to be very patient with these lovely old people.
Again, political correctness putting the elderly at the bottom of the list.

Sadly not.  We shouldn't have to.  If the finance industry was policed and regulated properly this would never have happened.  Was it Reagan who said, "government is a problem, the market is the solution"?  Well, his government was a problem, but the market was never a solution.  We've allowed ourselves to believe the free market lie told to us by the people getting rich off our backs.  Now it's all gone greedy bastard-shaped and they'll find ways of making us pay for their crime.

why on earth do they think they should be paying themselves $22million a year!!!! that's just ridiculous, and greedy and slightly selfish.
fair enough they might want a good wage, but even less than half that is a outstanding wage!
and as for the lending, they should have been more responsible!
if a customer is in debt, and the bank see's that, that shouldn't then offer them more money on a loan basis to put all their monthly debts into ''one easy payment''.....it might be only ONE payment a month, and it might be easy for it to come out for your account, but the think the monthly payment is like HALF that persons wages!

Sadly we, being merely the people, cannot sue, (effectively).
The money grabbers and high risk takers are protected by institutions who need to maintain the status quo.
Very few people would have the money to sue a financial institution, although now that the American government has bailed out AIG whilst allowing Lehman Bros to fail, expect some litigation.

The millions of ordinary citizens who spend their lives diligently and frugally paying all their bills, foregoing the high-life in order to house and educate their families, have been shafted.

We've all had to suffer the excesses of these pirates, kowtowing to the mega bonus loadsamoney's, who were so adept at buying their way to front of society.
What now.

Will they hang their heads and give back what they've falsely gained.

Or will our collective governments, the one's who represent us, protect them and make us pay or protect us and make them pay.

First you have to know and understand who to sue.

There is a lot more here than meets the eye and astonishingly more than the American news media is saying.

First of all the loans sold for financing homes had to get money from somewhere and the source of this first stage has been recently revealed in the Chinese press. The Central bank of China has on hand, 30 TRILLION dollars worth of American Home loan bonds that were purchased through the like of middle men such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.

The Bank of China bought this massive amount of bonds against the advice of more seasoned bankers and now they are stuck with $30,000,000,000,000 worth of paper certificates that will probably be worth zip tomorrow.

Now one must question why a central bank would buy this much from a single source. If you are suspicious that's ok because the answer lies in what the central bank of China is saying now, and that is they are blaming their American partners for " making them buy these bonds" . The truth is that no one made them buy anything. They bought these bonds because they made money on the side for their own bank accounts, in the form of bribes and payoffs. They call them ' "expedite fees and gifts" but the money ended up making them personally rich.

In the rush to sell the Chinese more paper, the American bankers ignored safety and good business sense by selling loans to people who would never be able to pay them back in order to generate the bonds to sell to the Chinese and other banks overseas. To say that this is unscrupulous is putting it mildly. The bankers were becoming rich and no matter what happens to the loans, well, they have their money so who cares.

The reason that our US Government has refused to back up the failure of Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch is because in doing so, they would be giving the money to the rest of the world. Quite personally, I could give a dam if the Central Bank of China looses money, they deserve it for having such stupid, short sighted, and greedy leaders.

The good thing is that America wins in the long run, we get a lot of banks with a lot of houses that will be going on sale for a very good price, compared to housing 3 years ago that was grossly overpriced because of Realtor greed, buyer panic, and Chinese financed easy money. Once all of this settles out you will find a small group of savvy Americans with a lot of money, retired because their firms are all bankrupt, property at more reasonable prices, and realistic loan terms from sound banks.

This "correction" was badly needed and has shaken the trees to get rid of some entrenched white collar thieves. Hopefully very few will be allowed back in the system.

Donald Trump thinks that we're going to suffer a worse depression than the last one.

I believe that we are already past the beginning stages of a depression and we're on our way there full speed ahead. This breaking down of the middle class is all being done intentionally.

People think that these conspiracies are stupid and that people who believe them are just crazy, but there is so much evidence to show that many of these things are in fact true and happening. And these crooks running everything are going to continue to succeed with their plans as long as the masses stay in the dark and allow them to continue.

Actually it affects a lot of people - whether or not you buy/sell/own shares.

A lot of the economic market is tied to the stock market - loans and mortgages are bundled and sold, bank assets are traded, the dollar is tied to the stock market.  Many institutions are invested in the stock market:  company pensions, universities, for-profit hospitals, banks - if the market drops, they have less money to fulfill their needs.  Banks can't lend money, universities have to charge more tuition to make up the difference, pensions lose value.

I wanted to be an artist.  I had some talent but not the confidence to get the training.  Plus other things came in the way.

I guess if I had been truly dedicated I would have found a way.

Still, my youngest grandson is 8 and has always shown talent in his drawings.  He is colour blind so all his drawing are black and white.  He doesn't seem to be in the least bit interested in colouring them.
When he comes to stay we have art sessions together and I show him how to draw certain things. he only needs to be shown once.  Maybe I will see him have my dream job

here I go wittering on again. I think I have typist diarrhoea.  lol

I wanted to be a vet - but then my dog died - and I decided I would rather be a doctor.

Sometimes I wanted to be a pilot, like my Dad had been in the war - but girls didn't fly in the Fleet Air Arm then.  That might be a good reason for being twentysomething now.

And sometimes I wanted to be a spy.

Well, I did get as far as being a Wren - and working at one point in signals intelligence - so I suppose that wasn't bad!

Frontline costs about £21 for a vaccine for a dog to ward off fleas and tics from the vets.  One good thing about the collapse of Lehmann bros......The fatcats of the banks who cream off everyone by  crippling people with their unfair interest charges just to line their big fat pockets  and making folks lifes hell repossessing houses as soon as someone hits upon hard times.  Bombarding folk with calls if they are one payment behind , even harassing people to take out loans when theyre not interested in doing so, are getting a taste of their own medicine.  Its fallen back on em .  Those who are wicked will get their comeuppance and its time they were thrown out of their big comfy plushy zone!  And made to panic just like they've done to poor stuggling folk

This was actually a proper question but I figured more people would be interested in answering a question about current affairs than about fleas.  And to be honest I expected a barrage of abuse.

Okay I'll bite as I know a bit about investment bankers and the low morale trash that they are. Investment bankers have been behind some of the cruelest company mergers getting employees sacked for monetary savings to the and the shareholders. Now that they they themselves are being sacked hand over fist for the worst financial doom in a century well listen to this... it's the smallest violin in the world.

I would imagine it varies from vet to vet but it's not just as simple as buying it cheaper, there is also risk attached depending on the size of the animal and the dosage needed. I would hope this is signified in the shop sales.

I haven't worked that one out yet. My biggest bugbear is when single mothers who could be working when their  children are old enough and instead get fully funded Open University courses to do and never finish the courses but take a break then start another one. All this when I can't get any funding for my furthering of qualifications because we aren't on benefits. How fair is it to penalise those who are striving to support our family and better ourselves?

I think what you are doing wrong is to go by what things SEEM like.
I know people on disability and welfare and such and they are barely getting by. Sometimes there might be one family member on welfare and others working so don't let what things SEEM like become truth for you. 
Example: If you saw a guy standing over a dead body with a gun, it would SEEM like the guy with the gun was the killer. But this guy with a gun could be a cop, a busness owner who heard the shots, a kid with a realistic looking toy gun, a guy going to the pawn shop to pawn the gun or a citizen with a concealed weapon permit trying to help the guy who got shot etc etc.
A satellite dish on a house doesn't really prove anything, it doesn't even prove that the people living in that house have enough money to buy beer and cigs, or that they are long-term unemployed.
Now there are always other explanations for these types of appearances. It could be that all the people you know of who are out of work and have satellite dishes and who drink and smoke are meth or crack dealers, or it could be that for some strange reason you know thousands of long-term unemployed families of drunk people who smoke too much, or it could mean that you live with a family of long-term unemployed folks and they won't let you choose the staellite TV station and they aren't sharing their booze and smokes...so many possibilities, so few people who will just mind their own business.

What you are doing wrong is working, not producing another welfare child who will bring more money to the unwed mother living with the unwed father who is also on the dole. What does that say about the liberals who want as much for them who do not contribute to society and are the " blood Suckers" as those who are the providers ?Ask Obama that question.

Your question/statement is far too generalizing.  Those that are poor need some form of entertainment to pass the time....television is the cheapest form of entertainment.  Unfortunately a Satellite or cable is necessary to get reception.  Those that smoke and drink are trying to "medicate" themselves.  You have different/higher priorities for your income.

i would like to know the answer to your question too. i have  a close friend who has lived on minimal benefits while struggling with an autistic son for twenty years. as he was un diagnosed until now . she  received no help, she was penalised by  having her unemployment benefits stopped constantly.  her son  was finally diagnosed with autism after  breaking her arm  and getting arrested, she was further penalised for an overpayment and her £60 a week unemployment is now £55. out of which she has to pay numerous bills such as tv licence and water rates electricity and heating. well heating is a no no. she puts extra clothes on or goes to visit her dad  who has a warm house .  she has no carpets. very little furniture. she has an  old tv with 4 channels. no satellite dish .no computer, no phone except for the mobile which i gave her.  how do other people manage to get the  luxuries?  food in the fridge is a luxury to my friend. the fridge that i got from free adds by the way. it doesnt seem an easy life style to me

It's because they complain effectively when they don't get what they want and you don't. You work and pay taxes, make a complaint about the amount of income you're left with and they'll laugh until they cry at the tax office or DHSS. If you're workshy, take all your and some borrowed kids in and let them run riot whilst you screech '*** e're' at them for around ten minutes. Bet you get to the front of the queue pretty quickly and are sent off complete with what you wanted. A couple of years ago i took a New Zealander who was coming to work for us for the Summer into the DHSS to obtain his nat.ins. number. He was appalled by the state of some of these people. Dirty, scruffy, dirty mouthed and that was just the women. The children were probably beyond any redemption as these 'women' screeched blue murder at them to 'be'ave or else'! Khan repeated that sorry tale many times both in England and on his return home - he really was shocked at the slobbish way that some people behave in England. I was and still am disgusted and cannot believe how low our standards of decency have fallen. Never mind, the credit crunch will sort a lot of this out.

Yes very happy when my daughter is 12 and I will give my consent for it to go ahead - it cuts down the risk of developing the disease.  I've also had treatment for precancerous cells and I don't want my daughter to go through that.
I was vaccinated against TB and Rubella at school (I think all of these vaccines have stopped now) - I don't see any problem with vaccinations taking place within the school.

After watching someone die from cervical cancer, my answer is a big Y E S.
My daughters aunt (on her fathers side) was not feeling well and was having strange pains in her girl bits.  She went to the doctor and they sent her immediately to the hospital.  By then it was too late.  They sent her home with hospice two weeks later.  By then they were giving her doses of morphine that would kill a cow.  She screamed none stop even after the morphine shots until there was no sound yet she still screamed from the pain.



She died in less then a month of first being diagnosed.
Connie's death was a horrid vivid reminder of what happens when you do not go for regular pap smears.  I do not want my daughter to suffer the same fate.  I wish I was not too old for the jab, otherwise I also would be getting it.

Seen anyone die of cancer?

Seen anyone have treatment for cancer?

I have seen some people come out the right side of treatment, and I have seen those that have gone back time after time and eventually give up the fight.

Giving them morphine to ease the pain before the eventually die, but you cant put them down, you let them live a  non existence almost in the very final stages trying to give them as much dignity as you can.

Consider these things first and then ask yourself why cant every women have the jab to protect her?

Many people didnt get the kids vaccinated aganst the so called child hood dieases such as mumps, measles etc because they were scared about the jabs possible side affects but seeing someone suffer is never nice but when you have the chance to reduce your risk/ prevent it from a simple jab is it not worth it?

Getting married is no protection against cervical cancer. Your daughter may end up marrying someone who cheats or lies about his sexual history. Even though my daughters are not sexually active, I still opted for them to get this shot after talking it over with them.

If my daughter was 12/13, absolutely! Cervical cancer is a silent killer, displaying no symptoms until its too late. Cervical cancer caused 949 deaths in the UK in 2006. Your daughter will probably be sexually active at some point in her life (I know it's not something you like to think about, as a mother) and you should take full advantage of the opportunity for her to have the injection. I was not so lucky. I had cervical cancer at the age of 21 after the birth of my first baby. Luckily I was always one to have smear tests done regularly and caught it before it spread. I would really like my grumpy teen to have the injection, as cervical cancer has been present in my family previously, but I don't think its available to anyone outside of schools.

However much the jab might hurt think about the amount of jabs they would have to have if they if they were to contract cervical cancer God forbid!
Anyway I recon its a complete miracle that the NHS are even offering this as there has been so much debate on the issue because of the cost
So I think that they are all a very lucky group of young ladies!

My daughter will not be having this shot at school.  My older daughter (16) thinks it is a shame that schools believe it is in the interest of young girls to encourage them to have this shot for "when they become sexually active at an early age".  At 16 she is not sexually active, but then we have raised her to understand the difficulties that come form unplanned and unwanted pregnancy.  She will wait until she is in a committed married relationship (and those are her words, not mine!)

Our school is offering it to all of us right now of course younger years get priority and i will be having it (i am in sixthform) and there is no downside to this at all to me, a jab is better than the goodness knows how many jabs and treatments and stress and pain from cervical cancer so why wouldn't anyone want it?

Can i just say to the idiotic woman who thinks waiting until marriage will stop any risk of the cancer, NO IT WILL NOT you could die a virgin and you could still get cervical cancer and it may be the thing that kills you! Promiscuity only increases chance of the cancer, you are denying your daughter good health!

There is a famous quote that says so but, really, I think that is only a view that can be taken by people like me who look back on it with a sense of our own shortcomings.  We can all look back and wish we had known then what we know now and, consequently, what we might have done differently but that's not how it works.  Young or old, we all live in the present, making the best of it that we can.  Anyway, if youth had been wasted on the young, all us old farts wouldn't be sitting here with so many wicked memories rattling around in our heads, would we?

Ya, well, let's just say that if I had known then what I know now, I would be richer, smarter, funnier, better-looking, etc. I think if we could have the wisdom gained from age and experience, but have it in our youth, most of us would have better lives. By the time you find out who you are and what you want to do with your life, you're too old to do it.

No, wisdom is wasted on the old. So you know more now and you're better informed but you still haven't done f*ck all with that information, apart from look back and complain. What good is that? To sum up, I think time is wasted on everyone.

<question>



Why does everyone succomon to fear and sell thier stocks when the media yells recession?



People panic and sell their stocks at low prices, because they think they are about to lose money, when that is exactly what causes companies to go under. On wall street, stocks fell DUE TO PEOPLE PANICING AND SELLING THEIR STOCKS because the media smears in the world face when a few companies go bankrupt.  I mean people are selling their stocks (and not buying like they should be) in companies that aren't doing bad, causing their stock prices to fall. Remember America, when you buy stocks at low prices, the company gains money, does better and people prosper. All the media hype on fannie mae and freddie mack, Lehman, and now the AIG scare, has caused ALOT of other companies to lose in the stock market because people are thinking OH MY GOD&lt; and selling even when they don't own stock in those companies. Doesn't everyone understand that "spending money on companies, buying stock, and buying their products is what makes those companies, and america's dollar value prosper. We had a natural disaster... Hurricane Ike, which yes, hurt oil prices due to the texas storm, however, now other countries are seeing everyone in American media yell... OH NO, recession,,,,, just because a couple of companies need help, thus selling thier stocks causing even more turmoil on wall street. America is prosperious because of the ability of businesses to prosper (small an large) however, when there is a "panic alert in the media, we get hurt even worse because people stop investing. Everyone needs loans to buy houses, supplies to build houses, and fix things in our current homes, food to eat, cars to get around, and what makes America so prosperious is the public (people) buying things to do this.  COmpanies are going under because people are in fear and not spending like they could. Gas prices hurt us, yes, but think of it this way...... It's only 2.00 more than 4 years, ago, if that, yet we will spend thousands of dollars on video games for our kids, eat a nice resturants, and buy non needed items-over needed ones, then complain about gas prices, Yet Americans can see that those three companies that failed is not what made America prosper... it's all the businesses, So why punish those companies and hurt our ecomony more buy selling their stocks when we should be taking advantage and buying more stocks now, while cheaper.... that alone would help our economy.



I'm just saying, think about it......... we panic....we sell....we all lose in the long run..........(i understand selling companies that are folding, but let's not make more fold by doing unnecessary things.) With all the media hype, You can bet, other countries are going to pull their shares out of our stocks, which will cause us to fail more, while we here are doing the same.... All because the media yells.... recession or some journalists writes a front page article sayong "worst recesion since 1930...  Well hell yeah, thank you, now it will be worse.



People, wake up, we can fix this problem, buy low...sell high! 
Not the other way around.



</question>



<additional details>



What are your thoughts on this....."Crisis" per the newspaper.



And what can we do about it BESIDES pass the buck?



If stocks are low now..... BUY! They will go back up ya know, and I bet right after the election too!

But instead of people leaving them be, and waiting for them to go back up... they panic, and sell because they think that company can't regain when it can! Like I said..panic! It's not impossible...!

why else wouldnt you sell your stock if its now worth a real low amount, and there is news that the market is down.

now its either that or a nother logical path would be to take hold of your stock and risk it knowningly knowing things could get better.

An interesting link. I see the Brit attitude towards the Jews has not increased. But then they don't have any hate preachers and keep a low profile when it comes to politics.  Whereas there seems to be a Muslim story in the papers almost every day. The word Racism must be heading for the Guinness book of records as the most used word in Britain today. lol . To answer your question, I believe it will take at least a thousand years for old hatreds to die.

by the way jews were once chosen people howver we belive they disobeyed god once and the land they were given as an agreement was takjen of them becus they broke the agreement.

Looking on the positive side, for the first time in history, there is protection for young girls against cervical cancer.



The rest is about sex education - safe sex so people don't get warts in the first place.  A difficult task - when girls are sexually active at such a young age and the UK has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Europe.



No wonder British girls have a certain reputation.

No I am very angry with the choices NICE make for us. But one thing I must say to other answerers: The NHS is NOT free - please don't be under the impression that it is. My NHS contributions each month are far higher than my private health care costs. We get 2nd rate health care and cheapo drugs because we give away free medical treatment to illegals and hospitals fail to recoup costs from insured tourists because of a lack of manpower. I treat the NHS as a back up, we use it for the basic things but have good private cover for when we need treatment. I will pay privately for my daughter's shot in a few years time.

It's hard to say without seeing the actual stats and figures.



They have covered the most important issue of cervical cancer prevention., The genital warts vaccine although desirable would not be covered by the stringent NICE procedures.

It is the unsightly side of the NHS that has to factor cost into everything and way up all manner of outcomes . An unenviable task.

If you had a daughter due to have this vaccine you may think it a poor choice not to go with the quad vaccine option but the redirected funds may be helping another set of 12 year olds receive pain relief from juvenile arthritis.

I don't reckon 'cheapo' is the same as 'adequate'. I think that's what we have a case of here.

As already has been said, its better than nothing at all.
I think some people are under the misconception that cervical cancer will be totally eradicated due to this vaccine. It wont be, there will just be fewer cases. Hopefully.
The vaccine actually only protects againts HPV which is the virus that has been linked with a high percentage (but not all) of cervical cancer cases.

Smear tests will still be required, but most importantly, sexual health education will still be required.

I'm English and I have learned 11 languages.
I accept that I am rare in having a gift for languages.  The difficulty for foreigners is that even if they don't have a gift for languages, they still have to learn them, especially English, because it is so widespread.If the English don't have a gift for langauges, that's the end of it. They don't feel obliged to try.
When I was at school  -  a few years ago now, languages were regarded as a soft option.  You did them if you were feeble at science.
Now languages seem to be regarded as tough.

We do at school, mostly French and German.
Some of us also like to take this further, I took French to A Level, and when visiting a foreign country, I prefer not to be caught screeching like Basil Fawlty in English, so I learn to ask for meals, where things are, say hello, etc, etc.

Typically, this country can have quite a chip on it's shoulder, and we're still a bit in the Zulu mentality of "we invaded everywhere, they should speak English, serve tea and full English Breakfasts all day".

I wouldn´t say it´s a complete myth but what proportion of the population are actually fluent in a foreign language as opposed to the number of Spanish, German, Dutch, Russians, Indians etc etc etc who can hold a proper conversation in English?

I´d bet my next month´s salary that if I could find the statistics the Brits would be way further down the language league tables than their European counterparts.

We are taught other languages at school, such as French, German and even Spanish, but what we should be taught is Polish, Romanian, bangladeshi, Swahili, Timbukstani...........

The curriculum needs to be revised.

What galls me is the fact that we are taught (as a sideline) other languages but we asume that when we visit another country that they would automatically be able to speak English, and a lot of tourists get quite 'uppity' when they realise that the inhabitants do not speak English.

I think we should form a new language - a 'Universal' language, that is taught from birth.

Did say before that it would have been much better for the english had another language been chosen to be spoken as a standard world wide such as french or german,italian or spanish,wouldn't have mattered,but it would have taken away the feeling of alienation on your high street as you to would not be understood by the masses.Luckily we speak two languages so often revert to the second one.The silence is deafening.

I didnt dislike the essay, but the worst one I ever wrote was about To Kill A Mockingbird. I claimed that Jem and Scout thought Atticus was a boring old man and the only thing he did was work and read. I was told that my essay was rubbish as Jem aspired to be a lawyer like Atticus. Even though I got a bad mark, that essay actually taught me alot about content rather than quality of language, which is what I thought was most important.

weeks? This is a move that is being encouraged by the Obama camp to skew numbers. They are also encouraging voter fraud by having people vote in multiple districts with slight changes, additions/deletions from legal name utilizing same day registration/voting. This is an ACORN ploy. Track the trend in Southern California.Next will be the food stamp scams - I've seen it before in Berkeley, Detroit and Watts all initiated by community organizers for groups such as ACORN, who is now vying for funds in the "wall street bailout". Obama says its for voter registration and early childhood education but there is also a mental health parity act which private insurers will fight but will be implemented in federal insurance programs (medicare/medicaid) immediately. Shaffer's Columbia diagnostic has been approved to guage mental health risks in children as young as 4 years old. Do you see how this all comes together. It's not social welfare its hard line communism.Consider how little is really being done to help distressed homeowners, give immediate assistance to small businesses (they won't actually feel a tax break until 2010 and by then all of Obama's pork will cut out any possibility of the tax break)

If my children's school do not test them for spelling, I will.



I think it's disgusting that children and adults don't know how to spell simple words.



I was in my twenty's before I found out that there is a difference between your and you're and it was just by chance that I was told.



When I was at junior school my Mum noticed that my work wasn't being corrected for spelling and when she asked the teacher, she said that they no longer correct spelling because "we don't want to hurt the child's feeling".  To be honest, I was too young to know anything about having hurt feelings and wish I was corrected because by the time I got to secondary school, spelling wasn't corrected because "they know how to spell basic words by now".

Language is all about communication. Now if say the following:

You would assume I meant "You're out of his league."



The fact I made an error but you still understood what I meant is the critical point here.



It is in unnecessary waste of time to correct very minor spelling mistakes and would rather the time be spent teaching my child something useful.

Our kids always came in with spellings to learn - 5 or 6 words a week isn't difficult.  It makes them think, and makes them use their brain.



I remember picking my daughter up from her reception class (4 and 5 year olds) and a mother was checking her son's spellings.  He'd got 3 wrong and she was screaming like a banshee, telling him no telly, no playstation until he'd got them all right.  He was only 4.  The whole school heard her, the kid was really embarrased - the parent's attitude was all wrong on this occasion.



I think that the attitudes of schooling is the cause of the decline in the behaviour of our kids nowadays.



When I was at school, our teacher had a bag of sticky stars - if your work was good, you'd get a gold, silver or coloured star.  It was such an great feeling to get a star stuck in your jotter.  Nowadays, instead of testing them, praising them and giving them stars when they get things RIGHT, the ones who are a bit behind are being mollycoddled so that they don't feel left out and non achieving.  They're all treated the same so as not to offend.



Not good enough - if they're not achieving, they need to be told.  What's wrong with saying try harder and you'll get a star next time.  They need to know that the other kid got the star and that they have to WORK to get it for themselves.



And the kid who's done well should be praised.

Spell check?



When I was in school we were given 20 words each monday and tested the following monday, also during the week we were given an essay to write using all 20 words.



For juniors it is not appropriate, however for primary and above it most certainly should be obligatory.



We were also given (say) a 300 word passage without punctuation and asked to add the punctuation.

<answer>



Should the cane be reintroduced in schools to help discipline todays youth? Or is it a form of strange and inhumane punishment? Have your say...



During a wide-ranging discussion this week on why we, as a society, seem to be getting more violent and aggro, a lot of calls, emails and sms came in saying we should bring back the cane - reintroduce corporal punishment in schools.



Many listeners claimed that being caned at school taught kids of the time to respect - or at least fear - authority figures.



A lot of you also think getting the cane for breaking the rules provided students with a consequence for their actions that actually meant something - as opposed to detention, which is often seen as too 'soft'.



There does seem to be a growing support for the use of the cane when students are involved in incidents of violence. The argument is that if violence is the language being used by kids, then using similar 'language' as punishment is something violent students will understand.



But critics of corporal punishment in schools claim that teaching kids not to be violent by using violence - the cane - is not going to work.



Many parents also baulk at the notion their kids will be hit by teachers.



But it is possible these are the very parents whose kids lack any kind discipline at home.



For what it's worth, my parents always thought any caning I got - and there was some - was most likely thoroughly deserved. In other words, they left the school to make that determination. They trusted the school to make that judgement.



So what are the pros and cons of reintroducing corporal punishment?



And should that kind of punishment be handed out to both genders - boys and girls?



Because when I was at school, the cane was only for boys, and of course, the girls got away with murder because they knew the worst they would cop was a detention.



It's also worth pointing out this was a time when all girls were considered sweet and innocent, and that only boys could be really bad. We know today that is anything but true.



So would bringing the cane back to schools do any good to curb what is seen as a lack of respect and an absence of discipline in some young people these days?

Yeah sure it is a minority, and so i guess it must be a slow news day, BUT while we're on the subject, I think it is a good idea! I'm sure the people who disagree with me are the same people that tell off other adults for disciplining their children in public.....aren't you? grrr lol. but seriously, if the kids behaved themselves then they wouldnt need to worry about getting the cane. the whole point of any kind of punishment is that it's only administered when someone has done something wrong, not just going round hitting kids for the fun of it!. If I was a teacher, I would want the cane to be brought back too. I'm only 22 but when it gets to the point where I don't feel safe walking past a group of teenagers, surely something needs to be done.

I agree - I think that the headline on yahoo for instance "teachers want cane back" was really misleading. It should have said "A fifth of the teachers in a survey want the cane back" - not as snappy though!



I'm not surprised that a minority of teachers wouldn't mind the option to use corporal punishment occasionally - but this hardly justifies lurid headlines.

It was probably never used, because Japan probably didn't understand the impacts of a nuclear attack. Let's only hope and pray that it will never be used, and that the US will never again provoke anyone to use nuces against it (because if I were president of Russia or China in 1995 or 1999, I would seriously consider this option, though it means harming innocent civilians-I mean babies, not war provoking demonstrators).

No but it does mean that police will no longer think they can shoot people as a "lesson to terroists" Israeli style



Blair was trying to "teach the terrorists a lesson Israeli style" . This was cold blooded murder of Jean Charles de Menezes, by British police and a disgrace. This link explains MY opinion perfectly

I have seen that article before and it is mostly unsubstantiated rhetoric.



As far as the crime rate in the capital is concerned it has actually gone down under Sir Ian Blair.



No doubt there are those who see this as a 'green light' for yet more spurious compensation claims against the Metropolitan Police.

What are the possibilities of Steven Fosset's Plane Crash to be a cover up?



I am very convinced that Steven Fosset was shot down for flying too close to area 51 and the crash and id are planted? Does anyone find it "convenient" that no body, bones or remains can not be found?  Isn't this just one more government cover up?

For one, the government won't shoot you down for flying over a military base unless you pose a threat, they will track you, and arrest you as soon as you land.  That's if you were stupid enough to ignore all the radio warnings you'd get and over really sensitive areas, you'd probably get a nice fighter escort.



Fosset was a very experienced aviator and would never be stupid enough to come anywhere near restricted airspace.



Besides, you don't need to fly over Groom lake, you can just look it up on google earth.

As of Monday Sept. 29, Steven Fosset was spotted in Tonopah NV working at a Chevron gas station. It seams as though he survived the crash, but suffered severe head trauma resulting in amnesia, his lawyers are currently in the process of re-assimilating him into his formal life. It's said when they found him he was convinced his name was Marcus Brody, and that he was born and raised in Pahrump NV.

Umm... "Area 51" is in Southern Nevada, just north of Las Vegas.  Steve Fosset crashed into a mountain in Mammoth, California.  They are 300 miles apart - that's not "too close" its actually quite far.  Remains weren't found because he was probably killed upon impact and eaten by bears.  It has been over a year since this happened and the likelihood for finding remains in mountains where there is wildlife that eat people is alway slim.

the car might not be theres and there are things called laws  which, whether they abide by them or not, we must. The law says (simply) anyone who doesn't want to be shown on TV won't be and personal information cannot be passed on. Your license plate counts as personal information as from that you can easily find out who the car belongs to and where they live.

weeks? This is a move that is being encouraged by the Obama camp to skew numbers. They are also encouraging voter fraud by having people vote in multiple districts with slight changes, additions/deletions from legal name utilizing same day registration/voting. This is an ACORN ploy. Track the trend in Southern California.Next will be the food stamp scams - I've seen it before in Berkeley, Detroit and Watts all initiated by community organizers for groups such as ACORN, who is now vying for funds in the "wall street bailout". Obama says its for voter registration and early childhood education but there is also a mental health parity act which private insurers will fight but will be implemented in federal insurance programs (medicare/medicaid) immediately. Shaffer's Columbia diagnostic has been approved to guage mental health risks in children as young as 4 years old. Do you see how this all comes together. It's not social welfare its hard line communism.Consider how little is really being done to help distressed homeowners, give immediate assistance to small businesses (they won't actually feel a tax break until 2010 and by then all of Obama's pork will cut out any possibility of the tax break)

Sir Ian Blair resigned as Metropolitan Police Commissioner - but shouldn't he have been sacked after...?



condoning the cold blooded murder of Jean Charles de Menezes? I can't believe anyone would exonerate the police, after they delivered three bullets to his head at point blank range. I can just imagine Mr de Menezes's parents saying "oh it's fine, the pressure was on, let's not quarrel about who killed who!"



</question>



<additional details>



Jean Charles de Menezes was here perfectly legally according the the then Home Secretary. Even he had been illegal, which he was not, that is no excuse to shoot first and ask questions later. How would you feel if police murdered YOUR son in this way. I doubt you would say "oh don't worry about it, after all there was a terrorist on the loose yesterday, accidents happen."

The purpose of Sir Iain Blair's resignation only becomes obvious when you understand that no police officer can be brought to court on a charge concerening a case which took place during his time with the force.



Once a police officer leaves the force, that's the end of the matter.  He is no longer involved in any of the cases where he might have been due to him being fuzz boss.



Hope that's clear and fuzzy enough!



Do you still believe that the police shot and killed Jean Charles de Menezes?  I don't.  It had all the hall-marks of the SAS - bang, bang, bang, your dead, very dead!  No one said a word like, hands up this is the fuzz.  No.  just a load of shots. . . .

It was not cold blooded murdered



fact are simple



he was told to stop prior to entering the tube station he then ran into the tube station jumped a barrier while still ignoring police commands to stop he then boarded a packed tube train and sat down with his rucksack.



The officers where right to fire and acted in a very courageous way.



All he had to do was stop and obey police commands, instead soon after attempted terrorism attacks he chose to ignore armed police.



and regarding shoot first and ask questions later there is a very good excuse that is the people who board buses trains and blow them and themselves up in an instant



shoot to kill is not nice but in circumstances in necessary



these officers acted in a courageous heroic fashion, its just a pity the person killed decided to ignore the police



the police did the right thing at the time, its easy to judge in hindsight, unfortunately officers in the front line against terrorism to not have the luxury of hindsight they are to busy risking their own life's for us

I like Sir Ian Blair, got a lot of respect for his policies but i do think the actual officer who shot Jean Charles de Menezes should have been brought to book, as i understand it two police officers heavily armed were watching him but one decided to have a jimmy in a bush and the other officer started giving chase, which caused some confusion.



Was there really justification in shooting him six times in his head, i doubt that very much, the poor man was young with all his life ahead, whatever must have been his last thoughts.

Yea.....24hrs after some nutters who hate our country decided to take some bombs onto a train & blow themselves up.



The police made mistakes & lessons should be learnt. But I hope that the brilliant job that the police do for us is recognised & that the police offices in question are protected. They were protecting us the public rightly or wrongly. I seem to be one of the few (maybe stupid people) that still believes in our police.

Faith - For the same reason that tabloids talking about say a story on a teacher will say,



"And Mr Smith, who lives in a £300,000 townhouse in Cheshire ....."



I mean what does the value of this persons living quarters have to do with the story? Nothing. But they do it all the time.



Likewise, I mentioned something that had nothing to do with the story, but is still entirely true. His as s is indeed black is it not?

Who else is glad Cameron is after the PC culture and the Human Rights act?



Perhaps he might also get the work shy working, the single mothers off their backs and the illegal immigrants deported.



</question>



<additional details>



You see Labour has done nothing for this country but helped the people who don`t add anything to this country to get something for nothing. the NHS is in unable to help grannies but it can help immigrants. Working families can`t get a bigger Council House because the single mothers have them. Work =shys refuse to take a job because their benefits are so good. Time these people got off their backsides and contributed to making this country great again.

Rickrolling is an Internet meme involving the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up". The meme is a bait and switch: a person provides a Web link they claim is relevant to the topic at hand, but the link actually takes the user to the Astley video.

What would you ban if you were king of the world?



Today we've heard that smoking in public places has been banned in India. People keep going on about banning things like smoking, but I reckon there must be much better things we could ban to make things more pleasant for everyone.



I'd ban 'people who stop in front of train ticket barriers and rummage through their bag for ages for their ticket while a huge queue forms behind them'.



What would you ban?

I'd ban politics ... Hate it.
Of course, the king shall be the ONLY political figure (which in fact, isn't quite a political figure, he'd be a dictator that bans all politics, right?)



I'd also ban smoking in public places. I'd set up smoking boxes that has filters attached to the opening to filter the pollutants.

For how long do you think USA will remain super power ?



I was just wondering cause its economy is now a mess, countries like China, Pakistan, and India have a larger growth then the US plus its military is stuck in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is unable to take any other military action because Iran and Pakistan wont let them and they are sort of stuck, Plus a lot of countries now hate em for taking stupid actions so for how long do you think it can remain a super power !

Is it one now? Militarily it is second rate, politically it is dangerously split with an illegal on the throne (sorry in office) and so far as allies goes it has only the remnants of a defunct British govt to wipe its pampered overblown ego, a govt which will not last beyond the next uk elections I might add. America historically speaking is a `neverwas` rather than a former or current, I wish I could live a couple of centuries with my faculties intact to witness the justification of these words. As it it I don`t doubt you will receive many red neck braindeads abusing you an telling you how ungrateful the world is cos we don`t appreciate what the good ol u ess of ay is doin for the freedom of the world etc etc etc.

Well now that the police have officially named Casey as a 'suspect', I think the case is moving in the right direction.  I do believe Casey is 100% responsible for Caylee's disappearance.  So sad.  My heart goes out to Casey's family too.

I think she left the baby in the trunk and she died.  Everything else after that has been an massive cover up that has been and is still getting out of hand.  My question is where was she actually going when she said she was working.  How can she hold the info in for so long? What is the lawyer talking about when he says it will all come out and we will understand?  is it that she is crazy? Split personality disorder? That is the only logical explaniation I can think of. But they need to stop spending the tax-dollars of the Floridians.  They should make her family pay the money back.

Isn`t it amazing hhow the Labour spin machine is trying to blame Gordon Brown`s failings on the Tories?



He was Cancellor for 10 years before he bacame PM. Labour had a whacking big majority in the Commons. If the Tories left the financial market lacking rukles, then he was careless or negligent in not noticing this and rectifying it.

The government really only has one option,and that is to put up interest rates,this encourages those with money to save and to hit those who have little,,this in turn is supposed to stop spending and this lowers our imports and slows down demand on wages ,,however this also has a detrimental effect on any one who owes money,which is just about all of us,Trying to get a cap on wage rises is also another tool they have but it`s not enforceable,in other words inflation is virtually a o go area for total control as it has too many outside factors effecting it,

Happy Murcias answer is correct.



Waves is just ridiculous nonsense.



The reserve however should have put up interest rates well over a year ago to douse the flames that were being fanned. Particularly in the buy to let market.



Personally if we have to have a recession to correct the flaws of the past few years, so be it.

I don't think we'll be seeing much more of Palin until the election is over.  For now on the Republicans will want to make it about Obama/McCain as much as possible.  By managing to get through the debate with only one question going horribly wrong (when she was asked about Cheney's stance on the VP position) she can now get out of the way of any tough questions.



Palin's performance in the Couric interview was so staggeringly awful that I think the next and only future interview will be with Fox News.



Expect lots of 'fair and balanced' questioning!

Swiss army knife issue?



I see a well-known clothing chain has been selling Swiss branded jackets with a free swiss penknife included. This has apparently caused an outrage and all of them have now been withdrawn from sale. Am I just being thick here by asking exactly what they've done wrong? Since when have penknives been illegal in the UK? I know the sale of knives is age-restricted but the jackets were priced at £59 so they're hardly going to be aimed at children. Maybe it's just a publicity stunt to get them in the headlines.  What are your views on this?

Personally I am bored by the number of people who seek scapegoats for our problems. Playing the blame game is just a way of avoiding finding real and lasting solutions to problems that the world faces.

<question>



Do you think that this would be unreasonable?



I know I'm posting this in here again because I think you're all very knowledgeable and I would like as many opinions as possible.



Again it's about my little boy's Dad.



My little boy's Dad is notoriously uncaring and terrible at keeping to contact arrangements. He hasn't seen him for 2 weeks now, and has no intention of doing so. He has missed 75% of contact, and chosen other things over seeing his son constantly.



I've now reached the end of my tether - he has changed him number, and the one number I do have he refuses to answer. I've been trying to get him to stick to a routine and he won't.



After trying to contact him for a week, I really cannot be doing with this anymore. For my son's sake - he needs stability that he just doesn't get from his Dad.



I want to tell him (via text so at least he has no choice but to hear me out) that if he doesn't contact me by tomorrow night to arrange to see the little one at the weekend then I will assume that he doesn't want to see him anymore - based on this and his past behaviour and therefore if he wants to make that decision, it's fine by me, but that has to be his FINAL decision. No second chances, no going back, and he won't be able to see him again until Finn is at an age where he can choose to see him.



Do you think that sending this message would be unreasonable?



</question>



<additional details>



Simm - his Dad is even worse than him, and his Mum not much better.



I've had his best mate talk to him (who happens to see him more) and various other people. It's in one ear out the other.



For reason's I don't want to go into, I am 100% that the court would rule a no-contact order, and I don't want that to happen.



I don't want to cut him out at all - I want HIM to make a decision now, not when little one understands (he's 18 months now). I'm hoping it will give him a kick up the bum more than anything else.

Love is a verb not a noun.



He doesn't deserve that child. It's not fair that others on this site are in turmoil, desperate for access to their children and yet he who has it on a plate fcuks up.



It's the likes of him that ruin it for others.



I'd be inclined to drop all contact and wait until he comes crawling.Then state your terms.



My cousin had to go through the same scenario  were the Dad was so unreliable that when he did take the child out , the child would scream hysterically and not want to go with a 'stranger'. She stopped access because of the effect on her child. It went to court. An order was granted. He never , not ONCE kept to it.

No, it bloody wouldn't be unreasonable. HE is the one that's being unreasonable!! You've given him every chance and he's not being fair to your wee boy. As you say, the wee one needs stability. Send him the text by all means - but I would also send him a letter by Recorded Delivery, stating the same.  By sending it Recorded Delivery, the letter has to be signed for, so no excuses. Also, make sure you keep a copy yourself. If he doesn't want to keep in contact with the child, go to your lawyer and make it legal. Good luck.

You could send the message but 6 months from now he may have you in court for access rights. I am not saying you would let it get that far. It is difficult. I would get on with your life & if he does contact you to see Fin make sure it is on your terms. It seems at the moment you are doing all the chasing. It is all on his terms but he is the one that does not care. The bottom line really is what is best for you & your son not what is best for his absence farther.



Edit:- Send the text if you think it is the right thing for your son. At least if your son asks you at a latter date did you try everything to contact my farther then you can hold your head up & say yes I made the effort.

Unreasonable no but unfortunately you will have no say how he decides to mess you and your son about in the future. He has proved where his priorities lie and it seems your son isn't even an after thought. The only way to settle this is by taking legal action so that whatever the outcome he can't just come and go as he pleases and you will have evidence of how you tried to build a relationship for your son with his father. The citizens advice should be able to guide you and any decent solicitor would be willing to write a letter but you need support with this. You and you son deserve much better than this and for what it's worth you are well rid.

because these days there are so many irresponsible dads around that are so selfish, it is best if you save your energy for you and your son, and he will come around some day if you just leave him to realize that it is his loss.



My daughters dad was the same and when I kept asking him to take more responsibility he just became vain and thought that I was running after him, my male family members were doing their best to not let her feel that she didn't have a father figure in her life, then he kept begging to be a part of her life.

One of the hardest lessons I had to learn was that you cannot turn a man into a good father.  It doesn't work.  and although the courts will force you to let him see his child, they don't force him to visit, if he doesn't want to.
I would stand back, and not get so emotional about it, hard as that is.  Let him come and go, and encourage your son to treat the relationship as a light hearted one, and not as a deep, meaningful one.
It is a waste, but it is better for your son to have a little bit of a relationship than not one at all, or one in which there is recrimination and arguing.
Let go, step back.  One day your son will be taller than his father and will look him in the eye and ask the same questions you have just asked.  And it will be too late - your ex will have lost all those wonderful, vital years.

No it's not unreasonable at all. You have given him plenty of chances and opportunities to see Finn but now you have to stop trying to force it.



trust me, you will get yourself so upset over it all it's not worth it. The most painful thing I ever saw was my 3 packed and ready to go to daddys, sat in the hallway  waiting for him to pick them up to go the 300 miles to his house. He never showed.
They waited 5 hours until they gave up.
No phone call, no explanation, nothing. Bastard.



You have had some excellent answers here, I hope you make the right decision for you and Finn.

Remember that, whatever you decide to do, you will be answerable to your son one day.



Although his dad is a bit of a deadbeat, it may still be in your son's interests to retain some contact.  It's rarely useful to stop this completely.  Perhaps negotiation is the key here?  If the boy's dad finds it so hard to keep to the commitment he makes, why not make it, say, once every two months?  It's not a lot, but it's some contact and it may be easier for the dad to adhere to.  You could agree a system whereby you text him a reminder a week beforehand.



Alternatively, it may be better to keep contact very casual so that your son doesn't get his hopes up.  This will be inconvenient for you at times, but if it keeps your son in touch with his dad it's worth it.  It may mean that his dad contacts you and asks to see his son, say, in the next day or so.  A pain and unreasonable, yes, but worth it.



Let the boy's dad be the one to formally withdraw contact so that you can't have it held against you in the future.  Keep any communications from him in case he lies about what happened when his son challenges him when he's older.



I know that dads like this are irresponsible, selfish and annoying, but most kids treasure contact with both parents and are surprisingly forgiving when they're little, so I wouldn't end all contact.

Kat, i feel for you. Stay strong girl. Finn is still tiny...and from what i know you are both Mum & Dad to him. Keep it that way. Don't push for his Dad meeting him. Let the space be. Explain in baby words to Finn about different families. Let him know that some Dads like his, love their babies but still have to learn how to show it. Keep it short. Just so he knows hes loved but knows that as long as he has you and his brother and the family that is contact with him, his world is complete. Don't set up meetings...only you & smallies will be dissappointed. Like you say, let the decision come from the Dad...in his time, if he wants it. If it doesn't happen Kat, honestly, you 3 are better off without it...If it does, its a bonus. The main thing is that Finn knows that he is loved and you will be a constant in his life. Kids are resilient...he will understand. Just make sure you shower him with all the love & attention he needs so hes secure with you. Then  he won't need anybody else. xxx

I wouldn't be rushing to burn the communication bridge quite yet in spite of your ex's poor behavior.  You don't mention your little boy's age which is an important consideration in this situation.



I would recommend sending a registered letter (keep a copy) to your ex in which you outline your concerns without threatening him.  Men don't respond well to these threats, they just disappear.



My children's father did a geographic years ago and that certainly didn't solve any problems, it made them worse.  Take some more time and move on with your own life which is the best thing you can do for your son.



Incidentally, men freak if you change gears on them and stop communicating when they are used to being harangued all the time.

I would like to say that you trying contact him is too much effort on your part. Usually with unstable parents, you should take the attitude that he should call you if he wants to see his child. It's less frustration on your part, and less pressure for him (yes, deep down I think he feels bad about not being with his child, and his guilty conscience is kicking his bum).
I have gone threw this myself and with stepchildren. In my case, I used to just plan my activities for the week/ month/ year, and when he called to see them I either told him he could because I did not have plans, or he could not, because I had already a full schedule. If he is not agreeing and sticking to regular visitation, that's what he got (he's out of the picture now).
In my step-children's case, their Dad was a bit more lenient, he would change plans when she called (once a month or every other month), but the effect was the same as it was in my case, she slowly faded herself out of the picture.
I suggest ultimatums just gets tempers flaring and might get him to act right, but only short term. Let it be up to him to end contact; just protect yourself and stop bugging him.
You might want to get a consultation with a lawyer to see what your state law considers abandonment and what your right is as far as refusing contact . Most states would count it against you if you refuse to give him visitation (unless there is evidence that he is physically harming or neglecting your son when he is with him), but don't require you to actively seek it.
if you have an active custody agreement filed with the court and he violates it (by not showing) that could be considered abandonment. So, if you don't have one, you need to get one, for your protection.
i know this is a lot of info, sorry! Good luck!

It's a tough one. Send the message, and then as the sensible parent just get on with your life. Don't expect anything from your sons dad, he's not responsible. One day, he probably will want to see his son. It may be next week, next year or ten years from now, but as he's your son's dad you should allow him to see him. Just make sure the terms suit you and you don't go changing your arangements to suit him.

With the limited " one perspective" information provided..... it is difficult to judge BUT I would not send the message.... it will not produce the results you and your son want



FIRST Because you are threatening a consequence you can not enforce.... if he decides to see his son .....you can not stop him..... he will "win" again
SECOND This appears to be a battle of wills.....you tell him he will.....he is telling you (indirectly) he wont..... you can not.....without a lot of legal hassle.....impose your will upon him.... you are wasting your time trying to make him do the right thing



THIRD This war is "injuring" your son...... broken promises..... disappointments..... he may even blame himself for you both fighting



MY ADVISE..... Forget "Dad" (?) or expecting him to do right.... build a new loving life with your son.....quit expecting anything from "Dad"(?)
Do not share your anger or disappointment with your son.... Do not contact or expect anything from your ex-......



He knows what is right.....he knows he is wrong.... but each time he defies you; he wins..... use reverse psychology..... expect nothing..... ask for nothing.....

I don't think ultimatums ever work.  It will just give him a reason to feel aggrieved at your, in his eyes, unreasonable behaviour and he will be telling anyone who cares to listen what a cold b!tch you are to cut him off from his son.  I'm not saying he's right, but I'm guessing that's what he will do and I doubt you want that.



There's not a lot you can do really.  You've found yourself in a very difficult position by having a child (I thought you had two?) with a man who was not committed to you or your family and the best course of action is to just wait it out and live your life the way you want to.



Don't give him your time and energy and remember that success is the best revenge.

My parents got divorced when I was 6 months. Father was unstable and always in and out, much like what you described. My father didn't put much effort to be stable, but when he did I appreciated it, even as a young child. If he came around he would take me and my sister to the Zoo, or Great America, and then we wouldn't hear from him for months, sometimes years. My mother was always very angry with him, she cried a lot and I know she went through hell because of him. But I am thankful that she never told him he wasn't allowed to see us (unless he was using again). Had there been a time that he was sober and wanted to see us and she forbade it, I would be resentful toward her. Epically since you have a boy, that's something he's going to need is his father in his life, he may resent you later if you don't allow his father to contact him.



I'm now 19, and my father got out of prison for the 2nd time last year, and I'm trying to keep in touch with him. We live in the same city, and I see him maybe once a month, but he seems to be doing better now that my sister and I are both over 18.

How likely is it that if I give my bank £50,000, Gordon Brown will guarantee it's safety?



Well firstly it ain't likely as I don't quite have £50,000 to spare.



I am talking about this 'promise' he has made to up the guarantee on savings held with British banks from the current FSA threshold of £35,000.



Does this help, and is it likely? Surely the potential liability to the government is colossal?

Your money is extremely likely to be safe.  Even without raising the threshold, no one in the UK has lost a penny of savings as a result of the banking crisis.



A guarantee of £50,000 is realistic and would have a reassuring effect which should mean the need to rely on it becomes even more remote.



If the UK government were to say it guaranteed 100% of all bank deposits, that would not be plausible so might well have less benefit overall than a £50,000 guarantee.

The ceiling will be raised by the FSA to £50,000, by the end of next week.



It's a guarantee to bring back some confidence and stop people taking deposits out of banks.  If it helps restore confidence, then it is a good thing and will not cost anything to the taxpayer.  The cost of doing nothing is potentially far higher, if liquidity dries up and the recession deepens.

The operative word being ' promise '.



Lets just say they do implement this ..the government are then seen to be doing something worthwhile and 'reassuring'.



But if it goes t*ts up and they can't honour that what does it matter to them? If they can't pay they can't pay..it will not 'guarantee' your moneys safety. Whereas they for however brief a time look like they are doing something credible.



If something so catastrophic happens that they can't pay they will be out on their ears anyway so in reality the government are onto a win/win and the public are taking all the chances...

I suspect he is in a daze because of the global financial chaos. Whether anyone can deal with a mess that affects a substantial proportion of the population is open to dispute and I firmly believe that David Cameron would not wish to take over the reins just now. Brown's problem is that he looks totally dejected and disenchanted with his problems. He seems to go into his shell and he lacks firm leadership qualities. His ministers also lack resolve and provide little support.
He knows that he lost control when he was Chancellor and has stoked a financial fire he cannot extinguish.

Bad in what way?



A bad father?  Don't know.



A bad tennis player?  Don't care.



A bad prime minister?  Depends - much of what is going on is beyond his control whereas he at least has the background and confidence to know how to deal with it calmly and constructively.
A bad leader? Certainly not a charismatic leader.  Probably not a leader who might appeal to a soap-opera loving reality TV viewer or to a right-wing extremist.  If you like your leaders loud and in-your-face, he is not the man.



For me, his biggest failing is that he has to rely on the advice of 'high-flier' civil servants who are no better than the 'high-flier' bankers who have screwed us all so badly.  The dishonesty of the retrospective application of higher car tax of cars bought since 2001 was the killer.  He may be unexciting, but I always thought he was honest.



As it happens, I thought John Major was OK too.  Another leader who appealed to the intellect rather than the emotions.

I will stop short of saying he should have fallen in with the crocodile when he climbed onto the fence.  Frankly, if I were his parent, I would not want to be around him any longer.

not to mention she brutally massacres wildlife animals, proposed paying a $150 bounty for the severed left foreleg of each dead wolf, hates polar bears and beluga whales. Yet she's so pro-life, she'd make a pregnant victim have the child of a rapist, and she's ever so against (omfg ) stem cell research??



am i the only one who thinks shes nuts, and a walking contradiction??



what are your thoughts...

Pro-lifers have a wierd affinity with Death penalty supporters.  I think the idea is that while 'every sperm is sacred' and innocent, adult human life is disposable and sinful.  I don't really get it.

its funny how much they care about life up until birth...they don't care about children's health care or education



they don't even care when they send these young people to go off to fight and die in illegal wars



so a cluster of cells with no mind or even any sort of nervous system is precious but a fully grown adult with all of those and family etc is unimportant

I've always found it ironic how so many of the pro-life supporters spout out it's murder to kill.  Yet they would be  the first to stick either a sterilized or un-sterilized needle into a condemned mans arm.
In my opinion, she's one taco shy of the combination plate.

What's so sad about the so-called pro-lifers in the US is that in reality they're a bunch of contrarians. That is, they'll contradict you for the sake of it.



They certainly don't seem to have thought through their arguments and the poster of this Y/A question makes a good observation about that.
What makes this whole thing so frustrating is that they'll use the disagreement to then label you as a less caring human being, as a lesser American, as someone who shouldn't be trusted.



You can see the same thing with their argument against evolution, instead of treating it like another one of God's wonders they use the argument to show you they're more religious than you and therefore a more "moral" person and all that.



It takes a lot of bitterness and anger to do something like that and for the life of me I don't understand where all this anger and bitterness comes from.



Pro-lifers behave as if they've been wronged and it is this kind of people who like the crazies in groups like Al Qaeda are the most abnoxious and dangerous in any society. People who are willing to go out of their way to either create obstacles in the life of others or just get rid of you becuase they really think they've been victimized by the larger society.



They're very defensive and hysterical to be able to have a civilized talk and, like I said, they'll contradict you for the sake of it just to prove to you how much you hate them.

I agree the rapist should be killed..... but what exactly did the baby do to deserve a death sentence?



If you would do some research you would find WHY she put a bounty on wolves..... An over population of wolves was destroying the caribou herds..... no caribou means eskimo babies starve..... her efforts were "conservation' not carnage......and she has never advocated whale slaughter..... in some areas bears were a threat to the salmon runs.....salmon is needed to feed eskimos also

How does someone not know where they 7 year old is?  I admit it is kind of funny.  http://www.wave3.com/global/story.asp?s=...



SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - Zoo officials in Australia are planning to sue the parents of a 7-year-old boy who broke into a popular Outback zoo and fed animals to a giant crocodile.



Zoo director Rex Neindorf says the boy jumped a security fence, then went on a 30-minute killing spree, bashing several lizards to death with a rock and feeding them to a 440-pound saltwater crocodile. The boy also threw several live animals over the fences surrounding the crocodile's enclosure.



Neindorf says on the zoo's security camera, the boy's face remains largely blank, "like he was playing a game."



The 13 animals killed are worth more than $5,000. Police say they're unable to press charges because of the boy's age.

Start a conversation with them, its hilarious!
I told them that unfortunately I was on holiday when the presentation is (even though they don't give you a date) and could they send me a cheque instead.



Then they carried on trying to convince me and finally told me I wasn't taking them seriously and should send me the details they want so they can pay me. I came to the conclusion the amusement I had was worth more than the 1.5 million dollars they offered me!

Yes.. Seems as if she had every line memorized and she was reciting something straight off the index cards.  Come on "Failin"  were you afraid that you would forget everything you learned that's why you kept looking straight during every talking point.  And why did you keep going back to energy on every question when the question was obviously not about that.  I will give her this though.  She did memorize enough to redeem her bad name during the Katie Couric interview.  She didn't sound light the "undercover blond" that she seems to be.

SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - Zoo officials in Australia are planning to sue the parents of a 7-year-old boy who broke into a popular Outback zoo and fed animals to a giant crocodile.



Zoo director Rex Neindorf says the boy jumped a security fence, then went on a 30-minute killing spree, bashing several lizards to death with a rock and feeding them to a 440-pound saltwater crocodile. The boy also threw several live animals over the fences surrounding the crocodile's enclosure.



Neindorf says on the zoo's security camera, the boy's face remains largely blank, "like he was playing a game."



The 13 animals killed are worth more than $5,000. Police say they're unable to press charges because of the boy's age.

Frankly, both sides are idiots.
It's tit for tat attacks backwards and forwards.
It's East vs West.
And Depending on if the US are terrorists only is determined by what side your on. If you are with Al-Qaeda, then the US are terrorists whilst Al-Qaeda are freedom fighters. Otherwise it's Al-Qaeda are terrorists and the US are counter-terrorists.



The War on Terror will never really be accomplished (much like the US War on Drugs) It's just a political label so that the US citizens believe the government are doing something. This benefits the government by investing in military and allows legislation to change regarding the investigation of suspects.



All in all, the label terrorism is one that does not have a universal meaning and is basically only used to stigmatize and prosecute people.

you lot of obviosly never been to Hull in England- bring back the cane. im 21 now but the kids at my school would punch teachers in the face knowing they couldn't lay a finger on them. Parents here have no control of their kids why should teachers have to deal with that.
You only get the cane when bad so don't be bad its easy enough.

I completely disagree, why can't normal punishment be brought back, like letting us as parents properly discipline our children. The Social Services seem to leave those children who are at great risk with the parents and persecute those who may have slapped their child once and its been reported by a busy body. My hands are tied when it comes to my children, we can't smack their bottoms, what happened to a child biting their parent and you biting them back? Or them pinching and you pinching them back? My eldest daughter was brought up under strict rules, you hit, you get hit back (not hard!! on the hand or bottocks) she bit me once and i bit her back, she is the most adorable 8 year old ever now, and would never be spiteful, she has manners and is curteous, whereas my 4 year old is going to be a tearaway.



We need to sort out what happens in home before any kind of punishment is unleashed in schools... why should teachers be able to discipline our children, we should be bringing them up correctly ourselves. (Sorry for the rant)

Teachers wouldn't need to bring back the cane if there was a basic respect for them from their pupils , you hear so many reports of teachers being beaten up , or stabbed cause they have tried to show children some authority , I don't think the cane is right but i do think teachers have a rough time of it , and they should have the ability to do something about unruly children

Anyone really believe this bailout/rescue will fix the problem?



my thoughts...
...D''oh!...
Come on peeps we all knew it would never work...
Think back, why were people buying up fancy cars and second homes? because the value of their first home skyrocketed, so they refinanced used the equity in their homes to go buy all those fancy toys...
now that market has crashed the moneys dried up. homeowners are stuck with a 400k loan and a house worth around 150k.



just because you free up credit people will still walk away which makes perfect economic sense to a struggling family! They already took the money now its time to run!
Fund managers are already looking to foreign markets to invest our tax dollars in, and for good reason. we make nothing in our country, wages are a joke when compared to cost of living.the line between rich and poor grows wider everyday. Forget middle-class even they find themselves bordering on working poor or about to join the ranks of the jobless!



Lets say you pass this bill? how long will it take the market to turn around, 3, 4 months? Half a year is more likely, in which time we lose another 2 million homes to forecloses. Come on  lets be realistic here this proposal fixes noting, not in time at least!

I think it'll fix things in the short run.  But if you think about it, the long term affects are much worse than the short term affects.  The people who are middle aged (30's and 40's) won't have to worry about much for a while, but the young people will be paying off this debt for the rest of their lives.  So will their children's childrens.  Bush really screwed us over.

So then get a bank account that offers free checking without direct deposit and don't over draw your account.. I've never been charged a fee from my bank for anything. I use Bank of America.

He plays the card as a humble man who lost his wife and has suffored major setbacks in his life, rides a train home to Delaware every night, etc, but when it comes down to his core, he's just another pompous *** windbag. Check his tax returns, he's a millionaire many times over and how much of his income does he donate to charity? About $2500 per year. I know people who make $40k a year and donate more than that. He tries to paint a picture of someone you'd want to talk to, but he views people who aren't like him as beneath him. He's proven that so many times with what he says and then has to retract because he offends people almost every time he opens his mouth.  For the record, I'm not voting for Obama but I'm not the hugest fan of McCain either. It comes down to tax policy for me and what will stimulate the economy and not stifle it, so McCain gets the nod on both issues.

Have you ever been scared that someone could be planning to blow up the place that you are visitng? If yes, then you have felt the terrorism.



If no, then let me explain: It happens every day in Israel, people get up everyday and are not sure if they will be back, it was the feeling in NYC for Days after Sept 11 - everyone was living in horror. THAT was terrorism.



Chinese people are terrorized by their government, same as in North Korea, in Sudan and Ethipy; they are terrorized by their own governments every day.



It happens in many parts of the world every day.



Now, did you really ask that question? Or possibly you want to open a discussion.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Yes the question was posed with the intention of opening up people's fears about a/terrorism and b/conspiracy theory. I was brought up in 80's Scotland, where the IRA had a strong following. I grew up with real terrorism. I still think the US Government is full of liars. The CIA are terrorists.

Should all drugs be legalised?



7 out of 10 people in prison are there for drugs offences
those who get out find getting a job difficult with a criminal conviction



legalising drugs would provide employment and tax money instead of now where drugs pay for gangs, people trafficking and terrorism.



it would also free up the police to investigate real crimes, if people are going to take drugs then thats their choice, even though they are currently illegal its very easy to get any drug you want.



so should drugs be legalised?

Remember what happened during prohibition? Crime, violent crime rose. People were gunned down in the streets, massacred in clubs, and gangs ruled whole areas. People in the country were making it in the woods behind their homes, in their basements, and sometimes in their bathrooms. People died from explosions, and the wrong mixture of ingredients.



Sound familiar?



Why are we being saved from ourselves? We can't legislate human vice. We've fought the war on drugs for decades and have only succeeded in spending too much money on something that's never going to happen.



If a woman has a choice on what to do with her body why can't all humans have the same choice?



Legalize all drugs, monitor it, tax it, create jobs and revenue! That will give organized crime and gangs one less thing to fight about.

Some should I think, But the problem is that people do things to the extreme. If drugs were legalized, then more people would be trying them and more people would be addicted to them and more people would end up dying because of them themselves or killing others because of them.



Alcohol and tobacco products are legalized and provide a good tax revenue, but how many people die each year or become addicted to alcohol and tobacco products?



How many die from cancer or liver damage or other diseases and sicknesses related to those legalized products? Way too many.



It's unfortunate because some people can control themselves and act intelligently and safely and take things in moderation. It's the one's who can't control themselves and don't act intelligently or safe that ruin it for the rest of us and make it dangerous to all of us.

this is usually a argument raised by users drug addition is high and there have been arguments and studies such as in amsterdam where the drugs were legalised.



The crime rate etc was just as high and also there is still prostitution and gangs and still the "black" market just as there is with gambling.



It may be easy to get the drugs however will it change or will everyone just be off their nut if they are legal.



However i can see your argument about people entering the "justice" system by simple possession.  There have been certain areas where it has been decriminalised.

Well, if it is the question of space in prison and money for police I say lets do away with all laws and that way we wouldn't have to have ANY jails or prisons, no tax dollars need to be spent on police forces and you could prove your grit by being responsible for your own families safety.



The argument for legalizing drugs is nothing more than a cry from users to decriminalize THEIR habit.



Same for any abusive crime, they want their personal habit legalized and Damn the public.

I think its obvious the present drug law is not working.



Drugs is the major cause of crime in this country, druggies stealing to fund a habit.



My gut reaction is to make the laws stricter, Life sentences for drug dealers, 3 strikes and you are out for addicts. Offer two chances of good treatment, if that fails, third time lock them up and throw away the key.



The other option as you suggest is decriminalisation. Studies have shown that some addicts can function on drugs like heroin, but what message are we giving to kids. OK we might take the drug trade out of the hands of criminals but in the eyes of many we would be 'legitimising' drugs.



I don't think either way would make much difference but if I had to choose I would go for clamping down very hard on drug dealers and users.

This is also a question that also relates to prostitution, legalise it and it become a productive and taxable occupation. For me personally I would say yes for both but having said that my life is touched by neither so really my opinion is only based on the fact that I am a tax payer.

I hope this is a sad attempt at humor.Drugs legal or not,will still fry your brain.Do you know how many people I see walking around just plain burned out from drug usage?Yeah sure let's go ahead and legalize them,so the neighbors can have meth labs in their houses.You ever hear about meth labs blowing up?Yep it happens more than you care to let on.Innocent people have gotten hurt thanks to idiot neighbors attempting to make meth in their houses,which are usually rental properties,so hey if the house blows up they don't care as it's not theirs anyway.There's a reason that they're illegal and well that's one of them.Another reason they are illegal is because the government is tired of having it's resources and money used up because yet another person ends up in a mental hospital because someone over-dosed on acid or something, burned their brains out and has turned into a loon,and can't afford the mental hospital.Hurting theirselves or others,seeing or hearing things that don't exist,and being in a world all their own.Maybe there's a good reason that 7 out of 10 people are in prison due to drugs.Once they get out of prison,maybe there's a good reason they have a hard time finding a job.You know not too many employers want a druggie hanging around the job place for fear of them having a relapse.How do you prove to an employer that your not at risk for a relapse?Kind of hard to do seeing as though you were tempted once before.As far as you saying that it's easy to get any drug you want,well I'm sure it is.But these people have to also remember that it's not a matter of if but when they get caught.You can only get away with that for so long,one mistake and that's it.As you can tell,I truly truly hate drugs and people that have to use them just to get through life,well they have bigger problems and are just trying to cover them up with a temporary solution.So no drugs should NOT be legalized.

To answer your question, "do I like the people in the US Congress"? The answer is yes and no. I abhor those in Congress that don't have the people of this country as their priority when passing legislation on either side of the isle. The very reason they are in Congress in the first place is to serve the people. It was the people who elected them, and it is the people they are there to serve. Anyone who voted for the FISA BILL, BAIL-OUT BILL, PUBLIC SPYING BILL, THE WAR IN IRAQ/AFGHANISTAN etc. ...should be voted out of office this year. If we, the people, don't clean house with this election...then we deserve every lousy politician that eventually gets there! We all need to VOTE!

Is A Global Government Is A Good Idea?



Since both presidential candidates are members of the CFR, (Council on Foreign Relations) which is an organization hell-bent on globalizing, I guess we better start getting used to being on our way towards  one world government. First they're unionizing the continents. Started with Europe, next is the North American Union and so on and eventually the CFR's open plan is to combine them into one country. Does this sound like a good idea or do you think Hitler would be proud?

SHAME ON AUSTRALIAN TICKETEK?



I fully understand that there will be difficulties and problems when a popular concert goes on sale but fairs fair why should people have to pay super dollars to have a broadband service that is faster than the speed of light. You must have a fast computer and super fast internet to purchase tickets or too bad for you. What a farce they have a billion dollar monopoly in ticket sales and they cannot provide a service that actually works. I had 2 tickets to the PINK concert that were fantastic seats, went through the entire process provided all credit card details and submitted to them while waiting for it to finish they booted me from the system hence cancelling the tickets. On speaking with them hours later because their phone was engaged forever, I was told that it was not thier fault that I did not have a computer fast enough or an internet service provider that is capable of running efficiently (sorry optus apparantly your broadband service is crap) and too bad. Why can they not take responsibility for their own short comings and blame everyone else for their lack of quality service. Shame on you ticketek pick up your act or hopefully someone else will come in and take over the ticket sales business that will be more customer focused!

Does anyone else hear the booming that is going on near the DFW airport?



It is a really low frequency and is causing the ground to shake.  It's almost like an earthquake...but only one boom at a time.  The Euless Police admitted that they are being flooded with calls, but no one knows what it is.  I really hope it is not the natural gas drilling.  (It sounds a little bit like the creature from Cloverfield when it was walking.)

no hes not this is the end times and he may be president when the antichrist comes to power but their are many specific facts about the antichrist that rule out obama the most obvious and publicly known of which is that the antichrist will be born or come from Eastern or southern Europe

truthfully religion is manmade and has too many flaws. it was made to keep people from doing bad things by making them think if they are good people they will go and have a good afterlife and if they are bad they will have an eternally bad afterlife. so an antichrist president wouldnt work simply because if people knew about this info the world would go crazy. if u wanna try and argue email it to me and ill rip u to shreds verbally

Well, let me think about some of the stuff Christ did--



He could walk on water.  Well, if Obama tried to walk on water, he would sink.



He made a blind man see.  Hmm, even Obama's healthcare system can't solve that one.



He's the son of G-d.  Uh oh!  Obama's not the son of G-d either.



I guess he MUST be the antichrist.



Wait a minute, just like Christ was crucified, and Obama gets crucified by political pundits every day.  Christ came back to life, and as the polls say, so did Obama.



This is a tough call.

They say the Antistchrist is going to come like this charming man.. He'll be kind, respectful. and also powerful.. At 1st i thought Bush was Antichrist..But people around me start to wonder about OBAMA.. Yeah i'am going to vote for him, I guess cause he's gonna help us middle class folks... But what his cute smile becomes a raging frown?.. The antichrist will come in fine and dandy, and leave out in chaos.  What if things go so good if OBAMA become president that it'll go bad.. Because no matter what u have to make trades, wars, and exchanges..

LOL he does seem to fit some people's idea of the Antichrist: the almost perfect human who leads the people to perdition.
But no, he's not.  His intentions are good, he even has some kind of faith in Christ, it seems.  I don't think he's faking it, even though he doesn't seem to make sense.



Only his followers (and not all of them) think he has such transcendent importance.

How bad is Royal Mail`s cutomer care line?



I have a parcel missing in the system, I went to call my local office but Royal Mail have removed all the local numbers from the phone book. I had to go into their national system. 10 minutes later i finally get someone, by now seething with rage I tell her the system is a disgrace and that the local numbers should be in  the phonebook. She asks what my complaint is and when I tell her that I want  to speak to my local office but can`t because Royal Mail have messed up looking after their customers I get cut off. I phone again and after 5 minutes I get another girl who apologises for my problem and gives me the phone number of my local office. I phone local office and inside 1 minute the boy tells me my parcel is at the local office and he is sorry I didn`t get a card.  So 20 minutes wasted in a queue listening to options I have no interest in and awful lift music when a simple phone call to the people that actually know how the job works resolved my query inside a minute. Well done Adam Crozier and Allan Leighton, have a star for messing about your customers!

The only way this would benefit our small business is that it will support  some of our customers which are also small businesses.  We are a well capitalized business (dare I say we say this coming) so we have made plans to ride out any down turn but some of our customers sail closer to the wind so yes indirectly we will benefit.

It's stupid posturing! Too little and too late! Whatever he does now will not affect job losses - unless of course he's actively going to pay employers to keep people working where there isn't actually enough work. You said it, the building industry, not in decline but in absolute free- fall! Small builder businesses all over the country have laid their staff off - there's no work, no sub-contracting to the big boys either, that's gone! Glaziers, roofers, joiners, landscapers, scaffolders, painters, plumbers - thousands of them now out of work and two years ago you had to wait god knows how long to get anyone to come and do a job for you! Brown bears the responsibility for a lot of this, Darling came late in the day and neither of them can fix it by borrowing yet more money and spending it on what? Another raft of costly investigations which will lead precisely no-where! Fortunately we sold our family business eighteen months ago to an Irish Plc. Today it would be worth around 30% of what we got for it. Merchants and independant showrooms are all cutting back or closing down.

Did Nazism borrow its ideas from Islam?



I really hope I am not offending anyones religion with this question. I am not attacking anyones belief neither. But I studyed Nazism whilst at school and even recently heard about Islam from Muslim friends and even read parts of the Quran.



I became interested in reading the Koran from a muslim friend. It began beautifully, however as the chapters progressed it became more darker, more militant and more anti Semitic. I stopped reading and explained to my friend too as why.



I almost felt sick. It was like reading the Nazi bible "mein kampf" which also talks about making expanding wars, and persecuting races namely j5ws. Also the abhorrent reference to "apes and pigs" etc...



So my question did Adolf Hitler borrow ideas from the Muslims to create his vile ideology and do the present day Muslims also support his ideas too? just look at the present media articles and statements made by prominent Muslims



Any views by people on this?

Thai Green Curry with Beef
This Green Curry recipe features beef but could also be prepared with chicken, pork or fish. If sweet basil leaves are not available, you may substitute European basil, or leave it out altogether. You can serve this dish accompanied with a cooling soup, like Glass Noodle Soup (Gaeng Joot), stir-fry or steamed vegetables, and of course steamed jasmine rice.



Ingredients
400 grams beef (a little less then 1lb.)



3 tbsp green curry paste (see green curry paste recipe or use prepared curry paste)



2 1/2 cups coconut milk (1 1/2 cans Chaokoh brand coconut milk or squeezed out from 400 grams grated fresh coconut)



5 small fresh Thai eggplants, quartered



2-3 fresh red spur chilies, sliced diagonally



2 kaffir lime leaves, torn



1/4 cup sweet basil leaf (optional)



1 1/2 tbsp fish sauce



1 1/2 tsp palm sugar



1 tbsp cooking oil (not olive oil, but corn, safflower or peanut oil)



Sweet basil leaves and red chili slices for garnish



Preparation



Slice the beef into thin pieces, about about 1/3" (3 cm) thick.



Saute the green curry paste in oil over medium heat until fragrant, reduce the heat, gradually add 1 1/2 cups of the coconut milk a little at a time, stir until a film of green oil surfaces.



Add the beef and kaffir lime leaves, continue cooking for 3 minutes until fragrant and the beef is cooked through. Transfer to a pot, place over medium heat and cook until boiling. Add the remaining coconut milk, season with palm sugar and fish sauce. When the mixture returns to the boil add the eggplants. Cook until the eggplants are done, sprinkle sweet basil leaves and red chilies over, then turn off the heat.



Arrange on a serving dish and garnish with sweet basil leaves and red chilies before serving.



Enjoy!

How everyone laughed along because George Best and Oliver Reed were just drunks who were being a bit of a "rogue."



The reaction to Kerry Katona has been quite different. She´s been absolutely slated with people seeming to enjoy her obvious problems.



Complete double standards.
I think this interview was disturbing and sad at the same time. Yes ...she´s an annoying divvy but she´s a young girl who  needs help.

It's racist to infer that being muslim is a problem (if you're using racism as a blanket term for prejudice in general, as most people do.)



Bringing up the accusation he's muslim automatically infers it's relevant, which it isn't (but it would be relevent to one who thinks muslims aren't fit to lead a country because of their religious affiliation)



It's a fact Obama isn't a muslim, if you seek to fact-check your sources that say otherwise you will be most likely pleasantly surprised.



In regard to the additional details... the pictures of him in a turban have a legitimate explanation if you ever decide to seek it.

First of all, Obama was NOT muslim, he never associated with terrorists, and most of the rumors about him are just that--rumors.
And as for the muslim thing...when McCain shot down that rumor, he said 'Obama is not a muslim. He is a god-fearing man.' That was horrible against muslims! They ARE god-fearing. Being a muslim is just like being any other religion. And so McCain, while defending Obama, was showing prejudice against muslims. My stepmother's family is muslim, by the way.

When you see a wave coming towards shore, you can predict that it will keep rolling till it fades on the sand.  When you place a tasty bit of food in your mouth you can predict that you will swallow it and down it goes to your stomach.  One prediction is based on knowing the laws of the world and the other from knowing yourself.  Events are interactions, and predictability, that is, a fairly reliable one, depends on the knowledge held about what has previously occurred, and also on the understanding of how things work.



We can predict where the moon will be in the sky centuries from now because we know that the moon is affected by the laws elaborated by Newton, laws based on insight and statistics.  If we did not apply these laws, then we would only be guessing.  Predictions that are based on past behaviours and on evidence presently known, are not the same as certainties, but they have a better record than guesses do.  Guesses are wild stabs, that may be right, but have not been researched or reasoned out.



Predictions are reasonings from prior realities (or should be).  A prediction that you doubt, is not a prediction, it is a 'maybe'.  The worth of a prediction lies in its links to reality and to known past happenings.



Astounding predictions that are based on the opinion of a person or non-scientific book, are not necessarily predictions but may be Prophesies.  For the multitude of prophesies that have been recorded throughout time, their record of correctness has been rather poor.  It is often only after a prophesy seems not to have eventuated, that a dispute arises by the originators or backers of the prophesy, as to what the prophesy actually meant to say.  Predictions, although maybe not very detailed, should be clear enough to be able to later determine whether or not they actually did occur, without a dispute muddying the waters.



Future events many not have happened as yet, however, the events leading up to them have happened and are happening now.  The scientific laws that govern certain events are only known by their presence in the past and by their validity right now.  Therefore, any event dependent on such laws is not a separate thing but simply a continuity, a convergence of all that is before its time.



Predictions are not meant to be certainties because there are other equally valid events or entities that may interfere with what may be reasonably expected.  A submarine may fire a torpedo at a ship but the torpedo may malfunction.  The known statistics on malfunctions of whatever is utilised, item and environment, can be used to gauge the Probability of a hit.  If a whale gets in the way of the torpedo then that is an example of an unexpected interference.  We can only hope that what we do is for the best to make an event occur, and know that there are others, such as the passengers on the ship, who hope otherwise.



We know and can in some ways predict the future, because any future is not its own master but depends up all that precedes it.  The Future is Especially dependent on the present events that immediately precede it in the 'now'.  If you want to change the Future you simply need to change the Now that activates it (activists please note).

SUE SUE SUE.  The courier has proven to be negligent in the delivery of your parcel in a timely manner and should pay.  The damage caused by this company's faulty system could cause irrepairable damage to you as an individual and your faith in the parcel services.  Your have been betrayed and need to be paid.  How can you trust humans in general anymore after this tragic disregard for your needs.



Also, sue the vendor of the product, they were fallable in  sensitizing themselves to a valuable patron like you.  They expect to hold on to your money and gain interest from it while you wait for a delivery?  If you let them get away with this...whats next.  You need to make an example of these sleazy corporate giants and crush them in a court of law. This emotional stress should not be endured by any human.

Did Biden say that the U.S. will be attacked when Obama is elected to say that the media/american influence will not criticize Obama when something will happen? They know allot more than we do about U.S. intelligence of foreign threats to the U.S., and he therefore is trying to cover the track when Obama does not instill world peace with the U.S. at the helm?

He didn't exactly say it would be an attack, but promised that there would be an "international crisis", generated to test Obama. I think it's odd that he made a statement like that, and seems very certain of his words, and that no one else is really addressing it.

You obviously know very little about Sarah Palin---not even how to spell her name.



If you look into it, you will find her statement about the Senate was absolutely true, and she did NOT say she would control it.



The far-left media hates Sarah Palin, as does the Obama camp, because they know at least half of Americans love Sarah Palin. She has the highest approval rating of any governor in the U.S. (around 85% rating). Also the office of governor in Alaska carries more responsibility that many other states.



If the media would put Biden under the same microscope they have placed Palin under, you'd hear comments on some of the idiodic statements he has made, such as "Bosniacs". There isn't room here to list all of his blunders. The one mentioned comes from the VP debate, televised on most major networks.

I can not believe, she does not know what the job of a Vice President is.  That is the first thing, she should have been given some notes on.



I guess the McCain Camp thought she would have at the very least looked it up by now and found out what the job of a Vice President entails.  Sarah Palin,  should not say not one more thing about of that mouth of hers' everytime she does she sticks her foot in it.

Do you think that the USA will expand the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to include Syria and Pakistan?



The USA has been launching varying kinds of attacks against Taliban and other groups in those countries recently. The countries involved are protesting loudly. Pakistan has had to suffer repeated attacks. Syria's borders have been less often violated.



Obama, McCain and Bush don't seem to be very different on this issue, except that Obama seems to be more concrete in his plans to leave Iraq. About Pakistan, he has been, if anything, the most aggressive of the three in his rhetoric.



So, this isn't really an election issue. It just is an incredibly important, vital issue!

it does matter how much he earns!! as your wage should reflect how well you do your job etc
he proved he is irresponsibleand not capable of doing his job to the standard that should be required. he has also lost trust from his employers and caused them a lot of grief and bad publicity as well. given that he is in a position where kids look up to the likes of him etc then no i dont think its excessive to lose that much money, as he didnt deserve it in the first place and even less so now.



many people have said that there are more important issues to worry about, including crime, but have they thought why crime is on the increase? its because there is no discipline and people feel they can get away with it, and situations like this, where a high profile person does something wrong and gets away with it only compounds their beliefs that they are allowed to do it too.
if they see celebrities and people they look up to, punished when they do wrong then they will have a better understanding of what is right and what is not, and what ross did wasnt right.
ok he apologised, but the apology he initially made with brand meant nothing as they laughed the whole way through it and afterwards he only said it to save his face and ****! not because he felt what he did was wrong!
ross has a lot of money and i dare say he wont miss the 25% that much, after all its hardly going to put him on the breadline is it?



bewtiching - it doesnt matter what she did...if she is sleeping around or not. they had no right to tell her grandfather what she had done, and up until then 99% of the population had not heard of her let alone associated her with sachs..if Brand has slept with her then he just showed what a low life he is by broadcasting it. people moan when  a girl sleeps with a footballer and then sells her story to the press but what he has done is just as bad, he used her sex life as part of a joke...hardly chivralous is it?

No, the fact that he makes £6 million a year is not irrellevant; it won't make a bit of difference to his lifestyle or his spending.  Cutting someone's pay by 25% when they earn barely enough to live on is serious, but he won't be hurting.  Perhaps he'll buy one less stupid suit this season.

You  surprise me. To telephone a man of advanced years who is already worried about his wife in hospital, and leave crude and insulting messages - not only on his anserphone but live on radio rates a bit more than 'silly' in my book.



It seems to me that people like him demand respect for themselves, especially if his salary is anything to go by, but are loathe to give it to others who may well deserve it more.  He behaved like a foul mouthed schoolboy and deserves even worse.



No. I am not jealous of his money or his fame. I'd just like to see it go to someone who actually earns it on their own merit, and not by being snide abusive to others.



We used to be taught to respect our elders. Maybe he should remember that, and direct his talent towards someone of his own ilk, who can give as good as they get, and stop behaving like a lout on our money, because ultimately, we are the ones that are paying that salary.

I think it is, especially now it's come to light that everything they said about the girl was true, by her own admission. Just another nasty little nobody cashing in on her five minutes of fame allowed her by Russell, Jonathon and her own grandfather. I think she's done far worse to her granddad than they did because he defended her and she made a laughing stock out of him. However, I am not defending what they did, even though I love the pair of them. Whatever she did or didn't do, that's not her granddad's fault.

What do you think about Boris urging football clubs to pay a living wage to their less stellar staff?



He suggests it would set a superb example if clubs agreed to pay their low-paid workers -- shop assistants, catering staff and cleaners -- the London living wage.



The national minimum wage in Britain is £5.52 pounds an hour, he is suggesting they pay the "London living wage" of £7.45 pounds per hour



This as compared to the stars themselves being paid up to £130k per week.

I don't know about Widnes, but I do know about Mischief Night. It is a night where a lot of trouble happens at night. Most people in my town, wont leave their animals out for long tonight and bring in some of their decorations.



When I was a junior in high school, our powder puff football game was held on Oct 30th in hopes to stop some of the occurrences of Mischief Night. This was first started in 2003, so 5 years ago, and the game is still held every year on the 30th.



When I was younger, like 9 or 10, I was with my sister on Mischief Night and the cops stopped us because there was a lot of vandalizing going on and they wanted to know if we had anything to do with it.



I think it only takes place in small towns.

yeah,I've heard of it. I'm from Liverpool so just down the road from you really! Basically it's an excuse for kids to go out and cause trouble. Last year my dad's car got covered in flour and eggs. I heard on the news that some of the shops have agreed to not sell flour and eggs to kids under a certain age-I think 16-to try to stop them doing it!

Are Europeans ready for the "change" Obama will bring?



Obama has tremendous support in Europe (as well as around the world). Are they ready for the "change" that will occur?



Yes Obama will be different than Bush. Bush had no qualms about "going it alone". Obama is determined to get NATO participation. Is France, Germany, Italy, and Canada ready to put up more troops in harms way in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Obama want to concentrate there and not alone.



</question>



<additional details>



I hope Europe realizes the "change" Obama will bring will not be "change" in the US, but he expects Europe to "change".  He expects Europe to spend more on military, he expects Europe to put more of their young soldier in harms way. He expects Europe to pull their weight.

Can you blame their background? Especially if they have had the benefit of a private education? Their private circumstances if they're ONLY earning between £200,000.00and £6,000,000.00 per year from one source? Or is it that they think we are so stupid that we will accept banal, filthy innuendo and detritus as laughable and laudable?

I just think it's yet another example of how low our culture has come. Russell Brand is a total toss-pot, i've never liked him, I think he's as attractive as a cane toad with a probably worse personality. Jonathan Ross is different, I quite like him.
There are no manners any more, no respect, foul language is now the norm as is loutish behaviour. I just think it's really sad that we've come down to this dumbing-down and coarsening of our once-great culture.

I find their humour  stunted, childish and should have been left in the student common room.



They have no talent. Both Ross and Brand think making rude, offensive and puerile comments are a good replacement for wit. I remember the Two Ronnies who made us laugh with not a swear word, no " don't you think I'm clever" antics. They were masters of the english language with a real talent.



Perhaps by saying this I am bringing politics into this question, but these people have grown up in the last 11 years. The 11 years we have had a Labour Government of all image and no substance. The master of this is Tony Blair.



He promised so much, but delivered so little. He lied and abused the office of Prime Minister for his own gains and walked away thinking he is untouchable.



His supporters all occupy jobs in the BBC who think that being " edgy" and downright rude is acceptable, even applauded. It is not.



This has come as a wake up call for the BBC, that we, the licence fee payers are fed up with this minority humour that only appeals to drunk twenty- somethings.



There has been a shift in the public mood. They will no longer tolerate this rubbish and pay for it. Either the BBC sacks Jonathon Ross and improves it standards or they lose the licence fee.

Bad upbringing...good manners should be imbibed, it cannot be really taught.



Also, have noticed there is a flagrant disregard of courtesy when money is involved. If being rude will pay, then most people will be rude to the extreme.



Also, the largely mistaken view that it is what people want & find popular is another silly reason lewdness is so ramptant today.

I watched the decline start in the 1960s with the likes of David Frost and others breaking down the boundaries of respect for authority through their programmes.  There were a group of Oxbridge students who became presenters and comedians.  They gradually eroded respect for others and although it was tame compared with today's standards, or rather lack of, it opened the gates for disrespect.  One of the programmes responsible was called 'that was the week that was'.  It was presented by a lot of young and arrogant people just like Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand, who thought they were God's gift.  I realise that Wossy is not young, just immature.

Bali Bombers- Death Penalty or Lifetime of Torture?



i personally believe that a torture would be a good punishment, even though under the legal system criminals cannot be given inhumane punishments, but what they did was hardly humane. The way i see it is we lock them in a max security prison and just beat the **** out of them everyday for the rest of their lives, and then right before they die we pull out the guns and put some rounds in their faces, then we see whos smiling. Whats your opinion people?

I think you hit the main pro argument right on the head.  People with less money have higher incentive to spend it, which leads directly to more employment, which makes everybody including the rich better off.  Money is a flow, not a static pile, thats something FDR understood which helped overcome the Great Depression, and its something that Republicans have never understood, which is why we are going into another one.

No.  To my mind whilst there are problems with the benefits system and its abuse it is not this that has caused the recession and the deep economic problems.  The problem is the lack of borrowing now available which affects all businesses as people can't borrow money to purchase goods and businesses can't borrow money to expand and diversify.  Therefore if the minimum wage were to be increased this would create even greater expense to businesses at a time when those businesses are making less money.  Therefore there would have to be cuts and unemployment levels would increase.

Not necessarily, if the minimum wage increases it means (-) firms have decreased profits and subsequently less for investment. It would (+) give purchasers more disposable income but (-) they may invest in savings and the economy would not benefit from it at all.



I can see where you are coming from, because increased spending does increase overall economic growth and welfare in the long-term. The the tools which are used to do this are primarily the fiscal (concerned with taxes) and monetary (concerned with the money supply) policies.



Prices are being lowered to encourage consumers to spend more (following the main fundamental principle of economics - supply and demand). It seems to be working in the UK moreso than in America at the moment. Hopefully it will all work out okay.



PS. Don't be discouraged that everyone said that it wouldn't, it was good that you were curious and asked in the first place.

Nice one Skidoo! Where is the salary increase to come from? Most employers are laying staff off to cut their overheads or their businesses will go bust. There isn't any spare money in industry and as the bl**dy government have spent all our reserves, there's no money in the country either! Typical Labour, stupid ideas about buying their way out of the recession? If i had my way no-one would be allowed to become a politician until they had demonstrated that they had successfully run a business for five years - that would give them the right background in financial training so that they didn't waste our valuable taxes.

The obvious argument against is that it will mean fewer minimum wage jobs, and/or higher prices.  However, every single time the minimum wage has been increased, there has NEVER been an adverse impact on employment or inflation.  Never.



However, a single minimum wage everywhere makes no sense.  For any non-minimum wage job, people get paid more in expensive places to live, like the major cities, and less in inexpensive places to live.  There should be a higher minimum wage in New York City than there is in Des Moines, Iowa.  It just makes sense.

Why do people think that offshore drilling is helping to lower gas prices?



Oil companies are actually producing less oil because prices are down.  Prices drop when demand goes down or supply goes up.  In this case, demand has fallen way off because of fear of an economic recession.  Oil companies are trying to increase the demand by decreasing supply so they can keep their record profits.

No, oil companies are not "producing less oil because prices are down."  Supply and demand are not the only reason prices go up and down.  When you see such a tremendous increase in the price of a commodity in such a relatively short time, as you have with oil over the last few years, it is almost always due to speculation on that commodity, in this case oil futures.  The proof of this is in the fact that the price of oil has dropped precipitously over the last several weeks in concert with the stock market.  Many people have been getting out of the speculation business recently, and the oil futures market is no exception.



As for why some people think that drilling will have an effect on prices of oil and/or gasoline, it's because they don't understand how the oil business works.  I work for a major oil company, and I can tell you that even if all the restricted areas in the US were opened up to drilling tomorrow it would be years before any oil could be produced from them, particularly the offshore areas.  Even then, the amount of oil in those areas is small compared with total world production, which is the basis upon which oil is valued.  So there would be no effect at all on the price of oil and, by extension, gasoline in the short term, and little, if any, in the long term.



However, it is also true that the oil companies could make money drilling in those areas, lots of it.  I plan to retire in a few years, so the higher my company's stock is the better for me.  So by all means, "drill, baby, drill."  But unless you own oil company stock, it isn't going to make any difference to you.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



"OPEC said at an emergency meeting Friday that it will slash oil production by 1.5 million barrels to stem the "dramatic collapse" of oil prices, but crude prices plunged 7 percent anyway as financial markets spiraled downward across the globe."

Off-shore drilling advocates hope it will help bridge the gap between our present dependence upon Mid East oil  and the ideal of total independence thereon.
It is to be hoped, also, that they factor-in the necessary companion policies that include other alternatives such as stricter mpg rules that automakers are begining to  shoot for and alternate energy sources like nuclear, solar, geothermal and wind.



It should be pointed out that 'T-Bone's' plea is about CNG, compressed natural gas

Off shore drilling has nothing to do with the decline in gas prices. The Boone Pickens Plan to replace oil with natural gas is what's doing it.  Now big oil is trying to starve the plan out. Once they do that, bet your last dollar that gas prices will rise.

Well, Texas is a big state.  If 23% believe that he is Muslim, then 77% believe that he is not a Muslim.  I would guess that most of those in the 23% category live in the small, hick towns where there is a tremendous amount of fundamental, Christian dogma and community pressure to not think outside the small box.  When people go against the status quo (ie Republicanism) in these small towns, there is an unspoken, shunning mechanism which goes into action, and it can be very painful.

God help you when 'she indoors' sees this! Wish i could be a fly on the wall! Then again anyone married to you would need to have a good sense of humour. I once asked a lovely employee if she understood the concept of multitasking - she said she didn't understand what i was asking and that on a daily basis she was probably too busy to go for re-training and would that be a problem as she was trying to overlap other positions to make them more cost effective and customer friendly? I took a deep breath, took her out for lunch, introduced her to a friend who does personal coaching and two weeks later gave her the promotion she deserved but had never expected. She's still there, happy, a bit stressed from time to time, earning a great salary and to this day probably doesn't still realise why i valued her so much. She has also gained the attention of the Chairman of the PLC we sold the business to as she actually answered the phone one night after closing time and was very kind to him, wouldn't give him our home number but promised that we would phone him back the next morning after 8am. She was very adamant that he could not have our home number! He was and is seriously impressed by her, no one ever said no to him since his Mother!

Wow, no disrespect but this sounds like that old Southern  redneck beating and slapping your wife all around the house style. If you was really serious about this question, you must of been real angry with your wife or something to make you type some inhuman question like that. The answer is definitely no but if you see your wife as a piece of scum making you something hot to eat with a chain on her ankle in the kitchen and non responsive type of woman, go right ahead and you'll go to jail.

I believe he was talking about the fact that many people think he is a Muslim.  As far as calling him a Socialist he is correct and in that fact makes him a danger to America.  Most normal Americans do not want a Socialist President.



Here is just a small sample of what will happen under Obama:



A national depression or run away inflation



More abortion



Mass taxation and give away programs that takes from those that produce and gives to those who do nothing,



Gun control laws that will put everyone under the control of government and criminals



Hate speech laws that will not even allow Christians to proselytize



Brainwashing of your children in all schools



Thought police



A Nanny State that will control every aspect of your life and your children’s lives



Huge carbon taxes to fund the world government



If Obama stays on course it will bring civil insurrections and the break up of the Union.  Mark my words!  I told you beforehand.

Labour, because they are the only party that will ever do anything for the common working man. Oh they might get it wrong, they might make a complete hash of it, but they will do it.



The tories will do what they want for themselves and their kind, if that should result in a few crumbs going to the peasants than so be it, but basically, its for them not us.



The Liberals, well they will tell your kids that they really should be homosexual or lesbian, that they should marry a coloured person , talk to the trees, never go to war and stop being a meat eater.

I think we have all fallen into that category, too much credit.  The Banks hooked us in and now because of their greedy tactics we are all in trouble.
My husband works for the building trade, and work has fell so much that every week they close another plant down.  So this is not scare mongering this is bad economy and lack of investments.  Plus the greedy people at the top of the tree who are now pulling in and not investing in projects.  Greedy oil men who make ridiculous profits.
The evidence is all around if you care to check it out.  Bad government control and greedy profit makers.
That's how I see it.
It all makes for a negative attitude and sends out negative energy and eventually we all believe it and go along with it all.
What makes me laugh is that supermarkets are lowering their prices daily in competition with each other, yet they are still making big profits.
Makes you think a bit.

No, I worked in a manufacturing company (Till last week). We were doing great, having the money market funds dry up seems to have had a huge affect. The orders are trickling in, stuff that had been ordered from a China company is put on hold, pallets of  valves ready to ship are just sitting around. If this keeps up you will be seeing  Major American manufactures go belly up, leaving thousands without jobs.

It's just piss poor policy aimed at a group of society who are least able or willing to access the right avenues to fight the changes.



The government know this and continue to police the most disadvantaged rather than support them.



It's not just mental conditions that Incap fails to support it can be people with very obvious physical disabilities.



I agree entirely that the scams and shady deals of those with most in society are far in excess in monetary terms than any benefit claimant. But then it's not that section of society's vote that they are after.

What i find absolutely mind boggling is the timing of all this! The Government sponsored Remploy factories who employed disabled people have been closing at an alarming rate this last twelve months just as the economy has gone into free-fall and their aren't any replacement jobs. The York Remploy employees went to the Labour party conference to speak about the closures but were side lined by being told that Gordon Brown was personally coming to listen to them in a closed meeting. The meeting occurred but he did nothing and the factory closed with all of those people now still out of work and not likely to be employed for a very long time. Now they're going to make them either find work or do without benefits - just where the hell are they going to find a job? It's not as though they are capeable of moving elsewhere, they need family care! This disgusting government are papering over some very wide cracks but eventually those cracks will split the foundations of new labour and they'll sink into their own morass!

As someone who has suffered from depression I would have to disagree with you.



However there are some people who claim to be depressed and do bugger all about it. These people are just hiding behind an illness.



I completely disagree on the MS and mental illness though. Thats just bad taste to say something like that.

I don't think they are lazy at all! Just because these illnesses don't have any obvious physical symptoms at first (e.g. a limp or something), it doesn't mean that there's nothing wrong with them! They are real illnesses with real, scientific consequences on the sufferer.



And as for people with these illnesses being "lazy", well you obviously have a warped, biased view of sufferers as people who just mope around and do nothing, being self-pitying. Though there must be some people like this otherwise this stereotype wouldn't exist in the first place, I know of several people who have suffered from depression and have continued with their jobs, looking after their children etc.



Even the people who do give up their jobs etc DO have reason for it - they're not being self-pitying, theyre suffering heavily from an illness. Just because the sufferer does no have a broken leg or similar, and instead has a mental illness, does not mean they are any less deserving of help or time off from work etc.



If this does not help explain mental illnesses a bit further, please do some research - I'm sure you'll find scientific proof that depression etc sufferers are not merely being "lazy".

In my opinion, Obama will be addressing the nation as a last ditch op-
portunity to try to persuade people to vote for him and try to improve his
image better than he did a couple of weeks ago when he talked to "Joe
the Plumber" about his economy plan.  How anybody can think that



his "Robin Hood" economy plan of taking from the rich and giving it to
the poor will result in anything but a deep depression is beyond me!

Sure I will watch him and hear what he has to say.  I like listening to him.  He is using up the money from contibutors to his campaign and he is using it wisely. Brilliant tactics to save the money until a week before the election. To have 30 minutes of himself explaining what he plans to do to save this great country etc.  uninterrupted by that irritating McCain.

Moving America into the 21st century pretty much covers it.



Health care reform is THE big one; new tax codes without excessive burdens on the middle class; moving ahead with science and technology regarding alternative energy sources; new forceful regulations on banking and finance; other environmental issues, like more recycling.  Repeal of NAFTA; immigration reform, higher standards for imports from China.  Many people want the war in Iraq ended immediately.  I don't think that will happen, but I'm not in charge of anything important, anyway...

Who, or what is the "Moronic Tendency"?  I know it's possible to HAVE moronic tendancies, but you can't BE a moronic tendancy.



The only thing this whole episode has shown me is that a lot of people in this country are willing to get whipped-up into a frenzy over some celebrity's off-the-cuff remark.  Still I'm sure the celebrities involved are loving the free international publicity that the Daily Mail readers are giving them.



So in summary, a comedian makes a joke about somebody's grandaughter and the whole country is up in arms.



Whilst simultaniously, our government is driving the country into debt in order to bail-out overpaid, clumsy, banking executives and noone seems to give a damn.

Are you on a personal vendetta?Get a life, they cracked a joke that 2 people complained about and the Sun picked up on. I find them amusing and so do millions of others. Bring back the Sach's 2.
Did anyone complain about the racist character portrayed by Mr Sachs for years? No, because it was funny.

No it wasn't that bad, she is a member of The Satanic Sluts, yes it was in bad taste but it was a joke.. if a girl puts herself out in that light publicly something will come back to her in relation to that, especially to people who know her if they are famous too, in this case her Grandad, (who is famous.. is in public eye) for him to be so shocked about his granddaughter's behavious shows he must have known very little about her, if nothing at all and therefore he really wasn't that close to her.

not at all, i think it shows how little people have to do with their time, in case it wasn't obvious, theres a credit crunch and people are losing their jobs, andrew sachs was satisfied with an apology and georginas career has had a good boost courtesy of the sun newspaper so really whats the big deal.

No. People like you who get their knickers in a twist over something like this are the best indication of how sick this country is. If a couple of overpaid comedians making inappropriate jokes was really the worst thing in this country at the moment, I'd be happy. Unfortunately there are much worse things in this country at the moment and the fact that the 'great' british public can't get themselves this wound up about things that really matter really pisses me off.

Personally, I take comfort in the fact that there as been such outrage shown by the public over the Brand/Ross affair. I think people have been fed up for a long time now with yob presenters and yob comedians and the camel's back has now been broken.
There should be no place for this sort of muck on a publicly funded TV service.  I deally, there should be no place for it anywhere but at least we would not be paying for it if it were on a commercial channel.  With the BBC, however, even if you switch off you still pay.
Interestingly, I noted that neither Brand nor Ross featured in the recent TV Awards,  so they can't be that popular!

This country may be troughing in the gutter of excess now. The current diva generation, for whom Brand is some kind of icon, though goodness knows what they make of a middle aged old git like Ross, are about to see the wheels fall off their shallow, materialistic lifestyles. The country is sick and may be heading for national bankrupcy, both financial and moral. People will laugh and deride this opinion, but if somebody had told you 3 years ago the housing market would be in steep decline and the international financial system on the brink of collapse, would you not have scoffed at that also ??  Exactly. By the way, Brown's plan to borrow MORE money to spend his way out of this mess may be the last throw of the dice. If it fails I've seen your future in countries like Albania and the Philippines. I can assure that's a cure you won't like !!

Only a tiny minority of loud mouths are against Woss and Brand.



This is England where we have many hundreds of years of at the edge comedy, mostly of the lavatorial and morgue kind.



Here's a vulgar English joke from the 1930s.



Max Millar
"I was walking along this narrow moutain path when around the corner came a pretty young girl.  The path was too narrow for us to pass each  other, so I wondered whether to block her passage or toss my self off."



It's just a load of inuendo and it's all in the mind.



British and thus English humour is all about death, sex and the lavatory.



Here's one our finest comedians ever.  Oh, so roood!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FBVCIYB5...



This country is now one big CENSORSHIP and no longer looks like the England of my youth, born 1941, so I've heard most of them, they just get revamped and keep on going round.



If you're a Londoner like me, you'll appreciate the mildly cruel joke.  There you are walking along the road and you see a mate waiting at the bus stop.  You nod as you approach' awite? etc.  Then as you get closer you say to him, "no point in waiting there mate, they're on strike".  Of course you know perfectly well that they buses are not on strike, but your mate is now wondering whether to return home or walk to work.



Cruel.

I don't think he will will a general election but a lot depends on how much damage New Labour can do to the Conservatives campaign. I personally do not believe that Brown is the saviour of a crisis. He had ten years as chancellor before becoming PM and the language he has used over the past few weeks has been tacky to say the least, such as "this is stuff coming out of America". If he were asked properly to clarify such a comment I think he would be lost for words. He still has very little credibility with the majority of voters.

Do you think we will see gas at $1.99 a gallon or less?



I saw it for $2.28 yesterday...and with Exxon reporting to make record profit this qtr. with the prices going down so much lately, I'm wondering if it will continue to decline.  What do you think?

Why have Hewlett Packard recieved little uproar over their Gary Glitter "touch me" ads?



In a week when Ross and Brand get banned, how come a major corporation like Hewlett Packard get away with using the Gary Glitter anthem "do you wanna touch me" to promote their range of touch screen PC's and laptops without hardly any outcry. They paid Glitter 100k for the promotion in the United States but the media have missed one crucial aspect of this. While the advert has been pulled, the packaging in the UK has the slogan "Do you wanna Touch"?  I assume he would have to be paid for this too, as it is lifted from the song. A total disgrace when one considers his sordid association with laptops!

for this to be answered you would need a very long debate...



but contributary factors are...
-their bringing up, if they have been shown pain... more likely to inflict.
-isnt only kids, or youth's. the amount of animals found tortured and abused by the RSPCA!!! many of whom dont have any form of mantal illness.
-feeling of power etc. being able to control.



this is one event by four youth's so i think that your statement if flawed... i'm 16 btw

most kids dont really understand how to act towards an animal. they dont get that acting irresposibly towards an animal can be quite harmful to it and its health.



also they're idiots.



and BTW i think u should show those kids your pet lion. i bet the lion would get good revenge on them for hurting other animals. lool.

My friend - that is a story almost too hard to even read and it is very upsetting. It's a sad fact of life, people have always been cruel to animals. I think it's mainly ignorance, curiosity and their upbringing. If people were brought up in the correct way, these things might not happen.



Bring back corporal punishment in schools, let parents give good hidings when their kids step out of line, and stick these lowlifes in borstals until they learn to respect things.

How upsetting.
I cannot abide cruelty to animals.
We had lots of different pets as kids, and were brought up to love and respect animals.
What sort of families do they come from i wonder?
They should be named and shamed. I always feel deep down though, that, the signals of their depraved behaviour, were, probably, apparent many years earlier and not dealt with. A sad indictment of our society, i`m afraid.

That question is quite biased my friend- you suggest that the cruelty to the flamingo was somehow related to the age of the perpetrators, which is ignorant and offensive.  But to answer your question, its because most people today are far removed from their food-source.  You can't have adequate appreciation and respect for any animal life unless you, at least once, have to hunt for survival.  However, your suggestion to "stick them in with" gorillas or lions shows that you value the animal's life higher than the humans', which does nothing to end violence against animals.

The link between cruelty to animals and violence towards people has been proven time and time again.
There need to be much harsher sentences for those who treat animals badly.  Otherwise, they will either continue with abusing animals more severelyt, or move onto people.
People seem to think that caring about animals and punishing those who hurt them is somehow "misplaced priorities" or a lack of care for people. I am proud that i rescue abused animals, and will stand up for animals- who can't stand up for themselves.  i am constantly accused of not caring about people, despite having a low pay job caring for disabled children.
ANYONE who intentionally causes suffering to another deserves severe punishment, whether they cause that suffering to another human or an animal who feels pain as acutely as you or I.

Is A Global Government A Good Idea Or A Nazi Idea?



Since both presidential candidates are members of the CFR, (Council on Foreign Relations) which is an organization hell-bent on globalizing, I guess we better start getting used to being on our way towards one world government. First they're unionizing the continents. Started with Europe, next is the North American Union and so on and eventually the CFR's open plan is to combine them into one country. Does this sound like a good idea or do you you think we're following Hitlers dream?

Why do people continue to believe Obama is a Muslim?



Ignorance in America is still alive beyond belief.



All of you who think this, are probably like that misinformed lady at the McCain rally, where she said she didnt trust him because he was an "Arab."  23% of Texans polled claimed this, in tonights news.  Your probably in that mix who think that all Arabs are Muslims and have Arab names, right?  Got news for you, Africans have Arabic names as well, but that doesnt make them Islamic. Christians are dying every day in Arabic countries, so lets do a little research before we judge.



</question>



<additional details>



Im adding that some African countries have Arabic names....not all....just wanted to make sure you knew what I meant.



Im sorry to have to correct you with the answer that his dad was Indonesian. His dad was from Kenya.  This is exactly the point Im trying to prove.  People dont read or research anymore, they just speak on what they think is the truth with no regard to the substance in their arguement.



I will say that I do agree with the way the McCain campaign has been ran. They let this biggotry run ramped at these rallies, and dont do anything to stop it.  McCain corrested the older lady once, but turned it against Obama when Obama didnt reputiate something said about McCain, which McCain took out of context.  Thats something the Republicans are great at doing, spin...spin...spin!!!

This is because his late mother married to the Indonesian husband who was a muslim. Whoever want to marry a muslim man or woman, the future husband or wife must convert to islam.



Unfortunately, the late step father was not a devout muslim and he was more westernized and free spirit. He didn't guide Barrack Obama, his late mother and half sister a true muslim lifestyle.

Is A Global Government A Good Idea Or A Nazi Idea?



Since both presidential candidates are members of the CFR, (Council on Foreign Relations) which is an organization hell-bent on globalizing, I guess we better start getting used to being on our way towards one world government. First they're unionizing the continents. Started with Europe, next is the North American Union and so on and eventually the CFR's open plan is to combine them into one country. Does this sound like a good idea or do you you think we're following Hitlers dream?

Neither good idea nor a Nazi one.



A global government would never work - look at how rubbish the EU government is, or the UN - it takes for ever for anything to be sorted out, and it is nearly impossible to get every country and culture to agree to the ideas brought forwards. Can you really see a government that aims to represent both communist china and the west working at all well? It would be blocked at every possibly stage by different groups or countries, and nothing would ever get done.



Plus, it would be uunbelievablycorrupt - again, look at the EU, which is as close to a world government as we've got at the moment. The EU is one of the most corrupt governments ever to be seen outside of Africa.... It would be so easy for the head of a world government to become a total dictator.

Would you consider this abuse of power? ?



If this type of data breach happened on one of our systems, you can damned well bet someone would be toning up their resume. the abuse of power by politicians bothers me more then the intellect.. We can deal with fools but people willing to commit a criminal act for a politician scares about where the political left sits.. Many reside in positions of power in the bureaucracies. This is unacceptable that a person charged with protecting confidential information would release this information clearly for political reason, but the Big Brother mentality of this bothers me.



The only clear thing is the head of Ohio FS is an Obama supporter has breached the public trust, If this is what the Obama Campaign see's as normal tactic I have real fear about his presidency..  If the campaign can be found as an initiate in this, I SEE this is abuse of power.



Jones-Kelly also has denied any connections between the computer checks on Wurzelbacher and her support for Obama. (YEA RIGHT???!!)) She donated the maximum $2,500 this year to the Obama campaign.



This is $$$$ Lottery lawsuit, maybe Joe can get some ot the questionable $600 million raised by the Obama Campaign..



"I would sooner have a stupid, yet honest man as president than an intelligent liar.., and seemingly intelligent people are doing very very very questionable and scary things in the name of power..

This changes things as Italians knew them before, when there were different teachers for different subjects and wearing a uniform was not mandatory.



The main concern of these protesters is the fact that it will increase the difference between public schools, where only poor people will go to the public schools and public schools teachers' wages will be lower, and private schools, which will create an elite group of students on the basis of their personal richness. Italy does not have a student loan program funded by the government as the United States does.



Proponents of this reform believe that this reform is right because it is something that comes from good sense and it will improve the quality of the schools.



800.000 Italians went out to protest in Rome last week. You can see what they did on here. You don't really need to listen to what they say, but just see how they protested. 800.000 people are almost 1/50 of the total Italian population that went to protest.

&gt;We are hard to protect because there's so many of us and it would get stupid if millions of security measures were applied. Imagine being stopped to have a full-body search every 5 minutes!
&gt;Everyone panics when an attack happens near them
&gt;No-one dares go anywhere

The suspension is pending a full enquiry so he could still lose all. It is giving the BBC lawyers time to work out if they can sack him without having to pay him for the unspent time on his contract. Similarly Ross is probably having his lawyers check the contract. This is not over yet. When the dust settles eventually, there is always Ch4.

Behave, do you even know all the facts!?
Absolutely ridiculous! Trial by Media! There is far more offensive 'comedy' allowed out there. over 98% complaints made were made by people who haven't even listened to the show! They just jumped on the hyped up media band wagon. Sad representations of the British public. Know the facts before complaining!



Baillie slept with Brand and dances for a group called the Satanic Sl*ts(!) perhaps she should look at herself before complaining about others.



Also apparently the show was pre-recorded so if anyone is to 'blame' it's the producers/BBC bosses!

I don't think he should have been suspended. For God's sake people, it was a ******* joke. Most comedians have material like this, it just doesn't get aired - the editors should have been suspended, not Ross.



Everyone's always like "I'm paying my licence fee, I don't want it to be spent on Brand's show..." blah blah - I pay my licence fee, and I object to it being spent on the antiques roadshow, or this little dorrit (the book is almost as bad as something by jane austin) rubbish, but you have the right to watch it if you want to.



We are all born with a little thing called free will - if you don't like it, don't watch, and don't go onto youtube after reading about it in the daily mail, and then complain.



His ratings will be huge when he returns, and wherever Brand goes, he'll get huge ratings too. Ross' show would have been a lot better than whatever rubbish the BBC is replacing his show with this Friday, and Brand's pod cast was the most popular ever for a reason...



Get off the bandwagon and get over it. It happened weeks ago, and there are far more important things going on in the world. Get some perspective, and sense of humour, and a life.

Oh you naughty naughty vicar?!?



Has anyone read the story today about the Vicar who had to go to hospital because he had a potato stuck up his bum?



He claimed he was in the kitchen "hanging curtains whilst naked", when he fell backwards and landed on a potato on his kitchen table.



What do you think? Was the Vicar being genuine? Or was he having a bit of fun with the spud?

When I heard the prerecorded show of that incident, at the point where Russell Brand said you're a waste of space (supposedly about Jonathan for exposing Brand's 'affair' with Georgina Baillie) - I actually said back, YOU BOTH are a waste of space!
Besides the truth is, apologies DOESN'T really change everything of the whole situation.
And to tell you the truth, they are really overrated as for Jonathan he can't talk properly and Russell can't even brush his own hair or shave for that fact.

I like both of them. I think they are funny and all those who complained are just sad. It was a joke and, fair enough, insulted Alan (i think that's his name) and his granddaughter. But now the granddaughter is in the papers selling her story on how rubbish Russell was in bed so this makes her just as bad!!

I thought it was well done and watching the different reactions on various news media stations afterwords showed most of the biased media against him.



It probably didn't make many switch sides and doubtfully swayed very many independents either. It does make McCain look more like an old amateur, a cartoon strip or Oscar from Sesame Street.



That than seems to suggest the old from the new and why so many see Obama as more hopeful than washington's "business as usual." McCain may refer to himself as an underdog, but, so far all I've seen is an old dog with the same old tricks.(boring)



Since I don't have a crystal ball, I can't really say. There is a strong suggestion of a new camelot, similar to JFK. We all know how that turned out. Let's hope history doesn't repeat itself again.

For a President Through Whom God Strategically Works to Reveal His will for America



Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. He changes times and seasons; He sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. He reveals deep and hidden things; He knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him.
--Daniel 2:20-22



Awesome God, all things are in Your hands—times and seasons, wisdom and knowledge, things hidden and things revealed—You hold them all!  Only You are worthy of the praise of our lips, yet we give our praise so readily to those who do not deserve it.  O God, Your will is perfect and supreme over all things.



I ask You to raise up the president of Your choosing this year.  Work in special and needful ways to bring about Your purposes for our country, Lord, and work especially through the president to accomplish that will.  You have been so faithful and true to us, God.  May Your will continue to be revealed to us through those who are elected this year.  In Your Holy name, Amen.

As much as I support Obama... I have to say that that is really weird and I don't think anyone sane has does that yet.



There are haters on both sides but so far, I've only seen democrats accept the fact that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and political view. Every republican response I've read so far is fuled by hate and the inability of accepting others with opposing view points. With that said, I am not really into politics and I don't go looking for political comments. I just come across them every now and then and that has been my experience.

Despite who im voting for OBAMA BIDEN 08
I think Sarah Palin is a very educated woman who is strong, and has faced many challenges in her life.  I think any woman who can juggle having a family and possibly being vice president of this country is something to applaud.  However, I think she is unprepared and unqualified to run the white house one day.

Jennifer Hudson's Sister?



Is it just me or does it seem like Jennifer Hudson's sister could possibly be involved somehow in the murders of their family? After checking out her myspace, she is clearly a whack-a-do.

Hi all...



I'm wondering why there were no witnesses to see a 7 year old (probably kicking and screaming) coming from the house. I think, he was taken from the scene from someone he was familiar with and put in the white SUV. From there, maybe Balfour went in the house and did the slaying. I'm guessing they didn't want the lil boy to witness what was happening inside but for whatever reason killed him later...just my thoughts. But here's a crazy blog that I found (didn't write so don't get on my case).
It'll make ya think...



So & So wrote...
&gt; I have 2 theories. One surrounds Julia, the other, Jason. For those of you who have blinders on and want to treat Julia like the innocent victim- fine with me. However, as far as I'm concerned there were three victims and they're no longer here to tell their stories. The most defenseless victim, Julian, a poor little 7 year old boy who suffered the most unimaginable fate, witnessed the brutal killings of his grandmother and uncle before being shot twice in the head. We must fight for this child and if this means by exposing his mother- then so be it. I come from a realistic world where unfortunately, mothers sometimes murder their children or contribute to their demise. This is my opinion and if you're one of those people who live in untainted worlds, I ask you to move to the next post because this will probably upset you.
&gt; Theory 1: Julia Hudson's Involvement
&gt; There are t oo many holes in this story:
&gt; 1)The body of Jennifer Hudson¢s mother Darnell Donerson was found by Jennifer Hudson¢s sister Julia around 2:45 PM Friday. Julia called 911 to report the shooting. She also reported her 7-year-old son missing. Police arriving on the scene found Hudson¢s brother Jason shot to death in a bedroom.- okay I got this from CNN. My question is how could she report her son missing if she never went through the house. She claimed to have walked in the door, and after seeing her mother's body in the living room, left out the house and called 911. She then went to the police station to report Julian missing. How did she know he was missing and not hiding in the house or somewhere murdered in the home? Apparently, the police discovered her brothers body- she did not. As I said, she only made it to the front door.
&gt; 2)Friday was a teacher's work day in Chicago. Therefore, children did not report. Julia is a school bus driver. Why was she working then? If her son didn't have school, she shouldn't have had to work. All Chicago schools are basically charter schools. Another caveat: How did she get home if Jason was her ride?
&gt; 3)Police have stated that Jason Hudson was shot when the gunman shot through the front door. He also received defensive wounds. However, his body was found in an upstairs bedroom. If you've seen a picture of him- he was no small guy. William, a man of small stature, could not have taken him upstairs alone. If Jason was shot in the thigh, he would have needed a very large person to help him upstairs. I always wondered in that type of area, shouldn't they have a gun in the home?



&gt; 4)Shell casings were found in Julian King's bedroom, yet police are saying he was killed in the SUV.
&gt; 5) The small bullet only went through the wooden door, so the door should have still been locked. How did the killer get in? If he shot at the door first, who in their right mind would have opened it for him?
&gt; 6)Why didn't they come at night when most murders occur? The whole family would've been there, and they could've killed everyone.
&gt; 7)Sure, the police could've been monitoring Julia's myspace, but I doubt it. This is more along the lines of the FBI and they didn't jump aboard until late Saturday. I'm sorry, but I just can't imagine with your mother and brother being tragically killed, and your son missing, the last thing I'd be thinking about is the damn computer. And if it was her on the computer, and William was a suspect, why did she keep him as her #2 friend? His *ss would've been gone with the quickness. Why did she feel the need to explain her actions on Myspace yesterday? Why has she been seeking support from her fans on Myspace when I'm sure she's surrounded by family and friends who love her? I'm sure her close st friends/family know how to reach her. Is she enjoying her newly found celebrity status? To live in the shadows of a famous little sister. All eyes are on you now Julia. A word of advice- ask Jen for some acting lessons- your performance to date isn't Oscar worthy. My little cousin was gunned down a few years ago in Detroit and my Aunt joined a support group for grieving mothers. She said during her meeting yesterday, the women unanimously agreed that something wasn't right about Julia Hudson- even the grief counselor said that she's exhibiting questionable behavior for a grieving mother.



&gt; 8)Her appearance at the press conference was a little too calm and collected for me. Her hair was fly, she looked pretty well-rested, and she said Julian was more "like a little brother" very strange! =(

The information you seek is highly classified.  Please submit Federal Forms # 1012B, 2321R, 6302/22BR, and 1612M under the Freedom of Information Act.  It is suggested that you do this prior to Obama being sworn in because after that all bets or off as to how much information will ever be released.  ....and how about Rhode Island?  It is neither, but that's a secret too.

A question for our american friends?



I am wondering why Obama was elected by the people to become a Senator in the american Senate when it appears there are so many people who are against him both as a politician and as a person.
Forgetting the fact that he is of African/American race what are the problems in real terms why some of you are against him.
We here in the UK cannot understand what the problem is and,as we only get the barest of details through our news services some of us are very confused.We are not however,stupid enough to believe everything that is reported but,is there any truth in what those who,despise him are saying and,that is he is the worst person to lead America forward and get your country back on its feet.
Finally,would anyone else be able to do that?

I think you heard information of McCain supporters. I definitely do think Obama will be a great President if elected.
Instead of choosing to be a "big time" lawyer, he chose to be a community organizer. He is very smart and I am sure he will do much better job than McCain. People don't agree with the fact that he wants to "spread the wealth". I don't see anything wrong for those who have luxury cars and mansions to pay more taxes. That is greed, millions of people are struggling with paying medical bills but they just don't care because they want to have 3 or 4 cars.

You have had your views manipulated by the mass media.  Obama may well be the flavour of the month, but if the TV only shows negative reports about the guy then your opinion will be influenced: just like it is for everybody else.  You must consider, the mass media hold considerable influence over the weak minded.  The majority of people can simply be told what to think.  Bush has absolutely ruined the US and its reputation, yet many Americans still think he's the second coming; because that's what they are told to think by their TV.



It was discovered in the 1950's that whoever controls the mass-media controls the people.

If you watch the 20/20, you would learn the back ground of Obama.



After his graduation from Columbia University, he went to do social work on the grass-root level, which he got his momentum to complete his studies in Havard Law School with highest honor recommended by his lecturers. Then, he went back to do the social work instead of working in High Court. This made him to be a Senator.

Did Nazism borrow its ideas from Islam?



I really hope I am not offending anyones religion with this question. I am not attacking anyones belief neither. But I studyed Nazism whilst at school and even recently heard about Islam from Muslim friends and even read parts of the Quran.



I became interested in reading the Koran from a muslim friend. It began beautifully, however as the chapters progressed it became more darker, more militant and more anti Semitic. I stopped reading and explained to my friend too as why.



I almost felt sick. It was like reading the Nazi bible "mein kampf" which also talks about making expanding wars, and persecuting races namely j5ws. Also the abhorrent reference to "apes and pigs" etc...



So my question did Adolf Hitler borrow ideas from the Muslims to create his vile ideology and do the present day Muslims also support his ideas too? just look at the present media articles and statements made by prominent Muslims



Any views by people on this?

Well this is new. fyi, hitler persecuted muslims as well as jews and gypsies and homosexuals during the holocaust. also, jews aren't the only semitic people. muslims are semitic as well - arabs, turks, etc. saying the quran is antisemitic would be like saying the torah is antisemitic. not very logical... also, would you care to digress as to how, exactly, the quran is at all similar to the practices of the nazis? because quite frankly, it is offensive. present day muslims do not support the ideas of adolf hitler. and there is nothing in the quran about ethnic cleansing.

Adolf hitler killed muslims, so why would muslims support his ideas?
These people who make the statements you refer to are extremists, and you get extremists in all religions (just look at some of the nut-case sects claiming to be Christian, who reckon that everyone who is not a believer should be converted, by force if necessary, and that people of other faiths to theirs are going to rot in hell for eternity). Most of the muslims I know (and your friends are probably the same) are shocked at the terrorists and hate-preachers' interpretation of the Koran, but like anything, it can be interpreted in many different ways. I can read you passages from the Bible that could be taken to incite hatred, and the same is true of any book. If you read the Koran expecting to find violence and hate (maybe not consciously, but subconsciously due to the influence of the media etc.), it is no surprise that you found it.

There are haters on both sides but so far, I've only seen democrats accept the fact that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and political view. Every republican response I've read so far is fuled by hate and the inability of accepting others with opposing view points.

<question>



Jonathan Ross/Russell Brand incident, the 'victim' in all this was on tv saying how he was offended but has ?



got over it, the young 'lady' in question is loving her 15 minutes, she's had her face on tv and in the national papers, both of these people are saying that they accept the apology, it was stupid but it's dealt with now.



There were only 2 complaints on the night, then the media got hold of it and now it's a national sensation.



Do these 35,000 people that have complained have a right to drag this out when the actual people involved are putting it behind them?



</question>



<additional details>



More people didn't complain than did, we all have to pay our tv licences, so by those odds, 35,000 out of a few million viewers is a small amount.



May I just add that I am neither for nor against, I just think it's bee nblown all out of proportion, perhaps it was the only new news on that day?  Are we all a little fed up with the mess Gordon Brown has made of hte economy, the 'evil' bankers and the was in Iraq etc so this caught our imagination?



Not that interested in puppies nor kittens, nor causing a fuss just because I can.



Hang on, no puppes/kittens were killed, some 'comedians' were rude to someone else, end of, no-one was killed or even maimed.  If the people who are actually OFFENDED are over it, why oh why are some still going on?



So, are some people saying that because they pay their tv licence, only what they want to watch should be shown?  Nice idea, but we ALL have to pay the licence fee and we do not all share the same viewing pleasures.



So, by asking for hte phone number of an elderly relative of mine  in order to do the same, does that mean you agree with it?  Or do you think it's ok to do it to some but just not a select few?



Anyway, they'd probably just tell yo uto grow up and laugh at you.

What you don't understand is that his isn't just "any" broadcaster. This is the BBC and is funded by everyone who has a tv on punishment of prison. If you want comedy that goes as far as these two comedians...fine..go and pay for it at a subscription channel. When you are forced to pay for something you should be able to complain as much as you like!!



If the BBC made a show with people killing Kittens/Puppies shown at 3am would you really say you cannot complain about it since you didn't watch it??



Same principle.



You're arguing that people shouldn't complain unless they heard it originally...I'm saying that's nonsense.



People are not saying they should dictate what is being shown. They are telling the BBC to maintain the standards to which it is governed by. i.e. Not break it's own rules, which clearly happened in this case.



As an aside, please supply here the telephone number of an elderly relative of yours. cos I think it's dead funny I'm gonna  phone her up and tell her I f***cked one her loved ones...on a swing. It's just a joke anyway.



well, you obviously found the "prank" funny and weren't offended by it, so let me have a laugh of my own and phone up that elderly relative of yours. I'll even put it on Youtube so everyone can listen and a laugh too! You don't want to come over as a hypocrite and say it's only funny if it doesn't happen to someone you know do you?

Putting it behind them? Sach's granddaughter is selling her story to the highest bidder - she's probably over the moon that all of this happened.



But I agree with your point. 35000 people jumped on the daily-mail led bandwagon, and have created some sort of hate campaign against the very talented Ross and Brand. Yes we should move on - in fact, it should never have become such a huge story. I personally am disgusted that most of the news outlets, and especially the BBC, have been running this as their major story or front page headline, when there are so many worse things going on in the world at the moment.



I also notice that out PM didn't find the time to comment on calls for us to send troops to the Congo (somewhere like that, I don't remember exactly where) but found the time to talk about the BBC2 incident.



Oh yeah, and where are the editors in charge of this? They are the ones who need to be suspended!!!

I actually heard the radio show in question and it really wasnt all that bad.  Yes, Russell Brand gets carried away sometimes but thats how he is.  Thats what makes him so funny and off the wall.  Andrew Sachs said that he had accepted his apology and for everyone to move on.



Its been blown totally out of proportion and if I was Jonathan Ross I would stick my two fingers up at the BBC and move over to ITV.

No, the newspapers spoil everything, they go on about on about how it was wrong blah blah, but why did it take them two weeks after the show was aired to come up with all these complaints. All the people complaining don't even listen to the show, so I dunno why they feel they deserve an apology, what a bunch of morons.

I didn't listen to the show and I don't know many people who did.  Doesn't that show that the people who did are the same kind of brain dead morons as the two presenting it.  They love this humour of showing someone else up.



And yes I would still be angry if someone I had slept with phoned my grandparents about it.



I pay a TV license not by choice but by law, so we should have some say over who is on our tv and radios.  I don't want these half wits on mine thank you very much.  That's why i choose not to listen to their TV and radio programmes.  I know the kind of offensive humour they use, but after hearing them maliciously call an elderly man (which is illegal lets not forget) then i would be pushed to complain

It's clearly all blown out of proprtion. Sachs said he accepted his apology and now I think everyone should move on. Just because some people didn't find it funny, doesn't mean they should ruin it for everyone.
Personally I think that it was a bit over the top, but that is what Brand does, people need to stop complaining and focus on more important thing.
It seems like a ridiculous waste of time to be going on about something that.

The offense caused deserves retribution, that has been accepted by the offenders.
The lack of oversight deserves condemnation and a review of systems, both of which would most likely have resulted in the termination of the complacent/irresponsible/incompetent employees.
The performance managed to alienate the elderly, women, the well mannered, parents, grand-parents and the politely-spoken, in fact it only appealed to drunken rude lads who feel its OK to bully the elderly.
The BBC have a mandate gifted by the majority, a majority who are plagued by exactly the type of yobs that this broadcast was designed to appeal to, and their message is "you can have some rope, but don't mess".
The frankly, unfunny, Ross and the deeply unpleasant Brand, would do well to acknowledge.....I think they will.

To be perfectly honest i think the average F1 follower is sick of hearing
his name during races.
Sad as it may sound i`m really happy when he goes out of a race because he seems not to get so much airtime.
They are not the Lewis Hamilton grand prix,Also in the race are some
very talented drivers.
All the hype is not about the colour of his skin and i dont think it`s in a racist context,It`s just people are sick of hearing his name.
The same can be said of Barak Obama.

If he is a truly nice, kind and decent man then you should not have to change anything, even your name. Are you Arab too? Do you keep your religion or have to change to Muslim? Make sure you are comfortable with all those things before you marry. A name change or any other change should be voluntary and not the control of someone else. You say he didn't ask you to but bviously you got the idea from someone. Good Luck!

The Christian church has had women preachers from the earliest of days.  In certain circumstances, the Catholic, Orthodox and Armenian churches have women ministers of the Eucharist.  What they don't have is women priests.  That's something we have managed without for 2,000 years and if we're going to change it, it will be when everyone has agreed, not because it's fashionable for jobs to be non-gender-specific.



Many theologians can see no theological objection, although that doesn't mean they think it should be imposed.  The top brass in the Catholic church has decided - for now - that it does not have the authority to ordain women.  It's likely to stay that way until the current clique has died out.  The Orthodox are not in a position to entertain the idea.



Protestant churches do not believe in a separate priesthood.  They are not of the opinion that their ministers are part of a universal priesthood.



The problems facing the C of E is that they have one foot in each camp.  They claim to be both catholic and reformed.  If they are a protestant sect, they can do what they like.  If they are part of a universal church, they should not have acted unilaterally.

The only reason why women don't have much of a history as priests is that it was a man-decreed thing, men have had financial  and government dominance for centuries. In the UK, at one time, a man gained all his wife's assets on marriage, she was his chattel. It is only recently that women had rights as independent people for income tax. Even their tax allowance, the Wife's Earned Income Allowance, belonged to the husband.
How do you know the divine doesn't want them as preachers? Been told personally? All religious doctrine is man-made and interpreted. It is our choice whether or not we accept it or question it.
I have always thought that religion is a living thing. If it is not, it will die. Therefore, at times, changes have to take place. How do you square the difference between the Old and New Testaments? One contradictory point is "an eye for an eye" (Moses) and "turn the other cheek" (Jesus). So which is right? Do you not think that religious instruction has to take into account cultural differences due to mankind's evolution?
There is such a problem recruiting priests these days that I think we have to be grateful that anyone is prepared to take on this difficult job, whether it be men or women, and I have to say that I think this job is more suited to women, who are known to be more sympathetic and understanding of life's problems.

Not too sure about this one LBJ but i've got to say that probably because of my Roman Catholic background i really feel a bit uncomfortable with female Vicars. I've met quite a few in my life, very nice and very well meaning ladies, but  somehow i do not feel as though they are quite as dedicated as their male counterparts -  more of a career thingy.



Probably due to multitasking!
Then again, i do not feel that male clergy should be forbidden from marrying, irregardless of the faith they follow, and i certainly feel that if more Catholic clergy were married we would not have had perverted priests who really are Satan's emissaries!

I personally don't know why anyone would join the clergy, but as you asked, isn't one of your commandments love thy neighbour? Why hate a gender?



Other institutions have to move with the times and embrace human rights, why should the church be exempt from anything? The church should not be allowed to opt out of gay adoption in the UK. No-one is above the law. And God's law doesnt exist. I have to obey my country's laws and I respect most of these laws, why don't you respect them?

Because Jesus is the Divine High Priest and he was male and that's why they have male priests in th Catholic Church. Also no woman ever offered sacrifice in the Temple-only the male priestly line.

Well, maybe you don´t know what the expression Afro-American means… or you are just kidding here.
Afro – American means that the person has his roots in the African continent and that his forefathers are from Africa.
I think that even the way American society does catalogue its people is simply another sign of racism under the surface… they say such stupid things like Hispanics to American citizens who came originally from South America, they call Orientals these people who came from places like China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan…  And Arabic a all these who are Muslims in general or come from middle eastern or Arabic countries… except the Jews, who are simply called Jews…



I wonder how they call people from India… ??? Orientals? Asiatic?? Middle Eastern???



It´s rubbish! Because it´s the attempt from the typical white American with European roots to show his superiority, as if being white and with European background is like a title.



And of course there are also differences, as between Europeans people from Italy, Spain, Greek, etc are still regarded as inferior by these typical white-as-milk skinned Europeans from UK, France, Holland…



Americas history is written on racism and violence, and using words like Afro – American still shows that there is plenty of racism hidden under the surface.



May this change and in the future we will only hear them saying that they are AMERICANS… because this is what they all are, no?

Now that we have a typical black male with the "gimmie gimmie" attitude our country is gone?



I guess Abraham Lincoln didnt know what he was talking about.



"You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich.You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.You cannot lift the wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down.You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred.You cannot build character and courage by taking away men's initiative and independence.You cannot help men permanently by doing for them, what they could and should do for themselves." --Abraham Lincoln

Why do people seem to think Obama is a black man?



He is mixed race, black father WHITE mother, a WHITE woman carried him for 9 months than gave birth to the man, if he can be classed as a black president, he can be classed as a white president. And some people seem to say "look at him", I'm looking and I see a mixed raced man. I know the media preaches all this stuff but the man is not black nor white, if he can be black, he can be white.

Where has Joe Biden been?



I haven't heard anything about him. Obama votes in Chicago, McCain in Arizona and Palin in Alaska. Where is Joe Biden? In U.S. politics, there's a President and Vice-President. Where's Biden? It just seems that you don't hear much about what he has contributed to the Dem's campaign. It really does kind of scare me that if Obama wins, he'll run the U.S. pretty much by himself.  ???

Biden has messed up so much that he probably doesn't want to show his face.  Obama is cocky and  thinks he is all that..but he had to chose someone.  I am glad he picked Biden, they are both alike.  But Obama can make people  believe his BS better.

Hmm, so don't vote for Obama because he is displaying true leadership ability & intelligence? Instead we should vote for someone who lacks political leadership, intelligence and someone who can't inspire?  You want another 4 years of Bush?



McCain lacked political leadership and the ability to inspire. He has good leadership for the battlefield but not for a country.

There may people who still do so... but anyway his religious believes are none of their business.



America is a hypocrite country, because on one hand they try to appear as the most progressive country in the world, but on the other hand they even use things like somebody’s personal believes for election campaign.



And if he were Muslim? Would this change anything??
Or Jew?
Or Buddhist?
Or if he would believe in anything at all? Atheist?



The USA is so stereotypical, always ready to attack any minority and trying to teach its citizens an enemy target.



Honestly, the saddest thing is that may Americans do not even realize that their government tries to do everything to make them believe that being a Muslim is the same as being an enemy – the ideal justification for any other war to steal oil from other countries. Well done, Mr. Bush!!
Yes, America is full of maniacs… and they used the idea of Obama being a Muslim to discredit him and convert him in a possible enemy of the liberty of USA and its citizens… playing dirty and using narrow minded people in their propose.



But THEY did NOT win!!!



So I guess that serenity still exists.
