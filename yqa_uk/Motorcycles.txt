if you don't go on the interstate very much then a suzuki drz400 would be ideal.  if you do go on the interstate, then you should get a scotts steering stabilizer, it makes 70mph+ much more comfortable

or husqvarna te610 is perfectly geared and light, ktm are good but require oil changes constantly

Kawasaki ZX600R 'Ninja', 2001, £2000. A good bike for my first 'big' motorcycle?



It's only half a mile down the street from me, seems cheap and is in immaculate condition (I haven't seen the bike in the flesh yet, but the photos would seem to support this).



Does this sound like an OK deal? Are there any things to look out for with this bike in particular?



I do not have any biker friends at all. Is there anyone I can turn to who will accompany me to see the bike and check it over? I'm in Bristol, England.



The Ninja will be first first big bike. Is it, however, a little TOO big or powerful for a rider who's only used to 125cc? I will ride the bike to work in all weathers (3 miles each way, 30mph limit through the city) and home at weekends to see mum (60mph limits, about 50 miles away on open roads).



Thanks!

The ZX6 is a good bike and if this is a good deal depends on the mileage, condition, tax and test. what else does it come with etc I always check ebay completed price and they are averaging about £1500.

Are the tyres good and a good make, £100 a wheel on average
Is the chain and sprockets good, another £100.

I bought an 2004 daytona from ebay for £2000 it had 6 month tax/test left, just replaced the tyres (£180 dunlop roadsmarts and the chain/sprockets another £100).

Now on to if it is a good bike to jump from a 125, that's a good question.

One thing you will need to check first is are you happy with the riding position, my mates don't seem to be able to ride mine and it is not as extreme as some of the other sports 600 out there.



All the sports 600s are fun to ride, handle and stop well and are capable of plus 150mph speeds very quickly, they do not like city work as they can put a lot of pressure on the wrists, or going slow as they usually develope power in the higher rev range, they're best out on the open bendy roads.

Have you considered something like a Honda hornet, CBF 600/500 Kawasaki ER6 or 6, Bandit 600, or even a Yamaha Fazer 600, these may be better suited for going to work on every day in a city and they will be ideal at the weeked for nipping 50miles and further, they all handle well but are tuned to give power all through the rev range which will be better for the city work.



Another bike to look at is the triumph speed four, same as the TT600 without a fairing but can be picked up cheap, this is if you can get over the daft screen round the clocks

I've also just bought a Bros 400 which is nippy, handles very well and with the v twin motor is great for nipping round town on, a lot have been used by couriers which says how good they are in the cities so they might be worth a look as well but seem to fetch silly money for an older bike.

Look out for any damage, like crash damage. 
Ask why it is being sold.



It is important to sit on it and make sure it will be comfartable not all bikes will suit.



Look around the engine for any leaks of oil and the seals around the suspension, ring marks that may indicate a seal needing replaced.
Look at servious history
Try get a book of bike prices to make sure you are not buying it for too much and it will give you an indication of how much you can bargin with the seller.
Just give it a good looking over and if anything you are not sure of take pictures yourself to show anyone that may help you to make a desision.  Move it about to check the brakes and suspension etc and make sure that you look at the port holes for the engine oil and brake fluid are full. test on a level surface.

I have been looking for a bike myself and i have gone for a 600 cbr which i have been tolled many times by different people, it is a good starting bike due to its preformance and riding style.  not all bikes are the same.  For it being too powerfull, you should be only doing at least max of 70 ;-)  Take it easy get the feel for it, which may take time but will be worth it in the long run

Be safe and it is not worth doing anything stupid.

If I have interpreted your question correctly, I see no reason that a flasher relay should prevent the bike from running/starting. The purpose of the relay is simply to allow your indicators to flash.

You dont need to have a flasher relay for a Honda C90 to work. If its not working its another problem. Depending on if its points or CDi will  decide what you need to look at to see why its not working. But a good start is always  check for a spark.

If you need a flasher relay- you dont have to buy a  genuine Honda one, any 18/21watt relay  with the same pin output will work, just go to your local motorcycle shop and take in your old one- and  they should be able to supply you with a good none Honda relay. None of my motorcycles have genuine  honda/ kawasaki relays and they last  years!.

should be pointing up .. ( if its a dohnut looking float ) .. the little bubble mark shuts off the fuel .. plus that mite just be mine ... the problem you have is the float or the float pin needs a good cleaning or fixing .. the pin maynot be shutting off the fuel because something is stopping it .. take off the carb and blow through were the fuel pipe attaches to the carb, u should be able to blow perfectly now push the float up or pin and if u cant blow its fine ( or you float is staying down preventing it from comeing up ) if u still can blow giv it a clean and if you still cant u need new parts ( pin ) it isnt stopping the fuel from enterign the carb

Unless the camera can show your face, no one can positively identify the rider as you.  Personally, I don't like giving da'man any extra from my wallet, so I'd take that ticket to court and fight it......say you let your roommates brothers best friend use the bike.  They can't prove it otherwise!

That's the loophole with cameras.....they don't pull you over to confirm the occupant of the vehicle is the registered owner!  Hope this helps your fight.

Uh Oh! Not good! Sounds like you will have a nice big fine come through your door! If you have a car licence, they will probably take that off you and you will have to re-take your test (Or you will have to take an extended test. Or they may do worse!

Charges likely to be:-

Speeding
Driving without a licence
Driving without insurance

then we have:-

Did you have an MOT?
Was the bike taxed?
was the bike roadworthy?
Are you the registered owner
if not, did the registered owner agree to you using it?
if yes, and he knows you don't have a licence, he can be charged with allowing you to use the vehicle

ring the dealers...or buy a manual......
normally you remove the fork tube top and add itin there...but both forks MUST have the same oil and amount in them...different levels will play hell with your handeling/braking...
are you adding oil to stiffen them?...normally a spacer tube works better.

The site will not let me link to a paticular page, but if you click on 'parts' then 'Kawasaki' then 'AR50' you come to the parts page. Then you can choose from a list of parts on the left, they have the racing pipe and reeds you require along with a whole load of standard and aftermarket products.

The Kawasaki Ninja EX250R is excellent starting place for newbies.  Another good choice is the Kawasaki Ninja EX500R.  Both bikes have in production since the late 80's so there should be used models available.

A lot of riders will tell you these are too small and you will grow out of them quickly, that is just an excuse for getting as big of a bike as they can as soon as they can.

I've been riding 40+ years have taught motorcycle training for 5+ years and seen quite a few wrecked sport bikes ridden by people that had no business riding those bikes.

Buying your first bike is very exiting and the thrill you will get from your first ride will probably stay with you for some time to come.  However different people have different aptitudes and therein lies the difference.

I have taught very many people how to ride.  Some have difficulty even after 8 sessions whereas some seem to be confident after just 45 minutes.  If you love 2 wheelers in general, the natural affinity will help you to master it in the shortest possible time.  If you harbor fear and other misgivings coupled with incorrect information, the process will take a while longer.

In some countries, a 100cc bike would be vehicle to start with.  In some, people want at least 250cc.  It all depends on where you will be driving.  If your use is within the city, driving at lower speeds, then a 125cc would be more than enough.

If you plan to use the highways more than use in the city itself, then a 250cc would be good and sufficient.  Just make sure you build up your confidence at lower speeds within the city before venturing out on the highways.  To my mind, the Honda CBF 250 would make an ideal vehicle to enter the world of 2 wheelers.  The single cylinder 4 valve, 4 stroke is a very sporty machine and fuel efficient too !

<question>



I am considering buying a Honda CBF 500, I have a few questions for anyone with experience?



I have just passed my UK bike test and this will be my first bike since a scooter aged 16. The CBF is what I learnt on and it seemed to be a solid, no-nonsense bike that will be capable of gettign me to work during the week and hitting the coast at the weekend. They're also everwhere, so parts must be available quite easily should itever go wrong.



My questions:

Is the CBF quite capable of moving me at 70mph all day, if need be, without breaking a sweat? What about should I decide to carry a pillion, would it suffer with the extra weight?

Also, the bike would be my only transport. Are top boxes, panniers and screens available for the CBF- and would this extra weight take from it's performance in terms of fuel consumption or road speed? I have never ridden a bike with a screen before, so I hope they don't act like air-brakes!

Lastly, is it worth looking into performance upgrades or more meaty-sounding pipes for the CBF? I know it will be my workhorse as opposed to a 'fun' bike, but that doesn't mean it has to be boring! I would keep it stock as a beginner though.



Any serious help welcome. Thanks!



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks for all answers so far. Are they any alternatives to the CBF that offer the same dependable practicality, but perhaps with a little more 'zest'? I'm pretty set on the Honda, but it's always nice to know!

hi i took my test on that bike and i liked it too. but when i passed and bought a bike i could not beleive the power i got a 1988 vfr750 i thought it was going to be like the bike i took my test on , boy was i wrong. compared to the cbf500 the vfr is very very quick fast and with torque. the cbf 500 is a very basic bike with low power but it would still go 110mph . i would really recommend a bike with the power of a vfr 750fj  but you have to respect the power. if i never got the vfr , i was going to buy cbr600r another really powerfull bike have you thought about the cbr600rr or cbr600f  vfr750 fj i bought for £600 and 105bhp cbf500 is about 53bhp.  by all means if you like it get it , please test ride some more you will be surprised with the power of these bikes if you are like me , i never realised bike were this powerfull, its the best thing i have ever done , safe riding and good luck

Yes, it will cruise at 70 all day (top speed is around 110mph).

All bikes are affected by the extra weight of a pillion, both in terms of handling and performance.

Various companies make luggage that should fit the CBF-500 (including the Hondaline range).  All luggage will affect the top speed and economy of any bike, because you are basically increasing the drag and reducing the aerodynamic efficiency.

Performance upgrades don't really exist for the CBF-500.  Most people who want more performance will simply buy a different bike.  Arrow make an exhaust system that will fit, though.

An alternative, but with more style, more power and more aftermarket bits (but still a good 'first big bike') would be the Honda CB-600 Hornet.  If you go for the 'S' version, that even has a half-fairing as standard.

I really like the CBF 500 as a first big bike, its fast enough to give you a little fun but not to quick that as a beginner it will over whelm you.

The bike will very happily do 70mph and faster if you need to get around that lorry as its top speed it says is about 125mph.

I have not found anywhere that does panniers for the bike though the bike does seem to allow for this upgrade and I have a givi rack and top box on it and no slow down is noticeable.

Screens are available; which will be the next thing I am looking for on my bike.

Not looked at performance upgrades for it so cannot help with that.

The only downside I have found with the bike is the oil check, it can leave you with a wonder if you are doing it correct, thankfully bike does come with a low oil warning light.

<question>



I am thinking of buying a sports bike. What are the options for a beginner with a £2k-£3k budget?



I have my test booked (UK). Hopefully I will pass!



I have tried out a couple of friend's bikes and really like the sports bikes, I feel comfortable on them and enjoy both their performance and the look.



I know that these types of bikes can be expensive and have earth-shattering performance figures. I refer only to out-and-out sports bikes in this question, not muscle bikes or sports-tourers.



HOWEVER, this will be my first bike over 125cc. My budget is £2-3k. I want a sports bike that will tolerate a beginner but will still offer me satisfaction as I become more experienced- of course, Insurance on the bigger bikes will also be an issue.

What would you recommend? My friend's bikes are all around the 600cc mark and I have heard this is really as big as I want to go as a novice. The Ninja sticks out as being a solid sports bike in my price range, are there any alternatives?

Thanks!

Foe your first bike after your test then I would recommend not going for and out and out sports bike.
I would say go for a CBR 600f these are the best bike probably ever built. These will do practically everything. The build quality is second to none, and they are good for twice the legal speed limit. In the right hands they will run rings around may higher spec bikes.
This is always my first choice of bike for the novice.

Don't forget to budget for insurance, and be sure of what you really want from your bike; panniers are an essential if you want to get out of your motorcycle gear when you go to the beach and a full-fairing will keep you semi-dry when the wind and rain hit.



"Sports tourers" are plenty fast enough for most people who haven't had their sense of self-preservation surgically removed and they are a hell of a lot more comfortable than pure sports bikes so don't be too quick to overlook them.



Honda CBR 600's are very common but they are rock-solid, comfortable and give excellent performance all-round. Trust me, it will quite happily wheelie at 90mph and won't give you a numb-bum after 50 miles.



You might also look at the Japanese grey-import market - mostly 400cc and 250cc bikes; back in the mid 90's I remember drooling over the exotic 400cc Honda RVF (not to be confused with the VFR) and the techno styled 250cc Honda Hornet.
 *edit: It looked like a mini Ducati Monster, very different to the normal 250 Hornet.

i passed my test 6 week ago and i got a 1988 vfr750fj  , a very powerfull bike even more power than the new vfr,800. 160mph sports tourer but this modal is more of a sports  though. loads of tourque 105bhp even the 2008 models are 97bhp i paid £600 english pounds . i love it, as i say it is a powerfull bike but most bikes are , when you move the throttle 1 mm  it shoots off like a f1 sports car , so dont even think about twisting it all the way round,



this was my first bike ever . respect the power cos it has more power than you actually think, i didnt realise motorbikes was this powerfull. and mines a baby the honda fireblade and yamaha yzf r1 are something else and no beginner should ever think about getting one . they call them the widowers

I've used the ECB,s for years on street, dirt, or track, but I'd check the condition of your rotor and calipers you may be warped or sticking, even cheapo pads don't wear that fast

i have a kaw zx11, and had the exact same problem with the rear pads, turned out that it was the caliper, the pads were not sliding in the caliper correctly, so wne you applied the brakes, one pad would stay pressing against the rotor. the solution, was to use a little high temp grease where they slide. never a problem after that.use just a very small ammoun of grease, otherwise, it will get on the pads.

also check to see that your are not accidentally resting your foot on the brake lever (a common thing to do also), just a slight presure on the lever, can push the pads just enough to wear them out quickly.

-calipier partly siezed, causing pads to  stick, check for signs of  disc over heating
- Poor  quality pads/ soft compound
- poor  riding skills , always  having foot  over brake peddle or using the rear brake only all the time.

I ride using 99% of the time- front brake. My read brake is for  poor road conditions,emergancy stops, or on the rare occasion a corner catches me out and i need to make sublt changes.

if you are riding in sand or mud this will cause them to wear much more quickly, also cheap pads will wear out MUCH quicker than good pads. Something like EBC sintered pads are great and will last you a lot longer.

Hello

1) Stop buying cheap pads, you have a performance bike the pads need to match it.

2) Let a pro change them and see how much longer they last.

3) If you must do it your self, try doing the job with someone there who is experienced to guide you the first time. especially if you have floating callipers.

4) When greasing the back of the brake pads you should use copper slip grease as this is designed for higher temperatures.

This sounds like one of two forms of seizure.  It could be that the pistons are partially seized.  This means that they don't retract when you take your foot from the pedal - so they keep rubbing and wear out.  You can check this by unbolting the caliper (but not the hoses)  - you should be able to push the pads back in by hand.

Some calipers operate on a pivot.  In this case the pistons may move freely, but the seized pivot means that one pad maintains contact.  If you have a pivoted caliper make sure you can move it by hand.  If not then you'll need to dismantle and regrease.

Finally, it could also be a problem with the level mechanism; something like a worn pivot, catching / broken return spring.

most of these problems are fixable by a reasonably competent home mechanic.

As a beginner, if I were to buy a sports bike, would I have to ride it fast?



I like the look of sports bikes and would like to get one as my first big bike. I know they are designed to be ridden at high revs, but does this mean you have to ride hard and fast all the time, or are bikes like the 600s happy to be going 50mph all day?

Thanks!

Don't be daft!  Of course you don't have to ride them flat out all day!

Not at all! How would you stop or ride in traffic if you had to ride it fast constantly!? I have a GSXR 600 and don't ride it fast all the time, yeah I have a blast on it every now and then but not all the time. Don't feel that because there are a** holes out there that ride like complete t***s on their sports bikes that you have to ride like that. Ride how you were taught to ride, not how you think you should ride, thats how accidents happen!

If you are happy going 50mph all day then ride 50 mph all day, the bike will only go as fast as you want it to go and how far you twist the throttle!

Never ever buy a sports bike just for their looks! After a couple of hours sitting on a mouse-mat sized seat you'll be wishing for the kind of sofa-like seat on the old Yamaha FJ1200's.

The smaller the bike the more revs it needs, show small bikes no mercy - rev the n*ts off of them! That's what the limiter is for; you won't do them any harm even running them at the red-line.

For larger bikes - 500cc and up you should be a bit more sensible, you'll know how much power the bike needs by the feel of it.
My advice, until you've fallen off and hurt yourself and you understand the dangers of motorcycles keep your speed well within the speed-limits and obey all the road signs, boy-racers have lots of fun until they come off at 100mph and suffer permanent debilitating injuries.

Scramblers and trail-bikes are hugely good fun and you are less likely to get seriously hurt because the accidents usually happen at relatively low speeds - it's high speed that kills people, not sand-dunes or rocks.

It is not  going to hurt your bike to to run at lower rmp , it will effect your fuel milage as you noted these types of bike run most efficiently at higher rpm. My cruiser says it goes 125 mph, I don't go that fast , I look good going 50 mph : - } I do however get out on the hiway and run it out every now and then just to help keep it clean  on the inside.

From my experience with sports bikes, you can do 50 mph on them quite happily, though the riding position means that it will kill your wrists and back; if you are a slower rider you may want to consider getting a tourer or muscle bike - these are generally much more comfortable and, if you are planning on doing 50 mph all day, more reliable/cheaper on essential wear items. I have a 916 and a v max and to be honest I only really use the max.

To get the best from a sports bike then you have to ride it fast!

But don't even think about it if your a beginner or on the road!

A sports bike is designed to be ridden fast therefore that means ridden on a track where there is no oncoming traffic and plenty of run off areas for when, and not if, you get it wrong!

If you want to ride a bike on the road then get a "softer" more road focused bike like the Suzuki Bandit 600, Honda CBF600, or the Ducati Monster 620.

These will still get you into trouble if you want to ride fast on the road but are more suitable for someone to learn on after passing your test

You may as well experience everything as quickly as possible? If you don't have at least a few weeks on the bike experience, I suggest you don't even get in traffic with it! The faster you go the better the chance of a crash and that is compounded by the fact you have no experience on a "big" bike. Get something you want but just remember that speed doesn't kill, it is that sudden stop that kills.

i went from a zx6 kaw, to a zx11 (with 10+ years of riding), take your time, and get used to the bike, there are many days, when were out riding, ill just slip it into 6th, and idle along enjoying the ride. if you have never ridden a high hp sport bike, then you need to take your time, learn how the bike handles, and learn just how much power they have.  my zx11 can easily burn the rear tire on pavement, and if your not expecting it, your toast. riding a new bike of any type fast, before your completly comfortable with it, is a sure way to get yourself killed in short order.

just because a bike will run 180+ doesnt' mean you need to do it. (it is also a sure way to get yourself in jail)

New production is out of reach at 3000.  You can probably find a used New Bonnie for that if you look.  The Bonnie is probably your best bet due to parts availibility, if nothing else.  Lots of accessories are around, both from Triumph and many aftermarket parts will work nicely.

Around here, you can't find a used Scrambler . . . those who buy them refuse to part with them.

I'm not familiar with the Speed Four here in the US.  Is it a UK-only thing, or do you mean the Speed Triple (or Street Triple)?

With a little tinkering, my 07 Bonneville does just about everything I want it to do.  I had a 71 Bonnie, and there is NO comparison.

Check out the Twin Forum at triumphrat.  Lots of good information there.

My experience of the Hinkley triumphs is limited to two Trophy 1200s and a Sprint RS.  All have really torquey motors - making them really rideable round town and out on the open road.  The earlier Trophy (not the one with the chrome trim that looks like a Rover reject) is the better Trophy, the later ones feel really top-heavy.  Excellent luggage carrying.  My first Trophy went on fine up to the point of write-off at 36k miles.  I sold my second one after a few months because it was too tall.

The RS is slightly harsh on bumpy roads - but stays perfectly on line.  Performance is good, position slightly racey, but okay for commuting.

I've ridden a scrambler.  Fun, but not for all day.  Hard seat, no wind protection.

If your friends ride relatively slowly then the scrambler and ne Bonny will be fine, otherwise you will need more grunt.

As a biker for 40 years I would say no, but there are always exceptions. For instance, at one time a biker wouldn't talk to a scooter rider but that attitude has largely disappeared due, I believe, to the realisation that anyone on two wheels has the same problem - anyone on four (or more) wheels. Most motorcyclists would be more likely to look down on car drivers, mainly because they have so frequently been put in danger by their lack of care and training.

Should be the other way round. Most 'professional' riders, eg couriers are mad, and aren't interested in road safety. Sports riders, if their behaviour on motorways is anything to go by, are worse. Got overtaken by a Jeep towing 2 race bikes on the M6. I was doing 70 in the middle lane, he passed me doing at least 80 in the outside lane. Speed limit 60 and no trailers in the outside lane.

I get paid to ride and I race but not professionally, so I guess you could say I'm professional motorcyclist.  I don't look down on regular motorcycle riders but sometimes I feel sorry for them.  From time to time I meet someone that acts and thinks they know all about bikes.  I feel sorry for them because they will make many mistakes based on their supposed knowledge.  Also if they already know it all, how will they have a mind open enough to ever learn.

I think so. They ride professionally and have a passion for the art of it. When you have a bunch of "little zits" riding around being idiots on public roads detracting from the image and validity of sport bike riding as a real sport.

I wouldn't say that. In reality, there is no such thing as a professional rider. No matter how good you are, there is always someone else that will know more whether it be everything or just about a particular subject. For example, Motorcycle Racers know more about high speed cornering and track riding than someone who rides a cruiser/chopper bike and someone who will do alot alot of touring will know more about riding long distance than someone who just rides to and from work. Do you see my point?

For that reason, I don't think that people that think they are a professional rider, look down on people that are "less" professional than they are. Many bikers down my way, respect each other - we have to as car drivers tend to gang up on us bikers!

I did a search on "inspection tag plate" and came up with a ton of sites.  Here are a few of the sites I found.  The best tag plate I ever saw was made by a friend from stainless steel sheet that mounted on the lower two bolt holes of the license plate.  You can also use aluminum sheet metal to do the same thing.

Does any one know if Honda builds any dual purpose bikes?  I didn't see any listed on their website.  I just got my motorcycle license so I think I would be more comfortable on a bike with turn signals and a speedometer.

What you are actually looking for is a Honda which has a good ground clearance, a raised exhaust (so it doesn't mess with the dirt) and an overall peppy engine.

You will find all this and more in the Honda Varadero 125cc.  It is an extremely comfortable V-twin from Honda with loads of pulling power.  Check it out !

you're new to motorcycles, so for a dual purpose bike you don't need anything bigger than a 250.

Honda made the xr250l from 1991 to 1996
they now sell a street legal crf230l but it is way underpowered, more of a kiddie bike



Kawasaki has the klr250.  the older ones are air-cooled and very simple and reliable.  the newer ones are liquid cooled and have a little more power.

Yamaha has the xt250, which is very similar to the crf230 in thats its outdated and underpowered.

Yamaha also has the wr250r which is the best 250 dualsport machine available, liquid cooled, aluminum frame, fuel injected.  very nice bike, but quite pricey.  they also sell a supermoto version wr250x

Depends on where you live.

In most of the world besides the U.S., Honda sells a full range of street-oriented dual-purpose bikes like the Varadero (1000cc), Africa Twin (750cc), and transalp (600cc).  However, none of those models are sold in the U.S.



Here, you're pretty much limited to the XR series if you're interested in something that can go highway speeds.

Looking at other manufacturers might be necessary if you want to broaden your selection.

Depends on what country and state you live in. No one here is a frikkin' mind reader.

How to apply for a motorcycle or moped driver license if you are under 18

There are two classes of motorcycle licenses, Class M1 and Class M2.



* With a Class M1, you can operate any 2-wheel motorcycle and any motorized vehicle in Class M2.



* With a Class M2, you can only operate any motorized bicycle or moped or any bicycle with an attached motor.

Effective January 1, 2006, you may operate a motorized scooter with a Class M1 or M2 driver license. Prior to January 1, 2006, you must have a Class C or higher driver license to operate a motorized scooter.

A motorized scooter is defined as: A two-wheeled "device" powered by a motor with a floorboard that is designed to stand on when riding. The scooter may also have a driver’s seat.

Refer to the Motorcycle Driver Handbook for more information.

To apply for a motorcycle Class M1 or M2 permit, you will need to:



* Be at least 15 ½ years of age



* Visit a DMV office (make an appointment for faster service)



* Complete application form DL 44 (An original DL 44 form must be submitted. Copies obtained by Xeroxing, faxing, or other methods will not be accepted.)



* Have your parents’ or guardians’ signatures on the application form DL 44



* Give a thumb print



* Have your picture taken



* Submit proof you have completed both driving education and driver training. (DL 387, DL 388, DL 388A, OL 237, or OL 238)



* Present an acceptable birth date/legal presence document.



* Provide your true full name.



* Provide your social security number. It will be verified with the Social Security Administration while you are in the office.



* Pay the required application fee. This fee is good for 12 months and allows you to take the appropriate law test(s) and skills test three times, if needed, within the 12 month period. This fee pays for both the instruction permit and driver license, if you qualify within that time period. If the application expires, it becomes void and all steps must be completed again.



* Pass an vision exam.



* Pass a traffic laws and signs test.



* Pass an additional law test of motorcycle driving rules.



OR



* Show your California driver license, if you have one issued to you.



* Pay the application fee



* Pass a vision exam



* Pass a traffic laws and signs test for motorcycles

It depends on the amount of CCs the bike has.

In Pennsylvania, you can have a scooter under 50 CCs with a regular license; you just can't go on highways or other roadways with a speed limit over 45 mph. You are also required to wear a helmet and eye gear.

I'm just making an assumption here, but I don't think there are any scooters made by Vespa under 50 CCs. You might want to consider a scooter from another company.

I recommend the Genuine Scooter Company. The Buddy Italia is my favorite model and is available in 50 CCs.

I'd suggest getting a motorcycle endorsement by taking a msf course.  You'll probably need the endorsement if the engine is over 50cc, but even if you don't, it will teach you a lot about accident avoidance.  Just because you don't need a special license to ride it doesn't mean it's the same as driving a car.

Yes, you do need a license. But it is not hard to get. It just takes some time to study. Make your appointment asap as there can be a waiting list. Also sign up for the MSF's safety rider course. You'll be a safer and more confident rider if you do.



Scooter riding is fun, but like cars or bicycles they can be dangerous, so keep yourself informed and take it seriously.



I have been riding scooters since 1995, my boyfriend has been riding since 1987! I didn't take the course, so it took me a few tries to pass the written test (I hate to study). I wish I had taken it. It would have helped my riding abilities. I have lots of friends that ride and they helped me learn how to be a better rider.



Good luck!

Your question and explanation really dont make any sense...you want a rigid frame but dont want to limit its abilities, yet you want to mess around on dirt and trails? HUH?



If youve got a street bike with a rigid frame you wont be taking it off road dude. lmao. I can picture it now...Ill spare you the disasterous details i envision, it aint good.



to answer the wheelie question...dude..once again..its a rigid frame for a rigid reason. It isnt made / designed to "wheelie". Im sure it would bring the front wheel off the ground, but thats not a wheelie. Most rigid frames are designed for the choppers, longer rake etc... you can muster up the front no problem, but 12 inches isnt a wheelie, although your harley guys may all claim to ride wheelies, ive yet to be impressed by one in 27 years of riding.  If you have envisioned yourself on a street bike with a rigid frame doing 12 oclock wheelies youve no business on a bike in the first place.



Im going out on a very short limb here and assume you dont ride, and if you have any experience at all its not much. Not bashing you bro, just pointing out your quest for rigid wheelies and trail riding makes as much sense as a rain suit in the desert.



I love the rigid look and feel, you get it all, but you suffer in other areas as well. Azz hurts, back kills and throttling thru a turn in the wet can be an artform in of itself. best of luck.

Why do many motorcycles, including the most up-to-date models, not have fuel gauges?



I am new to motorcycles and the only thing that puts me off buying anything larger than my current scooter is that many do not seem to have fuel gauges; I would be a bit cautious about this as I would not want to run out of fuel twenty miles from the nearest town!



Why do some bikes not have gauges, and does this really make things as difficult as I imagine they might be?



I particularly like the Bonneville and Speed Four, and have been told neither of these has a fuel gauge....and that seems strange!

It's to do with where you could put the sensor. In a car you might get a slight difference in the gauge going up or down hill, but on a bike it would be a big difference so it would be useless.

On a bike you have a reserve tank, so if you run out of fuel you just turn on the reserve until you get to a petrol station.

while I do not have a fuel gauge on any bike , I do have a reserve switch in the event I forget to fill up before i go out. It is extremely easy to check your fuel level and the reserve usually will carry you about 20 to 40 miles depending on your bike . No need for a fuel gauge.

Im no expert on this side of things. But when Im teaching my pupils I tell them that if they do have a fuel gauge to never trust it as they are never usually 100% accurate and to look into the fuel tank. Ive had bikes with fuel gauge and I apparently had a full tank of fuel but when I looked into the tank I only had half a tank of fuel!

That would my guess anyway. Bike have a reserve tank which you can turn on and that will usually give you enough fuel to get to a fuel station. I always try to find out how many miles a bike will do to a tank of fuel before it will need to be put onto reserve so I can keep an eye on how many miles Ive done. Not only that, I always have a look into the tank before I go out and fill it up if needed and keep it topped up.

Probably not and expertise answer but thats what I do.

There's a true and tested way that proves that modern motorcycles do not need fuel gauges.......its worked since the beginning of time!!!
Undo the fuel cap, look in and wiggle the bike from side to side, if you see petrol, its a full tank and if you only hear it, its near empty.
and beside you've always got reserve to go over to!

Lots of bikes do have fuel gauges, but many just have either a low fuel warning light or a reserve switch (or both).
The reason is that most tanks are only two to three gallons, and bikes tend to have a pretty regular consumption - you'll get to know how often you need to fill it, and it's easy enough to open the filler & look if you're unsure.
Trust me, you'll be fine.

ps My first VFR750 had a VERY accurate gauge - I used to leave the fuel tap on reserve all the time as I could trust the level gauge. I never ran out!

I just reset the trip odometer and I know to fill up before I get to about 150mi.  If I forget, the engine coughs a bit, I turn the petcock to reserve, and I stop at the next station.  If you've got a long stretch between stations, top off.

The Triumph Bonneville's and the Triumph Thunderbird's I rode back in the '60's did not have fuel gauges. It was just as easy to remove the tank cap and look down into the tank and get your fuel level. I did not get a fuel gauge until I bought a big Jap four in the 1980's. Many bike manufacturers don't fit them anymore as it is their way of cutting costs, but, judging from the price of some particular bikes today, you really begin to wonder if any of those savings in costs are passed onto the consumer!

most bikes are fitted with a reserve tap...2 diferent length tubes fitted inside the tank to the tap...fuel on lets the taler pipe feed the engine.as the fuel gets lower the longer pipe wont feed it,the bike tells the rider its getting lowon fuel so the fider simply turns the tap onto reserve [using the smaller tube]...about a gallon is left in the tank...then you simply drive to the garage,fill upend turn the tap back to on instead of reserve...

I'm with you on this one.  It is merely down to cost or more to the point "profit"

It really would not cost much to incorperate even the crudest manual guage into the tank and save a great deal of grief into the bargain

I've been lucky as my previous 5 bikes have had guages. 2 goldwings a BMW and 2 harleys

dont worry to much if a bike as or does not have a fuel guage

1  visible look into the tank

2 shake the bike lisen for the fuel

3 when u fill the  bike up  make sure  the fuel tap is on the  full /on marker
if a bike as no fuel gauge  i can guarantee it has a trip switch set it to 00000 run the bike untill it stops ( out of fuel )  take a reading from the trip switch  00150 remember that now you know your bike  can do 150 miles to a full tank
always set the trip switch to 0000 when you fill up check it regular when you get to say 00120 miles think abot filling that tank up you got a safe 30 miles to find fuel if your in the middle of nowhere and fuel is say 40 miles away you got your  30 miles left of fuel from  a full/on tank and you also can use your reserve tank which wil do another 25 miles so u are covered and can reach  the fuel station without any worry

4 remember if you have had to use reserve to get you to a fuel station when you fill the bike up take the tap from reserve back to the fuel on position



IF YOU DONT then next time you stop out of fuel you got to push it  as you have used your reserve ( emergency ) fuel up

5 how much fuel do i have in the tank ?  OK  lets say it takes 6.00 to fill up so i can do 150 miles to6.00
check your trip reading it say 00050
means now that you have used a 1/3 rd of your fuel you have left  4.00 worth of fuel in your tank that will take you another 100 miles before you run out



so now is it a big worry or concern if a bike has or not a fuel gauge
ANSWER = no

so now ive explained all that you can get that bike you love because you  can work it out
see how easy it can be



hopes  the above as answered your question

Well it depends on the overall cost of the bike. Manufacture  decisions and also consumer requirements.

Generally speaking  if the bike doesn't have a fuel gauge then it will have a three way tap on the tank.
Off- stops fuel going to carb
On/main- takes fuel  from upper part of tank- you fill up and ride until the bike begins to run out of fuel by spluttering.
Res -  takes fuel from the bottom of the tank- you turn onto this setting when youve used the main- head to the petrol station within 20miles and fuel up- then switch back to  On/main setting.

Some bikes have a diffrent tap set up, which is associated with CV carbs. These taps have a diaphram in them, that opens the fuel supply from the tank once the engine is running. So the tap will have a diffrent set up
Prime- lets fuel  to floats
Main- as explained earlier
Res-  ""
On this set up  the fuel is shut off once the engine is off. You use the tap the same way as explained earlier- switching from  main- res....

some bikes have fuel gauges , but how accurate they are is another thing. Fuel level changing on a motorcycle, when  riding about. I have a kawasaki GT550 and the  fuel  reading goes up or down depending on what i do, so i  actuatly  have the tank tap permantly on RES and use the  trip counter. If i fill up with a tenner then i know i must come back to fuel up in about 100 miles or so.

Well I was a school Caretaker and on June 16th this year I was acussed of theft and escorted from my school, I had been there 19 years. Earlier that year a colleague was also escorted from the school and has been dismissed. His crime was that he was dull enough to be caught using his PC for personal stuff ebay, msn and so forth.

I came across a document which alleged certain activities and these were investigated by the Police, and nothing was found and that part of the case was dropped.



In my case on the 16th June I was matched in front of a Human Resources manager from the Council and my Headteacher. I was not given a chance to have a colleague or even a Union rep and in that meeting I was told that I would be investigated for theft by the police and then escorted right across the school and thrown out. The school decided that the Police investigation would be dropped. By this time I did not fancy medication and I wanted counciling(thats a story all by itself!)

Next day I went to the Union and met a right burke, he gave me  his email address and he called himself sparticus! Well thats fine but he went down the council offices like a bull in a china shop. Sadly by this time I was on medication from the Doctor and the investigation meeting and disciplinary meeting did not go to well, because he allowed to waffle a bit.



Anyhow the final meeting is called an Sparticus went on holiday, leaving me to the Branch secretary and some idiot who allows you to see a lawyer. Both these apathetic sad souls were to support me, but I was lied too. The Branch sec said that the appeal meeting would not ahead on the 14th but at the end of this Month. I did not go and neither did they. Today I recieved the final dismissal notice.



The story of the Counciling for stress. In the first month I asked for counciling, oh yes I was told you can have 3 x free ones. A counciler had been appointed and due to get in contact within days. Days went by and I talked to my personal Spartan and he said that the counciler had been touch but couldnt get hold of me. So I complianed and another month went by. Its coming up to August and all of a sudden I'm told to report to a Counciler, so I did, but wished I had'nt he was one of those cold slimey people that you have too see. Anyhow he told within 3 days I would be appointed a counciler. On the 4th day I rung him and his answer machine told me that he was off till the middle of August. Not one to accept a negative I rung his boss. If you wont something done see a woman!

She was lovely and within a few hours I was sitting with a counciler! Sadly as we talked, she suggested that because I seemed to be hiding behind humour. I could be far damaged mentally than I thought I was.

So me therapist thinks I'm a nutter!  Can you imagine my first interview...what special qualities do you have...Oh eerrr I'm a nutter!

So there's always someone far worse off than you! Gis'a Job!

Engine and chassis/frame number/should both be the same ?



If they dont match...is it a problem ? Does it mean the bike has replacement/stolen parts ? Thanks.

The numbers on the motor and frame should match, if they don't..then yes that would indicate that the motor has been changed. Doesn't mean it has stolen parts, it just means the motor is not the one that came on the frame.

Either the motor was blown and changed, or the bike was down so hard that it damaged the frame and they found a donor frame and swapped everything to it.

As far as stolen parts go...I would definately have the numbers ran on the fram and motor, they tend to be a little easier on receiving stolen goods if you initiate the check, than they are if a year or two goes by and you get pulled over and they check it.

But yep, the answer is the numbers should match.

About 15 years ago, having the same engine & chassis number was the norm.  However this practice is no longer being followed for reasons best known to the manufacturers.  The current trend shows the engine and chassis numbers to be totally different and distinctive.

So ... please put your mind at rest.  If the two numbers on your vehicle, match with the numbers given in your Registration book, it is OK and valid.

Motorbike gear changes?



When doing the direct access course my instructor told me I must not change down from fitth gear to first in one go (in fact he said each gear change must be done individually). When driving a car this is fine, such as when preparing stop at an on coming roundaout etc. Why did my bike instructor tell me it was wrong on a bike. Now I have a bike I change down to first quickly (by clicking down until it stops) and have had no problem. In a car no damage is done to your gearbox by changing gear out of sequence. Is this true for bikes also? Why did my instructor tell me this? Sometimes I just feel it is appropriate to change down like this (Aprroaching T-Junctions etc).

mmmmm,im not sure,
that may just be his way of teaching...its always better to engine brake,it shows your one with the bike...but in some instances 5th to 1st is the only way...bit of a funny one that....ill be back later to view others answers.
bike and car gearboxes are complitly different...in a car you just bypass other gears,on a bike you have to pass one gear to get to another....clicking in to first gear at speed[even with the clutch in] can cause damage.

your instructor is right, you must be in control of your bike at all times, hence fifth to fourth is , clutch in, rev slightly to increase engine speed, engage fourth release clutch and so on. if you did 5th to 1st in 4 taps on the gear lever, when you let the lever out you  will find that the bike actually jumps/wheel lock/tyre squeal and you might let go of the bars and in icicy/wet conditions you might come off. changing from 5th to 1st is ok when stationery(but then you should slow down using gears and apply brakes when you want to actually stop. Riding with the clutch in while you change from 5th to 1st in one means you are actually freewheeling and hence no feel for speed/road conditions

Unless you're Casey Stoner, it's much better to change gears one at a time.

ALWAYS use the clutch to change, up and down. I don't care what some "expert" may or may not have told you, and everyone on Y!A, ALWAYS clutch your gearchanges. I have helped many friends rebuild gearboxes with bent selector forks and shafts, and rounded dogs...

You can shift from 5th to 1st without any harm to the transmission.
The transmission cannot be shifted out of sequence in one motion like a car.
The transmission is designed to only shift to the next gear, then another gear change is required to shift to the next gear (up or down).

That's what your instructor was saying - a car, you can shift from 4th directly into 1st in one motion.
A Motorcycle - you have to go through every gear 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st.

For practical purposes, it's advised to shift one gear at a time, to match the road speed you're traveling at.
When you slow down, shift to the next appropriate gear.
Think in these terms - your riding at 60mph on the highway - pull in the clutch and quickly down shift to 1st (you're still going 60mph) - then coast for 2 miles until you get off the exit ramp and are ready to merge.

What if you had to make an emergency maneuver to avoid an accident? If you let out the clutch to speed around the hazard, your transmission is in 1st and the engine would never be able to rev high enough to go 60mph in 1st gear - the engine would blow up and you would not have the ability to accelerate and avoid an accident.

In simple terms - your coming up to an intersection at 30mph in 3rd, when you slow down to 20mph shift to 2nd, when you slow down to 10mph shift to 1st.
This way you're always in the proper gear to quickly acellerate out of trouble.
If you want to coast with the clutch lever pulled in, that's fine.
Make sure you're in the proper gear by releasing the clutch a fraction to see if the gear you're in matches the road speed.
Try it.

1. You never change from 5th to 1st in a car unless you dont know how to  drive!.



When i  drive a car- i change from 5th( which on most vehicles is an overdrive gear) to 4th, then  to 3rd/2nd. First is for starting from a stand-still
2. The basic method to rride a motorcycle is to  select each gear 1-2-3-4-5- 4-3-2-1. If you plan well ahead and know your bike well then you will have the correct rpms, and speed for the next gear. To me this is a more controlled way compaired to  'block changes'(  method used on 1). I use this method as it gives me maxium gear range/peak and engine braking. 
For a novice  your less lightly to lock the rear wheel up if you use  the basic method.
3. Some riders use block changes on motorcycles- although i dont see the point nor value in it as i think its a waist of time, energy and costs more money- but each to thier own. If you ride using this method on your test- youll probably fail on it- as its not what the examineer is looking for. But even if after passing your test, if your riding in 5th gear on a motorcycle and  drop it down to 1st , you  either going to have to  use excessive braking to slow the bike down, let the bike slow down a hell of a way or  you will lock the back end up and possible throw yourself off.
If you coast- i.e holding the clutch lever in, then your breaking the law, as its an offence to  'coast'- and you will fail your test on that too

Hello

Think about it, in a car you select the gear. On a bike you have a sequential gear box. On most bikes you click down for first then up past neutral to second then you have to click up through the gears. On  car you can start in first then change to third if you want as you can select the gears. You could just pull in the clutch and hold it in until you stop but you would still have to click down the gears to find neutral, and coasting out of gear is classed as driving without control of the vehicle. You can change down as quick as you like but to quick and you risk high wear on the gear box,sprockets, chain ect.

What are the conditions like commuting to work on a 125cc motorbike from Putney (or nearby) to Central London



Hi

I am moving to Putney shortly and am not looking forward to the SW trains sardine can service to Waterloo. I work in Farringdon so it would be a train to waterloo and a bus (243) to Farringdon which isn't great. Tubing it would take even longer I think and also be a fairly tight squeeze.

For these and other reasons, I am thinking of doing my CBT so I can buy a 125cc bike and drive to work. Google maps and theaa.com say it takes about 25 minutes (it's 7.2 miles) but I don't think this factors in traffic during peak hours (8am-9am and 6pm-7pm).

Does anyone else drive a similar route from an SW location to central London on a motorbike or scooter?
If so what are the conditions like (i.e. traffic, wet weather driving, driving time, road rage ;) etc).

Many Thanks

Make sure that you take your cbt on a 125 geared bike or you will only be able to drive a 50cc scooter. The best and most reliable comuter is the honda CG 125. You can also use it to take you lessons and final test on. You can not take your final test on a scooter, it has to be a geared 125cc. If you passed your car test before 2001you can ride a 50cc scooter.

You will need to put a smaller tooth rear sprocket on it, stock i think that the rappy is good for high 60's low 70's so you will need a change of more then just 1 or 2 teeth. Also put a plus 1 or 2 teeth front sprocket on the machine.

However if you go this route you will loose your low end power. The acceleration will take longer and it will be more likely to stall.

You can do it your self, it is fairly easy you should just need hand tools. You will need the t sprockets and a new long chain, you will take the links out of the chain that you need to make it fit.

Bro, Id call Suzuki and find out what they offer. If they dont have what you need there are tons and tons of aftermarket companies that specialize in what you need. PUIG is a good place to start.



Goto www.wera.com..they have forums there that can assist you in locating anything you may need, plus the advantage of that site is, most participants are racers, they are always unloading shiit at decent prices. Alot of time they strip their bikes and have parts left over they dont need or use, its sorta like a huge online garage sale for bikes. good luck!

Carrying pillion is pretty easy. You need to remember that the extra weight will mean your acceleration will be affected and you will need to brake sooner. I can't possibly give you specifics as it will vary from bike to bike and person to person; but after a mile or so you should have it down. The pillion must be told to lean with the bike and hold on tight - from my experience a first time pillion will feel like they are going to fall off and try leaning the other way as soon as you bank the bike over so it's always wise just to have a little chat with them to make sure they know not to fight you in your control of the machine. Other than that check the owners manual for differing tyre pressures and chain tension if you are going to be carrying pillions on a regular basis and you should be fine.

Hi, not difficult at all, but you will feel a little different the very first time you take someone on the back.

You will immediately notice you feel a little less stable when not moving and taking the new added weight on your leg when standing still. You may well feel a little more wobbly as you pull off too depending on the bike you have.

The main factors to think about is, stopping distances, weight/centre of gravity and depending on whether the pillion is holding on to you or a grab rail etc hard acceleration/hard braking and how this will affect them on the back.

On another note, mirrors can sometimes become useless once you have another body on the back. My 998 mirrors were crap with a pillion.



Also make sure the pillion is comfortable riding on the rear and isnt going to bugger around while you are riding. I have a friend who moved around like a tranformer on the back, a real pain if you are filtering between slow or stopped traffic.

The highway code will state you should check air pressure in tyres and fork rebond, rear shock strength etc but who the hell would do that each time?

Most of all, the biggest consideration is you now have their life in your hands, if you like to cane it about and dont mind risking your own life, just remember you could now injury or even kill them through your actions not theirs, dont be tempted to show off too much.

Also wheelies are harder with a pillion due to the balance point going to pot.

Ride safe and good luck

One is the additional weight. Two, it will affect your acceleration to some degree. Three, if your pillion has no experience and has never been on the back of a bike before, it would be wise to inform them of leaning with you as you go into a bend, and negotiating a corner.
A pillion that wants to lean in the opposite direction can actually bring the bike upright with dire consequences! The pillion should work with the rider and ideally ride as one.

piece of cake...no different then riding solo,just a little heavyer...
its all down the the passenger/pillion...its so easy for them to lean the wrong way or even try to sit up strait when your cornering...very,very hard for the rider not to wrap it...just exsplain to the pillion to sit still,not to move,just go with the bike...if u intent to welly it tell them to put one hane on your waistbelt and the other on the grab rail...this will stop them falling off or head butting you when chainging gears.

It may not be the starter motor - It may be a flat battery or partially seized engine. Take the spark plugs out & try squirting a bit of WD40 into the cylinders & moving the bike whilst in gear to free up the latter.

they can be if you have the wrong kind of bike, seat or dont take precautions.
1) bikes that are best long distance are TOURING BIKES, followed by



CRUISERS, Followed by SPORTS BIKES, followed by CHOPPERS



or BAR BIKES.
2) Seats like corbon and mustang cost around $500.00 US and will



allow you to be comfortable for greater amounts of time.
3) Taking a 5 minute get off and walk break every 1 to 2 hours will

It will let more air in than the standard filter (which will probably be even more restrictive if its old and dirty) but you'll only benefit by putting a larger main jet in the carb so the bike doesnt run too lean. Lean engines will also run hotter and hence be prone to seizing, so if you do go for a race filter then make sure you get the jetting sorted!



The malossi filter combined with the set up you already have (big bore kit and race exhaust) should give you a fair bit more power once re jetted to suit. Good luck!

This is the closest manual to your bike I can find.
http://www.autorepairmanuals.biz/site/57...
As you can see, it covers from 1979 - 2003 - Honda rarely change their engine configurations when they make something that works.
This manual was probably last printed in 2003 - and later year bikes just added updated pages (Honda does that quite often to save on re-printing new manuals).
The XL model is exactly the same as the XR, except the XL has additional components to make it street legal - battery, head light, tail light, turn signals, horn and street legal tires.

Can help with honda wiring?



have just put a c50 engine into a c90 frame. the newer c90 had elec start and has six wires on loom and deff colours.but the c50 only has four wires coming out of engine and has points in it how do i wire this up and do i need defferent coil if so what type

Easiest option would be to get the rest of the running gear from a C50. Have you also installed the carb from the C50? There is a chance that the diameter of the carb will be different, the size of main and pilot jets will almost definatley be different between the 50 and the 90. In fact, easiest option would be to just buy a C50 in the first place!



As for the coil, download a parts fiche for both the C50 and the C90 and check the part numbers match up, if they're different then you'll need the C50 coil too.

Hi,
Well from what you say it sounds like your C90 may have been CDi. The other two wires probably come from the pickup coil on the c90 motor

I would look into seeing if its possible to put the C90 engine electrics on the C50 motor. Other wise you will need to replace the coil for a c50 coil and remove the cdi unit off the bike.
To wire up a points igniton its simply a case of having a switched live to the coil and the coil grounded out via a condensor and the points.

I dont understand why anyone would want to downgrade a 90 to a 49cc! - hey each to thier own!.

Also, as the other  person you may need to replace the carb, but i would say if the diameter of the inlet port is the same as the  inside diamenter of the outlet of the carb- then i may run fine.

How do Motorcycle racers/riders test their lean limits without low-siding?



Seems to me that in order to master how far you can get over around an apex, you would NEED to low-side at one point (on the track at least).  Do they have any form of training tools to help them reach and learn this limit?

What about riders on the road? Is it just as far over as you can go without hitting the pegs on the street?
Thanks

personally, I just did a lot of reasearch on tires...

found the best tires for my application, and i can drag pegs all day long...

trust your tires, get off the seat, and go for it, get that knee down

after a spirited ride, look at your tires... If you aren't pushing the limits you will see an unused portion of tire on the sides of the dreadwidth, these are called "chicken strips", if you see these chicken strips, you know you have more tread left, and you can lean over further than you were...

work on getting your chicken strips smaller and smaller, eventually you will have none, and will be taking corners at maximum bank...

There is the Lean/Slide trainer bike, which have a type of "training wheel" setup so you cannot fall totally over to one side.

http://www.superbikeschool.com/machinery...

Others may do it the old fashioned way and possibly take a fall once inawhile while wearing proper safety gear.

It would be stupid, to try to learn to lean all the way down as far as possible on the open road.  That isn't the proper place to learn.

Take the bike to a track where if you go down, there isn't a car coming at you.

I've low sided and high sided so many times I'm used to it. In fact, I usually yell WEEEEEEEEE!!! when I go down on the track. It's funny as hell to people in the stands.

I mauled down a whole row of cones on the side of the track coming in from the tracks backside bank turn at about 50mph, due to a front wheel stand while backing it in gone wrong during braking. Completely highsided over the bars and rolled for about 3 seconds straight, got run over by my own bike, got back up to get someones handlebar smacking my hand flyin by.

You don't necessarily need to low side to find the limits. Many have including myself. Usually you will drag hard parts, engine cases, pegs before the tires give out especially with super low speed sharper corners.
As you are getting close to the limit of tire traction on a higher speed corner where you don't really drag parts to make the turn you start to feel the bike drift. A two wheel drift is an awesome feeling, like walking the razor's edge. As long as you stay smooth your good to go otherwise call in the ambulance.
The best training for the turn is some flat track riding on a smaller bike (l150cc or less) that dosent flick you off like a bug.
Check out American super camp. It highly recommended. Best fun you'll have learning to slide a bike.

Look at it this way, the first Husqvarna was made in 1903, so they have a bit of history!

Huskys are mad, bad and great fun to ride.

They make Hondas look a bit cute and fluffy in comparison...

Expensive - I bought a  52 reg 15,000 miles 100cc vivacity with tax & mot for £150. All it needed was a new drive belt and I've put 2,000 miles on it just adding petrol and oil when needed.

If I were him I would take a ride on it away from YOU. You sound like you want to control everything he does. You aren't happy with his decision to buy it, tell him he isn't allowed to do something, and don't think he loves you? The biggest problem I see is you called his bike a bicycle. Maybe he should go get a girl that appreciates what a guy is all about? Tell him you care and act proud of his accomplishments when he actually does complete the courses and gets his license.

How the heck does loving you have anything to do with wanting to ride a motorcycle? That is the relevance of the bicycle?

. Notice I didn't tell you what that was- and it could be a number of different thing. But, be prepared to be looking for another boyfriend. Preventing someone from doing things that they enjoy- that are not illegal, immoral, or patently dangerous- is not the job of a girlfriend. If you don't like his choices, find yourself a different guy.

BTW: Motorcycles are not patently dangerous. playing with propane torches near a gas station- now, that is.

You're right on one point. He's NOT allowed to ride it without doing a licence. If he comes off the bike he's not insured and if he should kill someone other than himself he'll get well and truly nagged (and t-bagged) by Big Ron his cell mate for a few years. The loves me bit and allowing bit? Get real. When he passes his test you can go out on the back. Perhaps he's rebelling but he is def breaking the law. Hide his keys or grass him up because it's c**ts like him who keep my insurance premiums up.

In the UK you can't ride a motorcycle without road tax, insurance and a valid MOT.  Even then if you have not passed your test you can only ride up a 125cc with no more power than 11kw/14.6bhp providing you sit and pass your CBT course.

If you are in the UK then he is breaking the law and is up to your what you do, if you are in another country then I don't know the laws but still it's up to you what you do about it.

I don't think you will get any good answers in here as most of us are motorcyclists.

I find it funny at the wide range of answers to this question...

the factory probably recommends 32:1 which is drastically on the too much oil side but they have to do it to keep someone from burning up the engine.

as proven by countless hours on a variety of bikes, you can easily run your bike at 40:1 under heavy riding conditions for hard practice or racing in an MX environment OR drop to 50:1 for play / trail riding.

I would recommend using a good quality synthetic or semi-synthetic motorcycle racing 2 stroke oil.  my preference has been golden spectro for the past 28 years as it seems to burn cleanly with very little spooge / slobbering out the tail pipe.

How do I check/fill the gearbox oil on my suzuki ay50 katana ?



Bought this bike at the weekend, but I don't have a manual.
I presume the gearbox is supposed to have oil in and I want to check but I can't find the oil drain and filler plugs.



Can anyone help me please. 
thanks in anticipation, Dave.



</question>



<additional details>



OK, thanks for the advice.  I asked at the local scooter shop.

The only oil is in the rear wheel hub (which is tiny btw) and there is a 12mm head bolt located on the rear lhs of the hub casing which seals the filler hole.

Note that there is no oil required at the engine end.  I mean that at the engine end of the drive belt the drive mechanism and kick start gear is not lubricated.  So my squeaky, graunchy kick start lever that won't self-return needs a closer exam with the side cover off....

I'm having a lot of problems with my moped again?



Thing is I have just had it serviced and it lost drive on the A6 in Derbyshire on the way back AND during rush hour! It's speed dropped to a VERY dangerous 7mph.
It's a very narrow road and I was terrified.
I've sent it back this morning via the RAC with a note for the service manager telling him about it and that I'm not happy.
Any ideas as it had just had a new drive belt and gear rollers!
I am P****d off as I am hoping to be out this week on it cos it's give good weather!

well if you sent it to the shop, they will tell you. But if you mean the engine rev's high but the bike goes no where then itsin the drive train. I dont know if your moped has gears, but its either the drive belt or gears (Little auto shifter)

Buying my first bike, looking at a Harley?



Well I've finally gotten to the point in my life where I can buy a bike. I'm looking mainly at Harley Davidson's and have narrowed it down to a few, namely: 1985 Sportster 1000, 2008 Sportster 833 Low, 2007 Sportster Nightster. Just wondering if anyone has an opinion on these bikes, and which would be good for driving around town and taking trips on two-lane highways. (Not too excited about riding on the four-lane). Thanks!

Ok, Your new to bikes. Great ! welcome! hope you took the msf course so we don't hear about you getting hurt (i'm sure you did).
 If you want a harley, that's ok. But don't buy the older harley. You wont enjoy having to fix it all the time.



In the old days sportsters were the bike, today they are beginner bikes and because of their weight, alot of women enjoy them also. The 883 and the nightster are both sportsters and would be great beginner bikes. They don't however hold resale value very well. Now that's actually good news for you , see you should buy a 2 to 3 year old low mile sportster. You can get it at about half price and sell it for about the same a year or 2 later if you decide riding is for you and you want a bigger bike.
hope this helped ! .

I made sure to take a safety course before even thinking of buying a bike. Found a sweet 07 nightster with a few miles on it that I'm going to check out. I'll have to wait on buying a bigger bike, because I've just always liked that style of bikes. (similar to older triumphs and enfields)

The 883 sporty would make a good cross town, state hi way, short trip (50 miles) bike. It is also a reasonable choice to begin riding. You can handily trade it back in on a more suitable cruiser in a year.

I use to think I wanted a Harley first.  That was back when I thought every cruiser I saw was a Harley.  Then I looked into some of the Jap cruisers.  I have a Yamaha now and am much happier with the ride than the Harleys I've ridden.  I will still eventually get a Harley Road Glide but not to use as a dailey commuter like my Yamaha.  Much better handling (imo), cheaper to maintain and customize.  Just my $.02.

To me, Sportsters seem to have too short a wheelbase and don't handle all that well .



Everyone I know who has a 1200 Sportster has money tied up in performance parts to make them run, as well.
The 883 is a marketing tool to get you to buy a bigger HD, a "suitable cruiser" to quote your first respondent.

Except for Bill's input you got nothing but totally biased and absolutely useless answers. Please for your own sake take my advice. Disregard anything you have read here and create an account on hdforums.com, it only takes a second. The knowledge there is so far superior to what you will get on YA it's ridiculous. This place for the most part is an absolute joke, especially when the word Harley is involved. If you want a Harley nothing else is going to satisfy you regardless of what anyone says. Good luck with whatever you choose to ride.

good choice for a first bike. a sportster will do just fine on the interstate. get one of the newer ones though, the 85 ironheads ( their last year) had a problematic charging system that was only made for a few years.
also an 85 still has solid lifters that require adjustment periodically.
the evo sportys have hydraulic lifters & never need the valves adjusted.

buy a 5-10yr old mid sized jap bike and ride it for a year.  After you but some miles on that, then go buy the bike that you want to keep for a long time.Sportster are fine for putting around town or 200 mile days but anything longer than that, you would want something a bit sturdier.

If you are going to want to modify it, intake, exhaust etc. then go for the older carbed one. Otherwise, the new injected one would give better reliability.

Harley Davidson makes overpriced, underperforming, overhyped motorcycles that any sane person would steer clear of.  Why should you wait up to 6 months just so you can pay extra for the name?

There are hundreds of other bikes out there that cost less, ride and handle better, and outperform anything Harley makes.  Look a little harder to get the best value for your dollar.

Factory pressures are between 250 - 300
When rebuilding, it's recommended to start at 150 PSI (softest) and increase 25 PSI after each test ride, until you get the correct feel for your riding habits

I did that for several years. First bike was a 125 scooter which was fun, very cool in traffic, but was dangerous (IMHO) on hills as it slowed down too much. Then I got an Aprilia Pegaso 650 - probably the best city bike as it was tall, narrow, comfortable and dirt-cheap to run. Although it was a great commuter bike wasn't so good on long journeys so I got a BMW R1150GS instead. Not quite so practical as a commuter due to physical size in still traffic, and lower fuel economy, but much much better for long journeys. 6 years later I still own it! I'd still rate the Pegaso as a commuter bike, or its equivalent such as BMW F650GS, Honda Varadero / Transalp, Suzuki V-Strom 650 etc. I also like the look of the Kawasaki Versys, which I reckon might just be the best new commuter bike on the market at the moment.

Yes you can, but Seafoam is a better product and the best product I have ever found is the "Johnson-Evinrude" (Bombardier) 2 Cycle Carb Cleaner for outboard motors, Mercury works as well because a friend could not find the Johnson-Evinrude and settled for the Mercury -  it solved his issue that Gumout could not.



Drain your gas tank, if you can - drain the carb bowl, remove the fuel line from the tank, and pour one of these directly and at full strength in the line and allow it to soak for two days. Drain the bowl, for good measure run more cleaner through and drain it immediately (when it comes out clear, you're good) refit the fuel line, and  add a small amount of gas to the tank. Try starting it.

This would be the simple method to try -BEFORE you pull the carb and and try to disassemble and clean it.

You would be surprised how many times this method has worked for people and it's proof that all carb cleaners are not made alike. It's not a guaranteed method, but a tried and true method that just happens to work many times saving you and others a lot of time and trouble.

You could get direct accsess to to motorcycle riding.
However if you are under 21 your licence will be limited to 33bhp for a couple of years so why not practice then?

If you anxious to get in before the new test - then dont worry, its been delayed until 31 March 2009.

So, when you got to your CBT, see how you feel and what feedback your instructor gives you and use this to make your decision on wether you feel confident enough into going straight into the full test, or you would benefit from taking a couple of months to get used to riding and build up experience and confidence.

Its perfectly do-able either way, i know loads of people who have gone from no-riding experience, to CBT to DAS course and passed first time. All within the space of a week.

Whatever you decision, good luck and ride safe!

Are you big enuff to pick up a bigger bike, The size is less concern than the price. You will fall down and scratch the bike up along with broken mirrors,pegs and levers.
If you are careful a bigger bike will serve you well, remember a bike can go 130+MPH but doesn't have to.

When I started riding (in the U.S.) in 2001, I took a motorcycle safety class and rushed out and bought a BMW F650GS.  After struggling with it (primarily off road) for a couple months, I parked the Beemer and bought a Yamaha XT225, which I put about 3K miles on before giving the BMW another try.  By then, I'd learned learned a lot about how to properly carry speed through a corner and how to handle a plethora of off-road situations.  Starting on a small bike would've saved me a lot of frustration and money (BMW parts aren't cheap!); I strongly suggest starting on the smallest bike that suits your purpose and moving on to a larger bike when you outgrow it, even if that's in just a few months.

Good Luck!

I did my CBT last year and then bought a 125 between me and my fella. I went on it once and hated it. I passed my full bike test this year in May I was really nervous but passed first time. If you like and trust your instructor you'll be fine...but don't waste your money on a 125 go straight in for it!!

hey,

i would definitely say get some experience behind you first....however, if you do your licence, just because you have a full bike licence does not mean you have to rush into getting a big bike. due to the fact they keep changing the bike test i would say do your test as soon as you can but i would definitely say take your time with it, there is a lot you have to be care-full of on roads especially the things with 4 wheels lol. i have been riding nearly 2 years now and am still learning every day.

just take your time and good luck with it all.

Go straight for your full licence before they make it any more difficult. The size bike you buy after this is up to your own personal taste. I did a direct access and bought a 600 sports bike. The bikes they use in the training centres are just a nice size, I found the 125's uncomfortable but the CB500 was just right, the GS500 was smaller still only just bigger than a 125 but as easy to handle. Like most people are saying here, the bike will only go as fast as your right hand will let it. I find having the extra power on tap should I need it is worth it though. Good luck with the CBT and give me a shout if you ever come near Basingstoke, I'll take you on a brilliant road for practising cornering.

Well i would say firstly you need to be honest with yourself.

What road expierence do you have:

do you drive a car?- if yes then you should already know the highway code and most rules of the road.
Do/did you ride a bicycle alot( or prior expierence on a motorcycle as a rider- say offroad)? - If yes then you already have balance and  only need some training to learn how to adapt your skills to suit a road bike.

It is possible for a complete novice with no expierence to do thier DAS and have a full licence. But myself i would concider how skill full you are. Then i would  wiegh up if your a sensible person or the sort who is either easily distracted/ low concentration threshold or perhaps a slow learner.
I would do your CBT and then decide upon the expierences of that, if you think you would be ready to go for your DAS.

My freind she took her test on a 125cc, and i think she only had to ride for 2yrs on a 125 and now rides on a cb750. UNless im mistaken , i think if you pass on a 125cc, after two years you can apply for full entitlement.

Das can work out quite pricy- with DAS lessons- especially if you go with a company which loes your buisness and  needs your money.

If it was me i would only go for DAS if i felt confident, otherwise  i would go for the 125cc test and see it as a time to save up pennies for that 'dream bike'

Don't bother messing about with it! You will be throwing good money away.

Make arrangements to pass your test as soon as possible and then upgrade to a bigger bike. You should be able to get a very good price/part-ex on a mint condition speedfight.

I am thinking of becoming a self-employed M/C courier in Bristol, Avon, but rather than using a larger machine I'd like to stick to my 125cc Scooter with top box and panniers.

If your on a scooter you will be placed in the major city zone.
To earn decent $$$ you will need to have good knowledge of the streets and be able to find say, a department within a hospital very quickly so you don't waste time.
Your limited in what you can carry, which limits your earnings -they may offer a subsidy.
They have different levels of service on deliveries also, time critical deliveries can earn you triple money for direct pick-up and delivery.
You will also need to register yourself as self-employed with the tax office, and goods insurance.
You may also be required to pay radio and uniform fees.
It can be quite dangerous on the road as you will be tired in the afternoon and have to deal with peak hour and fatigue.
But if you love a challenge and your competitive go for it.

Sticking with a small scooter will limit your range, a delivery to London, for example, will take you ages. It might be better to find a company that has deliveries within the local area and offer an exclusive service, be aware though, the courier business has been shrinking since the arrival of email and digital transfer – the most frequently seen deliveries are fast-food with fewer actual couriers and the fast food business is worth avoiding.
You will need some form of control or base that clients can instantly contact you at, being self-employed this might mean a bluetooth headset in your helmet – being out of contact is a big no-no.

You might be ok but there are a lot of courier companies in Bristol, you will be limited to local work so will be stuck riding around the centre all day battling taxis and buses.
You need to get licence and bigger bike for doing mileage jobs, from bristol you should get a couple of trips to london a day.
Make sure you get goods in transit and courier insurance or you will find yourself having trouble with police and big trouble with customer if you were unlucky enough to lose something of high value through theft etc.

Buy the DSA motorcycle theory book or the software and read / use it thoroughly. You can get them through http://www.motorcycleparking.com/motorcy... Make sure you take your test before it changes to the new format which is going to be a nightmare!

check the spacing is right between the new pull start ( throw out dog should be clear of the flywheel when not pulled and not butted too close the the motor . If it is fouling space it out a bit ) . to turn over the motor by hand without touching the pull start , you have to remove the clutch bell ( 4 bolts on the other side )  so you can get to the clutch itself . remove the spark plug to make it easyer to turn over .



Grab a 10mm ( i think they are) on the centre nut of the clutch and turn the engine over , If it stops turning ( should be Really easy to turn over ) then you know for sure its fouling .

Why are motor scooters gay?



Why does everybody think that scooters are gay? They're mini motorcycles that usually have automatic transmissions, why is that gay?
They seem more practical with the floor in front of you, you can use them to haul things that you can't on a traditional motorcycle.

Mini scooters are way cool.. in fact in Europe, a huge portion of the pop ride vespas, scooters.. they're not cool in the States, for the only reason I think is because American places are so far apart, and we like to travel so much.. European cities have more transportation options, and are more efficient, more buses, more stops, and their aren't huge parking lots everywhere so finding parking is virtually impossible. If you have to go into the city in Europe it means, a) take the metro, b) the bus, or c) the moped\vespa\scooter\bike.  And d) gas is like $10 a gallon there..

Years ago when scooters first became popular 1950/60's, and the riders  all wore the same over cloaks and rode in large groups,they were referred to by the biking community as ''puff truck  drivers' which was more of an insult to the scooter than the rider. 
Early scooter  were 3 speed twist grip gear change so you needed to be double jointed in your left wrist, not that I ever owned one, but a girl friend at the time had a 250cc lambretta that went very well, but she banned me from riding it with her on the back as I kept scratching the runner boards on corners, oops, probably why she dumped me!!!



There are still many clubs around and seaside resorts in summer are popular venues for these guys and gals to gather.

Don't sweat it.

I'm a Harley rider who waves at anything on two wheels because I know we all face the same problems. Heat, cold, wet weather, inattentive drivers. We ride because we like the freedom, the wind, the gas mileage. So ignore the fools who make remarks on the scooters. Shoot I first rode on a scooter and loved it.

the reason society thinks they are gay is bc there is no major body type.example being the sport bikes like the kawasaki ninjas and so on the have no detailed body..and they are generally electric and do no more then 68 mph as a 250 cc motorcycle can do about double that...the only great think is they get like 98 mpg ( the fuel ones )

It doesn't matter what you ride, just that you ride!

Scooters are great for Point A to Point B local transportation, and a lot of fun on a Saturday afternoon!

It's not the destination, and it not the size of you ride, it's about the journey.

They are gay because they are slow, boring to look at and sound s***.

I mean....who could posibly want a bike that cant even make 50mph on a flat road??? how fast would it go up the hill then??

geez and the price too you can buy a proper 250cc motorcycle that can break 100mph for the same price and less

edit] to the ''greenman'' a scooter doesnt get you from point A to point B without struggling, say you need to go 80miles from ya home on freeways tell me how a 49cc or even 125 gets you there geez come on pocket rockets are faster

You are right,

Scooters have advantages and disadvantages over conventional motorcycles.

You have to ask another question though, why is your perceived sexuality connected to an inanimate object?  Another question is why the people around you think something makes anyone look gay, unless they are harboring homosexual thoughts of their own.

Now, if you are riding a pink scooter with flowers on it, and are not heading to the paint shop, you might be gay.

I rode scooters for years, and I have heard it all, but I often have a conventional motorcycle for long trips too.

Scooters are not gay, people are gay, and they show they are gay by saying other people are gay.  If someone is not gay, then if someone else is gay wouldn't matter.  People love to hate other people that are different than them, like the hatred of a small minority of Harley riders and Honda riders.

But if you really are gay (goes for everyone here) it is not my concern.

who is everybody I don't think you will find many true bikes say that I would not keep one out of a porker run just as long as it can make in before last bike in. How ever I would not want to go on a long run with one they are way to slow. The only reason some one would say their gay is for that reason but they would also call any thing under 600 cc gay

I have a set of Continental Road Attacks. They are a nice tire with plenty of grip and a decent lifespan. They are not a track tire, but they are good enough to drag the pegs. I have about 1,500 miles on mine and they are just starting to show a little wear. My guess it they will go at least 6,000 miles or so.



I had just over $300.00 into them after mounting (rims on the bike).



I thought that was pretty good.



There are some really good reviews on them online. That's why I bought them.

Just to add to what others have posted....

Avon and Continental are cheaper than most, and just as good on the road. You won't notice you're on cheaper rubber till you take to the track.

Of the two, I've found Contis suit my riding better.
