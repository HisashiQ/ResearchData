Popular, free blogging services:
Blogger/Blogspot (http://blogger.com ), Wordpress (http://wordpress.com ) and Livejournal (http://livejournal.com ).

Once you set up a blog somewhere, then you can use Flickr to blog your images. See http://www.flickr.com/help/blogging/ for instructions.
______________________________________...

I use Yahoo! 360 - a social networking service that features a blog (http://360.yahoo.com/kee_y360 ). Go http://360.yahoo.com . Click the "Get Started" button and go through the process, but after you are done (or can't go any further), you should be able to click the "Yahoo 360 Home" link in the upper right corner of that (or the main 360 page) to enter your space.

You can post a blog entry and add one image (or multiple images) from Flickr for each entry. The "Share Photos" module on the Top Page isn't working.

For more details on how to set up elements of your 360 space, see http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/ . Keep in mind that 360 is a beta service, so there are many bugs (including the annoying one of invitations not working). If you have problems, check the Answers area or click on my avatar and scroll down to click on my "Starred Questions" tab.

Go to http://360.yahoo.com and click on the "Get Started" button. Go through the activation process. Then, click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of the page (or the main 360 page) to get into the 360 space.
