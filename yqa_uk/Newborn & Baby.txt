Were any of you given steroid shots for lung development?  If so, what wk. and how long after did you deliver?



I was given the steroid shot yesterday and am 34wks today.  I have to go back today and get another one.  The dr said that they don't give them unless they really don't think you'll make it to full term.



Any insight would be great.  I'd like to make it to at least 38 weeks.  I'm having really strong and painful bh contractions.  But, I'm not dilated at all. (Which is great)!

I was admitted into the hospital at 32 weeks for premature labor, where they insisted on sticking a needle into my bottom (steroid shots)lol, for 3 days and put me on bedrest for the remainder of the pregnancy.
I gave birth a day before 35 weeks... so I lasted 3 weeks, and although my baby was small, 5 lbs, she did good and didnt have to stay in the hospital any longer than necessary.
I had dialated to about 2 cm on my premature stay in the hospital, and was having regular contractions for a month, and then when my water broke on THE DAY, I was admitted with 3 cm. dialated, not enough for the epidural and then hopped to 10 cm. in about 30 minutes after given pitocin to stimulate regular contractions.

My sister was given the steroid injection at 34 weeks too, but they needed to do an emergency c section about two hours later.  She was teeny for being 34 weeks, more like the size of a 28 week old baby.  But she was fine!  Didin't need to be ventilated for any longer than a few hours and was home a few weeks later.

My friend had those injections with her first son, he was 6 weeks early-due to preclampsia.  She is pregnant on her 2nd baby now, and had those injections again because she has preclampsia again.  She is 33 weeks now

I got the shot at 24wks gestation and then I had my son at 34wks gestation so it did help to a point.. and with my daughter it was too late. The doctors tell me that I should have started the shots around 17wks so that the chances would be better for a full term baby. Now with this pregnancy they said that they should have started me on them but again its too late Im having contractions at 32 wks but its not that serious(so they say) but anyway I'll make it to at least 36wks. but congrats and good luck.

Is this acid reflex or is he allergic to formula?



my son is 2 months old and has been spitting up alot he also always sounds like he cant breathe right. his nose is really stuffy. he also gets really stiff and mad as you know what after eating.  he cries most of the day and lot of times i can't get him to stop. so i took him to the doctor and he said he has acid reflex. he gave him some medicine but it doesnt seem to be doing anything and just recently got a horrible diaper rash. he cries bloody murder every time i change him. the doctor also told me to change his formula i use to have him on a hypo allergen formula but now he is on enfimil a.r. for babies who spit up.  also for the past two weeks he has been pooping after every feeding and at least twice in the night (he sleeps through the night but wakes up pooping) it is really bad smelling to.  i mean i know baby poop is not the greatest smelling but my other two kids didn't have anything like this and i am at my breaking point with him.  so should i put him back on the formula i was using i did not have hardly any problems with the diaper rash or pooping until his doctor changed it.

that does sound a bit odd...my little man was formula fed from birth and only pooed 1 time a day and  it was always firm and never upset him!  maybe try him on soy formula?  my brothers had problems with normal formula and as soon as my mum tried soy they were great! if he has reflux, elevate his mattress a little, my little man had a few chest problems and would get phlemy and we just elevated his mattress slightly and it works wonders...I know that it helps with reflus as well!!  good luck, and change his formula again though as he really shoudlnt poo that much on formula! its normally a lot harder!!

Yup, that is acid reflux alright....maybe the medicine isn't right or maybe you have to give it some time. My son was diagnosed with that at 1 month and has been on Tagament since July 3 times a day. We just recently cut back to twice a day because he seems to be getting better.



The pooping is not normal though that that does need to be addressed....try going back to his regular formula first though.

He may have acid reflux, but also if his sinuses are blocked, it may be hard for him to swallow formula.  I would clear his nose before you feed.  Also, the bad pooping is a result of the switch in formula.  It will get better, just give it time.  If he was allergic, you would see really bad rashes around the mouth and on his body not diaper rash.  That is from the pooping.  Just keep the area clean and put rash ointment and light powder.

(rectal) When given the Motrin her Temperature drops to about 100 then starts climbing again until she reaches the four hour mark and she back to 102. She's whinny and restless. And says ouch every now and again. Other then that she's got no other symptoms. She went to ed around 9 last night and slept very restlessly  with me until 6 30 this morning.  Tossing and turning ALL night long. She she be seen or should I stick to what i'm doing ?

Your daughter is under 2 years with a high temp, she needs to be seen and ASAP, kids under 2 even if they have a mild temp need to be seen because it means they have an infection or an illness and they have a lower immune system and might need medication to help fight off the bug. It could be tonsillitis or an ear infection and you can't see it. If the medication isn't helping then you need to get help now.

Cause if she does her boobs will never be the same and they will SAG! you should talk to her about changing her mind about it" HUH?? how can they be so stupid!.. i told my husband not to even listen to them.. anyway i don't know what my question is but ISN'T THIS THE MOST DUMBEST THING EVER??

It's possible she's going through what's known as a "nursing strike".  This is where something is bothering her about the nursing (maybe she's starting to teethe, maybe something startled her last time she nursed, etc).  Pump some breastmilk to be sure that she's still getting her nutrients, but don't stop trying to nurse.



Babies who are on a nursing strike are more likely to start back up if you try to nurse them while they are sleepy, or if you do things to encourage closeness - for example, take a bath with her and let her cuddle next to your skin.  Also, you might want to try wearing her in a baby sling so that she's close to you and can smell your milk.  Don't stop trying to nurse her though.



Google "nursing strike" or call your local La Leche League for more information!

Since they are in amniotic fluid they can make the transition into water during the deliver. Since they have not been exposed to air they are still receiving oxygen through the umbilical cord.

No they cant breath underwater, no human can, unless there is an unblicical cord or an oxygen tank attached. When babies are born underwater they are still using the umblical cord and placenta to breath just like they were in the uterus, once they hit the air then they take their first breath, I dont think your teacher is that smart

They can swim a bit. There was a study on this. They don't breathe yet because there is no air in the womb. There are organic plugs in the nose that must be removed, and the air supply is delivered via umbilical cord. After the child is born the doctor will spank it once to cause it to cry, this oddly enough, starts the breathing process.

they cannot breathe under water, as no human can, but the reflex to breathe in when hitting air does not happen because they are still in water. as long as the umbilical cord is attached, they are technically still on the mother's oxygen supply.

no. when a woman gives birth underwater, the baby does not breat in the water right when he comes out. when the baby first comes out it has never breathed air before, so it does not even try until it is pulled out of the water.

Yes, babies can breathe underwater while they are still attached to the umbilical cord which gives the baby blood and oxygen from the mother. It also is living in the amniotic fluid so baby is used to liquid.

Only if the umbilical cord is still attached. It's how they do water births. Once the cord is cut and the baby starts screaming, no. They need air at that point, and being submerged in water would drown them.

The brands don't matter but I wouldn't buy too much too soon. Some types can cause allergic reactions in your baby so I would try, wait and see before you start stockpiliing. Also, you will find that you go through wipes like there's no tomorrow. They're invaluable and have other uses besides baby's bottom. My kids are 5 and 10 now and I still carry and use baby wipes!

My baby's now 4 weeks old.  I bought 6 packs of 62 wipes, and I only have one pack left!  He does tend to do number two's in the middle of a nappy change though, so I think I use more than normal.

When i was a first time mom, everyone bought me diapers i had a bunch of diapers and when i had my daughter for a month i realized that i needed more wipes than diapers. I constantly kept running out of wipes, because they pee and poop alot and have to change them constantly so they dont get a rash. Buy the wipes in walmart that come in a box.

Upon purchasing a new product specifically for your baby would you take the time to read the instructions?



I am doing a final year college project on a baby formula preparation unit and I need to know if you as a parent would take the time to read the instructions that accompany such a unit or would you just dive in head first. Any opinion or info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

If you don't know how to mix the formula correctly then the instructions should definitely be read. Putting too much formula powder in with the water will throw off the nutritional balance and cause problems.

if he is only bringing up a little bit then its fine. i know its hard when you breastfeed as you cant see how much they are taking but its more then you think!so if hes just bringing up a little bit and is content between feeds then dont worry you will be fine! also get your health visitor or a nurse to check your latch. i only breastfed my on for 2 months but every little bit helps so if you do stop still congratulate yourself on giving him the best start in life.good luck!

If you are producing a lot of milk it may be coming out to fast and making him eat to fast. When I nursed my son I had to pump some first and then feed him because I was making a lot of milk. Don't give up on nursing. My son went back and forth from bottle and breast just fine. Just keep giving to him and he will accept both. I hope this helps. good luck.

I just had a baby last week .. and im really worried that .. ?



after 6 weeks when i can resume my sex life with my husband that i won't be able to please him like i used to before i had my son (  vaginal birth ) i'm afraid that i will be to stretched out down there .. and he won't like having sex with me anymore .. So i guess what im asking is .. does it go back to normal down there after 6 weeks or will i never be the same down there ... Did you have any problems having sex after having a baby .. did your partner complain about it  ? I really fear that i will be really loose .. i must sound crazy but i need my fears calmed .. i can't ask any of my friends that have had children because they all had c-sections ..

Hi, don't feel bad for asking this question! For me, I changed emotionally much more than I changed physically. A woman's emotions change after having a baby, and this affects her desire for sex. Don't be surprised if you feel numb to the idea of intercourse for a while...even a long while. Physically, you have NOTHING to worry about when it comes to being loose. That's not the case after having 1 baby. I never did one kegal (hate those- they feel wierd!) and I'm not only tight as can be, but able to have multiple orgasms now & I'm much more sensitive. Be careful the first few weeks after resuming sexual activity- your husband needs to understand that your body needs time to heal itself. If you rush things, you'll both regret it in the long run. Men just don't have a clue, do they!!! Good luck :)

I wouldn't worry about it.  If this was the case, there wouldn't be many couples out there with MANY children!  lol  Do kegels, which help strengthen the muscles in your vagina.  It is just tightening and loosening them over and over and it helps build those muscles back up.  You can even do them while sitting at the computer.  You won't be loose.  You were made to give birth out of your vagina and it goes back to normal size.  I have never heard of anyone, ever being loose down there after having a baby.  Do KEGALS!!!

I had the same fear! But I just had my 6 week appt. last week after baby number 2 both vaginal. And We couldn't even get in all the way the first time and my hubby says its like the first time again (I was a virgin when I met my hubby). So I don't think you should have any problems. It is meant to stretch down there because if it didn't then we would always hear the "wind in the canyon" lol. And nobody would ever have more than one baby cause no body wants that. I don't think you have anything to worry about. And if you ripped or tore you have stitches that will help also, but may make it harder and hurt more the first time or two

You'd actually be surprised. I'm pretty darn tight down there at 4 months PP. We have noticed a spot further back in my vagina that is more prominent than before. With regular intercourse I'm sure we can work that out and I can get past the discomfort, but we just have to find time to have regular intercourse.



Our first struggle was getting past my episiotomy. We attempted sex at 8 weeks, then were successful at 10 or 11 weeks.



I felt loose in the beginning because I noticed while taking baths that water more easily got in me. My husband even noticed it looks more loose on the outside, but that was contradicting the inside lol.



I have to admit to you that getting "in the mood" is more difficult for me. My fear is not pleasuring him physically, but mentally. Same for myself. I want to enjoy it but sometimes I feel as if I'm just doing it to make him happy.



Just take it slow, and maybe it would help both of you to have a couple glasses of wine beforehand. I was recommended this by my aunt to help with pain to make me more relaxed. It could also help with the intimacy. We never tried it but I still consider it. We just don't really ever drink anymore.



Good luck!

Okay so basically I had my son almost 3 months ago. When my husband and I had sex after my 6 weeks (vaginal birth also) it hurt the hell out of me. Don't get me wrong it was nice and he loved it but it was so tight that when he went in it felt like I was having sex for the first time all over again. No worries honey, you will be fine and you will please him. Trust me =)



Like I said my son is almost 3 months and it still is tight when we have sex.

before i had my son, i asked a few friends who had vaginal births. they told me there was no difference and not to worry. i always thought they were lying to me. like who would wanna admit they were loose, you know? now i laugh about it. they were right. it is totally normal to be freaked out about this.



okay, now about your vagina. i had a vaginal birth too. all the comments on here about pencils and paper rolls and how sex is ruined that stuff is bs. don't listen. my vagina is not loose. you may feel like the opening seems a bit wider than before baby, but inside it is no different. i was terrified about being loose after birth. terrified. probably as nervous about that as i was about having a bowel movement during delivery. (which didn't happen either lol) i will say i waited longer than the standard 6 weeks. to be honest, i haven't ever done kegals. the first time we had sex after birth i was actually tight. you will be fine honey. =)

"does it go back to normal down there after 6 weeks or will i never be the same down there"



Suffice it to say Yahoo! Answers has a high percentage of women with magical vaginas. It is statistically unlikely to ever be the same.



Childbirth is in general a disaster for the pelvic floor; you have about one in a hundred odds of becoming fecally incontinent...



You may be able to exercise your way back to some semblance of normality; you may not.

All my friends (guys included) who've had children said their sex lives completely suffered. Just imagine sticking a pencil in a toilet paper roll. Not a whole lot of pleasure for the guy. Just being honest here.

sounds like an issue for your doctor.  its really not a good idea to seek medical advice on yahoo answers.  you really don't know who is answering your question or if they have any buisness giving advice. Just make sure that you do research to back up your decisions if you plan on going against medical advice.

Baby coming home from hospital!?



My son was born on 31st October and after a nasty scare has been in hospital with lung and cord infection and a nasty dose of jaundice.



His levels have come down and he is out of the lights and tomorrow they will be re-doing his levels again and so long as it has not gone back up he will be able to come home with just another 5 days of anti-biotics.



I am worried though, as when he got sick he stopped breathing - it was the scariest most horrific minutes of my life.



We have a mat for under his mattress that beeps if he stops breathing - I thought I would find this reassuring but even with the mat I am worried and anxious.



Any suggestions for calming myself down and any tips on how to feel more secure?

ok so my husband is in the military as i've mentioned before and the other day he had staff duty with some other guys they were watching a guy who basically is on "watch" anyhow.. I guess some how they came up on the subject about babies (I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE TO KNOW) lol anyway.. some guy told my husband that a baby is suppose to Poop 50-60 times a WEEK!! lmao!!.. and if they don't then they have something wrong with there intestines omg.. haha! i think that 50-60 times is a bit much not even an adult goes that much.. and then another one told him "Is your wife gonna breastfeed? Cause if she does her boobs will never be the same and they will SAG! you should talk to her about changing her mind about it" HUH?? how can they be so stupid!.. i told my husband not to even listen to them.. anyway i don't know what my question is but ISN'T THIS THE MOST DUMBEST THING EVER??

They don't poop 50-60 times a week, more like 20-30 when they are a newborn. My son when he was first born pooped 3-4 times a day.
Breastfeeding can cause breast to sag a bit, but if you take good care of them and wear a good supporting nursing bra then it shouldn't be too bad.



EDIT - You'd be surprised and how much they poop when they are first born. Almost everytime I fed my son he pooped. You'll find out the hard way.

Newborn breastfed babies CAN poop really often - my son was feeding every two/three hours in the first week, and filling his diaper with every feed.  However, they can also go several days without having any bowel movements (experienced this with my second) and if they are totally breastfed you don't have to worry about constipation.  When it comes it is still soft.  Either extreme is normal for a breastfed baby.
About the boobs - research shows that any stretching etc. is going to happen during pregnancy, and your boobs aren't the same, but neither is the rest of your body!  A mother's body is a bit different, but no less sexy!  As someone said, wear a decent bra that fits while breastfeeding and it will be fine.
I recommend you and your husband reading "So That's What They're For" by Jan Tamaro - it is a really funny book about breastfeeding, but has all the facts you need. (Might do his buddies good too!)



I think the guys were just being guys, but honestly, they could use some actual facts like - the precise size of your wife's boobs vs a healthier, smarter child!

How long should you wait to call the doctor?



Hi everyone. My daughter is 5 months old and yesterday she came down with a low fever. I have given her tylenol and is brings it down to about 99.5. Within 2-3 hours of giving her tylenol, her temp goes back up to 100.5-101. It hasnt been 24 hours of this yet, but just wondering if I should go ahead and call the doctors today or wait it out until tomorrow. Thanks for any good advice.

I would definitely give the doc a call, if only to put your mind at ease.  She may be teething - that often causes a low-grade temp, drooling, and diarrhea (due to excessive saliva going down their throat).



Any breakthrough fever (one that breaks through a medication given to stop a fever) should have a doc's attention.

More than likely it will turn out to be nothing, so don't get alarmed... But in my personal opinion it's always better to be safe rather than sorry.

I would call the docs to make sure but its probably nothing but a virus.  I always find my self waiting to call the doctors until after hours and wind up in the emergency room.  I'm pretty sure that a fever is ok at this age until it gets to 103.0. But i ALWAYS feel more comfortable to hear it from the doctors.  My seven month old has had quite a few fevers. One at three days, One at three months and one last week. But if there are no other symptoms they are more than likely to just say that there is nothing they can do. ( this was the case last week it turned out to be a virus that lasted about four days)



And also, it really depends on which doctor you talk to about a fever when teething some say its possible some say that teething will not cause a fever.

Baby Keeps Crying PLZ HELP!?



I have a baby that is almost a month & a half old and she will not go to sleep (she hasn't slept in almost 7 hours) and just keeps crying.  She will fall asleep when I am feeding her;, but the second I put her down she wakes back up and starts crying again.  I've made sure she has a clean diaper, she's been fed, and snuggled.  I just have other stuff I have to do around the house, but I can't do it while holding her all the time.

If she is falling asleep while you are feeding her, she probably hasn't burped right? I would guess she has gas. Try to keep her awake while she is feeding and burb her every 2 oz. or so.

i agree with making sure your baby has been burped.
then try swaddling to make your baby feel snug and secure.
you can always call your pediatrician and talk to a nurse, not that I think your baby needs medical attention, but the nurse may be able to give you advice on what to try.

This could be colic, it's very common and usually starts in the first 6 weeks of life.  It's thought to be caused by painful bubbles of wind caught in the bowel and can be very distressing for a new mum.  You should talk to your health visitor or equivalent about this.  Does your baby draw her legs up when she cries and does she go red in the face with a high pitched, pained cry?  These are signs of infant colic.



Infacol is good for dispersing trapped gas, but it can take a few doses to be effective...(UK)



Talk to your health care team if you are very concerned.

she is getting used to falling asleep on the bottle or breast. my son did this and i was advised to put him down after feeding him and wake him up this sounds awful but by rearranging his nappy he would stir a bit then i would swaddle him and put him down to sleep. its important to put her down awake and she will learn good sleep association rather then always relying on 1 method to fall asleep i.e feedork in the ing, rocking. these always work in the short term but not in the long term. your baby needs to wake up and remember the they fell asleep there and they will go back off themselves in the night aswell. i ididnt believe this would work at first but my 4mth old now goes to sleep. at first the crying will last up tp 1 hour, just go to the cot every 15 minutes and pat her reassure her and hen leave, after a few weeks (and its exhausting) you will be able to put her down and off to sleep she will go!! this works for day naps too. hope this helps. also try colic drops if you think this may be the case and talk to the doc if still no success!good luck!x

It could be a few things.  First it could be colic which is gas and very uncomfortable.  Try mylicon drops for that.  If shes fed, and has a clean diaper and you suspect nothing else is wrong with her then just put her in her crib and let her cry herself to sleep.  It may be upsetting or annoying to deal with at first but she will learn to put herself to sleep eventually.  If shes falling asleep while you feed her maybe shes isnt getting enough food and is hungry.  Make sure while feeding her you try your best to keep her awake by talking to her.  Set a regular feeding schedule and sleep schedule, maybe that will help.

Make sure that she is burped. She could have gas which keeps waking her up. Do you own a sling ? They work wonders for when you have things to do and baby should sleep contently in there. Or what about a baby swing ? Try and put her in there once she falls asleep and maybe the swinging motion will help keep her asleep. Another thing you could do is lay down with babe until she falls asleep. Maybe right now she just wants the closeness of Mom and that's why every time you leave, she wakes.
I know how you are feeling right now. Do you have anybody that could come over to watch her for you so that you can get a break ?

I recently put a nightlight t in my 13 moth olds room for that reason.  If he wakes up in the middle of the night it is less scary and he can put himself back to sleep.  I don't see any harm in it

We co-sleep and use a nightlight so that I can see my baby to feed her and, well, so I can make sure the blanket doesn't cover her. She has no problems sleeping with the light. They're soft and dim.

I really don't think it matters.  I have always had a light on for my daughter.  It also helps when peeking in on her at night I can see her better and if she wet her diaper I could change her without turning on a light.  Keeping things dim and constant prevented her from waking up to much and putting her back down was easier.

I use a nightlight in my 5 month old's nursery. It makes it easier for me to check on her and not break my neck tripping over one of her toys at 3am lol. Also the light is very small and soft, so I know it doesn't bother her.

I've always had a nightlight in my daughter's room... not particularly for her, I don't think she cares one way or the other at this age. (almost 8 months old) It's easier to settle her down at night in dim light, and if she wakes in the night we can see what we're doing without having to turn on her bedroom light. Just make sure anything you get isn't too bright.

Buy a better grade of cat food; that way it won't gross you out or worry you if baby eats it.



No, you can't realistically expect an 11mo to not eat it. It's pretty harmless, but -- if you are going to keep saying 'no' and frustrating yourself and your baby, do what we did and just put it on the counter and forget it.

Anyone else feel there is something wrong but you cant fix it?



I just know there is something wrong but i dont know how to make it better...
I have a partner and 15 week old little man that i love to bits .
I dont know why but i have the worst mood swings all day but they arent real mood swings as the only mood i go to is anger



I lay in bed at night and when i know my  partner and son are fast asleep i cry and cry and cry
I think about how i can tell him and wish i had the courage to wake him and tell him"Greg there is something wrong and i cant fix it"
but i cant which makes me cry more
I also think about writing it in a letter but i cant write it



I think about posting this exact question and for someone to tell me that it is fine and normal tonight after laying in bed crying for a good hour i have got the guts to actually post this
Im not crying about anything and it cant be the post natal thing as the feelings of complete devastation and upset really only hit me when it is time for bed and i am laying there left thinking about nothing and i just cry
I tried to ell my doctor today and she said i might just be feeling a bit down and i didnt want to look like a case so i didnt exactly extend how crappy i feel at night
So i am stuck there is something wrong and i cant fix it i need help

how do you know its not postpartum depression?  Just because you are most upset in the evening?  Its natural for you to feel more depressed at certain times of the day.  As a depression sufferer myself, i often had the most problem in the evenings.  Call your doctor back and ask about postpartum depression.  It really sounds like it to me.  You will do your family a better service by taking steps to make yourself feel better than ignoring this.  I am sorry your doctor blew you off, because he of all people should be able to support you in this.  Maybe you just need to try to talk to him again.

You really need to tell your doctor the full extent of your feelings of despair at night. I don't know what to tell you really....there were times I used to feel the same exact way...before marriage and Jacob. I really think that you need to find someone to talk to to sort out your feelings. Depression can be very debilitating and you want to get a handle on it soon before it spirals out of control.

Hon, it definitely can be postpartum depression, even though you feel it most at night. You just put your body under tons of stress to get your baby here, and now you are using all your energy taking care of her. It is totally normal to feel overwhelmed and a little sad or cooped up. But this whole cyclical crying, reaching out for help, and crying this is not normal, and you need to tell your doctor or your man how bad it is. There are so many options for you to get help, but you can't pursue any of them until you admit this to someone.



Please, please, please tell someone near you and get the help you need. You will feel soooooo much better!

This sounds very like post-natal depression.  If you are in the UK you must talk to your health visitor about this, or see your doctor.  This is soooo common and the chances are that a course of anti-depressants will make you feel vastly better.  Talk to your partner, tell him how you are feeling.  Please don't suffer in silence as you are most definetely not alone in feeling like this.  Your hormones are all over the place after the birth of your baby and your moods are often the first thing to suffer, the pressure of a new baby is enormous and it is perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed by the enormity of your responsibility.



You are right in thinking that something is wrong that you cant fix alone, get the help you need and deserve and I honestly believe that if you do this you will feel massively better just from confronting your fears and asking for help.



Good luck and congratulations on your wonderful new addition. xx

sounds like classic postpartum depression, which is normal, common and totally treatable. my advice, call your doctor right now. not tomorrow, not next week, now. schedule an appointment to discuss what you're feeling and take the next step from there once you have looked at your options. Be honest don't just say "I feel a little overwhelmed." They can only help if they know what is wrong, and they will not judge you. I suffered with bad post partum depression for almost 3 months before I even hinted to my doctor that this way happening, and I regret all the precious time I lost feeling that way when I could have spoken up sooner. Now I am on a low dose of antidepressant and talking to a counselor twice a month and the difference is amazing. I feel so much happier and confident being a mother, and I rarely let things pile up the way I did before. Please please call your doctor right now!

Go back to the doctor and tell him the truth. That you cry yourself to sleep every night. You most likely have post partum depression - its just manifesting itself differently than in most women. Please go today - you will feel so much better once you get some medications.
It does NOT make you  a nut job!! Just an ordinary person with some complications of pregnancy.

You need to call doc back tomorrow or go to office. Be honest and explain the crying fits. It sounds like postpardum depression. More women have that than you know and it's nothing to be ashamed of, but it does need to be treated.



I had the baby blues and I was put on meds. I did great after that and doc just explained that it was due to changes in hormones and overwhelming changes that I was going through physically and emotionally.



You will be a better mom for coming clean and getting help. Baby will never know that you cried and needed a little help-but get to the doc and be honest.

Its more "advice" but here is my nugget of info.



I've been peed on, pooped on, spit up on, vomited on, drooled on, and have had every other horrible body fluid some how leaked onto my person.  I've been disgusted to the point of wanting to throw up myself, but it all seems like nothing when he smiles at me, that beautiful toothless grin.



If you have never had a child before, there really isn't a way to describe it.  I never belived in love at first sight until I became a mommy.  So I suppose my "one thing" would be how hopelessly in love you will fall with your child.

I wish I had known:



1. Never feed your baby to sleep.
2. You don't have to change the baby everytime he wakes up at night.
3. Keep the lights dim when getting him up to feed at night.



We have a lot of sleep issues and I wish I had done some research about sleeping beforehand. Now, my number one piece of advice to new moms is to research baby sleep issues before they are born so that you have an idea what you're going to do when problems arise.

My 5 Wk Old doesn't take entire bottle but acts hungry again soon after?



My son is 5 weeks old. I offer 4 ounces of formula which he rarely takes all of, however he acts hungry again soon after but won't take any more of his bottle. He's also a bear to put down and KEEP down for a nap. He'll sleep as long as someone is holding him but as soon as you put him down he's awake & crying.



My mom is recommending a little rice cereal (I know what the doctors say). Could it be that he just doesn't like his formula and I need to switch it up? Any suggestions welcome!



Thanks in advance for your help.

he sounds colic. my son would drink a small amount of his bottle and then act hungry again around an hour later. the doctor said he was colic so i bought dr browns bottles and switched his feed to the easy digestible version and hes fine now. its best bring him to your doctor to be sure. best of luck xox

babies this age like to cluster feed.. meaning eat many times.... this is because of the nursing instinct... if a baby nurses more often more milk comes inthe mother's breast... since you are formula feeding it is possible he's just trying to cluster feed the bottle??? who knows..



don't try rice cereal yet, it can cause constiption and might cause digestive problems later if introduced too early



babies need to eat and feeding on demand is not unusual.... I know it gets tedious but obviously your baby is self regulating his feeds and knows how much he wants to eat and when... which means he won't over eat [usually] if you introduce rice cereal that may mess up his inner "measuring" system

Dont give him cereal with his milk. he's too small and wont be able to digest it. i think you should try burping him as soon as he stops drinking and then offer the bottle after the burp. sometimes when they have wind they feel uncomfortable but also hungry at the same time.

If he won't take any more of his bottle, he's not hungry again.  It's probably a problem with his formula.  Ask his doctor before switching him, but he might need to go on soy formula.  Also make sure he's burped properly during and after his feeding.  At 5 weeks, he still needs to be burped after every ounce or so of formula.  Do NOT give him rice cereal.  That will only make his tummy problems worse.  Newborns can't digest rice and it can give them very painful gas.  At 5 weeks, he needs to be drinking formula not only for nutrition, but for hydration.  If he's full of cereal, he won't want a bottle and risk becoming severely dehydrated.



Try swaddling the baby tightly when you put him down for a nap.  This can often trick a newborn into thinking he's being held and help him sleep better.

That is actually fairly normal. My son at that age would only drink 2 oz. every 1-2 hours. If he won't take any more formula I would suggest giving him a pacifier. Babies this young have a natural need to suck. The sleeping is pretty normal to. If there are things you need to get done than I would suggest a carrier of some sort.

i would burp him really good 1/2 way through the bottle, and like your mom said you could always have a little cereal. it will help him get fuller  and may sleep longer,



as for the holding him till he sleeps, its nice to do that when they are small. but try laying him in a swing or bouncy  seat, and have soft music in the back ground,, if you get the child use to hearing music during nap times, its so much easier to be able to get other things done then...with my son, i would swaddle him in a blanket and lay him down in the swing and he would go to sleep better there at times.

Mummies who held or rocked their babys to sleep?



My daughter is almost one, and to get her to sleep for naps or bed I swaddle her and hold her until she is sound asleep and then lay her in her cot. I have been doing this for about the last 8 months after the other ways I used to get her to sleep all failed (nursing to sleep, pushing her in her pram, sleeping with her, white noise from hair dryer etc)
Anyway I am happy to keep doing this for her, as it works well and she sleeps 6pm until 7am.
But I have heard that alot of babys or toddlers grow out of this on their own. So I wondered...
Did they then go to sleep alone in their beds with no problems?
Or did you find yourself back at square one, having no way to get them to sleep?and if so what did you do? I really wouldnt want to do the cry it out method.
And finally, maybe you still rock your child to sleep at age 2, 3 or 4?
Please share your thoughts or stories. Sorry this is so long! Thankyou!

my son either nursed or took a botle at night/during the night and was rocked until 15 months....then I tried the sippy at night which he refused so it was just rocking and the pacifier....then I would just pick him up pat his back, put him back down... then eventually by a month it was just to patting his back... if he woke up...



he is 20 months now and sleeps in his toddler bed by himself, stays in bed all night, doesn't get up at all....i've only had to walk in their 3-4 times since giving the toddler bed at 18 months to pat his back when he wakes up and cries for some reason.



so yes I believe that a child can learn on his own with your help without the CIO method.....

I say if you're not bothered too much by this routine, enjoy it while you can because I doubt when your baby is 16 she'll let you rock her to sleep haha.  It might be a little bump in the road once you have to convert her over to going to sleep by herself, then again maybe she will break the cycle for you.  We just recently quit swaddling our 6 month old.  The first night was BAD, but honestly after that first night, he's slept better than ever before!

I've never had to rock my children or hold them to get them to sleep. But I almost wish I had. They grow up so darn fast and you blink and they no longer want to be held or hang with you. My 11 year old is growing up too fast for my liking, luckily I can still smother my 15 month old in kisses and hugs.



Enjoy this. Your child will start walking more and getting more and more independent, and you'll wish they wanted to be rocked. :)

My husband used to rock our son for all of his naps, but when we moved, we didn't have access to our rocker for a while, so we started lying down with him for naps and bedtime, since that was the only way for him to fall asleep. At 21 months old, he still sleeps next to us, then we'll put him to bed in his crib, where he'll sleep for 2 hours for his nap, and from 9pm-7am for bedtime. I have no idea if he'll grow out of it on his own, but frankly, I hope he does in the next 6 months, since that's when our 2nd child will be here.



We don't like the cry-it-out method either and certainly don't want to use it.

i did this with my first one...always had to hold her to get her to sleep.. i couldnt just lay her down since when she was born i was always holding her, feeding her till she was asleep...it went from that to her sleeping in bed with us. she refused to sleep in her crib because of this habit we got into. it didnt leave much of a private life. when i split with her dad at the age of 2, she had nights where i got her to go to sleep in her own bed, but that only lasted a few hours, and she would be coming to my room to sleep...i didnt mind at that point since it was just her and I.  At age 3 i was still trying to get her to sleep in her own bed, with some success but not fully... at age 4, she was better but there were days during the week she would continue to try and sleep with me.. we had her fully changed over to her own bed before age 5, but let me tell you how hard it was to do that converting.
I learnt my lesson when number 2 came round.  i laid her in her own crib from day one, awake.. now at 19 months she can get laid in her bed and put herself to sleep without me having to rock her, or hold her. much better for everyone, even her.

I have a 6 month old and she is also going through this MISERABLE time period!



She has been especially fussy these last 2 days, (the doctor said it comes and goes, it wont last every day, but it could last for days before it stops again)
My baby's doctor said not to use orijel b/c it goes away quickly and is a waste of money.



I use those teething rings that you can freeze! They help her little gums so much b/c it kind of numbs them.  plus she can chew on 'em which makes it feel better too.
I use the baby tylonal when she's REALLy hurtin, you only give him .08ml. Thats all he needs for his age and weight.( You'll see when you open the package the dropper allows for less dosage than what it says on box)
I hope this helps b/c I too understand what your going through..
I cant wait till those little teeth pop thru the gums!!



( I hear thats the most painful part tho.. )



Edit:
I've also frozen those "graduates BITER BIscuits"
just get them alittle wet and put in freezer.



She loves to knaw on them, they taste good and if frozen it feels good.

A very balanced diet is key, follow the food pyramid! Drink lots of water. As far as exercise...I started back into things really slowly. I first started walking about 1 mile everyday. Soon I added 45 minutes of cardio dance exercises (I love the crunch DVD series). Finally I added 15 reps from each of my total gym stations. After about 9 months I had close to what my body used to be, I still have a "baby pouch" at the very bottom of my stomach, I hate it! I think all those skinny celebrities have Liposuction after they have babies because no matter how much you work out there is just no way to loose all that "baby belly fat" in 8 weeks, it is impossible! They make us all feel like there should be nothing to losing the weight, but it is a very difficult thing to do! I wish you luck!

*breastfeeding is GREAT!!!



*start wearing spanx (or another tummy slimmer) a week after delivery to convince that extra skin to tighten up

My diet consisted of a lot of spinach and walnuts because they are both notorious for their ability to shave fat quickly, and walnuts have the necessary Omega 3 fats. I drank ONLY water with the exception of orange juice in the morning.

Are you pumping while you're at school?



If you aren't, that means you're regularly going 8 hours without pumping or nursing -- longer if you are routinely giving bottles in public.



That can definitely cause your supply to drop.  (And if he's getting lots of bottles AND your supply is dropping, he's probably refusing to nurse because he had learned that the bottle is where his food comes from.)



Advice:
1.  If you aren't pumping during the day, you MUST do so.  8-9  hours is just too long to go without nursing.  If it's not possible to pump, then you will need to nurse VERY often in the evening and during the night to keep your supply up. (Your breasts can usually adapt to one long stretch, but not 2.)



2.  Learn to nurse discreetly in public.  It's easy to do, and will help keep your supply up.



If you keep up your current pattern, your milk will dry up/baby will refuse to nurse, and you'll be 100% on a bottle within a couple of weeks.

HOnestly, if it were me I would just nurse in public. If your baby is hungry, the opinions of people who don't have a clue come second; baby comes first. Find a quiet, out of the way place and put a blanket over you. You might be surprised - some people might not even know you're nursing.



Have you tried pumping? THen you wouldn't have to supplement and you can increase your supply because demand is increased. If you're not nursing as much, your supply could go down, or the letdown reflex is delayed, and he gets fussy because he's used to the automatic letdown of milk from a bottle.

It's a matter of supply and demand.  If you nurse less often, your milk supply will decrease.  Is it possible for you to pump between classes?  That would help!

I moved my son to his crib 10 days after he turned 3 months old. He slept through the night the first two nights but then started waking again (but still slept better than he did in our room most of the time.) I don't see how it can be 6 months....unless you co-sleep because they can't be in their bassinets once they can roll over...too dangerous.

ok by cot do you mean crib?
There are several philosophies on this...I think it just depends on what works for you.



You can co-sleep for awhile--which they say helps with bonding.  Or keep the baby in a bassinet/cradle in your room.



I plan on putting my baby in his crib right away and getting him used to the crib (whether or not this will work...I do not know.)  But his room is right next to mine, so it's not a big deal to me.  I don't really buy the whole bonding thing with co-sleeping.  I think my baby will be better off getting a good sleep routine right off the bat and mommy will be better off as well.  We will be bonding all day and during night-time feedings.



I think it is all a matter of what works for you and for the baby.  Every baby is going to be different, so we can't necessarily predict when they will do everything or what will work best.

My kids were in their own rooms at 4 weeks. I used a good baby monitor after that. There is no required age before you move babies into their own rooms. It is whatever you are comfortable with. You have to be able to sleep also, so that you can be the best for your baby. Be careful to not take so much advice from people that you do not listen to your own instincts. God gave us women a natural ability to be mommies. Trust yourself.

I think it all depends on the parent. If you can have a baby monitor on at night and wake up within seconds of your baby crying (i do and it gets annoying sometimes when he has a bad dream) then you can put the baby in its own room once you get home from the hospital. A lot of people keep them in bassinets next to their beds because it just makes it that much easier to change them, feed them and back to bed as soon as you can. I would say once you feel you have gotten caught up on your sleep change the baby to the crib in his room. You will get better sleep once you don't hear your baby moving next to you.

The sooner the better. Get it out of the way so there is one less thing to worry about. Showers are usually done in 7th & 8th month. By then the last thing you will want to do is shop for three hours scanning products!

I registered 3 1/2 months before my due date.  You don't want to do it too early because baby products are constantly changing.  You don't want to have a bunch of stuff on your registery that was discontinued, and you don't want to miss out on registering for new stuff that comes out.



Registering is so fun!  I loved it!!!  Take a good friend or sister or your mom with you.  It's more fun that way.  And be prepared to spend the whole day at the store - take snacks & water in your purse.  It took over 3 hours for me to register and I already pretty much knew what I wanted from looking online.

I suggest registering for basics asap, but I would wait on the "cute" stuff.  The stores are always changing their stock (especially Target).  So go ahead and scan those diapers, playpens, changing pads, etc now, but wait until 3-4 weeks before your shower before you select your outfits and such.

Hey I just want to share something with you that I didn't know until my son was 6 months old. so many products are so bad! even the leading 'store brands' like huggies pampers etc. google what you read on the Label if you don't know what it is. there are things like chlorine bleach, formaldehyde and many other nasty fillers!! be an informed mama. Consumer laws don't protect us they protect the big companies!!! look at things like your baby's washes, lotions, tooth paste, baby laundry soap, cleaning products that will be used while baby is home! Did you know that because of all the products we have in our home and use on a daily basis actually make the air quality of our home more poor of the air outside....even on a highway or in a chemical plant? be informed!

It depends on how old your baby is. Juice is only okay after I want to say 6 or 7 months but I forget the exact age. Also, you have to dillute it with equal parts water. For example, one ounce of juice needs one ounce of water. Has he eaten anything different? New foods can change bowel movements for a few days.

Well that means that your other boob isn't getting sucked as much as the other.  Make sure you're taking turns.  Because, that leakage is the more rich stuff.  So, when this is happening make sure you express the milk out because it is a waste.  I hated the pads getting soaked than my shirt would be wet.  So it's best to have disposable ones and ones you can wash as well!



So say morning feeding suck on the left boob, than 2 hours later, suck on the other boob, vice versa!

Its normal, if you want to save the milk for any reason, try breast shells, they collect all the leaking milk and keep you dry!!



They dont leak anymore, but I used to take spare breast pads out with me. (also get washable ones, theyre better for your breasts and youll save lots of money!)



EDIT; if shes only a week old, dont worry, your milk comes in strong at first, once your body has figured out how often she feeds, itll regulate the milk supply and they wont leak as much.

How long have you been nursing?  I had this same problem in the beginning, but it worked itself out quickly.  As long as you nurse on demand your milk supply will end up evening out to exactly how much your daughter needs.

1 yr old sleeping habbits?



My little boy is getting older and has had a total attitude change as well as a crazy sleeping schedule. I knew that his sleeping habits were going to change due to him growing up but he has no set schedule. I have just been going with the flow with his sleeping when he gets cranky and rubbing his eyes I put him down but the problem is that he only sleeps for 15-30 min. never for 1 hr. I would like to have him take a 2hr nap in the middle of the day but like I said only 30 min at the most. What should I do.

First word..........?



My daughter is 8 months 3 weeks and has just started saying "oof oof" when she sees or hears a dog.
I am just curious as to how many people would count this as a first word or not.
I am a speech pathologist and I know what it would count as technically speaking but would love to here from other mummies. I think sometimes my professional background gets in the way when it comes to my daughter speech and language development lol



</question>



<additional details>



She does say it to the cat sometimes lol...so I kind of take it to mean "animal" more than dog. But it is more used for the dogs

Onomatopoeia's are words! They're just a little different lol. If she is using it to distinguish between certain objects or things I think that is awesome. I'd count it :)

Of course it's a word!! She put it together that a dog makes that sound, and she's vocalizing it. Don't be insecure when it comes to your opinions about your child. Call it like you see it, she's YOUR child. I'm not trying to sound rude, I promise!!! I've learned that all mothers have opinions about what's what...and it's ok to disagree.



Don't forget to write this down in her baby book...and even write a story about how you weren't sure. That's what makes memories special...they're imperfect!! Congrats on your daughter's milestone :)

My daughter was 8 months old when she started saying "dig dig" every time she saw a dog. At first I wasn't sure she knew what she was doing, but she definitely did, she kept it up consistently. She's now 15 months and she still gets so excited every time she sees a dog but now her pronunciation is a bit better. I'd say yes, count it as a first word.

Do animal sounds count as words?  I always think it's interesting that people want their kids to learn how animals talk before they learn how people talk.  :)



I think that it does count.  If you consider a word to be something that she says with relative clarity and is consistent in its meaning (and more or less correct), it definitely is a word.

She could be colic. Try running the vacuum, and if they soothes her cries, then that's probably what it is. My baby suffered bad from colic, and always wanted me to hold her, and acted like she was starving all the time! The soothing movements from your walking is what calms here! I do think you have a colic baby on your hands! Does she spit up a lot?

It can, but that largely depends on you. If you keep accommodating it she will expect it and it gets to be something you have to do just for a little peace. Don't be afraid to let the baby cry a little. It won't hurt her.  If you've seen to her every need and she still cries, then that's okay for a bit.  What we did when ours got demanding, put them down in bed, let them cry a few minutes, picked them up again (the way we wanted to) and often times they would be quiet. Sometimes they would just fall asleep.  Establish routine now, it will make your life easier later.

don't give in, she wants to be carried plus for u to be up. if she cries when u sit, too bad don't give in because if u do it won't go away ever. imagine her being 10 months and still in ur arms all day. my 3 yr old was like that because everyone would  carrry him since he was born. as soon as i would put him in his bouncer of sat with him, he'd cried he lungs out. i just let him cry until he got it that i was the boss, she will get it.  she will not change if u don't change her. stick to it and i know it will hurt to see ur baby cry but it's better for her to learn right now that she's only 9 wks than when she's crawling after u because she wants to get carried. my niece is turning 1 tomorrow and just started crawling yesterday, but has been crying for a yr now because she just wants to be carried. my sister always gives in to shut her up, but she's now 1 and very heavy to carry around. just be tuff and she'll learn. if u think it's colic try boiling her bottle water, i used to buy the gallons of water and still boil them and my son's colic stopped. i don't think it's colic because she'd be crying all day and night, and she wouldn't just stop when u carried her.

My advice to you is,You are making a rod for you back.I've had six children.Now just as long as your baby is feed,bathed,clean nappy.Put her into her bed and let her cry for ten minutes,when she realises mum is not going to pick her up each time she cries then she'll realise its not going to work.Babies are clever and smart too.Sometimes soft music playing in their room helps,just like the nursery in the hospital,they are use to noise from birth in the hospitals,and its very difficuilt for them once home,and before birth in your stomack, they were use to noise too.I hope this helps.Good Luck.

I do not agree that a 9 week old can be spoiled. First; is she on formula? If so it may be upsetting her system...for babies that is painful. If you are nursing she may be reacting to something you ate...like onions. This is a form of colic. Babies calm with warmth on their belly and gentle motion. When you sit down gravity jars the baby...it feels like a roller coaster ride when you are about to puke.



Check with her pediatrician...you should be able to talk to the nurse about this with out an appointment...it will change with age..but find out if your baby is suffering. Then holding her will be wonderful when she feels better. They grow so fast....enjoy.

Not enough milk to breast feed. Any way to produce more?



My little boy is 11 days old and I have been trying to breast feed. I tried just the breast until the third day. He didn't have any wet or dirty diapers since the merconium on the first two days. I tried to get him to latch on and feed for the first 15 minutes of every feeding then gave him a bottle so we would get SOMETHING in him. I started to pump, but I am only getting about 3 ounces a day. I don't know what else to do to produce more milk. 3 ounces isn't enough and I really don't want to formula feed him exclusively. Any tips?

You definately need to contact a latch league or breast feeding clinic to help you.



The first thing they're going to tell you is to stop offering him the bottle.  If you're serious about breast feeding him, you need to get him to take the breast before you introduce the bottle or he'll just take the bottle, it's easier for him.  Sure he may not be successful at first, but that's okay.  Both Mommies and babies need to learn how to breast feed, it is not an easy task!



The more he physically nurses from you, the more milk you'll make.  Keep yourself hydrated and eat lots of healthy meals.  Rest when baby rests.



If you really want to top him up, use a cup or something to tip it into his mouth.  You really don't want him to get nipple confusion.



Good luck!

My advice is to get a lactation consultant and work on your latch.  Baby was not getting enough milk because you both were not latching on correctly and stimulating the milk to come in.  At 11 days you should avoid a pump and fenugreek is not needed at this time.  Call your hospital ASAP, they have them on staff.  If you explain the diaper situation they will come right away.



Giving the bottle on the third day has totally confused the infant and for your milk to be able to come in properly you need the baby to nurse, not a pump.

just keep nursing him.  for some mothers and babies breastfeeding doesn't come naturally.  just keep him on the breast and encourage him, he'll get the hang of it gradually.



pumping is not necessary, it doesn't accurately reflect what the baby gets out, the baby's sucking is more efficient (and natural) than even the most expensive breast pump.  so give the pump a rest and practice with your baby only.



leave the bottle alone for about 4 weeks until baby is established with breastfeeding.  the way milk comes out of a bottle is different than how it comes out of your nipple, so that might mix him up a little bit.



i breastfed for 1 year, just fully weaned 2 days ago.



** at 11 days old, you should have a ton of milk, it's in there, even though you may not feel it, i promise...
drink a lot of water, before and after nursing.

Tip from my breastfeeding consultant:  Offer your breast to baby everytime they are hungry, then offer a bottle AFTER if you feel they are still hungry.  Baby is only 11 days old so stick with it and your milk will definitely grow.  It's too early yet to tell and most women give up at this point, so don't fall into that trap.  Keep on with what you are doing and eat lots of oatmeal and get Mothers Milk Tea.  That has fenugreek in it that stimulates milk production.  There are also capsules.  What also helped for me is to stay hydrated with water and gatorade (lime and orange flavor).  For some reason those helped me make a lot more milk.



EDIT:  The hospital gave my baby a bottle right off the bat and due to my C-section, breastfeeding was a hard and arduous task.  The baby was nipple confused but she quickly got over the "confusion" the more I put her on the breast.  I totally understand what you are going thru and don't feel that it's too late cause baby got confused with a bottle early on.  They do get over it, as long as they are still little and you keep at it.  Good luck and God Bless.

Nurse him all the time.  It will cause you to produce more milk over time.  Even if he's not getting much from you, try latching him on for at least 15 minutes every hour.  I know that seems like a lot, and it is, but that will help your body get a better understanding of the demand and boost your milk supply.



Also, make sure you're well-hydrated and not extremely stressed when you're trying to breastfeed.  Anxiety often interferes with your let-down reflex.  So try to sit, kick your feet up, take a deep breath and relax while you nurse the baby.



If you still have milk now, there's not reason you can't make more.  Keep trying and good luck!

This is a common problem.  First - many moms think their baby will starve that first couple of days if they don't supplement.  Not true.  This is the beginning of the problem, because once babies feed with a bottle nipple, they find out that it is so much less work than the breast, and we lose them forever :-(



First, drink TONS of fluid.  You cannot produce milk if you are not hydrated.  Second, be sure to eat a well-balanced diet.  You need carbs, protein, and fruits and vegetables.  Finally, be sure you are getting rest when the baby is resting.  Stress or lack of sleep can definitely affect breastmilk quantity/development.



You are supposed to wait several weeks before pumping milk, but since you have started, then try pumping every time you feed your son.  This way, you begin to teach your body what the demands are for breast milk.  The more you demand, the more your body produces.  As your son's appetite increases, you will be increasing your own production as well.



Finally, if you really want to breast feed exclusively, then once your milk development has increased, try to wean the baby over to breast feeding only.  It may be difficult for sure.  If he won't do it, then at least you'll have plenty of breast milk to feed him instead of formula.  They get used to the flavor of formula eventually, and then they reject breast milk then too.



Oh - and one other thing, talk to your pediatrician about mixing breast milk with formula.  My daughter did that for two whole months with her son, and that seemed to help the baby not have to adapt to one or the other!



God bless you and your baby!

Learned the hard way when I took my son off of breast feeding after three days.  He never would breast feed after that, and I dried up very quickly.  With my daughter and her son (she lived with me the first six months after the baby was born), we put together this strategy and it worked very well.

Firstly, you need to see your health nurse and get into a lactation consultant. They are brilliant. They will have more tips and advice than you could ever need! Right now though you should make sure you drinks plenty of water (no less than 2.2lt a day) and eat really well. Your body needs the fluid to produce milk. You can increase the frequency of pumping as breast milk is made on a supply- demand system. The more you pump more often the more you'll produce faster. When you pump or feed make sure you empty the breast so that it fills completely instead of just making a small amount of replacement milk. The other thing you can do is stop worrying! Your baby will fine no matter how he gets fed - breast or bottle, the main thing is to enjoy every second.

remember breastfed babies also go through times of "cluster feeding" meaning they will want to nurse all the time... this is normal... it will the stimulation of sucking will stimulate your body to make more milk.... cluster feeding is normal and does NOT mean you are not producing enough



by introducing the bottle this early it is possible he may reject breastfeeding because it does cause them to work harder for the milk than a bottle...



stop the bottle and just breastfeed!
if you want to be able to continue nursing....



get ahold of a lactation specialist

My baby is 9 weeks old. I had the same problem, my mom told me to include lots of liquids in my diet. I would drink 64 oz of water a day and have lots of chicken noodle soup. It took a few days but I did start to produce 3 oz on each feeding. Also keep trying to breast feed or pump. The more that is happening the more you will produce.

My daughter got her 6 month shots yesterday and her leg is red and theres a knot under the redness.

She doesnt have a fever or anything but it is sore when its touched even lightly. Thank you :)

That looks pretty normal.  My kids always get spots like that when they get their shots.  One of the shots, I think it's the DTAP, seems to cause a lot of redness and some swelling.  It's pretty common.



Try alternating warm and cool compresses and Tylenol to keep her comfortable.  As long as she has no fever and no serious swelling (like the whole leg) she's probably fine.  But take her to the Dr. if you're really worried about it.

Just massage the area gently, and place cool rags on her injection site! My daughter def. had this problem, and that's what her doctor told me to do. Also, try giving her tylenol every 4 hours, unless your doctor told you not to! It will help with the swelling and ease her pain a bit.

just massage the area with a wet towel. sometimes its good to massaged the injections site so the all the med can go in the muscle. if no fever then she will be fine, just take her to the doc just in case.

very normal.  I was worried too when my pumpkin got a huge knot also. Hers lasted 6 weeks!  I was really getting worried but it did finally go away. She usually still gets a knot every time she gets a shot but now the knot only lasts a couple of days.  No need to worry its normal, even the big knots!

A question for parents who are AGAINST the CIO method, and those alone?



I am completely with you on that, I could never nor will never let my son 'cry it out' for my own benefit, I won't ramble on but I just don't agree with it.



Anyway, for the last few months it's been tough getting my now 10 month old to go to sleep - it can take up to 2 or 3 hours in the evening, and now he's waking up in the night again it leaves me very little time to do my work that I need to keep up with as I'm studying a degree from home. I'm a single mum so don't have anyone else to rely on. However my son comes first and if he needs me to sit with him for hours then that is what I do (and those of you who think that's wrong, keep your opinions to yourself!), but obviously if I could *humanely* cut down the number of hours it takes to get him off to sleep, I would. Anyway I've got so used to the routine of trying to get him off to sleep after his bedtime bottle that I don't even attempt to leave the room any more as I know he always screams the second I do. However two nights ago I needed to quickly nip out the room after he'd finished his bottle as I was desperate for the loo, so I kissed him on his head and shut the door (the light was already off). He instantly burst into tears the second I closed the door, but the crying only lasted around 5 or 6 seconds, and then he stopped. When I came out of the bathroom, all was quiet, so I waited outside the room for ages and could hear movement at first and then eventually he went silent, so I went in and checked and he was fast asleep! So last night I thought I'd try the same - I kissed him on the head and went out the room, he burst into tears for 5 or 6 seconds and then instantly stopped again, and went to sleep soon after. I know the crying is just tantrum that I've left, and there isn't anything actually wrong, but I just feel SO guilty that I've left him and he knew that when he cried I didn't come back even if it was only for a few seconds. However he gets to sleep so much faster than he does when I'm in there with him, and also it gives me a couple more hours to get work done in the evening which is precious! So I just wanted advice from parents who are AGAINST crying it out - do you think this is acceptible? I could NEVER leave him to cry for an extended period, not even a couple of minutes, I just don't believe in a baby crying himself to sleep, but as I said this is just 5 or 6 seconds and then he starts playing in his cot and then eventually drifts off by himself. Would you do this or would you go in the second he cries?



Please don't answer if you are pro-CIO - I have no interest in hearing your opinions, thanks.



</question>



<additional details>



Anna N - did you actually read my question past the first line lol?



Sophies Mummy - that's what I've been doing for the last few months pretty much, except with him it takes an awful lot longer, and also tried without the bedtime bottle and there's no hope then, he won't drink earlier in the day and obviously I'm not going to let him go to bed thirsty. I've tried every humane method possible (by humane I mean other than just leaving him crying - I don't consider that humane) and nothing works!



Elyse's Mommy - I would never let someone else make the decision for me, but I'm just confused over my own feelings and thought some outsiders opinions might help me think clearly. If you had a problem with that you shouldn't have f***ing answered should you.

I can't let my baby cry either, but 5-6 seconds is not bad at all!  I'd say it's great that your baby has learned to soothe himself to sleep.  You are lucky!  Keep it up!

I am against the crying out method if the baby is screaming crying...when the baby is crying because they are sleepy-it is time to let them cry-a few seconds or a few minutes is not horrible and is better for you and the baby-as long as he is feed, diaper is changed, and you spent some loving time with him, then if you need to let him cry for even a minute and falls asleep that is what he needs!! Just now (I am a single mom too but I live with my parents) my baby girl was crying so hard and I couldnt figure out why-I had to take a rest since it was over 30 minutes-i put her down 30 seconds later she fell asleep. My dad said this...babies dont always want to be held all the time, especially when they are sleepy. I think the CIO is when parents get confused on when to do it-if they are fussy or tired-its time to let them settle themselves-but if they are truly upset about something-and you know-you need to be there for them. Remember babies cry for a reason-if they are sleepy-they dont know they are and they feel strange so they cry-I would say its alright to do this-as long in my opinion if he isnt CRYING for 5 minutes straight-if he is fussy or just moving-i wouldn't do anything. 10 months old....its ok do this do for a few minutes as long as you know he isnt so upset and just sleepy.

i never once was able to allow either one of my boys to cry it out it tore me up so bad i would start crying myself. I have a 2 year old and a 3 month oldmy 3 month old has to be held and rocked to sleep every night and also during hte day to take his nap and he does the same thing when i put him in bed he wakes up screaming, i of course run and pick him up my bf hates it he says i'm spoiling him, and he will turn out a brat. but HELL NO i do not believe a baby should cry them selfs to sleep its not their fault. They are still babies however i do believe once they hit 5+ then yeah if there is nothing wrong with them have at it. lol, till then sorry they are my babies.

I am very against CIO. I think the 5-6 seconds he cries is fine. I usually put Cade down once he shows signs of being tired. I lay him in his crib and close the door and turn off the lights. Sometimes I will hear him moan and I will watch him from the crack in his door and about 2 minutes later he is out. Cade is very vocal before he falls asleep. I would not worry about what your are doing at all. Yuo have your child best interest at heart. I am also a believer that sometimes chilren need their own personal time, that may be the reason he is playing in hi cot.

im so anti CIO.



take the bedtime bottle away. teach him to go to his cot and fall asleep on his own. i had similar problems and this solved my problems. establish a good solid routine.. my routine is -



5.45pm - dinner



6pm - bath with sleepytime bubbles and massage with lavender bedtime cream, then PJs on.



6.20pm - her fave show is on



6.50pm - we have a 9oz bottle, then read a story. if i see she is falling asleep on the bottle i take it off her.



7pm - she plays till she starts tiring.



7.30/8.00pm - she tires, we say our goodnights, kisses and cuddles etc. she gets the toy she wants for the night then i put her in her cot.



i put her lullaby light show on and give her a dummy.



i leave the room. she whines on noticing im not there and stands up.



i go back in right away, shhh her and lay her back down.



i do this continually till she is sleeping.



night 1 took 20min of in and out.
night 2 took 15min, night 3 took 10min and night 4 took 5min.



by night 5 she realised it was bedtime, mummy wasnt taking her out of the cot, and it was ok because if she needed me im straight back in there. so she goes to bed feeling secure and bedtime is a nice time, not a time to be scared and left to cry.



once she was used to this, i stopped taking her into our bed in the middle of the night, this was harder. i dont this as i done before. but she would cry, but i would cuddle her as she was standing in the cot and spoke to her, but she did not get out of the cot. i stayed awake with her till she fell asleep, i was right beside her and she knew i was there.



again, after a few nights she learned there was nothing to be scared of. now at 15mos, she is in her cot for 12hours a night. she wakes but self soothes.

I'm definitely against letting a baby cry for more than a minute if you're there to comfort them. Only because they then get worked up and more and more upset.  But 5 or 6 seconds I have no problem with, he's obviously only doing it because you've just gone out of the room, nothing's wrong with him because he stops it so fast.

A few seconds, is NOT CIO.



I don't do CIO, but I am a honest person. My kids have cried longer than your son, because I am cooking dinner, or holding another on, or just doing things.
Of a night, I don't allow them to cry, longer than it takes me to get there & honestly it takes longer than 5-6 seconds for me to get to them.

I gave my baby following food.



One bowl of rice washed in water, dried in shade, gentle roasting  in  pan, coarsely grind in a mixer.
One bowl of Moong dal ( an typical Indian pulse), same procedure as that for the rice as mentioned above.



Mix both the things together and use it in the following way.



Take three to four teaspoons of the mixture and then cook it in about 150 ml of water along with carrot or cabbage or tomato with soem salt to taste, till the things turn soft.  Add some butter of ghee to it at the time of feeding. This gives almost completer nourishment as it is a rich source for protein, starch and vitamins.

The best bottles are Dr. Browns or playtex airvent which reduce gas and help with colic, but really any bottle that is BPA free is good. As far as nipples go, if you are breastfeeding then, go with the NUK silicone nipples, because they simulate a nipple so the baby does not get confused between the real nipple and the bottle.

I used the Breastflow bottles by First Years. They are the closest to breastfeeding. I nursed for the first 6 weeks and then due to a medical condition I had to switch to formula and these were the only bottle my daughter would take. They were the only ones that she did not spit up everything with.

It can really vary from baby to baby.  Don't stock up on one particular brand until after your baby is born.  You may have to try a few bottles before you find one that works well for your baby.  Some bottles that work great for other babies, may leave your baby with gas, or may be hard for your baby to drink from.  Buy a few types of different bottles.... and see what your baby does well with.... then go out and buy some more.



Personally, we found that the playtex vent air (wide) worked great for us.  We used wide because that's what is recommend for nursing mothers.  IF your not nursing.... then it won't matter if you buy regular or wide as much..... but I am no longer nursing and I still purchase wide just because I think they work great for my son.

I used a lot of different bottles, but Playtex Drop-Ins were by far the best. You can push the air out of them so no gas... They are extremely convenient to use while traveling. I am pregnant again and due in Feb. also and without a doubt will be using the Playtex Drop-Ins. I breastfed and my son had no problem switching back and forth. He rarely spit up and when he did it was only a tiny amount. He was a very happy baby, not at all colicky or gassy.



The only downside is having to buy the liners, but Wal-mart has a generic brand that fit the Playtex bottles that are a little cheaper. And In My Opinion well worth the money.

I have a 2 year old little girl, and I breast fed her for the first 6 months,  When I decided to go to a bottle I tried EVERY bottle i could.  The only ones that didn't give her gas were Playtex nurser



drop-ins system.  They were the BEST!  The liners will cost a little more, but they are SOOOO worth it to have a happy non gassy baby.



I did notice that the playtex ventaire and Dr brown's bottles Leaked very bad.  Regular bottles made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable.  Avent bottles are pretty good, and the ones with liners are just as good as the playtex drop ins.  just a little more expensive.



CONGRATS!  and Good luck!!

Playtex drop-ins hands down.  Along with many other types I tried the Playtex Vent-Aire also and found no difference in reducing air.  WAY too many parts to wash.  I wish I'd had the drop-ins for my first born.

Ok, my daughter was really  bad colic, and also had acid reflux (GERD) her doctor told me to put rice cereal in her milk, which helps reduce spitting up, and also cuts down on feeding, because usually colic babies want to eat 24/7 because its only a temporary fix. Her doctor explained



that when a baby is colic, they think they are hungry, but it only increases the pain! I would try the rice cereal, and also they make something called Gripe Water. It helps also!

I believe colic is where the baby will cry for hours sometimes at the same time every day. It's not proven that it has to do with gas but the chances are it is.  Peds. will give you meds to calm the baby down, but really Colic is something babies just grow out of.



Reflex is where the milk is not digested and will come back up and the baby will spit it out, thus losing weight. For reflex the best thing to do is burp the baby alot in between feedings.  Also, give the baby woodwards Gripe water, it helps with the digestion. Or call the ped. and they will prescribe something....

Colic means that they can not find a cause for the baby's pain.



Reflux -or more properly GERD is when a baby has more reflux than is normal and it causes pain.  (Normal reflux is GER -no D as its not a disease)



The best thing to deal with both colic and GER is lifestyle changes.  Increased holding is very effective for both.  As is paying more attention to when and how much you feed baby, what position they are in during and after feeds, etc.

When is it safe for her to be on her tummy?

It's definitly safe right now. :)  Once they can roll over themselves, it's not a concern AT ALL. :)  She's well past that.  With a mattress topper - you've done the right thing putting her in her own crib.  It's about this age I made my son sleep in his bed all the time - I would always sleep with him on my arm so he wouldn't roll, & about the time my arm gets really numb from the weight is when they have to go in their crib all the time. :)

As long as you put your baby down on her back, she's safe to sleep any way up she chooses - i.e. the moment she can roll to be face down she's safe to sleep that way. Stop wasting your time and disturbing her sleep patterns flipping her - how would you like it if someone did that to you every time you got comfortable?

hi im not sure to be exact but my health nurse said once they can master rolling its ok, as they will turn their heads once they are on their stomachs.My daughter has mastered rolling but i still stress about it and watch her to make sure she does turn her head during the day when she naps.
However im not that worried about it now,after talking to health nurse,so if you are still concerned maybe get more advice from a Professional. I hope this helps you all the best.

If she can roll then she is probably fine. My baby started rolling on his tummy at 5 months. I hated it. But, soon I gave up on flipping him back over one hes 7 months old now and sleeps either on his tummy, or side.

May not be anything too big, but I would call the dr. and tlak to them about the fact that the poop is green. I remember reading something the green poop is not usually good. If she has not had any green foods, I would call. Sounds like she may have just had a little too much food or getting over being sick......

Sounds like the teething fairy is paying her a visit - My daughter always has loose bowels when she's cutting teeth too!



My daughter didn't have diarrhea with the first two - but the last 4 she has...she has 6 teeth now...and the fact that she only has 3 through makes me think "Where is the 4th".  Teeth almost always come in pairs.

You need to contact your pediatrician asap. There may not be anything wrong with her, maybe another tooth is on the way who knows, only her doctor can tell you. Make sure she gets lots of water.

My baby won't sleep? Can you help me?



I have a 6 month old baby and he doesn't sleep at all. I have asked our pediatrician and she keeps telling me to sleep train him. And I've tried that. But the thing is he doesn't sleep during the day or night. And if he does, it's 15 minutes here and there. Then maybe if I'm lucky he sleeps 45 minutes. Then at night he hardly sleeps at all... I don't understand whats going on? Did/does anyone have this problem and what did you do for it?

First make sure he is nice and full before putting him to sleep ... 2nd I know this sound extremely cruel but it works ... let him cry himself to sleep for up to 45 mins ... do NOT go in and interrupt him unless he sounds like he's choking or something horrible, this will tire him out, build his lung and it is PROVEN that a baby that cries himself to sleep sleeps more sound! After awhile he will cry less and less each night! ....Also my baby sleeps for 12hrs at night and 3 during the day! BUT only if i have country music on and some what loud to ... try that ... good luck

Its difficult my boy was like that but he is fine now at 11 months. day time i wasnt too bothered with but night times i suggest you try and resolve first.
before he goes to bed bath him play with him or read him a book with some calm music. you have probably tried these but i suggest you stick to one strict bed time routine! 8pm nath was in bed by at 6 months every night no acceptions and now he goes down about 7pm and sleeps right through till 7/8 if im lucky. just keep doing the same thing over and over, and when he wakes up in the night keep him in a dark room, cuddle him for a bit then put him straight down and leave him, if he cries go back and do the SAME again. over and over and over, keep doing the same things!! i cant stress that enough. he will get it sooner or later. goood luck. x

You have to be willing to let him work it out on his own. You don't have to leave him there screaming for hours, but he needs to learn how to fall asleep on his own. Have a bed time routine. My 7 months old has always been bottle, bath, lotion, pj's, soft baby music and bed. We do this every night so she knows when it's time to start settling down to sleep. Also, make sure he doesn't need a special kind of formula (hypoallergenic) as this gas can cause colic and result in discomfort and zero sleeping. Good luck!

I've had this same problem with my 2 yr. old and some of my friends have gone through this with their young toddlers and all of them told me about and swear by giving my daughter a half of teaspoon (crushed up) of "Melatonin" either in some food or drink and that will get them right to sleep and on a normal routine..Melatonin is actually a normal thing produced in your body but some people have lower levels of in which they dont sleep. So this natural sleep aid regulates that for you...its also something you can just go up to any store and get; in the pharmacy area..and if you want more info. or have any questions about it you can talk to them about it...I did, and they told me that it was fine for babies and kids as a natural sleep aid. Hope this helps and Good Luck!

What about medications to help my child sleep better?
Research has shown that behavioral treatments (in other words, parents using good sleep time strategies) work better, and have longer lasting effects than medicines.  If your child needs more than a behavioral program to help them fall asleep, you may want to talk to your child’s doctor about trying Melatonin.  When used under the direction of your child’s doctor, Melatonin can be a safe and effective treatment for kids [10], and is especially useful for kids with special needs who have more troublesome sleep problems [11,12,13].



Melatonin is an over-the-counter medication in the U.S. But even though you do not need a prescription to get it, be sure to talk with your child's doctor to find out whether it is appropriate for your child, and how to use it safely.

Hi,



I think the most important thing to start with is to get your baby into a good sleep routine.  I had massive problems with getting my 4 month old son to sleep.  He would just lie awake and cry for hours, then when he finally went to sleep he would wake every hour or two hours through the night and cry again!  Talk about pulling our hair out .... we were absolutely desperate for sleep!



It was a baby sleep audio program recommended by a friend that finally saved us. We followed the advice and began by creating a baby sleep routine which included bathtime, dimming of the lights, putting James into his crib, final nappy change and then lullabies. We also made recommended changes to his naps during the day and used some of the other recommended techniques. Within two weeks he was sleeping through the night most nights with just the odd night where he would just wake once!



Definitely start by creating a good baby sleep routine though and you could find that solves most of your baby sleep problems.



Good luck!

What's your solids feeding schedule like for your baby?



My baby is 7 months old.. he's breastfed throughout the day and his schedule is something like this:
7-8am breastfeed, then cereal and fruit
12pm breastfeed, then either fruits or veggies
4-5pm nurse only
6pm, fruits and veggies



8pm, nurse then bed



I'm wondering if I should give him some cereal during dinner, because eversince I stopped, he started waking up much earlier during the night to nurse... used to sleep 8-5am, now he's waking up at 3 to nurse.



Also, what are the quantities you are giving of solids? My doctor said two tablespoons at each feeding, but sometimes my baby wants more, so I just give him until he's not opening his mouth anymore... is that ok?  If I give him cereal in the evening also... should I still give him the fruits and veggies along with it?

That sounds really good. I feed mine until they don't open their mouths anymore. Don't measure food and expect it to satisfy every baby, makes no sense. Some need more, some less.



Absolutly give him cereal in the evening. Just mix it with breastmilk, so he gets the little extra nutrients. Then nurse him.



In the first year babies need most of their nutrients from breast/bottle, but you are also training baby healthy eating habits, so feed him food when he wants food.

sounds like your doing everything right hun. go with waht you baby wants. my baby is 11 months now and has always had more than i thought he would.  If cereal during dinner seems to help him sleep longer keep doing it he obviously wants it :)  you can jus give him the cereal but jus to change it night by night maybe add a bit of banana or pear for added yumminess.
Your doing it all ok hun, good luck x

My girl is 7 months old too. This is her schedule:



7:30 am-5 oz bottle and 2nd step fruit (sometimes some cereal)
10:30am- 4 oz bottle and 2nd step vegetable
1:30pm- 4 oz bottle and 2nd step meat entree
4:30pm- 4 oz bottle and 2nd step fruit
7:30 pm- 4 oz bottle and 2nd step vegetable or meat



She basically has a 4 oz bottle and a 2nd step food every 3 hours from 7:30 am-pm then bath and bedtime. It's a good routine although we're trying to cut it down as it's quite often for a 7 month old :)

Sounds like way too little nursing and too much food.  Up till a year a breastfed infant's calories should be max 25% from solids - the majority should be breast milk.  Elyse is also 7 months.  She nurses about 6-8 times a day plus two 5-6 oz bottles of expressed milk while I am at work.  We introduce food once or twice a day - sometimes she eats a bite, sometimes she doesn't.  It's all practice up until a year - your baby needs your breast milk, not more solids, that is why he is waking up to nurse more.

Egg whites are highly allergenic. (Most people who are allergic to eggs are allergic to the whites.)



However, recent research has found that routinely avoiding allergins in older babies (babies old enough to be eating solids at all -- 6 months+) does NOT reduce the odds of allergy.  So current advice says that, unless there is a strong personal/family history of allergy, there is no need to hold off on egg whites.  (Many books/websites have not yet been changed to reflect current research.)

Will my baby girl always be 'big'?



My 6 month old baby is almost 18 pounds and consistently weights in the 75% - 90% range. The Dr. says she is perfectly healthy and this is great, however I am wondering if this means she will likely always be on the ‘large’ side compared to other girls. I am fairly petite, but my husband is big-boned. I am wondering if this means she will take after my husband, or if it is too soon to tell.

It really depends on how active she becomes and her food intake vs exercise later in life.  Some people who are big as children, continue that trend throughout life - but a big baby does not mean a chubby child and vice versa.

It's really too soon to tell.  Having a "big" baby is really healthy but that is no indicator whatsoever of how big she will be when she gets older.  Usually big babies tend to slim down as soon as they start crawling and walking...  And by the time she's a toddler she will be the same size as the rest of the children.  Don't worry!!!

It is wayyyy too early to tell.  She sounds like she could take after her father as far as being big-boned but there's no way to predict how "big" she will be.  My boys have always been in the 90 percentile on their weight.  You can take a look at my 360 page if you like (I think there's a link on my profile) and see some pictures of my boys there.  My oldest is still in the 90 percentile at almost 4 years of age but I don't consider him "big" at all!  My youngest weighed 20lbs, 1oz at his 6 month check up and at 8 months, I don't think he's gained a pound (if not lost).  He has really thinned out since he became mobile.

It is too soon to tell, because alot of children grow out of their "baby fat".  Baby fat is not a good term anyway, because they are not fat, they are just healthy babies, like your baby.  As long as you don't give your child alot of fast food or junk food, don't worry about it.  Just make sure your baby is healthy, happy and loved.  Hope I helped!

Baby boy unexpected, and drastic change in sleeping pattern....?



my son is 4 months and started sleeping through the night from about 9 to about 5 at three months... a couple times he even made it to about 7... but the last 2 weeks he has been waking up alot more frequently...
up until 3 nights ago he was waking up about 2 times once around 3 then again at 6...
i didnt worry too much about this bcuz however frustrating it is i know that babies sleeping is often varried before a real established routine is set.
but three nights ago he went to sleep at 9 and woke up at 1, 3, 4, 5, then 7...
and he has kept that same pattern for 3 nights now!
its geting pretty hard on me... but i am worried about him...this seems almost to drastic...
any suggestions???
he does have a diaper rash but he seems ok with it during the day.... i havent noticed any more gas than normal... he is still eating the same amounts...
everything seems to be the same....

Overactive gag reflex?



Almost every time my 2 month old baby yawns, he gags and chokes.  Is this strange?  It just started a couple of weeks ago (after our 2 month checkup).  Should I call the pediatrician, or just talk to him about at our 4 month checkup?

There are few published reports on the effects of marijuana on breastfed infants. Some studies suggest that one-time use of marijuana leaves only minute amounts of THC, the active component in marijuana. THC is fat-soluble, which means it builds up in the body with chronic use. After a breastfeeding mother uses marijuana, THC is evident in her baby's urine and stools (Perez-Reyes and Wall, 1982).



Any secondhand smoke the baby is exposed to increases the amount of the drug he receives. And animal studies indicate that marijuana may suppress lactation. It stands to reason that an infant exposed to large quantities of secondhand smoke could become too lethargic to nurse. The combined effects of less breast milk and less suckling from the infant could further depress the mother's milk supply and create problems for the baby.



http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/viewa...
Susan J. Astley, PhD, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Washington, and Ruth E. Little, ScD, Researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, wrote in their article "Maternal Marijuana Use During Lactation and Infant Development at One Year," published in Mar. 1990 in the journal Neurotoxicology and Teratology:



"Very little is known about the effect of postnatal marijuana exposure on infant development. Postnatal exposure can result from maternal use of marijuana during lactation. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) transfers and concentrates in the mother's milk and is absorbed and metabolized by the nursing infant.



The present study investigated the relationship between infant exposure to marijuana via the mother's milk and infant motor and mental development at one year of age. One hundred and thirty-six breast-fed infants were assessed at one year of age for motor and mental development. Sixty-eight infants were exposed to marijuana via the mother's milk. An additional 68 infants were matched to the marijuana-exposed infants on pre- and postpartum maternal alcohol and tobacco use.



Marijuana exposure via the mother's milk during the first month postpartum appeared to be associated with a decrease in infant motor development at one year of age."



http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...



Separate from the direct, chemical effects of marijuana on a baby, use of marijuana may affect a mother's ability to be able to properly care for her baby. Maternal judgment may be impaired.



Any secondhand smoke the baby is exposed to increases the amount of the drug your baby receives. Also, because street drugs are rarely pure, marijuana may be laced with other drugs or substances that can also be harmful to the breastfeeding baby.



The active ingredient in marijuana, THC, will be stored in mom's fat tissues for long periods (weeks to months) and will build up in the body with continued use. Small to moderate secretion into breastmilk has been documented, and THC is concentrated in human milk. According to Hale, analysis of breastmilk from chronic heavy users indicated an eight-fold concentration in milk compared to mom's blood plasma, however the dose received by baby was insufficient to produce significant side effects. Studies have shown significant absorption and metabolism in infants, although long term effects have not been shown.



Marijuana can cause sleepiness in the baby, which can lead to slow weight gain and possibly slow overall development in the baby long term. In addition, babies whose mothers smoke marijuana regularly have a higher risk of SIDS.



Hale reports a possibility of decreased milk production. In animals, THC decreases the amount of milk produced by suppressing the production of prolactin and, possibly, by a direct action on the mammary glands.



There is significant brain growth occurring during a baby's first months of life; marijuana may alter brain cells. Animal studies (on babies whose mothers' milk contained THC) have shown that DNA and RNA metabolism may also be affected and the proteins needed for proper growth and development impaired.



After a breastfeeding mother uses marijuana, THC is evident in her baby's urine and stools (Perez-Reyes and Wall, 1982). Infants exposed to marijuana via breast milk will test positive in urine screens for long periods (2-3 weeks).



One study (Astley and Little, 1990) found that exposure to marijuana through their mother's milk during the first month of life resulted in decreased motor development at one year of age. In another study of 27 infants evaluated at 1 year of age who were exposed to marijuana via breastmilk (compared to 35 nonexposed infants), no significant differences were found in terms of age at weaning, growth, and mental or motor development. Follow-up of these infants has been limited.



Long-term effects of marijuana exposure through breastmilk are unknown.

At this time everything she does affects her baby. A girl i know wasn't eating properly and breast feeding. She took her baby to the doctor for a check up, and they was calling child protective services for her because they thought she wasn't feeding her baby, but it wasn't that she wasn't feeding her baby she just didn't have enough nutrition in her milk, cause she wasn't eating right. So just think about what smoking pot will do.

This doesn't seem to be a big "hurry".  What you say, obviously isn't going to stop what she already wants to do.
It's her choice.  Is she neglecting her child?  Is she literally smoking right in front of or near the child?



What do the rastafarian mothers do?  They do the same and their children are fine.  Let her be the parent she wants.  It may be wrong to some, but it's her choice.  As long as she's taking care of her child and she loves the child, that's all that matters IMO.

according to my doctor when i was pregnant it does get in the breast milk. It not only flavors the milk it will make the child high. Ask her if she wants her baby to be a pothead. Explain to her that she has a choice the child doesn't and that what she is doing could be considered child abuse.

What is a normal newborn weight gain?



I am breastfeeding exclusively and my newborn is 12 days old.  He was 6lb 9oz when he was born, 6lb 5oz when we left the hospital, 6lb 7oz at his apt when he was 4 days old, and yesterday at his apt he was 11 days old and weighed 6lb 13oz.  The doctor didn't seem concerned, yet he didn't seem happy.  Is this not enough of a weight gain (6oz in 1 week)?  I am always worried since I can't actually tell how much he is eating.  How much and how fast did your newborn gain?

6 oz. is perfect. Plus, the first week and a half they lose about 10% of their birth weight anyways. I was worried about the same thing and after a month of my daughter not gaining weight, my doctor asked me to supplement with formula. Stick it out, not enough time has passed to tell yet.

I breastfed my son exclusively too.  He was 8 lbs. 6 oz at birth and 8 lbs when we left the hospital.  At his one week checkup he was 8lbs 4 oz and at 2 weeks he was 8lbs 9oz. My doctor also told me that breastfed babies tend to gain weight slower, which is not necessarily a bad thing.



Most babies lose weight during their first week and then get back up to their birth weight by the time they are two weeks old. Since he is over his birth weight, your Pediatrician is probably right that he is growing just fine.



Also, newborns usually gain about two-thirds of an ounce each day. So if he was 6lb. 7oz. at about 4 days of life, then he gained 6 ounces over the next 7 days, which is still well within normal expectations.



If your really concerned check with your doctor. But he sounds healthy and happy to me! :)



Good Luck & God Bless! Congrats on your little one!

Am I being completely selfish?



I'm really upset right now.  I just had a huge fight with my husband over the phone.
I did a post about this situation last week and received a lot of great feedback.  Although I took some of the advice and it has backfired on me.
My husband's family lives about 3 hours from us.  We live in the same city as my family.  I'm due tomorrow with our first baby.  I don't think I'll be having the baby tomorrow though!  His mom wanted to come stay with us for the first week our baby is here.  Like we are to call her as soon as I'm in labor and she will come right away and then stay for a week.  I've never wanted this...I wanted alone time with my husband and baby.  But I knew there would be World War III if I didn't go along with it.  So reluctantly I said yes.  That was several months ago.



As I've come closer to my due date I've really thought about how I do not want her here.  I understand she wants to see the baby...but couldn't she wait a couple weeks?  Drop in visitors I am fine with...in house guests for a week immediately following the birth of my first child...not exactly something I'm thrilled about.  I had told my husband all along that I was not thrilled with this idea but that I would go along with it as to not piss anyone off.  Well now I'm about to give birth and am more concerned with my own well being.  I just got a call this morning from the doctor's office to schedule my induction for next wednesday.  I called my husband and told him.  He immediately calls his parents and then calls me back to say, "They will be coming on Wednesday, is that okay?"  I hesitated and said "Okay, that's fine."  So since he knows I'm not crazy about his mother and father coming here (the plan is for his dad to stay a couple days, his mom to stay a week) he says he knows I'm not fine with it.  I just told him again how he knows I'm not fine with it but that I don't really have a choice since I already agreed to it.  This then leads to how all I'm thinking about is myself...his parents are so excited to see this baby and I'm going to deny them of that...why don't I tell my family that they can't see our baby at all.



I just want time alone with my husband and baby after giving birth.  I don't want houseguests.  But I'm only thinking of myself right now according to him.  It's his baby too.  I just feel like he's trying to make his parents happy instead of me.  Am I being a total jerk?  I shouldn't have said anything...I should have just gone along with it.  Now he's probably called them and totally trashed me and it'll be even worse.



To make matters worse today is his birthday.  He said to me thanks a lot for ruining my birthday and the birth of my child and then hung up on me.  I'm just so upset.

I don't think he's really thinking of you; some woman would love the help some would rather be on they're own. He needs to think about you not his family; you are carrying the baby, have been for 9 months, your going to give birth. Your not selfish you just want peace to welcome your baby. Don't just give in to want he wants.

If your husband is totally trashing you to his parents I think HE needs a swift kick in his butt. How rude and totally immature!! I'd tell him that if he wants his parents to come then he needs to clean, cook, do laundry and entertain him because you most certainly won't. Do you have friends who have children? Maybe the husband can talk to your husband and tell him what to expect the first couple of weeks. Maybe having another guy telling him will get through to him. Bottom line is that you don't want her there so she doesn't have to be there. Sounds like you'll have to tell her though. It's about you, hubby, and the baby. Not just about the two of you anymore. Good luck!! Congrats on your new family member! =)

this is a situation where no matter what you do, somebody is going to be upset, either yourself, your in-laws or your husband. so you just have to decide if you can deal just to keep the peace, or if it's worth making everyone mad.
but...my bestfriend just had her first baby and her mom came and stayed for a week and she was SOOOO grateful. she says that first week was the hardest week of her life and if she hadn't had help, she doesn't know what she would have done. so, if you decide to just let them come, look on the bright side and take full advantage of the help you'll have.

No, you are NOT being selfish.



Why don't you call his mother up and talk to her yourself. Tell her she is more than welcomed to come VISIT the baby but those first couple weeks you just want it to be you, your husband, and your baby. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. You and your husband need this bonding time with your baby. She may take it better coming directly from you, too.



Then call up your husband and apologize(hopefully he will too) and explain how you're feeling to him. He needs to be more sensitive to what's going on. But YOU need to get all your feelings out there in the open to discuss. I've always been very honest with my husband, even if I knew it would make him angry. Honesty is a key trait in a successful marriage, so stop being afraid to tell your husband how you truly feel.

you are going to want the help. trust me. i know you want to spend time with just him and granted you will be able to sleep next to him and have his help the whole way. you will just have a little extra help when you need it. which you will. when you want a shower, eat, go to the store. you will thank them for comming trust me.



he is not trying to make his parents happy over you...grow up. he has done everything right im sure and made this pregnancy about you and him.



thank god they didnt have to go to the doctors with you. how would you feel about that?



my step daughter and mother in law were going to come to my 1st ultrasound but i decided i wanted it to be just him and i.

I think it is a sticky situation. I feel you ALL the way! I really do. I have had 3, and after EVERYONE of my births, all I have wanted is to go home and have NO visitors for a day or two and just relax and unwind and not worry about people coming or going and so on.
My mother in law and I get along quite well now, but after the birth of my first child I was ready to thump her! When was it HER turn to hold my baby? and so on and so on.
I am sure that your hubby is worried and will feel releived to have the extra help and reassurance of his mother there. But it seems that there HAS to be a better way about this, so that everyone is happy? We dont want to aleinate him, but also you need to feel comfortable and get off to a good stress free start (TRUST ME).
Maybe, if your inlaws come on weds when you are going to be induced and stay at the hospital with you while you are in labor. Then while you are staying in the hospital (which now a days is only 1 night) they can stay at your house. MAYBE, there is a way to suggest that the first maybe 2 days at home they can stay elsewhere, and maybe visit on occasion those days for like an hour here or there? Like if they could get a hotel or stay with some of your family or something?



Understand their excitement too, but as a mother myself, I wanted alone time just with my family. I hope there is a middle ground for you so that everyone is happy and no one is hurt. Explain to your hubby that you appreciate that his parents want to be here and help, but you really need a couple days and that you dont want to hurt feelings or get anyone angry with you, but it needs to be a stress free and happy time for your too.
Best of luck! Many prayers! Congrats on the new little one coming!

You are not selfish. Your wish for intimacy is very understandable.



But before you get too wound up on this: When you have a new baby, family staying with you is not there as bothersome house guests but as unpaid serving personal. With your new little angel in your arms and the physical exhaustion from birth, you won't have the time nor the energy to clean, cook, do laundry, get groceries etc. That is why they offer you to be there. They are going to work for you, not steal your time.

You may not like this answer, but you may want to take a few things into consideration.  If you MIL is going to help with cooking and cleaning, then it may be good to have her there.  If she is the type who expects you to cater to her, then put your foot down.  My mother had to deal with her stepmother and MIL in the house when I was born, and both of them expected her to do all the cooking even though she'd just had a baby!  My MIL stayed with us shortly after my daughter's birth, and I couldn't have done it without her!  My husband was just as tired as me and drop in guests were fabulous, but having someone there consistently to manage the visitors, food, etc. was a godsend!  My husband and I honestly just stayed in our bedroom most of the time bonding with our little one.  It was GREAT!

I do not think you are being selfish at all. You are under a lot of stress right now. Although it is a big deal for everyone, and stressful for everyone, you are the one having the baby, not them. I think is is perfectly reasonable to just want to be with your immediate family. They can wait, it is not the end of the world, they shouldn't be putting you through this extra stress.

Wow! Honey you don't need this! You're fixing to have a baby and you need good thoughts and good energy going into this. I'm guessing that you'll be thankful for your in-laws after a couple of sleepless nights, but that's just my personal thoughts. The point is, even though you're not happy about them being their, perhaps you can make the best of it. They won't be able to see the baby as often as your family will. I don't think you're being a jerk. I can understand that you want this private time with your husband and your new baby. That's exactly what I want after my baby comes, but since the situation is what it is, I would talk to your husband. Explain that you do want this to be private between the three of you, but that you understand how important it is to him. So try negotiating. How about they both stay for three days instead of a full week? Do you think you can handle that?



Either way, try to get some of that stress down.



Good luck, hon!

You're in a tough spot and neither of you is totally wrong.  You agreed in the first place and they made all these plans and were excited about them, and then you decided you wanted to change things.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't blame you.  I'm not sure I would want someone staying with me for the first week either.  However, maybe it will end up being a blessing in the end.  Does your mother-in-law plan on helping out with cooking and cleaning so you can rest and spend some quality time with your baby?  That would not be such a bad thing.  If she thinks that she is there as your guest and will be catered to while getting to know her grandchild, that would definitely be a problem.  Have you and your husband tried compromising?  If she comes on Wednesday and that's when you have the baby, you will most likely be in the hospital until Friday so you won't even be home the first couple of days.  Maybe she could just stay the weekend and then head home Sunday evening or Monday morning.  I'm sure it's very important to your husband to have his parents around.  Try to find a solution that you can both be comfortable with.  Keep in mind that doesn't mean that either of you totally gets your way, but you both need to be ok with how things are worked out.  Best of luck.

Your the one that's has to going through an induction,labor, and the birth! Personally i think you should be the one calling the shots. You needs time to recover and so does baby! Its hard on babies( well at least my baby) to be constantly passed around..they need time to bond with it's parents! But to be honest with you, you should have been honest with your husband from the start you should have told him you weren't comfortable with them coming right away and maybe they could come a week later( which really isn't much to ask). By then you kinda gotten you and your baby settled and then are prepared for company! I would still persist they wait...And as for him blowing up at you for "ruining his birthday and the birth of your child" you can tell him where to go and how to get there. You don't need that added stress right now..and playing guilt trips on you is not necessary. Stay Calm...and take care of that little baby inside you!

Oh honey, this is so NOT selfish. This is your day. You need to feel comfortable. The way I would handle this situation is to call your in-laws and politely ask them to stay in a hotel for this time. Tell them that you're expecting it to be hectic, and that you understand that they want to help. But that you just aren't ready for house guests- not even your own family. This way everyone wins; they can be there during the day and away at night. It's the best thing that I can think of to compromise.

what you might should do is call you MIL and talk to her yourself.  say, I think its great youve offered up your valuable time to help us immediately post birth.  and i would really like you guys and my family both to see him/her right after birth.  However, I believe that the first week or two is the most important for bonding between parent and child.  I would be extremely happy for you to come stay with us for a week after that time.  But, certainly if I find myself overwhelmed before then, I will call you.



actually, it sounds to me like your husband is nervous about being alone with the baby right away.  and that he wants to use his parents as a buffer until he gets used to the new "package" being around.  make no mistake, it is tough to start with, before they really start sleeping, and while you're getting used to having to get up with him/her several times a night.  let your husband know its okay and you'd like to spend this time as a family and you'll be there to help each other.

I think genetics play a huge role but you have to look further than just the parents. You need to look at the grandparents and extended family.



My husband is a huge guy but his dad is small and so is his mom. But his grandparents and ancestors were big people.



I am a big girl too (close to six feet) and with my huge husband I had a six lb daughter that is now the skinniest thing (although she is tall). The second baby is also just on the very average side. So only time will tell if they turn into incredible hulks like us.

Sorry to say....but just because the baby dropped, doesn't mean labor is imminent.  Sounds like you are having Braxton Hicks...which is good to get your body ready for labor, but doesn't actually start labor.  At 37 weeks you could have up to 5 weeks left (let's hope not!) and since you haven't told us of any other signs of early labor, I would just say relax, and let your baby set its own time table.

All my 3 babies were late.  All natural but 2 were induced.  However I have a couple of friends who have had premmies.  One had both her babies 4-6 weeks early due to cervical cancer problems and couldn't hold the baby any longer and one had her baby 4 weeks early due to other medical issues.  All babies are now 2-4 years old and doing fantastic.  Usually premmies take a couple of years to catch up with children their own age in milestone achievements but by 2, they may be a little shorter but otherwise, developmentally they are up there with their peers.  Just remember though, a lot of babies still have a good chance of survival even as early as 24 weeks gestation.  I wish you all the best of luck and hope these answers have put yours or someone else's mind at ease :-)

My first was 35 weeks and my 2nd was born at 32 weeks.  The 35 weeker spent no time in NICU and came home with me.  The 32 weeker spent 29 days in NICU but is doing very well.  He's behind in a few areas for his actual age but not for his gestational age.  He has a couple of digestive issues he still needs to outgrow but overall he's doing fantastic.  He only spent 4 1/2 months on the apnea monitor.

Why is my 11month old throwing angry strops!?



He is always a little stropy if i wont let him do something like climb the stairs and touching the oven. but the past couple of days he seems really angry. screaming at me and wavin his arms around. he refused to eat yesterday and kept spitting the food out into his hands and wacking the spoon as it nears his open mouth. he's walking now and im thinking it might be that he just wants to walk and not be sat down eating when he could be practising. help, am i doing something wrong or is he just a perfectionist?



P.S dont know if this has anything to do with it he is a boy.

Hi Emily,
No you're not a terrible Mum. As I am a fairly new Mum I am reading a few books to help me with all these problems.



I am reading a book at the moment called On Becoming Baby Wise (Five months to Fifteen Months) By Gary Ezzo and Robert Buckman. In the book they claim that children from about 8 months of age can understand communication but can't speak. So they recommend teaching your child to sign. It is only basic words like Please, Thank you, Food, Drink, More, Yes, No, etc. This gives them a way to communicate to you about what they want. When talking to other mothers they had heard this as well from other sources. It is believed that if children can express themselves and communicate what they want/need/feel at the time, then the temper tantrums decrease and maybe even cease. In the book they also discuss high chair manners and mealtime activities. Stick at sitting to eat because if he gets into the habit of walking and eating, then it will be harder to retrain him. You want him to sit to eat when you go out.



This book is written by Christian doctors, but it doesn't try and convert you. They just want parents to be able to enjoy parenthood and have well developed children.



Good luck with your precious little man. May he bring you joy in the future. Be strong!!!

No, it's not a boy thing. My daughter is 11 months old too and lets her attitude show when she wants to. Same thing with eating - pushes the spoon away and yells at me when i try and make her eat lol, I think giving them the spoon and letting them eat on their own might help (It's a bit messy but they are way happier) She is also just learning to walk, it's a huge milestone for them and gives them heaps of independace so they think they are high & mighty at this stage, it'll pass though :- )

this is because he can. ignore his tantrums hard though it may be he will soon learn that it is not the way to get what he wants. we find controlled crying works wonderfully with our two. 19 mths and 4 mths



ther are no hard and fast rules with kids whatever works is usually fine.



but don't let them get away with too much when they are young as you are just storing up trouble for later on



good luck and enjoy him while he is young remember YOU are in charge

Hiccups are really just your lungs forcing air out.
It's just trying to rebalance the oxygen VS carbon dioxide.

Nope... no truth. A hiccup is air trapped at the diaphragm. Yes their intestines are maturing and adjusting but with or without hiccups, that would happen.

Is it looked down upon to kiss a baby on the cheek?



I find myself always wanting to kiss babies on the cheek, or squeeze their cheeks.  I have a friend who recently gave birth to her son, and a  friend of theirs was holding the baby and kissed him on the cheek and my friend cursed her out for it.



I thought this was ridiculous, i dont have children but does it make moms uneasy when people (friends, aquaintences) kiss their babies on the cheek??

babies have a very low immune system compared to ours.....we carry many germs on our hands and lips so we want our babies to get the least amount of contact with germs, so yes it is wrong and very rude to be touching and kissing all over someone's baby.  You should wash your hands too before holding a friends baby and not come around if you or any member of your house hold is or has been recently sick.

I agree, it was rediculous for your friend to freak out. Maybe she's just a germ phobic though, which is very understandable. I'm ok if people kiss my daughter on the cheek as long as it's family or close friends. If a stranger kissed her that would be a different story. My mother in law even kisses her on the lips. Now that is kinda weird to me! My daughter is only four months old! But oh well, at least she's loved.

Wow. I think she may have gone overboard. Some mothers dont like anybody kissing their child for fear of germs. I was ok with friends and family kissing my baby on the cheek. I would be fine with acquaintances touching my babys cheek but not kissing her. How can you stay away from a babys cheek? Theyre so cute and chubby at that age! :)

Some people freak out because of germs.  But a kiss on the cheek is actually better than touching babies hands as adult hands are germier than adult mouths and babies get their hands in their mouths more often than their cheeks ;-)

When did you start to train your baby to take naps in his crib?



My baby is 10 weeks old, he sleeps in his crib in the night no problem. When i put him in the crib for his nap, he cries for few min. but ten falls asleep, but will wake up after about 30 min.



I pick him up and he will sleep in my arms for another hour. I want to train him to sleep in his crib for the whole nap time.  When can I start to do that(will involve crying) and how do I do it? Am I doing the wrong thing by picking him up now?

Your baby is 10 weeks its good for you both if you hold him now.  I would wait a lil longer before training him to spend the entire time in his crib.  We co-sleep with our daughter some of the night and put her in her crib for part of it.



Naps, we wait till shes almost asleep before we put her in the crib. She does not usually cry, but when she does we pick her up and try again.  Babies thier age just need to be comforted, it helps build trust and security for them.

I had massive problems with getting my 3 month old son to sleep.  He would just lie awake and cry for hours, then when he finally went to sleep he would wake every hour or two hours through the night and cry again!  Talk about pulling our hair out .... we were absolutely desperate for sleep!



It was a baby sleep audio program recommended by a friend that finally saved us. We followed the advice and began by creating a baby sleep routine which included bathtime, dimming of the lights, putting Paul into his crib, final nappy change and then lullabies. We also made recommended changes to his naps during the day and used some of the other recommended techniques. Within two weeks he was sleeping through the night most nights with just the odd night where he would just wake once!



Definitely start by creating a good baby sleep routine though and you could find that solves most of your baby sleep problems.



Good luck!

My daughter didnt poop for 4 days once and me and my fiance were losing our minds worrying! My mom suggested giving her Enfamil ProSobee formula. I was a little worried about that because she was on exclusively breastmilk but we tried it. We gave her one 4 oz bottle of that and within an hour she was giving us 4 days worth of poop. It was a little disgusting but you could tell she felt so much better. My fiance said, "I never thought Id be so happy to see a baby poop." :) I always kept a little can of that ProSobee around just in case.
Does your baby seem uncomfortable? Like he has a bellyache? They say babies should poop at least once a day but if he seems happy, then he probably just doesnt need to go yet. 12 hours isnt bad. If he goes over 24 hours, that may be cause for concern. If he goes over 2 days, you can try the ProSobee or call his ped.

Your babies bowel movements will change often. You will go through different periods of changes just know that this is common. At certain times in their development life cycles, their bowel movements start to change. Your baby may start to poop 2 - 4 times a day now or even once a day now. Don't be concerned unless baby has not pooped in more than 3 days. Its funny how us mommies worry so much about poop now. I know I did and am just starting to go with the "flow" and not worry too much.

"Some breastfed babies, after the first three to four weeks of life, may suddenly change their stool pattern from many each day, to one every three days or even less. Some babies have gone as long as 15 days or more without a bowel movement. As long as the baby is otherwise well, and the stool is the usual pasty or soft, yellow movement, this is not constipation and is of no concern. No treatment is necessary or desirable, because no treatment is necessary or desirable for something that is normal."

My daughter didn't poop for a few days so I got worried and called the doctor. This is what he told me...when they are around that age they start learning how to use that muscle that can let them go. When he feels the need to go he holds it shut. If he doesn't go in a week then you should be worried, but if it under a week it is okay. It might just be a lot of poop when it comes out. Haha.

My 2 month old isnt pooping good right now either. She can go like 24 hours with out it!  She was switched to soy and I think that may have something to do with it.  Our doctor suggested an ounce of pear juice a day.  That didnt help much, so I asked what else.  She said I can try using a thermometer once a day to help aid her.  I felt bad doing it at first but its helping alot!



When she does poop, its huge and hard and alot!  I feel terrible for her, but I think its the formula.  She would scream at night because she couldn't poop and it was backed up!!

You should watch for signs of hunger. Feeding On Demand is the key. Don't try and put your baby on an "every 2 hours" schedule. A baby knows when they need food, so don't deny it and don't force it... Here is a good link for you. It has good info on hunger cues for breastfeeding mommas and babies :)



http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/basics/...



"Common infant hunger cues include:



Early



* Smacking or licking lips



* Opening and closing mouth



* Sucking on lips, tongue, hands, fingers, toes, toys, or clothing



Active



* Rooting around on the chest of whoever is carrying him



* Trying to position for nursing, either by lying back or pulling on your clothes



* Fidgeting or squirming around a lot



* Hitting you on the arm or chest repeatedly



* Fussing or breathing fast



Late



* Moving head frantically from side to side



* Crying"

I went to my pediatrician with this question when my son was 3 months old. She told me plain and simple: some babies needs more food more often.  In fact, her daughter nursed every 1 1/2 hours for months.  She fought it at first, but says it just succeeded in making them both cry needlessly. :)  Also, just about everything I've read says you can't over-feed a breastfed baby.  If you think she's giving you hungry cues, I'd say feed her.

Breastfeed her whenever she gives you the cue that she's hungry.  Don't worry about schedules or how often.  A baby goes through growth spurts all the time and sometimes you have to breastfeed every 45 minutes for a 24 hour period cause they are growing and need all the nutrients they can get.
There is no way of telling how many hours she'll go.  Just feed her when she shows the signs and you both will be happy.  Your supply will go up and she'll be a contented little nurser.
Congrats on making it this far.

Yes, many do. You should still be feeding whenever he/she is hungry (on demand) Breastmilk is digested alot faster than formula so every 2 hours is normal. Your baby should be nursing at least 6 times a day. If you are concerned in any way, contact your family doctor.

I always fed my babies when they got hungry. Because there is no sense to make sure they eat every two hours. Like if a baby is asleep and it is time for them to eat, don't wake them up. When they get hungry they will wake up and let you know. If you think she is hungry feed her.

Don't put your baby on a schedule you have to breastfeed on demand.  I breastfed both my daughters and in the beginning I fed them on demand.  Signs are crying, putting hands to her mouth, trying to get into the nursing position.  You will get to know the signs.

Can weaning from the bottle cold-turkey scar my child?



My son is 13 months and loves his bottle dearly.  Well I took him off and he is completely on sippy cups.  Well, when it was time for morning bottle, and he got morning sippy cup he was not happy.  The women taking care of him said it would confusing him to give him a bottle in the mornings.  Do you think I'm scaring him for life or should I give him the morning bottle?  Thanks.

There are often daycare assistance programs that can subsidize daycare while you work.  Also, look into what other public assistance programs you might be eligible for.  For instance, WIC, Section 8 housing vouchers, or food stamps.  It's not wrong to ask for help if you really need it and know it's temporary until you get on your feet.



Most work at home things are a scam.  However, I know that a couple of tele sales companies, like West, hire people to answer phones at home.  You have to have a dedicated land line for it, and they only pay pennies on the minute, but if you have a knack for talking to people, you can earn money keeping people on the phone and making commissions on what you sell.

You could try looking for a job at a fitness centre daycare, they usually allow you to bring your own kids with you.  You could also try running a home daycare or babysitting.  Other than that there probably aren't a lot of jobs you will be able to do from home with the baby at home, most work at home jobs require you to have a quiet space to work in.  Watch out for scams, any work at home job that requires you to pay for anything up front or promises that you'll make thousands of dollars a month isn't legit.

8 Month old still up every 3 hours...sometimes less.?



My 8 month old (actually he is closer to 9 months) is still not sleeping thru the night. He is up every three hours, almost to the minute. That is on a "good night" - sometimes he is up more often then that.



Most nights I nurse his back to sleep as it is easiest and I want to go back to sleep too.



I cannot and will not do the CIO method....but I need to do something soon. He is over 20 lbs so I know he doesnt need to be eating thru the night. He eats about 4 jars of food a day plus finger foods. He has 2 naps a day usually lasting an hour to an hour and a half.



Any advice?



Thanks..

Maybe he needs a pacifier?



If you dont already have a good bedtime routine, it could help him wind down and realize he needs to actually sleep.  We give our daughter a bedtime bath, put her in her jammies, wrap her up all snugg and read to her (shes only 13 weeks but eh..it works) she sucks on her pacifier or drinks a bottle and usually falls asleep around 6:30. She will sleep till 12 or 1 in her crib. Then she gets another bottle and we sleep with her in our bed or on the couch bed till she gets up at 5am

I would say try to  keep him in his crib.  I know it's easiest to feed him then put him back to sleep but that's not going to fix your problem.  Keep him in his crib and rub his back or belly (like pp said).  If I gently shook my baby in her crib by putting my hand on her belly she would fall back to sleep.  I was trying to mimic the feeling of a car ride.  Maybe play some music from him or give him a toy and see if he plays then falls back to sleep on his own.  Maybe give him a bottle of water.

My baby is 10 months old and was waking frequently too.  He is also breastfed and I was feeding him to sleep every time he wakes.  This was causing him to wake MORE though because he was gulping a lot of milk quickly, causing him gas.  It was a vicious cycle for mommy!  LOL!  I actually think that he actually NEEDS the nourishment of eating in the middle of the night because even though he eats all day long, he is an active little boy and he wakes because he is hungry.  They are growing SOOOO much and so quickly this first year and that takes a lot of calories!



We are working on it, but this has helped---we started giving him plain, toasted, multigrain waffles and a cup of formula mixed with liquid baby yogurt before bed.  That evening meal helps him go 4 or 5 hours before waking up!  YAY!

Well my advice is that it is completely normal for a 9 month old to be up that often at night, and that you should only attempt to change it if you resent the behaviour or it is effecting your ability to function.



Weight has nothing to do with sleep maturity and the ability to self-soothe.  How much they eat during the day has little to do with sleeping at night, in fact your baby may be waking to nurse more at night because he is eating too many solids during the day and has to get all his breastmilk at night -which is what he really needs to survive.



http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...
The expected pattern is for mother and child to sleep together, and for child to be able to nurse whenever they want during the night. Normal, healthy, breastfed and co-sleeping children do not sleep "through the night" (say 7-9 hours at a stretch) until they are 3-4 years old, and no longer need night nursing. I repeat -- this is NORMAL and HEALTHY. Dr. James McKenna's research on co-sleeping clearly shows the dangers of solitary sleeping in young infants, who slip into abnormal patterns of very deep sleep from which it is very difficult for them to rouse themselves when they experience an episode of apnea (stop breathing).



http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp
Nightwaking has developmental benefits. Sleep researchers believe that babies sleep "smarter" than adults do. They theorize that light sleep helps the brain develop because the brain doesn't rest during REM sleep. In fact, blood flow to the brain nearly doubles during REM sleep. (This increased blood flow is particularly evident in the area of the brain that automatically controls breathing.) During REM sleep the body increases its manufacture of certain nerve proteins, the building blocks of the brain. Learning is also thought to occur during the active stage of sleep. The brain may use this time to process information acquired while awake, storing what is beneficial to the individual and discarding what is not. Some sleep researchers believe that REM sleeps acts to auto-stimulate the developing brain, providing beneficial imagery that promotes mental development. During the light sleep stage, the higher centers of the brain keep operating, yet during deep sleep these higher brain centers shut off and the baby functions on her lower brain centers. It is possible that during this stage of rapid brain growth (babies' brains grow to nearly seventy percent of adult volume during the first two years) the brain needs to continue functioning during sleep in order to develop. It is interesting to note that premature babies spend even more of their sleep time (approximately 90 percent) in REM sleep, perhaps to accelerate their brain growth. As you can see, the period of life when humans sleep the most and the brain is developing the most rapidly is also the time when they have the most active sleep. One day as I was explaining the theory that light sleep helps babies' brains develop, a tired mother of a wakeful infant chuckled and said, "If that's true, my baby's going to be very smart."



7. As they grow, babies achieve sleep maturity. "Okay," you say, "I understand this developmental design, but when will my baby sleep through the night?" The age at which babies settle – meaning they go to sleep easily and stay asleep varies widely among babies. Some babies go to sleep easily, but don't stay asleep. Others go to sleep with difficulty but will stay asleep. Other exhausting babies neither want to go to sleep nor stay asleep.



[...]



An important fact for you to remember is that your baby's sleep habits are more a reflection of your baby's temperament rather than your style of nighttime parenting. And keep in mind that other parents usually exaggerate how long their baby sleeps, as if this were a badge of good parenting, which it isn't. It's not your fault baby wakes up.



8. Babies still wake up. When babies mature into these adult-like sleep patterns varies among babies. Yet, even though babies achieve this sleep maturity some time during the last half of the first year, many still wake up. The reason? Painful stimuli, such as colds and teething pain, become more frequent. Major developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking, drive babies to "practice" their new developmental skills in their sleep. Then between one and two years of age, when baby begins to sleep through the above-mentioned wake-up stimuli, other causes of nightwaking occur, such as separation anxiety and nightmares.



Even though you understand why babies are prone to nightwaking, you realize it's still important for parents and babies to get a restful night's sleep, otherwise, baby, the parents, and their relationship won't thrive.

my son is the same way. he is 7 months and usually he only sleeps about 3 hours after i first put him down and then he wakes every 1-2 hours after that. and he also takes a bottle every time to get back to sleep. ive tried to sooth him other ways but nothing works and sometimes he'll get so upset that he ends up wide awake and mad and it takes even longer to get back to sleep. he did have an ear infection about a month or so ago and after he started the meds to clear that up he started sleeping better but it only lasted a few nights. he has been teething since 3 months also and finally just cut his first tooth over the weekend and i have noticed he's been sleeping better since, maybe since he's not in so much pain anymore. actually last night he only woke up once and i was so happy! we'll see if it continues though.

I'm confused why you say a mixture of formula and milk?  You're not mixing your formula with cow's milk, are you?



The can of formula should tell you, but it is probably good for about 2 hours unrefrigerated once it's mixed.  If you put it in the fridge, it's good for 24 hours.

I think they think that they will live happily ever after with no effort on anyones part to keep the relationship together.  Reality comes into play and differences come up and they file for divorce.  Most of these people never should have gotten married in the first place.  It's great to get married because you love the person, but when you don't think about the practicalities as well you are just asking for trouble.

I think a lot of people do, but I also think a big part of the problem is people jump into marriage too quickly. Marriage is a phenominal thing and it's a not something to be taken lightly, I think too many people think if this marriage doesn't work out then there will always be a next one. Divorce is the easy way out. My husband and I decided no matter what trials come our way the D word will never come up in our marriage because divorce is not the answer. Divorce is the easy way out and every broken marriage can be fixed. Sure marriage isn't exactly what I thought it would be, but you know what? It's actually better. I love having my best friend with me all the time. It's like a slumber party every night!

I agree with you. I have been with my husband for 7 years this January. married for 2 1/2 of those years. at first yes it was Physical attraction and I loved him. we did argue tho lol. and now, we argue less our physical attraction is about the same if not stronger but like you said, we work more together, to help the relationship. I don't know if people just want to "play house" and think its all fun all the time. but its not. people do fight, people do argue but there are all the good things too. from my experiences with my husband, its best to talk/argue about things its better then never getting your problems out there to be fixed. Communication is key. a lot of people I went to school with and grew up with have been married and divorced. my best friend. she told me it just wasn't "fun" anymore and she wasn't ready to be tied down anymore... and I don't see my marriage as being tied down or trapped. you have to be ready. you have to be in love. and you have to be ready to work things out because nothing is "perfect" and "fun" forever. but you are in love forever if its right for you.

I think one of the main problems is marriage no longer has any requirements... you don't have to take marriage prep classes, you don't have to have STD testing done... you can marry someone with 2 hours notice and then act surprised when you find out your new spouse has herpes and has no desire for children...



If couples spent more time together before marriage and let the magic cool down I think marriages would last longer. I totally support couples living together (and yes, having sex) for a couple YEARS before getting married. It is a lot easier to have secret lives and secret dreams if you go home to your own place at night and spend time apart.

Yes, I think people do have unrealistic expectations.  That's why I refuse to get married until I'm 30.



I think it's wrong for people just to get married because they have a child.  You need to be togheter and friends for quite sometime before you can truly make an informed decision on whether or not that person is right for you.

I feel that with today's society everything is up in the air. I am a very traditional person and I feel that once you get married, its for good. I think that people need to realize what it is they want out of their lives and try to find a person who can support them and love them for who they are. Most people are into physical attraction and money. Thats not what you should look for in a person.



Celebrities and the media contribute to the way society looks at marriage - and most to people its not a once in a lifetime commitment.
Marriage is hard and I dont think many people realize that 2 people have to work together under many conditions. Thick & Thin.



People need to decide on their beliefs, finances, family, education and emotions before they put time into a "fairytale" wedding. You need to think about the negatives and decide if you are ready to committ your life to another person.



Congrats to you on a great marriage and still going strong!

Well, in a way people are different than they used to be so I don't think it's just their expectations of what marriage is. Two reasons I feel that divorce rate is so high is because 1) women have more options these days - they aren't necessarily bound to an unhappy marriage for financial or societal reasons 2) these days more people have an ego-centric approach, where they are seeking to fulfill the needs of the individual, not the marriage. (I think this is what you are leaning toward). In that way, people do become disillusioned easily once the honeymoon wears off because they are expecting the high to last and when it doesn't it's a big let-down.

I think it has more to do with people not marrying the right people rather than having an unrealistic view.  Their view may be ok, but the person they're with isn't -- or isn't right for that ideal.



I've been married over 11 years, and yeah, we're the only ones "still standing" among all our friends who were also married.  But for each marriage that fell apart, I could have told you ahead of time they weren't going to make it.  He was too selfish, she wasn't sure what she wanted and got married out of boredom, they didn't really look at their finances before having kids and now are fighting all the time over the bills, and so on.



It's a matter of being honest about who you are, who your partner is, what you both want, and a commitment from each other to roll with the punches and grow with each other.

I think I just got really lucky. We've been married 2 1/2 years. It was a whirlwind thing. We got together in Dec moved in together in March and got married in July. Ever since we've been together we've never had an argument or fight...not because we avoid it, just because we get along really well. If one of us doesn't like something we ask the other not to do/say it again and everything is understood. I think it really is kind of like a fairy tale. It's like watching one of those sappy music videos where the couple is all lovey dovey and always holding and kissing on each other. lol. I love it. He still opens my car door for me, holds my hand everywhere we go, and spends all of his time with me. We do everything together. Our first baby will be here next wed. via cesarean and we're both really excited. I know things will change after that, but I can only see them getting better. anyway, sorry to sound like a sap. lol. I'm just like my man.

Normal Napping Patterns for a 4 Month Old?



My "almost 4 month old" sleeps about 10 hours through the night.  But, during the day he takes about three or four 30-45 minute naps.  I've done everything I can to get him to nap longer, but he has his own schedule.  I just worry that he is not getting enough sleep, but he isn't cranky when he wakes up.  I always catch his fussy cues and let him nap when he needs to, but the naps aren't very long.  Anyone else have a baby who naps like this?

my daughter is also 4 months old, and has similar sleeping patterns. She sleeps for 10 hours during the night with only waking up once to eat a little. During the day it seems like a lot of cat naps. with her not sleeping more that 30 mins here and there. I would say because of the night time 10 hours, he is sleeping normal for his age.

My daughter just turned 16 months old, and I still breastfeed her, usually just in the evening before bed, sometimes in the morning too. I had planned on weaning her at 12 months, but she didn't want to stop, and I felt bad trying to force her to stop, so we cut back gradually, now down to the one feeding most days. We'll stop when we're ready. Plus, a few weeks ago, she got a stomach bug, and wouldn't eat or drink anything, but she would nurse. I was very glad at that time to be still breadtfeeding, because I knew she was at least getting something.

I breastfed my first for 18 months and my second for 22 months. That was our special time, like you said - before bed and naptimes. You are still doing him good with having the nutrients, etc. from your milk, and if it's giving him comfort, then that's great. Over time you'll develop a new, special routine to replace breastfeeding once you've weaned him.



I can remember thinking at one point that maybe I should stop, and then was like, "WHy? It's not bothering me, and the kids still want to, so why stop?" I think sometimes people still have these outdated and antiquated notions about nursing and it's amazing how the negative views still pervade our culture. I'm so sick of the sexualization of breasts and how people can't get over their REAL, primary function - not to be toys to men, but, should you have a child and choose to nurse, a source of nourishment first and foremost! Get over it!



There's a big difference between nursing 14 months and until 5 years. No one ever said you were doing that. Good for you!

I'm neither proud nor ashamed that I am nursing a 2.5 year old and an 11 month old.  I merely know that humans are designed to consume breastmilk for 2-5 years

Nutrition for Nursing Toddlers
http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/tod...



Many nursing moms are told that they must introduce cow's milk at a year. Your nursing toddler is already getting the best milk he can get - mother's milk! Breastmilk has a higher fat content than whole cow's milk (needed for baby's brain growth), and all the nutrients of human milk are significantly more bioavailable than those of cow's milk because it is species specific (not to mention all the components of mother's milk that are not present in cow's milk).



There is no need for additional milk or (or the equivalent nutrients from other foods) as long as your baby is nursing 3-4 times per day. Cow's milk is really just a convenient source of calcium, protein, fats, vitamin D, etc. - it's not required. There are many people in many parts of the world who do not drink milk and still manage to get all the calcium, protein, fats, vitamin D, etc. that they need.

How is Breastfeeding Related to Cancer



http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/defaul... longer the women had breastfed during their lifetime, the less likely they were to get breast cancer. According to the researchers, this was a very striking finding. They made sure that the women’s age; menopausal status, ethnic origin, number of births and their age at the birth of their first child were all taken into account. Breastfeeding still lowered breast cancer risk by 4.3% for every year of feeding. There is also a 7% reduction in risk of breast cancer for each child born.



A 4% lowering of risk doesn’t sound much. But, as breast cancer is quite a common disease in developed countries, breast feeding every child for an extra 6 months would mean about 1,000 fewer cases of breast cancer in Britain each year.



You will have less chance of Breast Cancer and other Cancers

New Baby advice?  Schedule and poop!?



Does anyone have some good advice on how I can start getting my 2 week old on a schedule?  I have to go back to work soon, and need him to sleep at night, not all day.  He wakes us up right on time, every 2 hours at night to eat, and every 4 during the day.  How can I get him to switch? Please don't respond if you're going to tell me to just deal with it, I need a solution and know it can be done, somehow, but I need to find out how.



Also, does anyone know how to get poop out of clothes, changing table covers etc?  He's still pooping the yellow stuff, and ALL just isn't getting it out, I tried Shout too, and it didn't help.  Any secret tricks?



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks for the help so far, I'm not expecting him to sleep all night, and I just want him to get used to eating and waking more during the day.  He's made his own schedule with the eating every 2 or 4 hours, if I wake him up every 3 like the Dr. said, he just plays with the bottle and barely gets an ounce down in an hour, where if I let him do it his way he eats 2+ in about 20 minutes.  I'm just hoping if I start early, it will be easier to transition him to all night sleeping later on.  But I'm fully prepared to do the up every few hours thing until he needs less.



Plus, it's really hard to wake him up sometimes, he could sleep through a freight train, literally, but will wake up at the sound of the faucet at night.

2 weeks is still early for a baby to have a schedule but the best way to start is every night at the same time give a bath and get baby ready for bed. Then give a bottle and try to put baby down. Close door and walk away, let cry for 5 min. Then get baby up...but do this at the same time every night

This doesn't make a "schedule" but will help your baby understand day & night and in turn eat more before bed and sleep longer.



they can't digest the cereal so please don't do that!!
Do NOT try to wake him up or try to keep him up so he sleeps at night....recent studies show this actually makes it harder for them to sleep at night and can cause problem with develpment.

It's hard for them to understand a schedule at that age, but the main thing you have to be is consistant. Do the same thing everyday, they will eventually learn the routine but don't expect it to be perfect. Especially when they start teething.

you really cant get a newborn on a schedule.  they know what they need when they  need it.  dont worry- you will *totally* adjust to his schedule :)  your body is amazingly adaptable.  His sleep paterns will favor night and day somewhere around 2-3 months.
as for the poop, add 1/2 cup vinegar or hydrogen peroxide to your wash.

well what i did was start limiting his naps during the day to 2 hrs and keeping him up in the evening. it was hard. when he would start falling asleep i would take his socks off anf then part of his onsies or go change him and shake his rattle. i even tickled his belly bc he would startle and not b all the away asleep. i then up his oz at night so he is fulkl and will sleep more hrs. i also have him on a routine. he gets changed into night clothes or a bath around the same time everynight and dim the lights. i didnt start his schedule until he was 4weeks bc i had 2 weeks to get him on it.also make sure where he naps is kinda bright during the day and if possible dnt turn on the lights at night when u feed him or change him. i alos have him in daycare and they keep him up.

Well he's only 2wks, I think you are asking a lot..with that said...we kept our son in his pack n play during the day in the living room where it was nice and bright...then at night, we would play with him during the evening hours (he would stay awake from about 6 until about 9 or 930  we would bring him in his room with just a nightlight on and put on some soft music, give him his last bottle and put him to bed in his crib...this didn't really start to work until 4-6 weeks..at 6wks he was sleeping 6hrs a night...you really can't ask for more!!!! they need to eat.
Get him used to light and dark...and have a routine before bed..some people swear by a bath..but at that age they don't need it it dries out their skin...well in some babies...we bathed our son about once or twice a week at that age...
good luck

Wake baby more often during the day.  4 hours is far too long for a newborn to go without eating.  If he gets enough to eat during the day (and your milk supply becomes better established) he should be able to go longer at night.



So wake him to nurse every 2 hours during the day/evening, and then let him sleep as long as he will at night.

It's very hard to get a newborn on a schedule.  They need to eat often & have their diaper changed often.  Most babies do not sleep through the night until they are at least 3 months old.  This chaotic schedule is just something that they will slowly grow out of, not much you can do to control it.



For the poop, I would spray Shout on it right away, let it soak a few mins, than throw it in the washer.



Just for comparison, my first baby didn't sleep through the night until he was probably around 7 mos old, & he ate every two hours for a couple of months.  My second baby slept through the night at 3 mos & ate every 3 hrs for probably 4 months.  When your baby sleeps longer at night, just make sure he has a full belly & a dry diaper right before bed.

I wish I had a trick to the yellow poop stains! I am nursing and my son is almost 4 months... the poop is just now changing but we sure did go through some clothes! I actually changed diaper brands from Pampers to huggies and that seemed to help with the explosions! Since then I really haven't ruined any clothes!



Now for the schedule... Hard when they are only 2 weeks old. BUT, if you can try to keep him up when he really wants to sleep. My son never woke up in the night so I don't know how to help you with that, but during the day might be easier for you to help him stay up. But 2 weeks just doesn't seem to easy to get on a schedule.

You do not need to wake her unless she is not gaining weight properly. You will find this out at your next appointment (but don't be alarmed if she has lost a few ounces since birth, this is normal). Does she seem content? Does she have 4-5 wet diapers a day? These are the things to be concerned with, not the number of feeds books and people put in your head.

A lot of people might disagree with me but I, personally, would wake her.  She's a newborn and needs all those nutrients.  If she's not getting enough of them, she will start losing weight.  Then more than likely, the doctor will blame your breastmilk by saying it isn't good enough and they will encourage you to supplement, which isn't good if you want to breastfeed.  If you have a scale and can keep track of her weight then it might be ok.  If you don't establish a consistent nursing bond with her now, your milk will end up drying up.  That is one of the reasons they say to nurse every 2-3 hours.  If she sleeps 4 hours at night, then I would let her sleep but during the day, I would nurse every 2-3 hours.  You need this to establish your milk supply or it will dwindle.

My son was in a carseat the same day that he was circumsized, which was the day he left the hospital.  Of course it's going to be tender but you have to do what you have to do.



If they don't need to take him anywhere, then they might as well not.  But if eh does need to go somewhere (dr.) then it's not a biggie.



The diaper provides a decent amount of padding and he'll probably just be pissed about being in a carseat.

No! I had my baby circumcised and put him in a carseat just fine. After the circumcision, you put a pile of Vaseline on a piece pf gauze (or you should be doing something to that matter) plus they have a diaper on. I just might not have him sit in a carseat for a long period of time.

No it's not! If that was the case newborns who are circumcised the day they are born would stay at the hospital for a week.  I would think that would be the main thing a doctor would tell you.  My son was circumcised the day after he was born and was just fine in the car. I would think the diaper and bandage are sufficient enough for padding.

That's horrible, poor baby. It's so sad people are still forcing circumcisions on their baby :-(
I've never heard that about a car seat before, but obviously he would be in a lot of pain. Is the theory that the car seat has a strap in that area or something? I don't think there would be a car seat with extra pressure on that area. It's probably ok to put him in one.

I would definitely talk with your pediatrician about this, and maybe find a new doctor b/c that really isn't cool.  I think that if it were going to seriously harm him, he would have an immediate reaction.  The last one was nearly a year apart from the others, so at least it wasn't in close conjunction.

GO AHEAD BY ALL MEANS...........HAVE ANOTHER.
Im going to have another and all my girlfriends are offering to throw it so I don't believe they will be offended.  I have answered this question before on this site.  You will not believe all the negative response you will get.  Don't listen, they will even call you greedy.
But hey this is a new beautiful life you are celebrating.  I would definately attend someones 2nd baby shower.  Every baby deserves one, not just the first.

Well I guess it would depend on the situation I have a 3 year old girl and I has a baby shower with her I am now 30 weeks pregnant with another baby girl and I am having another baby shower but that is because my husband went into the air force and we are from MI and now are living in AZ I got pregnant after we moved and we didnt bring anything from when my three year old was a baby so we have absolutely nothing.  One of my really good friends in AZ decided to throw me a baby shower, so in this case I dont think that it is rude.  If you have everything that you need or whatever then why not just have a diaper party or something instead?

i think its fine to have a shower for each child. its not about getting gifts, its about celebrating for the new baby that will soon be entering your lives and if one baby deserves one, so do the others. i had a shower for my first and again with my second and plenty of people came. ive also been to several other showers where the mom had already had a previous child and i didnt think anything of it. if you have some of the bigger items like the crib, bassinet, swing, etc. left over from your first then thats great but there are still plenty of other things the new baby will need. if someone doesnt want to go, they dont have to. its that simple. you shouldnt feel bad about it. im sure you'll have food and games and stuff like that so people can enjoy themselves. im sure you arent just going to be sitting there collecting gifts the whole time.

My baby's hands are always moving, as if he's strumming a guitar. Is this normal?



My son is 7 months old and is constantly moving his hands in a guitar-strumming motion. He repeatedly does this, but has actually calmed down a little since he was born. Now that he's able to grab things, I'm assuming it distracts him for a short period of time. He moves his hands a lot more when he gets excited, almost uncontrollably. Are these movements normal, or should I be concerned?

is he able to go to sleep on his own? or is he feed until asleep? my five month old still wakes alot in the night and i have tried all the methods, crying it out etc. he can cry for 2-3 hours and then i end up giving in and he is super hungry. just go with it i say it wont last forever. one thing though is that if he doesnt already he needs to learn to go to sleep on his own, so once he is feed and happy put him to bed awake, he may cry first few nights but will get the hang if it and also do the same in the day put to bed awake. good luck

Inside of giving a milk bottle when he wakes just comfort him. If possible try to not even pick him up, just rock his cot or pat his bum. Also make sure he is not sleeping too much of a day. A good bedtime routine helps as in bath bottle bed & at the same time every night. Having the day routine helps with them sleep through as well.

I have 3 girls and 1 boy and my son was a nightmare baby compared to my girls he would wake every couple of hours until he was 2 years and 3 months and that's when he started sleeping through the night. I have brilliant night time routine with bath; massage; dress play feed adn swaddle then bed but it never worked for my son; most people will give me thumbs down but I had to get up in the morning for my other children; so I would basically prop his bottle up with a blanket instead of me sitting there feeding him a bottle 4 times a night; he knew which way the bottle was and he would go back to sleep like this; by 6 months he could hold the bottle and I would have bottle of cold milk in his crib ready to give him when he woke. ( By the time he woke for the bottle it was at room temp). It saved my sanity because nothing worked with him.

There is this stuff called Johnson bed time bath. Bath your baby in it (or any other product that contains lavender)as it helps them fall asleep. Give him a bottle after, burp and then put him straight down to sleep. do this as a routine every night and your son will get use to it.Hope this helps.

Wrap him up really tightly and leave a dim light on (he may be scared of the dark).  he could also be missing his mum, what you could do is take your top off at the end of the day and put it over a pillow, then let him fall asleep on the pillow and put the whole thing in his crib, it might help him to sleep better . .

My son woke every two hours until he was about 5 months old. The only thing that changed it for us was a book called Save our Sleep! It was fantastic, I got him into a routine where we had to teach him how to re-settle himself after his 40 min sleep cycle, it took about 4 days but worked wonders.  he has slept 12 hours every night since! Good luck.

Well the baby does move down leaving quiet some space on the midriff
It happens after the ninth month starts , so its very normal.
The baby moves down to the opening to get there head fixed .

Not necessarily...but if your baby does not come down it can not come out! It can happen anytime before you have the baby though! Im due next week and I can feel my daughters head, because she is lower now and my belly has dropped!

she sounds fine, they cant really control their eye muscles at such a young age so they can look "wonky eyed" - my son sure did! You are doing the right thing by getting her checked out though as it will put your mind at rest or if there is something wrong (which it doesnt sound like there is) they will catch it and treat it really early.



They also cant focus on things that are a distance away do she will only see you clearly if you are close up.



Three smiles a day at 13 weeks is amaxing! my son didnt smile at all until 16 weeks, and then I think it was wind!!

Your baby is smiling and she has met that milestone regardless how  often a day she does it. Some children smile more than other just like some children will talk more than other children. Your baby is fine.

How do I change what my 1 yr old eats?



My son is a preemie so he's technically 10 months old. We've already went to his 1 yr check up, the doc gave the go ahead to start cow's milk. My son still takes pretty much strictly formula. I've given him 2nd foods here and there and bites of what I have to eat sometimes but he shudders and gags sometimes as if he doesn't like it. I don't know how to transition him from formula to regular food and cows milk!

Did you buy the pictures they took at the hospital when your baby was born?



I didn't but only because honestly I didn't think she did a very good job, she only did face really close up shots of Colten, I took a million of him when he was in the hospital and I think mine are way better. She did send me a link online to were I can go see the ones she took or buy them anytime I want.



I'm just curious. Thanks.

I'd definitely get the kissing one, cause it's too cute.



I did buy some pics of one pose they took in the hospital. It's of my daughter laying on her stomach with her head facing the camera, wide eyed, looking very alert. It's a black and white photo, she's in nothing but her diaper and there is a blanket across the diaper, so it looks like she's naked! The photographer had everything black and white except the blanket, it's pink. It's really cool. I love black and white photos and this one has a hint of pink.



I wasn't going to buy any photos, since we took really good ones, but I love pictures and I HAD to have this one! :)

I felt that they were over priced and not very well done as well.  I took a ton of pictures my self.  However the ones that were taken were done professionally and I did not feel that I wanted to give up buying them.  Mostly because your child will never look the same again.  I decided to only purchase one 3x5 of each child for my wall.  They are pictures that I never take down or replace.  I got them more for the memory but I did not feel they were good enough to spend a ton of money on.

I did, they were way too overpriced, the nurse did an awful job, (she took his picture when he was UPSET) then I didn't even get to pick which one I wanted, they just sent them in the mail. But my fiance insisted on getting them... I guess it will be cute 10 years from now, but I truly hate the picture, and it got replaced on the wall by professional pictures we had taken later... I guess eventually I will be glad we did them.

I didn't.  I find that those first pics of babies don't look very cute.  The babies themselves are, dont get me wrong!  But it's like they take them right off the bat when they are wringkled and the babies look like little red monkeys.  I know I will get thumbs down for this one.  But to be honest, I think the pictures me and my family took in the beginning did my baby a lot more justice than the baby convict photos the hospital took.

Yes, I did for my first baby. It was a bad picture and it made her look even chubbier than she already was. (9lb 9oz) I am a photoholic though and I thought it was special because it was her first real picture.



For my youngest, I didn't have to buy the picture. She was born 11 weeks early, so they took a Polaroid to give to me since I was unable to see her.

I never bought my photos from the hospital, some of them were pretty cute but I have a digital camera and took extra cute ones that were more special because I took them myself in any position or clothing of the baby that I chose and was able to take my time with it.
I think if u have a digi ca that u can take the same type photos of your baby, besides the pics ion the hospitals that they take are not worth spending all of that money. JC penny portrait studio is cheaper. I go to the website which is really nice. It's http://www.shutterfly.com/.
It is completely free to use. U keep all of your pics from your digi cam in a photo album on there that is safe to use and password protected..U can take those pics and free of charge add borders,pictures,words,holidays themes etc to them which turns out very cute. There are so many fun things that u can do with your own pics on that website. then if u feel like u want to buy then they have deals where u get the first 20 prints free (with decorations of your choice) and there packages are well priced.



Your babys pics came out cute and he is adorable..If u feel like u want to buy them let no one stop u from doing what u want but I am pretty sure u can take the same pics at home, maybe even better and using the link I gave u, your pictures will come out beautiful...I have ordered pics from there and they arrives glossy and looked exactly like professional ones, everyone asked where I got them done =o)

No, I had them taken and they sent copies to my house and told me I had to pay for them - I was quite annoyed because I was completely disorientated when they 'got me' lol and apparently I signed something I don't know... but anyway I got out of paying for them and sent the photos back as they were dreadful! Out of all the pictures taken by me, my birthing partner and my family, the professional ones were by far the worst, and they were SO expensive! It'd have been nice to have some as a momentum but it didn't matter too much, I ended up getting a couple of nice professional shots of him done at 6 months and will probably do so again aged 1.



**EDIT**
Everyone who didn't buy them gets a thumbs down?!
Was this a trick question... or is there a seriously pissed off unsuccessful newborn baby photographer lurking around here and it's payback time?
LOL, how strange!
Or are we terrible mothers for not getting those pictures? Yeah that'll be it!

I used to wake up at 4.30 on the dot every day, this was NOT the time i went into labour, i started labour at 7.30 and finished at 20.59 no where near the time i woke up in the night, HOWEVER, it was the time my daughter woke up for the first month of her life. My mum said that i was waking up because my daughter was waking up inside me as at this point in pregnancy your child will have a regular sleeping and waking pattern, and this was her right until she was a month old from pre birth.

Question about my breasts (breastfeeding)?



My daughter will be 3 weeks tomorrow, and I am breastfeeding her. I've noticed over the last couple days that my left breast doesn't seem to be filling up as much as it normally does. My right one is still normal, but I can feel the difference when I touch my left one. So my questions are:
a) What could be the problem?, and
b) How do I fix the situation?



Thanks so much!!

Can i still introduce finger food if my 6 month old refuses pureed food?



i am having the toughest time with my 6 month old as she doesn't want any pureed food (homemade).  however, she tries to grab food from my hands when i am eating.  for e.g. she refused pureed banana but doesn't mind nibbling the whole banana when i eat it (though she makes faces at the taste).  same with apple, she refuses the puree so i tried cuting a slice of apple and she tried holding it and nibbling on it (again, she makes faces at the taste but at least she is trying).  i also tried giving her whole carrot which she loves.



but i am really scared that she might bite of a chunk and chock on it as she has not had much practise eating the pureed foods.  the only pureed food she has accepted is carrots (finely pureed, she chokes if a slightly lumpy piece goes in her mouth) and rice cereal.



what finger foods can i give her as i feel really bad refusing her food when she makes a grab for my food but she totally refuses pureed food.  as soon as she sees the spoon, she turns her head to the point where i can't even give her rice cereal or pureed carrots which she loves.



oh, she doesn't have any teeth!!

I suffered from baby acne when i was a baby. My mother used to wash my face with cotton wool and unfortunately you just have to wait untill it goes away on its own whch was about a month I think. On the positive side when a baby has acne is usually means that they will have good skin as a teenager/adult. I for one have never suffered from pimples since and have really good skin. Hope this helps

there really isnt much you can do, but it DOES go away on its own. my daughter developed it at around 2-3 weeks old and had it till about 3 months. her face was really red and she has red and white spots on her forehead, cheeks, chin and nose. i just used warm water when washing her, and it eventually went away.

Is this safe? When ask what she was doing the tech said he looked 1 year old so she gave him the shots. Do I possably have a case against the tech?

No. We didn't want it made public that we had a baby... you never know with people these days. Birth announcements were sent to people we knew and were in contact with, but no one else has to know our family business.

Breastfeeding question...I really need the some advice.?



Ok, I have a friend that had a baby 1 month ago, she stopped breastfeeding after a week..if that, anyway, she said it just wouldn't work and that she was hurting and made to much milk, she also was pumping every hour, she said her baby didn't know how to latch on because she was so small..born at 37 1/2 weeks..6 1/2 lbs. Anyway, I am due in a week or so and all she does is tell me how i won't be able to breast feed, how not to feed the baby every hour because I will get to much breast milk and leak it everywhere..blah blah blah.



Ok, now please correct me if I'm wrong on this stuff...



1) breastfeeding is hard in the beginning and its going to hurt for a few weeks until your body gets used to it.



2) your encouraged to nurse baby often in the beginning to increase your milk..once your body figures out how much milk your baby needs you won't make AS much. It is normal to be engorged a LOT in the beginning.



Am I at least half way on track?/ I want to breast feed my baby so bad and quite frankly don't care if it kills me, I want to do it!!! Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this...



Any advice would be great!!

First of all, congrats on your baby and your decision to breastfeed!! It's the best thing you can do for your baby! The health benefits to your baby (and yourself!) are amazing! I'm sure you already know all of that though. Your friend sounds like she will feel better about her decision to quit breastfeeding if you don't breastfeed. Do not listen to her!!



I have a 3 month old who is breastfed, and I never had any problems at all, except right after the birth. I was exhausted and groggy from the epidural, so the nurse gave the baby a bottle of formula. The next morning though, the baby latched on like a pro and never had any problems since. It also never hurt when the baby latched on. Engorgement is extremely uncomfortable, but all you have to do is take a warm shower and pump your breasts until they aren't so full.



The worst part of breastfeeding for me was leaking! Just get some bra pads and extra nursing bras. I thought they would never stop leaking, but now (around 3 months later) I rarely get leaks anymore, just sometimes at night. You are right, your body will figure out how much your baby needs and you won't make as much.



You sound so determined, that's great! You are doing something wonderful for you baby. And I promise once your baby stares into your eyes while you are nursing her, you will feel a love that you didn't know existed!

You are totally correct. Breastfeeding is hard at first but once you and baby know how to do it, it is easy and painless. And newborns have very small stomachs, they need to nurse a lot.. but your body will regulate itself.



You will be a great mom and I am sure your baby will be a champ at nursing. Congrats mom!

Sounds like your friend just wanted reasons NOT to breastfeed. Its your choice and dont let anyone tell you that you cant do it. I never did have many problems breastfeeding, but my sister did. She didnt produce enough milk and was very discouraged. But each woman and baby are different. I think you will do just fine. Good luck.

I think your friend feels guilty for 'failing'  which is ridiculous, she didn't fail it just didn't suit her, I think she hopes the feeling of failure will be lessened if you 'fail' too. You are correct by the way on all points. Make sure you have support as breast feeding is hard work, eat well, drink lots buy a good nipple cream, lansinoh (cant spell but something like that) good pillow for support ( I can recommend my brest friend) and good luck!
I had my baby at 37 1/2 week she was 5lb 13oz and breast feeding was nearly the death of me but it is far and away the most rewarding thing I have done for my daughter!

1) breastfeeding is hard in the beginning and its going to hurt for a few weeks until your body gets used to it. IT SHOULDN'T HURT BUT IT MAY FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, IF IT REALLY HURTS THEN YOU NEEDS TO SEE A LC ABOUT HELP WITH LATCH, MOST BABIES NEVER GIVEN A BOTTLE OR PACI AND NURSED WITHIN HOURS OF BIRTH LATCH JUST FINE



2) your encouraged to nurse baby often in the beginning to increase your milk..once your body figures out how much milk your baby needs you won't make AS much. It is normal to be engorged a LOT in the beginning.NURSE YOUR BABY VERY OFTEN FOR THE FIRST 6-8 WEEKS, THIS WILL BRING SUPPLY IN AND MAKE SURE YOUR BABY GETS ALL THE MILK THEY NEED, NURSE ON DEMAND BUT NEVER LET THEM GO MORE THAN 4 HOURS WHEN VERY YOUNG.  YOUR BODY IN THE BEGINNING MAKES TONS OF MILK ONCE ITS COMES IN AND LEARNS HOW MUCH TO MAKE BY HOW MUCH YOUR BABY REMOVES FROM THE BREAST, NO PUMPING UNLESS YOU PLAN TO GO BACK TO WORK, IF YOU GET ENGORGED YOU AREN'T NURSING ENOUGH, YOU SHOULD GET ENGORGED ONCE OR MAYBE TWICE OTHERWISE YOU SHOULD NURSE MORE OFTEN.

Your are right, breastfeeding is only hard at first but once you get used to it. It will be easy Second of all your the who's scheduling when to feed your baby i was told by my nurse every hour for a week or two. then gradually change it to every two/three hour.. as they grew they will change the schedule. You dont make to much milk is just enough, its good for your baby and good for you. it will help you to heal faster and loose weight in a same time its very healthy for your baby especially the first breastfeeding.

You're pretty well right on - breastfeeding can be pretty painful the first few weeks while you're body adjusts to it and figures out how much milk to produce. As for nursing your baby, don't look at the clock - nurse the baby when he/she wants to no matter how long its been since they nursed before. The baby knows when it's hungry. It might be a bit of hardwork in the beginning, but I really believe that it's worth it.

You are correct on all counts.  And the pain can be eased if you start using some lanolin ointment now, before you start nursing.  It really helps.  The engorgement in the beginning isn't that bad, I mean it is uncomfortable and I certainly wouldn't want to be like that for a long time, but it is usually over in like 2 days.  Leaky breast are just a part of nursing, no big deal, you get used to wearing a bra most all the time and breast pads inside the bra.  I don't sleep in one but make sure that I wear a cotton shirt at night when I nurse and the one breast leaks usually soaks the front of the shirt so I have a replacement on hand. ( quite frankly I am so exhausted I could care less.)

Yes you are exactly right.



I had the nurses in the hospital help me in the hospital after my son was born.  They were extremely helpful all night.  We didn't leave the hospital until I was sure I could get him latched on by myself. Which was only about 24 hours.
And yes it was painful for me.  But I've heard it's not for all....?



It took me closer to a month for it to stop being extremely painful,  but so worth it..



I never had a problem being engorged until I quit breastfeeding.  And never had any leaking issues either.
I will definately breast feed my next baby too.

You are correct on both! My daughter had trouble latching on at first, but I just kept trying (also with the help of a nipple shield-ask for one!). After about a week she knew what she was doing. Also, the only thing that hurts is the nipple-it may become cracked and very sensitive, but for me it only lasted a few days. Then you are used to it and there is no pain. And for the first several weeks you are supposed to let baby nurse on demand-whenever he/she wants to. That builds your milk supply to the level that your baby needs. Engorgement is only supposed to last a few days I think; I didn't experience it though.



Breastfeeding really is a wonderful thing: the bond with your baby and knowing that he/she is getting the best nutrients. Good luck! If you really want to breastfeed, just stick with it and ask for help if needed.

You are correct on both points.



Baby will breastfeed on demand.  This means that as soon as baby cries, first offer the breast, and then offer something else if baby doesn't want to eat.  There are lactation consultants at the hospital and plenty of hotlines you can call if you can't get baby to latch correctly.  After a few weeks, baby will get the hang of it all and everything will get better.



But, you really really need to talk to your friend about her negative attitude.  The more she tells you that you won't be able to breastfeed, the harder you will think it is, and you will let her get the best of you and will quit.  Sit down and talk seriously with her.  Tell her that you are sorry breastfeeding did not work for her, but it is different with every baby and every mother.  Tell her that you really want to try breastfeeding, and you would greatly appreciate her support.  And, tell her that if she can't be supportive, to please avoid being negative because the last thing you need is her negativity ruining what you are trying to give your baby.

Good for you for wanting to give your baby the best possible start!  Breast feeding is very hard.  I'm not going to lie or make it sound like a walk in the park.  It took my daughter and me three months to make it work.  In the meantime, I suffered through clogged milk ducts (warm compresses work wonders!), a baby who refused to latch without silicone nipple shields (which she stopped using at 3 months), and VERY sore nipples that cracked and bled.  I think I kept Lanisoh in business by buying their lanolin ointment!  (Which, by the way, if you use, make sure you use breast pads because it does leave a greasy residue on clothes that doesn't come out in the wash! Breast pads in your bra also help with the leaking milk issue.)



Different people produce different amounts of colostrum and milk initially.  A friend of mine could have fed five babies with her milk, and she was constantly engorged.  Meanwhile, I had to meet with a lactation consultant to figure out why I wasn't making enough milk.  I've had to breastfeed and then pump to essentially "tell" my breasts to make more milk.  If your friend was pumping every hour, she was essentially telling her body to make more milk.  Yikes!



Breastfeeding is one of the most unnatural natural part of being a mom, but it's worth it!  I got a cold last week, and because there were antibodies in my milk, my daughter only had a very mild version of my cold.  That alone was worth all the pain and frustration!  Good luck and try to stick with it!  If you choose not to though, don't beat yourself up about it.  Being a new mom is hard enough without the guilt we try to lay on ourselves for doing or not doing whatever it is that we are doing or not doing!

I don't think there is anything wrong with goat formula. You could also try soy formula. Also infant formula can be given from birth. Just select the right product for your child's age.



Babies are pretty tough little things and they will usually thrive on any good quality infant formula. Your infant has developed a rash so sure - change the formula and see how it goes.



Really the biggest battle is ensuring you get enough sleep each night so you can function properly. Little kids can feel it if you're all stressed out. So if the baby's got a rash, and it could be itchy and making them cry, then change the formula and see how it goes.

For those mommies that make their baby's/babies' food...?



What kinds of veggies did you mix together? I'm having trouble being "creative" and have only mixed green beans, sqaush, and carrots together. Other than that I've been giving him the veggie by itself.



Any fruit combos would be welcomed too! We've tried pears and bananas mixed and he's enjoyed those two.

You can try imitating the ones that you can buy-- or you can do what I did with Lilly and mix a bit of vegetables that your babe doesn't like into larger amounts of veggies or fruits that the baby likes. I slowly mixed more of what she "didn't like" into lesser amounts of things she loved.  Or instead of just mixing the different veggies serve 2 or 3 veggies with different textures at the same time.  I got more into mixing once Lilly was eating meats and more textures-- one of her favourites was pureed Chicken or Turkey with Papaya and either whole rice or barley.

If your baby is willing to eat the veggies without being mixed then that's a good start to get them into eating a bigger variety of foods, which is not a bad thing, if your baby doesn't like one particular veggie, then mix it with another veggie that baby does like. Personally potato was the base for all my mashings, every other veggie just seemed to go well with it, depending on your babies age, if baby is at the right age for finger foods, speaking from experience my 3 babies all love to chew on a cob of nice juicy corn, they like peas, as they are easy to eat and a little fun to chase around the plate...avocado is also very good for babies, you can try little chunks of that, mixed with your potato.
The good thing about babies is if they don't seem to get bored with the same foods if you serve them for 2 days straight.
I also used to mix grated veggies in with my tomato based pasta sauce, only grated because that way they mix better in the ground beef without being chunky, not to mention i havent met any child who doesnt like pasta!.

Applesauce and Parsnip are great, too. My baby loves them. So far, I also mixed potato and brown rice in the veggies. A bit of chicken or ground beef also mixes very well with the veggies.
Next thing on my list to try is spinach.



I always add a teaspoon of cold pressed canola oil to the veggies to ensure baby can absorb the fat-soluble vitamins.

My baby won't eat any veggies (except sweet potatoes) so I can't help you there... but as for fruit combos, I mix fruit into his infant cereal and he loves that.  Apples and strawberries, bananas and plums, and pears and peaches are good combos, as well as bananas and peaches.  I also mix some pureed chicken or beef with apple sauce or pureed pears.

I mix avocado into almost all the veggies my baby eats.  Peas are also good mixers.  The avocado is nice for adding calories since my baby is a little on the small side, plus it has lots of great vitamins that babies need for development.

dont give runny yolks. there is a risk of salmonella. its not worth it. would you eat a half cooked burger? then dont give your child a half cooked egg. aside from this, eggs arent recommended till at least 9mos.

I agree with the person above. Definetly dont give him egg unless it is fully cooked ..(hard boiled) babies are much more susceptible to salmonella/ food poisoning etc than we are.
Also you didnt say how old your baby is? Around 8months I started giving my little girl egg, including the white. I found it was difficult to get the egg to a good consistancy for her to eat, so I pureed it with some baked beans.
If he enjoyed it thats great, just keep an eye on him the second time, as often if a baby is allergic to something they will not have a reaction to it until the second time they are exposed to it. Look for rash, wheezing, vomiting, difficulty breathing etc.
Good luck, sounds like you have a great wee eater!

So when can I give my baby eggs?
Because of the fact that many children tend to be allergic to egg whites, doctors advise that you avoid egg whites altogether for the first year. If there is a family history of food allergy, then it might be worth excluding egg whites from your baby's diet for the first 2 years.



Well cooked egg yolk, however, can be given to your baby from 6 months of age - although you may want to wait on egg yolk, too, if there is a family history of allergy. The easiest way to separate the yolk from the white is to hard boil the egg, then simply remove the yolk. Alternatively, you can crack a raw egg into two, then tip the yolk back and forth between the shell halves, allowing the white to drain into a cup. However, some traces of egg white may remain and even tiny traces can lead to a severe reaction in an allergic baby.

Should I record yesterday's date or should I wait a little more to see if she is really walking.

I would record it as it happened.... so in the baby book put yesterday's date and say how it happened and you weren't sure and then once you see it and can be certain, put that date... The memory will be exactly what happened not just a date.
I do this with all of my daughter's. I have a calander that has lots of question marks next to possible milestones and little things that she's done. The calender itself will be a great memory but I will transfer it all into her book too

Hi friend, I am also like you . I have kept record of all the things that my baby had done. Now He is 4 yrs old. According to me you should pen down that moment because that was the first day when your baby had walked. It doesn't matter whether u were present or not. After all she has walked before mom of mom. You can record her videos, photos online that is the best way to keep record of all beautiful things. If you want u can share your baby photos, videos on

If you want to keep a record of everything your kid achieves then you must make a note of it.
If you only want to record the things you have noticed by yourself then you should not make a record of it.

I would record yesterday's walking record. I had my son 10 years ago and my daughter is now almost 5 months old. I have been going through my sons book and mine that my mother kept for me to see what my family mile stones have been. I think it is great for a grown adult to look at their baby book and see when they achieved things.



The book is not for your benefit, it is for your daughter to know when she actually got to the next level.



BTW, you could also put both down. Put down when she did walk for the first time and them put when Mommy saw it for the first time, and then you could aslo put when she really got moving around on her own.

Ohh I used to stress exactly the same! at that age though they can petty much move their head around. My girl keeps rolling on her belly, so its not like I can take her mattress away fo fear of her not breathing.



I have an old sheet which I cut in half and I swaddle her (wrap her tight). and put her on her back. She's abit of a hudini  though so generally she gets out. Then I stressed that she'd choke on her vomit or something.
So what did I do??
Stopped worrying.... Sounds silly but it has worked. She usually ends up horizontal and uncovered but babies are babies and they roll about.
I know this isnt help but just sharing my experience, Because I now sleep better.
P.S. the bars on the crib are designed so that babies cant get their heads stuck. Try a porta cot if your really worried, No bars or bumpers and they can roll around all they like

I think it is a lot safer to take the bumper off the crib because if she gets her face pushed up against it and tangled in the sheets and can't get out of it, you could have a potentially fatal accident. I don't want to sound like a downer, but a friend of a friend had a 6mth old who had the exact thing happen to her and unfortunately nobody got there in time and she passed away to sids.



As far as i am aware, all SIDS recommendations in Australia say not to use crib bumpers at all.



I have never used one and I have never encoutered my children hurting themselves by bumping on the wood. Occasionally they wriggle around and fall back to sleep with a leg or arm hanging out of the bars/slats, but it was never a problem.



I think I would rather have a bump on the wood than deal with something potentially far worse.

My 6 month old girl sleeps from 6 at night till about 6 am. With a feed or two durin the night.



She will usuall go back to sleep within an hour and half of waking up for another 2. Stays awake till about 2 then has another hour.



But every baby is different. My first is crazy still now (20 months) but at 6 months she NEVER slept during the day. I got so nuts from not having time out for mysef that the same time every day I put her in her room ( between 11 and 1). For the first fw weeks she screamed the whole time! but then she fell into a great routine of playing around for a bit then having a nap.



Increasing sleep is good... no no its great! Baby's take as much sleep as they need, And as long as its not interfering with theyre night routine let them. Also if you have started solids it could be related to that. staying fuller for longer.
Hope this helps

Why my 20 month boy cry when he have to bo a bath? ?



From birth until 18 month we have such a funny time while i washed him in his tub. I have been for 2 month trying to wash him in the shower standing on his feet but he cry and cry. It's seems he is so afraid from the bathroom now. What to do? Do i have to go back in the way i washed him before? Maybe i will buy another tub, a bigger one.

I have the same problem. Except  I was taking a bath with him until he noticed I was "different" so I made daddy start taking baths with him. He screams in the shower and I think its because he doesn't like the water hitting him in the face. And no matter if he is in the bath or shower we cant wash his hair. So we let him sit down in the shower and he seems to feel more comfortable or we will give him a bath and put bubbles in the tub. He really seems to like the bubbles and give him lots of toys whether in the tub or in the shower.

Well you could buy simple baby's furniture and paint it your way! Shops sell the same thing. Some italian and danish design houses make the craziest things but they cost a fortune.



For my baby I bought a very old fashioned chest of drawers found in an antiques shop  that I painted bright red so it gives it a quirky look. I'll do the same with the rest of his furniture.
It was my hobby while I was pregnant, I would paint every day!

Caffeine passing into breastmilk...how much and how fast does it happen?



I'm trying to find out about caffeine passing into breastmilk.



My midwife and doctor have told me that if you were to breastfeed your baby and then have 1 standard alcoholic drink, it will have passed through your milk and you can feed again safely as little as 2 hours after that drink, but is it the same with caffeine??? I know that it is okay to have a coffee (or coke etc..) when breastfeeding I just want to know how quickly it would get to the bubs.



Anyone know anything regarding this....

it goes through the same amount of time it takes to go through your system. About 5 mins after you begin drink, and then 45-2hr after.
But honestly... I wouldn't stress. I drank coffee normally with mine (one in morn and one in arvo) and it didn't affect her at all. Others can be different though. Your body is amazing at working out what bubs does and doesnt need, So really the minute amount that gets through doesnt affect them. But I have heard opposite also

sweetie stop stressing.
All babies develop at different rates hey. My girl is 6 months now and still rarely smiles. Where as my first was smiles from day one.
I am guessing that you have afew mothers around you that you have to compare to? Dont!
As soon as you stop comparing the happier you will be.



As for the turned out eye, it wont be a problem I am sure. My daughter had the same thing and her sight is fine now. theyre still learning to controll theyre eyes, legs, arms, yawns, burps, feeding, weeing, pooing etc. Its hard to co ordinate all of these things at once. Give it a few months before you worry. Alot of doc's stress that it could be something to do with brain function but majority it is nothing at all. Hope this helps

Wow what a little dot of a thing, because she was born early and was only born so small that would have put her back a bit, and having the eye problem wouldnt help. Talk to your health nurse or doctor about it, but she will probably surprise you and smile very soon.

should state how old your bub is. With formula they should be getting plenty. If breast feeding they should be getting what they need.
I
f it is a vegan choice..... I think your silly to be expressing your opinions on your child when humans are genetically built to ingest and need calcium (if not sorry something I feel really strongly about)

you shouldnt need any extra vitamins or calcium for your baby. they should get everything they need from brast milk or formula. and also from health fruit and veg if he's old enough yet.

No, you feed babies either breastmilk (much preferable) or formula. They do not need extra calcium or vitamins, and too much of some vitamins can be harmful.

For a baby 12mths or under they should be drinking formula or breastmilk in which case they will be getting all that they need.



For babies over 12mths that are on cows milk, as long as they are having cows milk, some cheese, yoghurt etc..they will also be getting enough calcium.



If your baby is eating and drinking a well balanced diet that is appropriate to their age, then you should not need to be giving any supplements at all.

I know exactly what you mean, i to have a cat who thinks he's my son and a little 6 month old.  Unfortunately you can't do anything right now as it's calledseparationn anxiety and all babies go through it.  They eventually get over it.  As for the cat, not sure on that one lol.

okay hun, its really herd to do but it does work.
You really need to let them cry. most importantly relax. If you do the "im comming, im comming" thing they will pick up on it.
Show them that you will not rush to their every bec and call.



Some babies really just want to go where you do, if you have a walker pop him in that so that he can learn to move aout on his own. And place him in sight when your doing things. He just wants to know what your doing.
But when it comes to going to the loo and getting yourself dinner you really need to just let him cry.
It takes a while and persistance but it will be fine in the end.
They know that you love them.... just give him a hug when you get back and say "see that wasn't so bad". It will start loud and demanding but after afew weeks he'll know that you'll be back shortly.



AS for your kitty, she sounds gorgeous!! she needs alot of love and cuddles too, but you sound like you need you time. So why dont you set up a little bed with some bikkies in the laundry and just leave her in there afew hours a day. She too will learn to not depend on you ebtirely, You sound like a really loving mum, but just try not to be a pushover okay

There's not much you can do, but that doesn't mean you have to be around him 24/7. Sometimes it is better for you to just leave him for 5 minutes to cry. Leave him with something distracting so it might take him a few minutes to notice that you're gone.
Separation anxiety is common from 6 months, and it shouldn't take too long for him to grow out of it. As long as he is learning that he doesn't need to rely on you every second of the day.
Good Luck

OMG! I had the same problem. It is so----- hard to get things done when you have a needy baby! They just love us so much , that is why they do that. They grew inside us for 9 months! You have to let the baby cry [ which is very hard to do! ]. Our first instinct as a Mom is to pick them up whenever we hear a peep out of them. This will be hard but things have to get done like taking a shower, dishes etc.  Make sure they baby is fed, not wet , & not sick. If you need to jump in the shower,  put the baby in the crib. Same thing if you need to do dishes......  You need "me " time . If you are married, ask your husband to help you.  It is OK to let the baby cry for a little bit. PLUS, picking him up everytime will only teach him that this is okay when its not. It will get harder as he gets bigger if you dont nip it in the butt now. I think your kids sound like mine & they will always be attached to you . However, if you do those things I said , you can have it a little easier. Also, remember they are only young once & to cherish these moments where they do want you all the time. They will grow up so fast!! You will ask yourself where the time went!!

I was 40 weeks and 3 days when I went into labor.  Earlier that day, I decided to take a 30 minute walk 3 times.  I also had sex the night before.  My doctor told me to give it a try.  So I did and 7/19/2008 my beautiful baby girl came out and I was only in labor for 20 minutes.  The greatest pain I could ever feel.



My due date was 7/16 and I was set to be induced on 7/22/08 but went into labor before then.



Just try taking a walk or the sex.  Might help.

"I think I still have the nail marks in the inside of my lip from when my daughter was 5 months old and grabbed my lower lip and decided to see if she could pull it off".

My little girl is 5 years old now - and what I miss the most about her being a baby is the way she used to find relief for sore gums when she was teething.  Not only would she chew on my fingers, but she used to turn her head from side to side very quickly while I held my finger on her gums, making a squeeking noise.

Anyway: back to your question...

When I came home from the hospital I received a "subscription" to gerber baby.  I loved this magazine (being a new parent) because I didn't know what to expect from my baby, what was normal, and what to look for in her developement.

What gerber did was provide details about my baby's "phases" which I followed along with as she grew.  It was great reading about month to month expectations, and then watching her for the behavior or goal.

You may want to check out their website. They provide quick facts in the developement section about your baby's emotional, social, and physical goals.  It was both educational and fun for me.  I hope you enjoy their site.

Roflmao! My daughter will be 5months on the 7th and she started about 2-3 weeks also. It's really cute. And yes the annoying part is when she's trying to go to sleep while I'm holding her...she feels everything on my face (lip, nose, eyes, chin...etc) && grabs it;; more like YANKS it!! That's the annoying part because It hurts sometimes and she constantly does it. But hey that's her way of going to sleep so I have no choice. It's cute though.

Sterilising & weaning?



I began weaning my baby at 18 weeks, she is now 20 weeks.  I began early because she is not a "milky" baby.  She's never cried for food, and wasn't really interested in her bottle.  Someone told me she might be more into food than milk, so as soon as I could, I tried.  She loves food.  I want to make food for her myself, and also give her jars so that I can take her out and not worry about food spoiling and also because restaurants etc wont heat home cooked food, but will heat jars if necessary.



Anyway, I'm sterilising EVERYTHING when I cook the food myself, because she is still young, and also she has been hospitalised twice with nasty infections, and I can't risk her getting another one.

My question - which bits of the food preparation cycle do I need to sterilise and which ones don't I?  I'm sterilising all the cooking utensils, masher, ricer, blender, chopping matts...everything.  Part of me thinks I should just use jars until she is a bit older (because its "safer"), but I feel like its a bit of a cop out.

What do you think?  I'd really appreciate opinions or experiences.  Many thanks x



</question>



<additional details>



Maybe I should elaborate... I'm not a Monica off Friends type.  My baby almost died, twice.  She caught her infections from "people", and so I try and keep all things around her clean and sterile.  We're not sure yet if she has a metabolic disorder which makes her prone to infections or not.  There is something that changes in you as a parent when you see your baby so sick, and something in you which wants to protect her from anything else which might make her sick again..... I know I sound overboard, and I need to relax, so that's why I asked! :-)

i have made every piece of solid food my baby has eaten since he started solids at 5 months (except if we are at a restaurant and he has some of my dinner) - and i have never sterilized a thing (just wash things with hot water and soap like i do all of our dishes and utensils).



it's much healthier to make your baby's food and i don't believe jarred baby food is any safer at all, it can be contaminated in the factory it is made, there are often baby food recalls on jarred food.  i have never bought a jar of baby food and my son is super healthy and never gets sick.

i think what is safer and healthier is buying fresh veggies and meat and making your own you know exactly what is in it.

You do not need to sterilise everything. Just washing all the cooking items in hot soapy water is adequate.

There is such a thing as being overly clean, and children raised in these sorts of environments are more likely to develop asthma. Think about it, soon your baby will be crawling around and putting things from the floor into her mouth. My son is only 4 months old and already puts his hands onto restaurant tables and other dirty surfaces then straight into his mouth. It has done him no harm.

You really do need to stop sterilising everything your baby comes into contact with and by doing this you will be letting her immune system develop.

Sorry if what i have wrote seems a bit harsh, but you really do not need to sterilise everything your baby comes into contact with.

I totally understand your being anxious, but others are right, sterilising absolutely everything may well make it worse, she does need to be exposed to some things, to help get her immune system up and better :)

I would sterilise feeding equipment, but not utensils.



Don't use jars, she's better off with your food, though it's perfectly OK when you go out and things to give her a jar if it's more convenient.

HELP!!!! A very hungry baby?



Hi i was just wondering if anyone could give me some advise i am a first time mum and would like other peoples opinions other than my midwife.
My baby is bottle fed and started drinking 3oz when he was born and by a week old was on 4oz. By 2weeks old he was drinking 5oz and at nearly 6weeks he has been drinking 6oz bottles for the last couple of weeks. My midwfie says this is fine and that if he is hungry enough to drink more than give it to him.I have tried giving him hungry baby formula but it gives him tummy ache and makes him constipated even if i just give it to him on a night feed.
Although my midwife says it is fine to give him so much my question is.........Bottles only go up to 9oz and the youngest age suggested on baby jars is four months.He is already hungry for more than his 6oz bottle at only six weeks and i know i am not going to be able to hold out on just milk until four months.His on four hourly feeds and is already hungry for more.Does anyone have any suggestions?

Anyone have a baby cough remedy?



My 4 month old son has developed a dry, hacking cough as well a blocked nose and i want to know if there is any home remedy i can give him.

I know that when i have a cough i normally have hot water with honey, but as honey is a no-go for babies under one i cannot give him that.

I do not really want to give him a cough syrup as they are full of artificial colours.

Can anyone help me with a home remedy as my poor little lad really seems miserable.

You can try a bit of vicks on the chest. A small amount.



The best, most suggested thing, by DR's, and you can look this up, is to either take him in the shower with you and stay in for a bit, so that the moisture helps to clear him up.



Or, you can run the shower/bath while you sit near it, and it has a similar affect. The water itself, from the showering together, will help the nose to clear up. It will moisten and loosen up the boogies. :)

There's not much you can do aside from that. Keep him in warm pj's? Anyway, if it persists, then you can take him to your DR and let them know your concern, and they can prescribe you sugar and dye free medicine for him.

I've done it all with both my kids. My daughter was the worst. Hers seemed to happen when it was close to seasons changing, winter, and when she had teeth coming in. Of all those, they worked fine. Its just something you're going to wait out, on top of the suggestions. Sorry. :( Best wishes.

IDK if you, the "asker", will get this, but if he has a fever, you shouldn't keep him warm, that only encourages the fever to raise, and will do more harm than good.

I found that a good steam helped mine for a few hours. I would close the bathroom door, and put a towel on the bottom to help escaping steam and put my babe in a swing while I took a hot steamy shower. Then id leave him in the hot steamy bathroom in his swing (usually having a good sleep) until its not steamy anymore! It always helped him clear up his airways for about 3 hours or so.

Plain ol' sugar syrup will calm a tickly throat.

Make sure baby is hydrated enough which will help loosen phlegm.  Steam (bathroom) can help.  As can peppermint tea (not oil)

You can use a mustard plaster but be very careful not to burn the skin.

We know that even a 12 percent solution of sugar can be a powerful drug, relieving measurable pain by half during a circumcision. Perhaps this placebo syrup functioned as a drug. Whether it was the sugar or the children’s minds at work, the syrup dramatically relieved coughs, and could be a gentle, inexpensive first line treatment for coughs from viral respiratory infections. A spoonful of sugar may do more than just help the medicine go down! The next time one of my children has a mild cough

Run the shower on hot, and sit in there holding him.  Let him inhale the steam.  Also, get saline drops from the drug store.  Drop 1-2 drops in each nostril, then you can either use the aspirator to suck out the blockage, or you can just sit up with him and let it loosen on its own.  Babies tend to HATE the aspirator, so with my kids, I just dropped in the saline and let gravity do it's job.  If that didn't help much, then I would use the aspirator.  I just felt like the poor baby is already sick and feeling crummy, why get them even more riled up.  Good luck.  I know it's awful watching them like this.  =(

I'm a mom of twins (who are now 17 months old and starting to wake up from their nap) -- I will post a reply later but I wanted to be sure to refer you to the forums at http://www/twinstuff.com . You may already be familiar with them, but if not, they are forums for parents of multiples (the majority are parents of twins, but there are parents of triplets and higher order multiples as well) and it is an invaluable resource for information, advice, etc. The forums specifically for "The First Year" are wonderful, I don't know how I would have gotten through the first several months without them.

Good luck!
--------------------------------------...
Later that same day....

If you can have some kind of help caring for them, by all means, do it. I was confident I could do it all on my own and while it's certainly possible, and many people do it, help, if you can get it, is a wonderful thing. You may want help caring for the babies or you  may want help with, you know, everything/anything else. Many people recommend having some help for a week or two when the babies first come home -- the pros to that are obvious so I will play devil's advocate and point out the main con (which has nothing to do with having twins vs. having a singleton, by the way): you may want time alone, as a family unit, to bond and settle in when your babies first come home, and you may not want anyone there. If you have a partner/spouse and he is able to take time off from work when the babies come home, chances are that he isn't taking off much time, and you may not want others there at that point. Also, if he can take time off from work, and if you're taking off more time from work, you don't want to go from having "lots of help" and people around (your husband, and, say, a relative who is helping you out, or a baby nurse, or whatever) to having no one at all when husband goes back to work and the help situation ends. Anyway, that said, take help that's offered!! But be clear about the kind of help you want -- if relatives live nearby they'll probably be quite interested in helping with the baby, when what you will probably really want is help with things like laundry! Be that as it may, think about what you want in help and what is possible....and take it if you can get it.

Routine, routine, routine -- before motherhood I was not very...good...about routine. But I believe it's imperative, and has a lot to do with why my children (now 17 months) are so happy. You don't have to be rigid about things, but routine is great for most babies and gives them a sense of security...and with twins, routine is great for the caregiver and gives them(us) a sense of sanity! It also means trying to keep both babies on the same "schedule" -- you know that old saying, never wake a sleeping baby? Feh. That saying is inapplicable where twins are concerned. If you don't wake a sleeping baby what you end up with is a situation where you are *constantly* feeding. If one baby wakes at 1am to eat....the other one gets offered the breast/bottle then as well. Otherwise, you're in trouble, you will never sleep, and you will truly suffer. If you breastfeed, try breastfeeding in tandem -- after you're comfortable breastfeeding at all. If you bottle feed, find ways to feed simultaneously. If you do both, you can breastfeed one while bottle feeding the other...and switch that around at the next feeding. Etc. Establish a consistent bedtime routine with your babies before you even think it makes a difference to them; it can be very simple but be consistent. This will help with getting them to sleep (although sleeping through the night is a developmental thing and can't be rushed against an individual baby's particular inner schedule....unfortunately). Have a routine of waking, eating, and playing, and learn to look for "sleepy signs" to put your babies down for a nap....the ability to sleep well is a learned skill and when babies get very tired they don't sleep. If you try to keep them awake longer it will backfire, and nights will be terrible.

Get the support of other moms of multiples. For me, the forums at twinstuff.com were very very helpful. Most questions/concerns that moms have are pretty universal on some level, whether the mom is dealing with one baby or five. But the options, solutions, etc. are different when you have twins as contrasted with when you have a single baby. Pure and simple. Most of the well-intentioned advice from moms of singletons isn't very applicable, and if nothing else it gets very annoying because the bottom line is people who have not parented multiples just don't get it. So be sure and have some resource, some group of people in the same position or people who have been in that position, to help you through, whether it's on-line, or a local parents of multiples club, or just a subscription to Twins magazine. Something.

Be organized. Someone else mentioned keeping a notebook. My husband and I made a chart -- a very simple chart, basically dividing a page in two, one side for our son and one for our daughter, with columns for: time, feedings, diapers, and "other." We printed them out on our computer and used one chart per day, noting the time for each baby of feedings (how much they drank or for how long they breastfed), diaper changes (wet, "poopy" and yes, color and consistency b/c that info is telling for a doctor). In the "other" column we put everything else, from medication taken to temperature to what new food they had tried....whatever. It was extremely helpful for us, and for our doctor. You'd be amazed at how much you don't remember that stuff (especially when you're utterly sleep deprived). Very important.



For practical stuff in preparing for twins, remember first of all that twins doesn't mean you need two of everything! One baby may love a bouncy seat while the other hates it. Ditto a swing. Get one, see how it goes. Our twins shared a crib until they were six months, too. As for the stroller, there really is no such thing as a perfect double stroller, at all! To start with I urge you to get infant car seats that snap out of the base and can be carried...and a snap n go stroller, which is basically a base into which those car seats can fit. Makes life very easy. The stroller is cheap, it's light, it can be used for as long as the kids can be in those seats, and buys you time to learn what you really need/want in a stroller so you can get one (or probably two) that truly fit the bill.

If you have same-sex twins, if they are identical or if they appear identical, find some consistent, agreed upon way to tell them apart. Sounds stupid, but I've heard again and again from parents of ID twins that they could not tell the babies apart when they were very little. Some use a touch of nailpolish on a fingernail, some go by color of clothing...whatever.

Diapers: 1800diapers.com. They have excellent prices (yes, you can find better sometimes, but time and effort do have value, you have two babies to look after, after all!) and, they deliver right to your door. Orders over $50 are shipped free. They sell bigger boxes than you can find in most stores. You can even "schedule" a delivery with them so they deliver, say, once a month (but if you do that remember to change/update the size you need!) I cannot tell you the hassle it saves me from, not having to buy the tons of diapers we need every time we go shopping. And it's not just diapers, they do formula, wipes, and various other baby needs as well.

This doesn't speak to the raising of twins, but nonethless: if you are still expecting and they haven't been born yet, be prepared earlier than a woman pregnant with a single baby would be. Chances are pretty high that the babies will be born early. Or, you may find yourself on bedrest at some point. So get ready early.

This is a ridiculously long answer, I'm sorry for that. I'll leave you with two other thoughts. One: be prepared for a lot of attention and a lot of comments, which can be sweet and can be annoying. No matter how sweet it is you will get annoyed by the attention and the questions...and for some reason people tend to want to touch twins more than other babies. Two: This is the most important thing to remember. Have fun. Raising twins is....very challenging. It's the hardest job I've ever had, let me tell you. It is also the most fun you'll ever have. Enjoy it.

Sorry to go on for so long. Congratulations!

What would happen if I just took my daughter



Please see my previous question:

http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...

As well as his previous behaviour, he is now saying he would badmouth me, snatch our daughter on one of his visits and take her abroad, leave her with his friends who smoke drugs whilst he goes out...  I'm so worried, I just want to get her away from all this.  I know every child deserves a father but all this is going to do is hurt her is she is around him.  What would happen if I just took her away?  Would I be being completely unfair?  I'm reluctant to go to court and say all the things he has said, because that will just make his behaviour towards her and me worse and he has threatened violence against me should I do that.  Help!

You can't be arrested for moving. If I were you I'd get myself fully prepared (money, deposit for a house/flat, sort out transport) and move to another part of the country. Wait till he's not around and flee. Go on the edited version of the electoral register (so he can't view it) and don't put your real name of gas bills etc.  Although you'll have to give your real name for benefits, at least he can't run a credit search on you to find you.

Im afraid the only way to deal with this is to take it through the courts and to tell them everything that you are telling us on here.  If he has been threatening you with violence then you can get a restraining order on him.  I am also in the UK and a friend of mine is going through a legal battle because her sons father is trying to get access to their son but he is very violent and completely unfit.  He has been aggressive, violent and at best could be described as an unfit father and dangerous.  At the moment she has custody of her son and he does not have any visitation rights due to his behaviour.  If he has been threatening you then that amounts to domestic abuse, violent or otherwise.  I know its difficult but think about what is best for your daughter in the long run.  Seek legal advice and try to get his access restricted.  Good luck!

6 months old? neglect?? what do you think? what should I do?



I baby sit this baby, she is nearly 6 months old and me and my mother agree she is about the size of a new born. when her mum was explaining what to do and stuff (she des it every time) she always says not to warm the bottle, just give it to her cold. she doesnt wash used bottles either. I had her over night and she was on medication, he dad said to give her the medication with her dinner and if she wouldnt sleep to give her more to knock her out (this is perscription medication). all day they just leave her in a bouncer in front of the TV and she isnt even eating food, just bottles all the time. I asked if she has been bathed (they dropped her off at 8pm) and they said no but didnt want me to bathe her, she has bad flaking on her scalp and cradle cap really bad. she cant support her head yet and doent respond to her name, just clapping and whistling.

i dont want to say they are bad parents because i dont know the full situation, they are friends of my brothers and thats the only reason i look after them.

please let me know what you think. i dont think its right.



</question>



<additional details>



i am not worried about losing the job.
where i live there a 1500 people and to get elsewhere the only way is by plane, so if i take her to a nurse or what ever the parents will know right away.
i will look for cps in my area.
i know it seems like im just sitting around but im jut trying to figure out the best action. thank you all so much



i saw her today and she was still in the same clothes as two days ago (they only sent me with one set, i bought more the next day)  she maybe gets bathed twice a week at most.



also they wont take her to a doctor until she is so bad they have to take her to the emergacy room.

while the mum was preggo and throwing her guts up the dad was in the next room screwing his ex. and i know there is a lot of fighting going on between them.



im not saying this is neglect, im just not sure and worried about the child



the medication she has for her was given at emergancy



im 17 in october.

Hi - Hmmm tough one this. Me I would take the child to A&E next time you are babysitting and explain your fears to the nurse there. You may be wrong, but at 6 months a baby should be at least supporting its own head..
I guess your worried about losing your job as a babysitter, but imagine how you would feel if the baby died? Would you blame yourself for not doing anything?
Its your call, but I would do SOMETHING.
Call social services and report it without giving your details, although as in the case of Victoria Klumby, nothing will be done.

It isn't necessary to warm baby bottles if you don't want, it is more a comfort thing and not needed.  The bottles should be washed though after every use but that isn't neglect according to CPS.  Not sure on what medication she is on but it does sound bad that the father is saying to give more to knock her out that would concern me.  The bouncer thing all the time is bad but at 6 months old there is no law that says she has to have solid foods.  Some babies can go 2 days without a bath, frequent baths dry out their skin sometimes (my pediatrician said that too) so unless she is going a week or something without baths they may not see that as neglect either but her clothes should be changed and her diaper should be changed obviously.  Cradle cap isn't necessarily a sign of neglect either, most babies get it and it can be hard to get rid of, with my boys i had to use selsun blue shampoo to get rid of it (per pediatricians recommendations).  She should be able to support her head though and should atleast look at you when you talk to her so I would say something may be wrong there, was she a premie or anything?  Really it is a call you will have to make, do you think they neglect her or not?  You didn't say what she weighed so I couldn't say if the weight is ok or not and really that would be hard to say if it proves neglect or not without knowing the situation because i know babies that are failure to thrive that are in good homes.

It's sounds like neglect to me but you never know the whole story. They could be great parents going on doctors orders. Although the TV thing isn't good for any child but that alone isn't neglect, just poor parenting and they will pay for it later when the kid won't sit still or focus on anything. It's really a judgment call on your part. Are these people well-rounded loving people or is there some possible drug/alcohol abuse going on? You see the situation is questionable...just look at the parents and see if there are any flags. Unfortunately contacting CPS only means they will do the bare minimum to address the situation. I have heard many parents talk about notices left on their doors including a date and time for the next visit CPS will make; which means the parents can clean up their act that day and go back to doing what they do after that. If you decide to call, certainly do it but don't expect anything special but if they do their job it will be a good thing. Best wishes.

You should call social services. The baby could just be small for her age, but there is really something wrong if she cant hold up her own head! That is bad parenting if you are too lazy to play with your kid, risk getting her sick by not washing bottles, or giving her extra medication. Now she isnt quite 6 months so not starting solid food yet is okay. It will ease your mind if you call and they may contact someone that deals with developmentally slow children as well. If they dont see anything wrong at least if something happens it wont be on your concious.

I think your right,that sounds like a bad situation. I guess the best thing you could do is call CPS and remain anonymous. Tell them whats going on. They do take her to a doctor if she hes prescription med. Maybe since this is a small town,the nurse or doc. will listen to you. weigh the baby next time you have her, just weigh yourself first then weigh yourself holding the baby,so you can tell CPS or the nurse.
Do the parents use drugs? Where do they go when you babysit,it sounds like theres not much to do in a town that you described.

Why on earth would they not let you bathe her?



Them not letting you bathe her and telling you to increase her medication sounds like a step above neglect into downright abuse.



They are out right telling you to not take proper care of the baby.



Leaving her in a bouncy seat all day with no interaction besides what she gets from television is neglect.  At 6 months she should be able to support her head there is something wrong there likely physical but if they are doing nothing about it then that too is neglect.



I would find your local CPS or file a report about your concerns with your local law enforcment agency.  Hopefully CPS or the police will be effective in dealing with this (so many times they aren't) and things will get better for this baby.

You sound very young...I am a Mother of two healthy children and I have never warmed their bottles..because I was taught by midwives that it is not necassary..its not neglect! it is not advisable to leave an infant in front of the TV all day and that may be why the baby doesnt respond well yes...cradlecap is very common and not everyone sees the need to remove it. Nothing you have mentioned apart from the ill advised medication is neglect...these are simply not great parents and when you live a bit longer you will see that thjis is all too common...I am afraind that reporting them will do no good...just keep babysitting and YOU can talk to the baby and help it grow.

Does your brother spend time with these mates? Surely if he goes round to their place, he would have some idea of the situation. Or haven't you spoken to him? If he is in agreement with you, then contact Social Services. It could be neglect or just very lazy parenting. My boys could their heads up by 6 months old, in fact they were crawling around! Next time you are looking after this baby, give her a nice warm bottle, perhaps buy a jar of baby food, and try feeding on her it. I am sure that babies should be weaned at this age! And read the pharmacist's label on any medications she has for directions on dosage and frequency!

This is truly sad. Honestly I know that CPS doesn't require much but that you feed a child and put a roof over its head. So maybe what you are seeing is just two truly nasty unconcerned parents.  Your gut instinct is telling you something is truly wrong here and you should listen to you as you may be the only person to speak up for this child. Call CPS.

It is a well known fact that neglected babies do not thrive and what you have described fits this. You need to contact the authorities and express your concerns, they will not divulge who contacted them. For the sake of this baby (and any future children) someone needs to intervene. I admire your social conscience in the absence of the parents caring properly for this child.

Hmmm, it sounds like a very complicated situation. Kudos for trying so hard to do the right thing. You have my respect.

The baby sounds unhealthy. I'm not so much concerned by the lack of baths (cradle cap can actually be made worse by too much bathing - try olive oil, it works a treat), but by the poor condition and dirty bottles.



As her baby sitter you are in a good position to make sure she at least gets good care while she's with you. Keep up the good work.

Do call CPS. And if you don't feel confident visiting a nurse try calling the hospital/health centre anonymously. Describe the childs physical condition and circumstances and ask for their advice.



Go with your gut on this one, darling. Listen to your heart and you'll do the right thing.

Good luck.

I'm a Mother of three and I honestly can't believe that anyone would tell you not to contact someone about this child. What's the worse that could happen? Maybe the parents get investigated and it's found that things are fine, well then so what? Now what's the worst that could happen? I don't even want to go there.

I know that child protective services makes it VERY hard to get children taken away from worthless parents. I have a cousin who had a little boy with his girlfriend and you couldn't really get much worse as far as parenting. They were young and completely selfish and clueless and doing a lot of drugs on top of it. It took my family months and months to finally get something done. Today the child is in a normal home and is well adjusted. I shudder to think what might have become of him if we had looked the other way and allowed him to be treated the way he was.



Now this was not a fun thing to do. My cousin is very close to me as is our entire family. But to me there was no question what was right to do. This child does not have any say and cannot do anything about the way it's being treated. So people like us have to give them the voice they don't have.

And yes some people are right about some of these things not necessarily being neglect. For instance my two year old has ezcema and could only bath two times a week at most when he was that young and trust me I'm a great mom. Plus cradle cap happens too even if you're doing everything right. Not warming the bottle, not necessary either.



However the things that worry me are first and foremost the father telling you to give the child more meds to "knock her out". I'm sorry this is pathetic. I can't imagine saying that to a babysitter. If they are open about that to you can you imagine what they do in private?

Plus the child sitting in the bouncy seat alone and not being able to hold up it's head is not right. Maybe there are health issues but even so you'd think the parents would explain this all to you and let you know what's going on...I know I would.

My gut tells me that these people are selfish idiots who have no business "raising" a child. Could I be wrong, of course. The thing is I'd rather take a chance on being wrong then take a chance on a poor helpless child being abused or neglected.

I just can't get over the fact that these parents do all these things like not washing the bottles in front of a sitter. I mean if that's acceptable behavior to them in front of a babysitter I don't want to fathom what else they think is acceptable.

I wish you the best in your decision. I really do think though that all of us need to look out for the best interest of children and to me these people don't look like they are.

im not sure where you live but cps over where would prob not class it as abuse well not enough to do anything its a really hard situation my 4 month old is lng but slim and she wont take solids yet she can support her head, smile laugh and look at you when you talk to her she makes baby sounds , warming a bottle is not necessary at that age...it depends on what the medication was for and what it is but sometimes babys dont sleep and parents use medication to make there baby slep also not classed as neglect......my daughter watches tv in her bouncer she loves it and it keeps her quiet when she is awake....cradle cap can be hard to get rid of as most babys have it at some stage......the nurse is bound by priacy laws she cant tell the parents you brought her in and then the nurse is obligated to take it further (right an anonimus letter to the nurse so she is made aware of the situation keep a copy you made need it later ) you dont know the parents havent washed the clothes since you last saw them what the mum and dad do in there priate lives will not come into effect unless it is hurting the child screwing his x may not be right but its not illegal.......some people just dont care about there kids but by law its not neglect just very sad if it was my id be keeping a diary, photos and copys of an letters you may send to a nurse or cps so if something does happen to the baby or cps do inestigate you have evidence and can back up your claims as it takes awhile for cps to look into things .....all i can say is good luck and i hope everything works out for this poor little girl

jacqui - i dont feel my daughter is comfy in the hauck at all! she is always wriggling, stretching, pushing etc. grandma uses it when she stays at her house, just to go to the shop, sit her in it to feed her etc. we arent flying, we are going by train so i think it should be ok!

but yeh, i think you are right about the OPD instead of OCD lol. must be gentic - my sister was the EXACT same with ehr daughter, bad genes lol

Haha! That's just like my in-laws. They have four kids, the youngest being 5 mos. old now. They recently discovered that in total, they have 10 buggies. They've gotten rid of most of them, but there's still one or two floating around.



My youngest is 16 mos. now, and we have NO buggies. I got rid of the last one, and plan on letting her run around with her older brothers supervising when we go out.

We've got 4 children the youngest being 8 months. 
We have had a huge amount of buggies. Everyone in the Maclaren range, including the twin traveller! A Mamas and Papas travel system and duette. Jane Powertwin. But my favourite by far is my new Jane pro slalom. Not ideal in the car but fantastic for walking.

You must have obssessive pram disorder! No seriously, think the one at grandparents is a bit wasteful, couldn't you take that one on holiday?
That would be ther one I would have taken! I think you will find your most recent order heavy! Esp if you are flying! Even if you go by car, the one at grans would be better, as lighter, and wont take as much space!
I have the mickey mouse version!
My son is my 4 th child and he will be 3 at end of sept! It will defo be the last push chair i buy! But so were about the last 6 !
No seriously it will be the last!
I have had a proper push with a carrycot attachment that i used for my older 2 sons, they also had a twin side by side pushchair , (they were 2 yrs apart in age!)
They also had 2 foldup light weight buggies, for hols etc when i had help!
My daughter had a proper pushchair with carseat attachment, and went through about 2 fold up buggies! 
My son had another proper push chair with careseat and has had 2 fold up push chairs!
good luck!

I have no idea what lose motion is, but, I do know that if your baby is collicy, meaning, it won't quit crying to mix about a teaspoon full of dark Karo Syrup, with about 4 ounces of luke warm water in a bottle, and it soothes the baby.

Is he feverish at all, or any signs of illness or dehydration, like slow down in urine output, maybe not wetting his nappy for 6 hours or having dry eyes or a sunken look? if so it's best to see a doctor.

Otherwise I'd give him little sips of sugar water as often as possible and keep him off food for a day or two, maybe just dry toast, but continue with his baby milk. I wouldn't leave it much longer without seeing a doctor tho'

not 100% sure what lose motion is but if it's loose stools, then a natural full fat yoghurt with some mashed banana is great. stay away from things like fruit juices, grapes and raisins. make sure his bottom is well protected with frequent nappy changes and barrier cream.

Do you think there are too many "rules" when it comes to raising a child?



Do you think we blindy listen to the "blanket rules" we read in books etc regarding things such as introducing solids at a particular age, not nursing to sleep etc.
I know they are not ruels but the way they are "recommended" especially sometimes here on Y!A you'd think they were lol
I mean I know some of things have their place but I also believe that Mum knows best and we don't give our guts instincts enough credit.

Does that even make sense? What are your thoughts?

i never personally. i never bought a book when i was pregnant, never bought one when my daughter was born.

Y!A is my textbook, i prefer to ask other mummys with experience, whether it be on here, or calling someone i know. im a lot more confident with making my own decisions for her now, she is my first, so for a few months after she was born, if her skin was a little red, i was convinced it was a rash and that she had meningitis.

i cooled off a lot more and know the line between what is ok, and what isnt and when to call the dr.

hi, ill mail you, dont want to start a debate on your Q.

you dont allow, ok well someone posted a Q a few weeks ago saying 'do our private jokes offend you since your not in with us' i didnt realise at this point there was an in crowd and found it sort of infantile.

i posted a similar question to all those not in with the in crowd saying we should form our own group. it started as a joke, but everyone answered and they were  like 'yeh lets do it' bla bla bla. so i posted another Q asking what our name should be, someone suggested 7's since is an upside down L, opposite of L, L for loser, opposite of loser etc.

but from what i understand, another user(s) have set up trolling accounts to post questions bashing me, and my contacts. and since these questions appeared ive had a thumbs down monkey on my back, and been getting violation notices for legitimate questions and answers.

Many of those "rules" are things that have come about from years of studying parenting methods as well as medical and psychological research.

For example, not introducing solid foods before a certain age is to ensure your baby's immune system is fully developed and to ensure the baby is mature enough to actually chew and swallow the food. But most age targets related to feeding have to do with developmental milestones rather than specific ages. The ages tend to be more of an average.



Not nursing your baby to sleep is in the same category as not walking on tip toes while baby is sleeping and not rushing to your baby the instant they cry. If everything is always just so then baby never learns how to cope if something isn't just so.

yeah i do, i read all the books when i was pregnant but when it actually came to being a mum no amount of book reading can tell you how hard it is so i listened to my gut instinct and did it how thought it was right!
I weaned my little girl at 4 1/2 months because simply milk wasn't enough for her and it's been ok to do it for years when my mum had her kids so why is it different now?
I say listen to your instinct and do it how you feel its right!

Totally agree 
There are so many rules

About eating, sleeping, milestones, 
I mean come on we know what we are doing and we know what to do  in a situation but then rethink ourselfs because of what is supposed to be done

I dont see everyone saying to their baby just wait a sec and then rushing to look up the correct way to stop your baby from  choking

We immediatly sit them up and rub their back or lay them on their side and scoop out the sick
It is an immediate reaction that happens



We doubt our ability and instincts way too much

Yes, some people on here do listen to the guidelines and stick to them rigidly. And they think everyone who doesn't is a bad parent. It's silly really because as parents we should do what comes natural. We know what our baby needs more than any book. And if that "book" doesn't fit your baby's specific problem, what do these people do? I mean, how did our ancestors survive without these guidelines?

I agree. There is way to much recommendations out there. Honestly I found it the hardest part of being a new Mum. I had one group of people telling me to put my baby down to cry or else she would become spoilt. I had another group of people telling me to rock her to sleep and pick her up as fast as I can everytime she crys or she will have insecurity issues later in life. One group said if I didnt put her on a 3 hour feeding schedule she would be over feed while the other group said if I dont feed on demand she will be under feed. I was so freaken confused! It made me so depressed everytime I tryed things one way because I worried about the consequences that I may reep according to the other group of people.
Finally I stopped listning! I did things as I felt I should do them. I picked her up when I felt she needed me and let her cry when I could tell that she would soon settle back to sleep and i feed her when I felt she was hungry without looking at the clock. Now me and baby are both happy and finally I feel like I am doing a good job!. Mother definatly knows best because every baby is different. No book or expert can tell you how to best parent your baby. Only you can know that. 
And yes I find Y!A to be a very opinionated place when it comes to those rules. As long as we all love our babies and provide what they need then who cares if one mother chooses to feed to sleep and one mother prefers to cry it out. We all do what we feel is best for our children and we cant ask for more then that

I got given a few books when I was pregnant, I read them, but I'm not following anything to the letter.  I'm just going on what I want and if I need help i'll ask my mum.

i agree. even though i get told off by my post natal career i nurse my son to sleep. He falls asleep on the boob then i move him to his bed where he always wakes up when i put him down and tuck him in but he always falls asleep on his own after he is tucked in. For some reason i feel obliged to listen about solids, becuase i think surely there has been research done on this for them to press the issue so much? However things may change when my son gets older, he is only 2 months at the moment

I never listened to the "rules" aside from of course "Back to Sleep", carseat safety, etc.

I did co-sleep, however; swaddled way past 6 weeks (more like 6 months and 7 months), my twins are still on bottles at 15 and 1/2 months *hides head in shame*, I didn't make them stick to a solid schedule- and I still don't really.  We have a basic routine but I take things one day at a time and do things based upon when they're tired- hungry- etc.

I also rushed to my girls when they started to cry and I tiptoe when they're sleeping.  Why?  Because if I'm loud they wake up and if I don't rush to them when they start to cry then they wake up the OTHER one.  :-D

I did all kinds of stuff that's against "the rules" but my girls are happy and healthy so what more can I ask for?  :-D

How can i loose weight without it affecting my breast milk?



Hello mummy's
I put on 3 stone while pregnant and i have lost 2 but this last stone is impossible to loose every time i try to my milk seriously reduces for example this time yesterday morning i got 12oz out of my boob's (i express by the way and don't have any problems until i start losing this final stone) this morning i only got 7oz! this wk so far i have lost 2pounds so why does losing weight affect my milk i'm confused as I actually need to lose another 3 stone yet to be my ideal weight 
Ive not really cut my food down except for not eating the choccy bars cakes etc etc 
How can i lose weight successfully without it affecting my supply??

I've not heard of women having problems with breast milk because of loosing weight! However I've heard the opposite that breast feeding helps encourage weight loss! Are you doing anything else different besides trying to loose weight? Also it could be a mind thing! I'd get a hold of a lactation specialist that can help you with this. Maybe increase the amount of vitamins you are ingesting without going up in calories and fat! Also if your not drinking enough water during this weight loss then perhaps that is why you have alack of milk. Try increasing the amount of water and liquid you drink! Good luck!

Breastfeeding is supposed to help you lose the baby weight. I'd make sure that you aren't stressing out about breastfeeding your baby. This could reduce your milk supply. Make sure that you are giving your body enough liquids to keep yourself hydrated, and pump regularly if you can (I pump or feed him every 3 hours for my baby). Breastfeeding is based on supply-and-demand. The more you express or the more your baby feeds, the more milk your body will produce.



If you still are having troubles keeping your supply up.. see a lactation consultant. She will be able to help tremendously.



Here is a link that talks about increasing your supply.

Props to you for breastfeeding your baby! Good luck!

I asked a similar question a little while ago and no-one could understand my problem..,.. everyone just kept telling me that breastfeeding *helps* you lose weight. Well for me, it's like my body takes everything it needs first and whatever's left over goes into milk production...if there's not enough left over (if I haven't eaten enough or if I've done too much exercise) then my supply suffers...so I know exactly what you mean. You just need to take it slowly and not try to lose too much at once. When my daughter was born I said my goal was to get back to pre-preg weight by my SIL's wedding late november....It's less than 10 weeks away and I still have about 8 kilos to go :(
I don't think I will get there but have decided that since Lucy is 7 months and eating solids so well, I am going to take t slowly and aim to lose half a kilo a week (which is the recommendation anyways) and if it effects my supply too much then so be it...

Good luck...just know you're not alone!!

I went to my doctor about the same problem as this, I could not shift the final 4lbs! She said that it was probably just water retention as you reatain a little water whilst bf-ing. Dont forget the weight in your boobs too! Especially as you can express 12oz in a sitting! Fair play, most I ever managed was 1oz!

Only thing that worked for me (and agonisingly slowly) was to have a healthy balanced diet and take more exercise. You need the right food to produce milk rich in all the nutrients, so cutting calories isnt the way to go. Just up exercise!

I hope you lose that stone soon, and good luck!

Breastfeeding sheds those pounds fast if you are eating right and drinking lots of water!!  However, you wont be able to lose those extra pounds b/c  your body is retaining water and is storing some fat for the milk.  this is normal.  Im exercising right now like i was before i got pregnant and im breastfeeding.  I feel better and i feel like im getting more toned but the weight is not coming off.  Im not worried b/c i know my ody is retaining water and some fat.



You dont want to burn all the fat off while nursing and your body wont let you or it wil be harder if you are nursing.  Continue working out making sure you feed the baby an hour after your work out to preven lactic acid from gtting to the baby and try to pump or feed the baby before going to the gym. Drink tons of water...i mean tons!!  That fills you up, its good for the milk, and it prevents constipation. Your skin also looks better.  Eat right.  Do not diet!  Go ahead and splurge once in awhile. I do!  I refuse to diet and i cheat all the time but im exercising and i know whats im done breastfeeding, those extra pounds willc ome off easier.  I have have to admit that i also use formula or supplement for my baby.  My milk supply has gone down alot but im returning back to work next month.  My baby is turning two months next week.  I still breast feed her but only about 4 times day at most. The rest is with formula when im not home.



My stomach is still very flabby and needs alot of work.  Im doing alot of stomach exercises but i know it wont go away for a while.  It took me about two years to really feel like my old self after i had my first baby.  Now with my second, im so busy with my first one too that im lost my pregnancy weight faster jsut from running around being a mom.  I still have 12 pounds to go but that wont be gone until after im completely done nursing.

Go see her, take her some magazines or crossword puzzle books to help keep her mind occupied. Yes, you could look after the baby if she needs someone to and you could also go by her place to clean and catch her up on laundry or dishes. Right now the thing she needs most is love, understanding, and support. So, just be there for her!

Wow. I think I was actually one step away from that. I was hospitalized with Severe PPD because I didn't want anything to do with my baby and I was suicidal.



What you can do is look after her baby, call and just talk to her. You should call the hospital and check to see when visiting hours are. Chances are you CAN visit. I was allowed visitors. So was everyone else there.



Another thing, I know you have an infant but you can cook a couple of meals that can be easily frozen so she doesn't have to cook.

Does she have a husband or boyfriend? I'm gathering she doesn't from the way you are talking.



She probably will be put on meds which should help but it will take a few weeks at least for them to kick in. Also maybe if you have the time you can offer to clean her house. Well, maybe not her whole place but maybe just tidy up some? Call and talk to her. Tell her if she needs anything to call you.

I personally understand how hard it can be. I wish you all the luck. I hope she gets the help she needs.

She is in the best place she can be right now and her baby has to come second, just for the time being.



Postpartum psychosis is a very dangerous disease and needs to be treated carefully.

My cousin let hers go untreated, then threw herself off a cliff, leaving a few week old baby with no Mummy.



She in the the right place. Visit if they will let you and by all means care for her baby, but they should keep the child at the hospital with her.

are you eating enough in the day time?.. Try to have a snack and a glass of full fat milk before you put your little one in the bath. Sometimes stress and tiredness can hinder your milk supply.  So look after yourself! And also the hot towels thing is a good idea.

Yeah I agree with above ^^ a warm flannel helps the milk flow & so does massaging the breast with your knuckles from the outside working in prior to feeding, hopefully this will help. I'm not sure why it happens but it is perfectly normal xx

It's your "let down" sometimes it can take a while.  Maybe after her bath, you can pump, just until the let down happens (just until your milk starts to come out).  That way it's ready when she starts to nurse.  I found I had slow let down when feedings were close together.

Make sure you feed her before the bath, so that she isn't so hungry.

Also you can hand express a bit before you latch her on.

You also might consider that the bath before bed routine doesn't work for you, or maybe it just needs to be moved earlier or later.

14 and wanting a baby?



Hi. i'm on my mums account but who cares... ok so i'm 14 and i think i want a baby... i have the money over 3grand in my account because i've saved up since i was like 7 and got a good job as a avon delivery girl :} Don't mind the waking up in the nights. I hardly ever sleep because i want a baby so much :[ My dad bought me this reborn doll when i was 12 and it's cute but... no where near the same!! I've had experiences before and I'm good at looking after a baby ! :] Schooling wouldn't be a problem because me and my parents are already thinking about home schooling... so basically.... was just wandering what you guys think? Thanks! =]



And no nasty comments please...there are people alot younger than me with babies!



</question>



<additional details>



I have a job to get the money. And 3grand will get me all the baby needs like the cot, pram, etc. I'll still be doing school like I SAID. I'd live with my parents obviously. Untill i'm like 17 when i'll go rent somewhere. Not hard to work out.

Im 26 and as much as I love my daughter, i definately wouldnt have had her any earlier! I find it hard to cope sometimes and cant imagine how i would manage if i were any younger. Dont get me wrong though...there are many great young mummys. But definately not for me at all! I would advise you to wait until you were a bit older hunny.

well i guess it's your decision
but it's still illegal for you to sleep with someone yet
what do your parents think?
would you think about adopting?
even then i'm not sure if you'd legally be allowed to until you're at least sixteen
so i'd say wait another two years anyway
you might have changed your mind by then, and if not then you're free to do as you please
but are you sure you don't want another couple of years before you will have no time without a child to look after?
in the meantime, babysit and volunteer at creches, playschools or primary schools

Okay I'll just give you the figures and its your choice, 
A baby is $600 a month (I don't know how much your making teens average $320)
Women under 15 have a higher risk of birth defects
and theirs a stigma against teen pregnancy. I would wait untill you have a stable boyfriend and your parents agree.

3 grand is not enough. You might get a good start with that, but you'd be on benefits to keep you going, right? Pretty selfish seeing as us taxpayers work pretty hard to keep what money we get after being taxed so much. You won't have any time for schooling, home or otherwise as you'll have a baby to deal with.
Yes, there are people younger - but not much. Do you think they have much of a life? Or if they do, their parents certainly don't as they're the ones taking the baby.
It's not fair on your parents, not fair on the baby, not fair on the taxpayers, not fair on the baby's father, and long term, not fair on yourself.
Don't do it.

How about you grow up first.



Three grand!! Wow, you sound rich. (please note the sarcasm). 3 grand will probably last you for a year. So what are you going to do after that?



Give it up little girl.And that is exactly what you are a little girl. Go to school, get an education then think about having a family.



You are being selfish if you bring a baby into the world when you are not ready to become a responsible parent.



Source(s):



"I have a job to get the money. And 3grand will get me all the baby needs like the cot, pram, etc. I'll still be doing school like I SAID. I'd live with my parents obviously. Untill i'm like 17 when i'll go rent somewhere. Not hard to work out."

Oh ya, you have it all figured out. You should be set for life then. Oh little girl, you are naive, aren't you.



You have a job, wow, how much do they pay you? Min. wage? Ok, 3 grand will be all the baby equipment you'll need, but what are you going to do for diapers, formula, clothes, medical bills? How about life insurance. How are you going to pay for that on your min. wage job? How about when you can't go to work cause your baby is sick?



Are you planning on going back to work right after the baby is born? If not, you really think your going to get much for mat. leave ?  If they even give children mat leave.



There is only 24 hours in a day.  How are you going to do your schooling, work and take care of a baby in one day, each day? You'll be schooling and working so much that you won't have time to be with your baby.



So how is this fair to the baby? It isn't.

there are a lot of younger children with babies but 3000 is not enough to raise one!

wait a few more years until you are at least out of high school- you can't even drive to take the baby to the doctors or hospital if you need to

also, who do you think you will be having this baby with? you need to understand that the father has every right to be involved with the babies life- no matter what happens between you two

wait, please- just because young girls are having children, does not mean that it is easy

YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND WORK.... WHEN WILL YOU HAVE TIME TO SPEND WITH THE BABY???? YOU WILL HAVE A BABY THAT YOU WILL NOT SEE!

Premature baby trouble?



I am not Maisy but i am her mum and she asked me to check this out.
My daughter has had 4 premature babies and they were all healthy and came home after 2 weeks but she has just had her 5th child 4 days ago- (her first baby girl!) and the doctors said there is a 70% chance she wont survive but there has never been that problem with her other children and she was only earlier by 4 days. Why is there such a higher percentage on this baby is it because she is a girl (the baby?)

Why don't you just ask her doctor. But it could be for many reasons. Maybe there is something wrong with her heart or lungs. Or maybe she is smaller than the others. I don't think it has to do with her being a girl. Why has she has so many premature babies though?

I agree with what shelbi and nicole has said. Other than the simple prematurity, she might have some systemic defect.
Only 4 days premature shouldn't increase the mortality to 70%.
The chances of infection in premature babies are higher than the full term babies. 
You need to ask the treating doctor why they have said the chance of survival is very poor.

I think it depends on the baby, and how they developed. How early is she? Did your daughter get a steroid shot before she was born to help with her lungs? Did she get the shot with the other babies? The nicu nurses told me that girls do better than little boys. I would talk to the doc. Be there for your daughter give her all the support she needs so she can be strong for her darling little girl, trust in the doc.s, and pray.

How far along is she?  A few days can make a good bit of difference.

Preterm females have a higher survival rate.



Gestational age is not the only criteria for a healthy baby.  Lung development is a biggie.  Did she have any complications, like meconium at delivery?  Is her heart rate stable?  Does she require oxygen?  If so, at what percent?

It might be, and this is just a thought, that the doctor is emphasizing this because he/she thinks your daughter s not taking seriously the danger of preterm delivery.  He or she may think that because she's had five babies she should stop having children.  Doctors are only human and they have their own personal biases, in addition to the huge bias they bring as doctors in our current society.

I have had eight children, four of whom were preterm.  They have never figured out why they were preterm.  After my first preterm baby, the doctor told me I was stressing my body too much and my babies would be increasingly preterm until they could no longer survive.  He was wrong.  My last baby was born one day LATE.

The fact is, babies are created by God and each one has a purpose and extreme value to Him.  Trust God for the outcome He chooses best because He knows way better than doctors.  He can make the impossible possible.  I will pray that God fulfills His purposes in her life and that no weapons formed against her would prosper.  I pray that she has no complications.  Above all, I pray that God's peace, presence and power are with you.

Generally speaking premature boys do less well than girls.  However the birth weight can mean a lot more than the gestational age (which can be wrong).  There may also be other things wrong with her.

I strongly urge you, grandma, to help mom if mom feels she is not getting the information she needs to know what is going on with her baby.  Mom and Dad are the only ones who can and should make medical decisions for a baby, and they must make informed decisions.

If you can afford it, it can work wonders to have a lawyer drop by the hospital or draft a letter for the baby's file.  Also check the hospital to see if they have a patient advocate to assist, or request a social worker.  Help keep track of information for your daughter.  Obtain copies of the medical file for your daughter (you will likely have to pay per page) AND/OR request that mom or baby's primary physician be provided with copies of all records (this is supposed to be standard practice so that there is one place for all records the next time they are needed, and because the primary care physician should be more knowledgeable about ongoing medical problems)

Our son is colicy, he is 11 weeks old.  I was concerned with that too, but despite all the crying, he seems to be learning just fine... he has found his fists and has turned over a couple times.  I actually think that crying and kicking made him roll a couple times and it surprised him, lol.  So now it almost seems like he tries to do it.



This gets better and colic is usually gone by 3-4 months.  So don't worry.  That is not enough time to fall behind.
Hope this helped!!!  :)

Are you joking?

In my opinion, fussy babies are smarter then complacent babies and will astound you later.  Of course I am justifying my own sons, and me, and my sister ...  BUT my colicky now 2 year old does everything his 3.5 year old brother can do, he talks in full sentences, has imaginative play, can ride a tricycle, count to 3+ (not many 2 year olds can do this), recognizes most of the alphabet, recognizes his name and his brother's name (written), knows his colors, and has amazing comprehension, and that's all I can type right now!



Colic has nothing to do with intelligence or ability to learn.  It may have something to do with their temperament however.

It really depends how many weeks you are and how the midwife measured it. If it was measured by Ultrasound scan, it's pretty accurate (though not perfect)  and she's probably right that the baby hasn't grown, which could unfortunately be bad news.
If he/she measured the height of the top of your uterus with a tape measure, then the accuracy generally depends on the skill and experience of the person doing the measuring. This way is generally used as a tool to chart the progress of the pregnancy, and a lack of growth from one visit to the next might indicate a problem.

You haven't said how many weeks pregnant you are.....so if you're early on in the pregnancy and the baby isn't growing, the most likely outcome is that you will have a miscarriage. They are very common (about 1 in 5 pregnancies) and there's nothing to blame yourself for -it isn't anything you've done or not done, it's just nature's way. If you're more than 32 weeks and the baby isn't growing, it's possibly a problem with the placenta and doctors may try to induce the baby early.

It's understandable you're upset, but you need to know one way or the other as soon as possible, so why don't you ask your doctor/midwife for further tests? They will probably monitor you carefully anyway and another scan in a week or two's time will tell you more.

Good Luck... it isn't always bad news, I've seen unexpected things happen.

Why are people so hung up on the group of 7's mummys, but the dont bother about the JPA's in religion & ?



spirituality?

for those who dont know what 7's mummys are, from my understanding its a group of mummy who werent happy about not being included in private jokes by the other cool mummys so they formed their own group and all have 7's after their names. from what i have seen and read they dont seem to bully or be basty to people, so i dont see the problem.

anyone have any insight?

phantasm - im part of neither group, im on once in while, more so over the last few days as ive had a few days off and i just fail to see the uproar against these women, its not like they are ganging up to bully, they are answering questions seriously - they all have different views, but they are being tolerant to each other and saying well i wouldnt do it like that, but thats great if it works for you. i think this section is lacking that.

you have your typical meanie moms who answer questions solely to bash some of the time, i dont see evdience of this with in this group.



deborah - stupid people get nasty edits, im sure you know that already though as i know you have had many of them



TO CLEAR UP SINCE SOME PEOPLE CANT READ -

im not 7s, im not in with the in crowd, im not a meanie mom.

im ''idontliketherain'' formerly known as ''rokstarr''

my account was suspended due to too many violations in current events (my bad!) i have 1 child who is 4yrs old, so i came on pregnancy and parenting now and then when CE was boring me. i noticed the forming of these groups prob about 2 weeks ago, my account was suspended 1 week ago, i have now got a new account.



i posted this question merely to see why people were so bothered as ive seen at least 3-4 Q regarding this new little click.

Because from my observances,
I'm one of the only people who switches from R/S to NBB regularly, and I took off the JPA a while ago, only because I ran out of room and being a kosher ninja is fun :).
Secondly, JPA is meant to spread correct information and correct misinformation, and call out blatant liars and bigots. (actually ,so is the kosher ninja thing, so why be redundant, right?)
The other...This "7" thing, well I think it's just social, right?
One is a group of friends, the other is a group of friends with a purpose of informing. One to educate, for people with a strong particular knowledge, the other soley to 'chat' and keep in touch.



There's a difference in answering questions, and clearing up misinformation handed out to people simply because they don't speak Hebrew, or didn't have a good education or-sadly and commonly- choose ignorance. I can answer Q's here based largely on experience and some light reading. I answer Q's there based on years of education and an observant Jewish lifestyle. Realistically, someone could have just as much and just as valid of information on babies with a minimal education. Not so with the religious Q's that JPA tend to answer.



Source(s):



JPA- Jewish- Pagan Alliance (as to misinformation regarding both), now Jews, Pagans and Allies
There's an uproar over the '7' thing?

Why?

There are much better things to be in an uproar about in this world. If you want to be in an uproar, go fight the bigotry in R/S and the Israel section! Plenty to get in an uproar about there. 
But as for women being friends, who has a problem with THAT?

We are just here to help people out, by giving serious, or helpful information - and to block out the bully's who take it WAY to far on this site. It has nothing to do with "ganging up" on others.

Another thing.. If you aren't part of the 7's, then why are you trying to stick up for us, to other people? I really don't get why you would do that, but thanks a lot! And yes, we were created because we were sick of other people's private jokes, and honestly - the "7" itself was supposed to be private. But this is Y!A, there is nothing private about this forum.

You still might want to hold off on this until after the first year......I know yogurt with its live cultures seems to be okay from about 8 months on....but it's still dairy and they can still develop an allergy, so you may just want to hold back, or use Gerber graduates that are specifically tailored to a baby--they have some type of yogurt snacks available.

Yogurt and cheese are a bit special when it comes to these 2 foods being dairy products. While there is NO great magic in Yogurt or Cheese, the most common reasons for yogurt and cheese being ok for baby prior to age 1 year old are:

Unlike Whole Cow Milk beverage, your baby is not at risk of formula/breast milk being replaced by Yogurt or Cheese.



The medical community worries that if Whole Cow milk is introduced to an infant prior to 1 year old, that parents would stop formula and/or breastfeeding and use Milk as the replacement. This would possibly be dangerous to your baby's health! They, however, neglect to specify the difference between baby drinking milk and eating yogurt and/or cheese.



Lactose is broken down with the culturing of the yogurt or cheese and milk proteins are either semi-removed or limited. The culturing makes yogurt and cheese easier to digest. Many people with lactose intolerance often are be able to eat cheese and/or yogurt without trouble. The same is often true for some people with a milk protein (either to the casein or the whey) allergy.



As mentioned, the one "magical" quality that may be found in Yogurt is that studies show that even people who are lactose intolerant may be able to easily digest Yogurt. Lactose is already converted to lactic acid during the manufacture/culturing of yogurt and people with lactose intolerance (and even the milk protein allergy) often more easily digest it than other dairy products. This digestibility makes yogurt (and even cheese) "ok" for babies 8 months of age and older. Many pediatricians will say that yogurt is fine for babies 6 months of age as well.



Most pediatricians recommend starting your infant on Yogurt around 7-8 months of age. Some pediatricians also recommend yogurt as a great first food (from 6 months+).  Selecting a Whole Milk Yogurt is the most beneficial to your infant as babies need fats in their diets for proper growth!

You can buy Plain Whole Milk Yogurt made by such companies as Stonyfield Farm, Cascade Fresh and Brown Cow. You can also Make Your Own Homemade Yogurt! Stonyfield Farm makes the YoBaby brand that many parents know and love! However, using a large container of Plain Whole Milk yogurt will save you money (and save on added sugar) and give you the flexibility of adding your own flavorings to baby's yogurt. As regards yogurts marketed for for infants (between the ages of 8 months and 12 months old), the YoBaby brand does contain natural organic sugars.



The sugar content is less than in a brand such as Dannimals and it is natural and not refined or chemically processed sugar. There are no additives such as starches, fructose syrup, gelatin etc in the Stonyfield YoBaby brand either. You may be surprised to learn that all yogurts, even the Plain yogurts, will contain sugar. Sugar (lactose) occurs naturally in dairy products. This "dairy" sugar is not an additive and we feel that is an important distinction to make!



How Should I Serve Yogurt?

As long as baby has had the fruits/veggies that you wish to mix in with the Yogurt, you are unlimited in what you use. Some of our favorites are:



Yogurt with applesauce and a dash of cinnamon 
Yogurt and Blueberries 
Yogurt with peaches and bananas together (and separate) 
Yogurt with Wheat Germ and no other addition 
Yogurt and mashed avocado 
Yogurt blended with any fruit and water to create a baby-smoothie (using water makes for a thin mix that may slide through a Sippy Cup with ease) 
Yogurt mixed with veggies - sounds yucky to grown-ups but many babies love yogurt mixed with a veggie!
http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/tipYogu...

Cheese:
Providing there are no dairy allergies, babies can be introduced to cheese from a relatively young age, around eight months. Cheese can be cut into small pieces and eaten as a finger food or melted over vegetables, pasta or on bread.

Yogurt:
Yogurt can be introduced in the diet from eight months onwards, providing there are no dairy allergies. Yogurt is a good source of calcium and “friendly” bacteria that helps the digestion system do it’s job.



Yogurt is also a good source of the fats that are so mportant to a baby in it’s first years.



Yogurt is also a great way for baby to get the fat that is so highly needed during baby’s first year. Check the labels for additives, sugars and starches.

There is no one answer to your question.  Many experts suggest 9 months, some say 6, and a growing group say that the order that you introduce solids is not important as long as you wait until 6 months.

MILK VS. YOGURT FOR BABIES
"Hello Dr. Bob and Jim:
Why is it OK to give a 9 month old baby yogurt made with whole milk and NOT OK to give a 9 month old baby whole milk to drink?
Thank you for your response."

click here

The answer is that if you give an infant under a year cow’s milk, the infant can develop microscopic gastrointestinal bleeding (you don’t see it in the diaper), and this can lead to anemia and other problems. Yogurt does not cause this same reaction. Now: WHY does this happen? It seems to be the milk proteins that are responsible for this mild allergic reaction. In yogurt or infant formulas, the milk proteins are “de-natured” by heat in such a way that this allergic reaction does not happen.

Early introduction to different tastes is always a good plan to prevent finickiness. Feed your little one a touch of buttermilk, yogurt or kefir from time to time to familiarize them with the sour taste. Lacto-fermented roots, like sweet potato or taro, are another excellent food for babies to add at this time.1



http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...
Food allergy fears get some of the blame for the bland approach. For decades doctors have said the best way to prevent allergies is to limit infants to bland foods, avoiding seasonings, citrus, nuts and certain seafood.

But Butte's review found no evidence that children without family histories of food allergies benefit from this. Others suspect avoiding certain foods or eating bland diets actually could make allergies more likely. Some exposure might be a good thing.

3. Babies need to drink milk when the mother is not at home.

Not true. Three or four good nursings during a 24 hour period plus a variety of solid foods gives the baby all he needs nutritionally, and thus he does not need any other type of milk when you are at your outside job. Of course, solid foods can be mixed with expressed milk or other milk, but this is not necessary.

[...]

5. Babies need to drink milk to get calcium.

Not true. If you are worried about the baby’s intake of calcium, he can eat cheese or yogurt. There is no need to drink the calcium. Besides, if the baby is also breastfeeding, breastmilk still contains calcium.

Yogurt may be introduced as early as 7 months old, (the typical age recommendation is 8 months old) depending on your baby’s pediatrician and your baby’s propensity to allergies.
Cheeses are typically offered to the non-allergic baby between 8 and 10 months of age.  If your baby has a known or suspected dairy allergy (either a milk protein or lactose intolerance) then you should wait to introduce cheese and other dairy when your infant is older.

My girl wakes up at 6am every morning (bummer eh?) and I give her 6oz of milk and after about 2 hours she has her breakfast. Only give half a jar of baby food. At about 12 shes hungry again and I give her milk (6oz) again. Then at 2 or 3pm half a jar of babyfood. Then at 6 she gets the other jar and a wee bit of dessert. Then at 8pm after her bath she gets 8oz to fill her up until morning. Sometimes I have to feed her half of the last bottle at 10 or 11pm. Usually she's out cold and will drink it. Sometimes not.



Anyway - try not to worry about it too much. When the growth spurt hits at 5 and half months- My Evie is nearly 6 months and is eating like theres no tomorrow.



Its only a phase and try not to get caught up HV's. They always make us feel stupid, but we are not!
Edit- can i also point out that baby food jars say that you can feed a hungry baby from 4 months. My doctor also advised me to do as your doing- breakfast lunch and dinner. No harm says the doctor so i'm going with it and she's more healthy than other babies I've seen. Not a single day sick since she was born.

He's probably getting too full with  his solids.

Three meals and a couple of snacks is a HUGE amount of solid food for a 5 month old.  At this age he really shouldn't have any solids at all, and if you are going to offer them (6 months is the usual time to begin) one or two SMALL meals a day is more than ample.

I would just stop the solids for a couple of weeks. He'll be hungrier,and will take his formula. Then you can SLOWLY add solids back in.



(He needs at LEAST 24 ounces of formula a day, and most babies are taking in the 30-40 ounce range.)

Honestly, they don't recommend even giving solids until the infant is at least 6 months old.  Your choice.  If it was my child I would cut back on the solids and stay on the formula.

If he is wating solids now he won't be able to drink as much milk, before my baby  used to suckle for a half hour before bed and now only 10 min.  They still have some food in their tummy, no worries.  You should not give your baby a bottle of milk in bed, you should give him an once of bottled water and his milk while he is still awake.  It's better for theirs oral health!

Goodness me that's a lot of solid food at 5 months. I think if you start at 6 months and then only a couple of spoons a day till they are used to it, But I dont think you need to worry if it is only one feed that he is off...all babies are different as to what they drink anyway...as long as he is puting on a normal amount of weight,

At this stage, most of the nutrition still comes from breast milk or formula. The solids provide wonderful experience with flavors, textures, and the mechanics of eating. As the amount of solids they take increases, most babies settle into a pattern of 3 meals of solids each day. The amount of formula tends to drop off a bit, but typically still falls in the range of 6 to 8 ounce bottles given 3 to 5 times a day. Most commonly, a smaller bottle (or half a bottle) is given with each meal and a larger one at bedtime. Some babies also enjoy a bottle first thing in the morning.

A baby can have up to 32 ounces of formula per day. In addition, he can have as much in the way of solids, water, or juice as he wants to supplement this. The mealtime formula is usually given at the end of the meals, to top off the solids in a comfortable and easy way. Even though the solids are now playing a larger role, the breast milk or formula still provides the core of the nutritional needs. If a baby begins to regularly take less than about 20 ounces per day, you might want to offer the bottle first and then solids.

Hi, i think because u have started him 'earlier' than health profs recommend, hes getting the taste for food and doesn't want anything bland, and that what milk is to him. Maybe cut down on snacks and restrict what he eats later on in the eve, their tummies are still so tiny and snacks aren't a necessity at this age. Fairplay to you tho, to get them eating one meal aday at this age is an achievement

Yes. It is very rare, but it is possible. Two white parents can have a black child if both parents have a white dominant gene and a black recessive gene. Thus, if the child does not receive either parents dominant gene, it will be black. Two black parents can also have a white child.

I want to teach my 10 month old  to fall asleep on his own but everytime I leave him to cry it out, he vomits.?



I will go through the routine of feeding him his bottle, in my arms, rock him and sing to him, and i will put him in his crib, knowing he is tired and ready for a nap/bed and i will leave the room and he will cry. I try going back in 15 minute intervals to rub his back and shhh him and leave the room again. I have even tried staying in the room with him. But every time, he gets so worked up he vomits, then I have to take him out of his crib to clean up the mess which defeats the whole process. What shall I do?

Instead of rocking him and singing to him put him in his crib with a toy and some music. I got a great lulliby CD that plays 24/7 in my sons room it helps with the silence and when I put him in his crib I would often put a toy in with him that he can either play with till he falls asleep or when he gets up in the morning he will often play with it till he is ready to be out of his crib. about 30 min or so of extra sleep!

Honestly, and it sounds gross, but you need to leave him alone once you leave the room. It's not going to hurt him if he falls asleep one time in his vomit (my daughter did one time in her sleep and I never even knew until the morning) and you going back in there in intervals teaches him that you WILL come back as long as he keeps crying (called graduated extinction). After you lay him down, do NOT go back in there until he is asleep (total extinction). Don't worry about the mess; he'll be fine. Do this for a couple of nights. Sometimes it takes a week or longer and sometimes there will be relapses, but it works. I started sleep-training with my daughter at 2 months and she cries whenever I lay her down but is asleep within 5 minutes. I have also used the exact same lullaby CD since she was born, and she knows that when she hears that music, it's sleepy time. Works well when we're staying at motels and such, because as soon as she hears the songs she goes to sleep. I did however train her a little TOO well to sleep in her crib, as she won't sleep anywhere else, whether it be the car or her stroller. Oh well - you win some you lose some.

My son did this as well- he got so cranky he would either spew or bang his head against the side of the cot.
I constantly kept going into the room to clean him until one day i just left it. He DID spew all over his bedsheets but then fell asleep. I left him a full 5 minutes (because they need that to fully fall asleep) and went in and cleaned him up.
My line of thinking was that a bit of throw up on him isnt going to hurt him- sleep is more important- and i could clean him up more easily when he was asleep anyway!
It took a couple of times but he eventually got the message and wasnt upset anymore. 
You might also try propping him up a bit when you pop him into his cot as he might be thrwing up because he is lying down and getting upset- propping him up might make him throw up less.
I hope this helps

this is how i taught my girl without allowing her to cry it out.

dinner - 5.50pm

bath with lavender bubbles, then a massage and PJs - 6.10pm

in the night garden is on - 6.20pm - 6.50pm

we read a story and have some milk - 6.50pm

then she plays till she starts fussing, rubbing her eyes etc



when she does this, we pick up her fave toy - soft upsy daisy - say our night nights, kisses, cuddles, into cot with a dummy, and turn her lullaby light on.

i leave the room.

after 20sec, she whines realising im not in the room, i go back in tell her its ok, mummy is just in the other room, its bedtime etc then leave the room again. i continue to do this till she falls asleep.

1st night took 20min
2nd night took 15min
3rd night took 10min
4th night took 5min

thereafter when i leave the room i dont need to go back in anymore as she doesnt whine for me, she just cuddles upsy daisy and watches the lighty up stars on her lullaby light. i go in 10min after i put her down, and she is sound asleep.

What can I do to stop my four month old from crying when others nurse her.?



As soon as someone other than myself nurses my 4 month old baby she starts crying. This is only a recent thing and she never done it when she was younger. She is like this with absolutely everyone other than myself including her Aunt and Uncle who live with us and she is around all the time.



She also will not settle to sleep anywhere other then her cot...including her porta cot and pram.

Any help would be appreciated as I am a first time mum and am unsure about this sort of stuff.

Are you around when she's getting a bottle? That could be a problem, as she is old enough now to know that you have the "real thing" and smart enough to know that if she refuses the bottle enough, mommy will give in to feeding her. Have someone give her a bottle with you where she can't see her and even if she consistently refuses it, have them keep trying. She will eventually take it if she's really hungry. She's just old enough to play favorites and is proving it.

As for the sleeping, make sure the bedtime routines stay the same, no matter where she sleeps. Act like nothing is different. One thing that worked for my daughter is a lullaby CD. It's the same one she's heard since she was born and I only play it at sleep times. When she hears the music, she knows that it is time to sleep. Hope this helps.

I find that my son is more willing to go to someone else who has one of his toys and shows him first. He almost jumps out of my arms to get at the toy- and doesnt care whose got him.
To get him to sleep elsewhere- I had to train him to associate some item with sleep instead of a PLACE. So I bought him a little teddy and sprayed it with my perfume. Now when he gets his teddy and i hum a certain tune- he knows its sleepy time. t5his takes a while for them to learn but be consistent and you will be surprised how quickly they will pick it up.

When babys get a bit older, some starts to act that way. Are you around when someone holds her? Here's a trick that I do for my baby...
When she is a sleep, rap her in a babys balanket, then when the nurse holds her, she will be ok. Keep doing this until she gets use to of having people hold her

She may be the biggest troll of all in Newborn & Baby, should we all block and report her?



Im talkin about her.....
http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt...
Look, I may be new, but Im no fool. Think about it, shes been here longer than some of the regulars/Top Cons, why isnt she a TC? Maybe shes 2 busy switchin between account? Plus her answers are crappy too, just look at this.... http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...
...who would give such shitty answer thumb ups/votes if not herself? Shes always bragging that she knows the trolls multiple accounts, maybe because its herself? She sounds like a big attention wh0re.
Also shes been here for long time but she has no friends. Noone ever stood up for her or anything. Nobody gets personal with her, nobody knows who she is or where she lives. Is she US/UK/Canadian? Maybe she doesnt even have a baby.
Also shes playing safe, never insults or say mean ****. No real person can be that nice unless she has another accounts to say nasty things. I think shes WI-Mom, Mitchie 1, Mitchie 2, and all those mean trolls put together.
Im sure some of you already suspect her for a long time. I heard shes the traitor in the Momjeans group.
So all of the TC must be hating her.
And dont worry, you can admit whatever bad things you know about her bcos I blocked her so she cant see this question. So if she knows, it means one of you is her other account.
I think we should all block and report her so that we can stop all this drama in Newborn & Babby and live in peace.
Thumbs up for everyone who agree with me and block/reaport her, ten points if you can help proof this.
Good nite everyone.

There was a situation with another troll a few weeks ago that did similar things but one hundren times worse, she attacked another user on here, got blocked then came back again and again.
I found my self almost trolling the trolls!
I just ignore them and move on, i do beleive though that this forum has gotten very high school, i was being petty at a stage and thought to myself, 'no' i want this forum to be the way it was when i first started, mums supporting mums. and that is the way i have kept it for a while now.
I'm a TC because i have earned it, not because i have joined a group or 'click' and i don't have multiple abbounts to support myself.

So, my advice is, just move on and ignore them. they are trolls because they get a reaction, don't give them a reaction and they will fizzle away, like the troll that i was talking about at the start of this post.

good luck

I do not use "baby juice" because if you read the bottle it is just more expensive adult juice!  I make juice at home.  And yes, juice is bad for your childs oral health and you should give them a bottle of water after to rinse their mouth and wipe their mouth with a facecloth before bed!

My dentist calls apple juice "cavity juice" and we've avoided juice with our kids for the most part.  Juice is full of sugar, even "no sugar added" juice.  It is in no way a substitute for an actual piece of fruit.  I'm not a total no juice nazi or anything, but I would say my kids only have it about 3-4 times per year.

Hi there,

Yes you shouldnt give your child juice in the first year give him water only. But if you do want to give your child juice the best thing to give him is fresh juice give it to him one part juice to 10 parts of water. Thats is what my denist told me to give my son.

But only give it after a meal as it does not harm there teeth as much.

Good Luck hunni but i would take your dentist advice xx

I use it with my 7 month old son, but very rarely and I always dilute it down by half. He generally only drinks like an ounce of it at a time as he is still getting used to it. I have never heard of it causing tooth decay but it makes sense if it has acid in it. I give him grape juice only cuz I have heard its not good to give them apple juice just yet since its hard on there body anyways. If you are worried about it then you can always brush her gums with a very small and soft brissle tooth brush after she drinks the juice or else just give her water till her teeth come in. I am a very teeth concious person. I love my teeth and my smile and would never want to ruin it so I would do the same for my child. I am not worried about it at all and I wont stop giving it to him unless I am told otherwise. Its a decision that has to be up to you. Use your best judgement. You should also reasearch it online. I think that once the child is 6 months juice is fine to give them so long as it is diluted.

Your dentist is right.  With my son, (he is my first) I gave him juice from about 6 months on, and I even put him to bed with it sometimes.  ( I know now that is very very bad) When my son was 3, he had to get almost all of his back teeth capped, I think only 2 only needed fillings.  Thankfully, since I got it taken care of so early it didn't damage any of his adult teeth. He is now 10 and hasn't had a cavity since he had all of his work done.



My daughter is 4, and just had to have a few fillings, she never went to bed with juice, just milk a couple of times.

Yes, I have used it in the past.

When Em first started on vegetables, she was very constipated. She would cry and her bottom would bleed when she would finally go. Our pediatrician recommended 1 ounce 100% fruit juice mixed with 3 ounces of water, which I did, and it helped.

As for the concern about tooth decay, I use a small finger brush and baby gum cleaner every other day to clean her gums. When she has teeth I'll help her brush her teeth twice a day.



There are many warnings out there about the harm that comes from formula, juice, vaccinations, etc., but as parents, it is our job to do research and decide what to absorb and what to let pass through. I've decided that I'd rather clean her teeth more often than watch her scream and cry as she tried to poop.

It's all scare mongering. Everything in moderation. So that means yogurts are bad also because they have sugar. And also fruit has natural sugars which can cause tooth decay. Should we not feed our children fruit? If you was offering it all of the time and letting her sip on it constantly, i can well imagine she would have terrible teeth but from about 9 months old, a tiny amount of juice to mostly water (5% juice 95% water) with her meal can't hurt. Plus as soon as she has teeth you would be brushing twice a day anyway.

I am used to being very busy, working full time and doing a masters degree right up until I had my son 8 weeks ago.

Now he's here, life is totally different - obviously!

We go to a few groups/ baby massage etc, out for walks and things when the weather permits but I often find myself bored and at a loose end!

Money is tight (maternity pay!)



Anyone got any tips of cheap/ free things to do to occupy us both?

Anyone else feel the same?



</question>



<additional details>



My friends with babies are all living miles away so they are saved for whole day trips out.

My other friends are all at work.



Preferably things outside of the house - when we're at home he is bored (&grumpy) too and doesn't nap as well as he would if we were out.

Its mind numbing staring at the same four walls day in day out.

firstly, sleep when your baby sleeps.  You need to rest.  If you can't rest when you've just had a baby, when can you?  Enjoy your time while your baby us so small, he will get big very quickly and you will wonder where the time went.  All of a sudden he's 4 months and the new born stage is gone.  Get some magazines and relax while you can.  Buy a yoga DVD, continue with baby groups and strive to meet other mums to perhaps go for a coffee with or go for lunch once a month.  I know it's hard and frustrating.  I had my girls 13 months apart when I was 21 and 22.  I didn't know anyone and my husband was working morning noon and night for cr*p money.  We were skint, I was lonely and I didn't even have my mum because she was in Ireland and I was in England.  Then came the post natal depression.  Relax and think  of the great future all that study is going to provide for yo and your family in the future.  congratulation by the way!! xx

You must really have it together!  I was barely leaving the house when my son was 8 weeks old!  You could read to him or read your own books when he is napping.  Also try an online mommy message board.  You will probably find some common ground with people on there.  We go to the park, the library, walk around the mall, grocery shopping, and the apple orchard.  I also cook dinner for the family.



That takes up some time.  You could try and find a mom and baby exercise class.  It's difficult to find things that will entertain a baby when they are that young.

The weather has been really sh itty latey so I haven't left the house in a few days and I feel like i've got cabin fever ha!

I know how hard this is, as I too had a fabulous, busy job before my first child was born and I found it hard being at home with a baby.  My baby was very grizzly and colickly and we were both miserable!  My friends also worked at the time and the ones with children lived far away.  However, by the time my first daughter was six months old, we were having a great time!  First of all, I made sure I got out every day - whether it was going for a walk in the pram, going to the shops just to look around, having a coffee and reading a book at a coffee shop while she slept, that sort of thing.  I also left her at the local creche while I went swimming as the total cost was about AUD$6.00.  As my daughter got older, she became far more interactive, and I could take her to other different things such as Gymbaroo (started that at about 5 months I think) and Playgroup (started at 11 months).  There, I met other mothers and made new friends.  Do you go to a mothers' group with your local parenting nurse?  If there's anyone there you like the look of, invite them to the movies or to your house for a cuppa.  Do you have movie sessions where you live that you can go to with your baby, it eats up some time and gets you out of the house.  Also, accept babysitting offers whenever you can, just so you can go out and feel like a person again.  Time out for yourself, even if just for an hour to get your hair cut or to have a swim or a walk, is really important.  I found it hard the first few months, but after a while, I made a new routine at home and enjoyed it!

I think the average is around nine months, but it can start as early as seven and a half months.  To encourage crawling, put something your child wants just out of his reach.  Usually a favorite toy will work.  A friend of mine's baby would never crawl for toys, but at eight months old he would crawl for food.

The average is 8-9 months but some babies start at 6 months or as late as 14 months....some go straight to walking.

They'll do it when they're ready,  so there's not much to do to encourage.  Just be supportive when they try.

It really depends on the age of your infant.  My son is 8 months now and here are some activities I do with him:

Gross Motor:
*Sing "The Wheels on the Bus" and do action with him --In particular "the people on the bus go up & down" --I stand him up and put him down.
*Let him sit and play (develops balance & back muscles)
*Let him have tummy time (pre-crawling exercises and develops back & neck muscles)
*Hold his hands or waist and let him stand (Develop leg muscles and balance)
*Stand him up against the couch (for balance and leg strength)

Fine motor:
*Let him play with/eat cheerios or gerber graduates puffs (develops pincher grasp)
*Sing "Itsy Bisty Spider" with actions
*Sing "Patty Cake" with actions
*SIng "Head, Shoulders, Knees, & Toes" with actions
*Give him many shapes, sizes, and textures of toys to play with & explore while he is sitting or having tummy time (blocks, stuffed animals, measuring cups, balls, sippy cup, tummy time mat, etc, etc, etc)

Good luck & Have fun.
Also, don't forget to read to your baby!!  Babies looooove books

Breast milk amount dwindling?



I used to breastfeed by pumping and nursing and still am. The last couple days ago, I was really busy. Instead of pumping every 3 hours, I found out that if I pump only every time I feel engorged, I can produce so much more milk. So that's what I did.



Now I realize that somehow I don't feel that intense engorgement anymore. My breasts just produce bare enough of milk about twice or maybe three times a day (?) Sorry I was really really busy that I lost count. I don't normally really count anyway, just stick to the schedule to pump every 3 hours. I got panic so I try pumping again every 3 hours, nonetheless I produce very little amount of milk, about 1 ounce for 20 minutes of pumping, while normally I produce about 2 ounces. That last couple days ago when I pumped only every time I feel intense engorgement, I could produce up to 3 ounces.

I'm so worried, my son is 2 months old and I wish that I can feed him with breastmilk for at least 3 months, if not more.



What can I do? Keep pumping and hopefully the milk production will go back to normal? I've been drinking gallons of water, taking 9 capsules of fenugreek every day.



Any insights will be so appreciated.

try brewers yeast it is so grose but 100% works i have been breastfeeding for 19 mo now and went through this i tried pumping to up the supply but not much came out i took fenugreek capsuals even these other capsuals called lactation support pills found in health food stors still nothing worked then i bought brewers yeast wich is full of vitamns believe it or not. and i was literly over making again i was ful full full!!!! i warn u it taste nasty but whatever it takes right? people back in the day would ue this to up milk supply look it up but heres a hint the only way i could drink it was 2 scoops of it in a tall glass of oj that is the only way i could get it down really i GARENTEE it

Also the reason why u slowed down is because when u stopped puping 3x a day and u went to one ur breast thought u needed less milk therefore going down on ur supply! it supply and demand the more u pump the more u make what u did was a sure way to make less milk but no fear u can bring it back up continue to pump and feed the baby as many times as u can along with what i suggested! the reason y u were engorged was because u went down from pumping 3x to 1 at first ur breast thought thy needed all that milk so it took a day or 2 for them to see that u only were pumping 1x therefore tricking ur bereast into thinking they need to make less milk! Isnt it amazing how r bodies can figure that out. also i know by waiting till u were engored u were pumping more milk but the reason for this is u had already skipped 2 pumping sessions there for u were stocked up. ALWAYS REMEMBER SUPPLY AND DEMAND the more u emty the more u will couninue to fill back up keep drinking plenty of water as u are already! stopp stressing ur body also feels that and may cause u to go down on milk supply. TRUST ME U CAN GET IT BACK UP!!!!! my daughter has never had formula and i went through the same thing ur going through now

By only pumping when you were engorged, you made your mind think your son was needing less breastmilk than he really needs. To increase your milk supply again, pump AFTER he eats, so your mind realizes it needs to make more. It will take a couple days to a week for you to see a significant increase, but it will come. Whatever you do, DON'T supplement with formula, as this will decrease your milk supply even more. As for not getting as much out as you used to, its because you stopped pumping so much. Again, pump after (not before) he eats and even if you stop getting milk out, continue pumping for 10 more minutes. The suckling makes your mind realize it needs to make more breastmilk and will do so. Also, make sure to pump both sides equally, or you'll be like me, with a daughter that plays favorite on the right breast and hates the left so mommy doesn't care and now has lopsided boobs! Hope this helps.

Honey, I think i was in the same boat you are, about a month ago, when my baby was 2 months, my milk supply went waaaaaaay under. I didn't pump or anything, i was just feeding him every 3 hours, then I realized he was always hungry after each feeding, i freaked out, just like you did cuz I was also planning to breast feed for quite some time! My friend told me that it's normal, almost every mom experiences the low milk supply around 1.5- 3 months postpartum. I just kept feeding him and letting him suck longer then usual and now, he gets enough milk!

But when I'm really active or busy doing something active, my milk supply will go down because it's wasting energy on doing something else then producing milk. I've noticed that in mylself.

Hope this was helpful. Good luck and Congrats on the baby!

WHAT? I have never heard of anyone saying the father should go home after the birth. My husband was told that the couch folds out into a bed for him to sleep in the moment we got the hospital. I don't know where your from or who is telling you that the dad does not need to be there but thats ridiculous. My husband was there from beginning to end minus a few times that he ran to get food or to the store. Tell people to mind there own business and what you feel is right.

for me personally Id have loved it but I can see the other point -  not everyone has a man, also every patient in the hospital had the right to privacy, I wouldnt fancy, sleeping in a ward say with 4 beds (as was the set up when I had my son 7 months ago) with another 3 strange men in the room

Edit: I am referring to after the baby is born, of course dads would be there all through the birth and for some time afterwards!

i have never heard of a rule or anyone against it.
some dads can't because there are older children to take care of or they have to work.  you must realize that father's can't care for the health of mom and baby like a nurse can.  they don't have the training/skills.  you might want both.

I think it is a matter of bed space, privacy and liability.

Most mothers share a room - and unless you're willing to pay the price of a private room, freeing up the other bed, you're going to run into issues with women who don't feel comfortable with a man not their husband, doctor or nurse in the room,

The liability is on the hospital - if they let an untrained husband do something rather than a trained nurse, something bad could potentially happen.

there are birthing centers, and birthing centers in some hospitals that do allow that- you'd have to look about and see if there were any in your area.

My husband was there all through the birth, and afterward, but first time, I sent him home to care for the dog and to get some sleep since he had to work the next day, and the second time, he had our toddler to take care of.

I have never really heard of that. I mean sure, sometimes new dad's are pretty annoying when in the labor/delivery room because they are all nervous but it's adorable too because they mean well. But they don't try to kick them out or ask them to leave. The partner should always be included in the birth of a baby unless they don't want to be there.

yes I think it would be good for them to be able to stay, but dont forget that will bring lots of issues up like the following.

hospitals with communal rooms! out local hospital has 4 beds in one room, this could make some women feel un easy with other womens husbands/men in the same room! plus then all men will need vetting what if they have a criminal history ie. abuse/aggression/sexual assault, 
women who have just given birth i would think would feel very uneasy and open to victimisation and abuse, plus some women could make threats/claims against the men staying!.  and what about women who have been abused??

when your walking around in your nighty after giving birth feeling lie crap the last you want to do is bump into a strange bloke!

I think you should have the choice for your bloke to stay over, but hospitals need to have separatete rooms for this to happen.

Every hospital should give dads the right to stay in the hospital as they all pay tax. If it wasn't for the father they would be there.
I wouldn't mind sleeping against the wall as I understand that its not me that needs the attention, but every dad has the right to there baby, the same as the mother.
If anyone tried to tell me to leave the hospital with my baby, I would kick off, big time. Its our baby (mine and partners) so we should both be there. I also think its disgusting when dads are not there, but sometimes mums don't want them there which is terrible, its not up to the mum, they should both be there no matter what.

my goodness, we are paying out of pocket for a private room just so my husband can stay with me the entire time I'm in the hospital.  I've never heard of women not wanting their husbands there, but I do know hospitals that don't allow husbands to stay overnight and this is specifically because most of their rooms are not private and for privacy reasons for the other patient, they do not allow males to stay past visiting hours.

some do, some dont. My daughter would not sleep without sucking on something, after 2 days of her sucking on my nipple for comfort I gave in an gave her a dummy (pacifier)  To be honest if she has to suck something I would rather it be a dummy that i can throw away than a thumb . If a baby is not interested in sucking tho , I wouldnt give a dummy as it is hard to break the habit (not as hard as a thumb tho !)  Hope this answers your question :)

True If she has to suck - She can have a pacifier - Its much better than a thumb or fingers!

it depends on the baby; my son didn't take one unless he was hungry;so if we were out somewhere, and he was due for a feed and i couldn't get him the food right then and there id give him his dummy and he'd be fine... nw he has it quite a lot as he is only 3 months and teething and its the only thin he'll suck on... but its so much easier to throw away,,, whereas if they want to suck something they will suck their fingers which can cause so many more problems...

They do not NEED pacifiers, but if you with to help soothe them or calm them down from time to time, they can be so very handy. They say breastfed babies should not get them too often because it could hinder their sucking at the breast and give them another "option." Once latching is established and milk supply is good then it is no problem if you ask me. My daughter gets one when we are in the car and I can't feed her or she is just angry, or when we are trying to get her to sleep.

Babies have an overwhelming need to suck. even when they are not feeding so it will come in handy! Some parents just prefer not to use them. I was the loony kid who wouldn't give it up 'til about 4yoa :\

I don't give my baby a pacifier, but she sucks on her fingers. so that's up to the parent. I don't give her one because the tell u if your breast feeding, you shouldn't give the baby a pacifier because you don't want to confuse them. So that's mostly up to you.

They don't NEED them as such but most babies have a strong urge to suck and a paci meets that urge when a mother's breast cannot for whatever reason.
My daughter was about 6 weeks when I introduced one as she would be on the breast for about 4 hours straight every evening and I was exhausted. She wasn't drinking at this time just comfort sucking but as soon as I took her off she would scream. I still put her on the breast every half an hour so that if she was hungry she could eat but generally she just fell straight asleep.

Most babies from 0 to 3 months have a strong sucking reflex and want to suck for comfort. Some babies more than others. A few don't like pacifiers.

My little one is 7 weeks and I introduced a pacifier when she was 4 weeks as breastfeeding was well established by then and she wouldnt get confused with the latching on. Till then I had felt like a human pacifier as she wanted to suck all day!

Some days she takes it, other days she spits it out after screwing up her face.

After 3 months of age a pacifier just becomes a habit since they lose their sucking reflex then anyway. I am planning to wean her off it after she is 3 months.

My daughter who is one year old today didn't take to a pacifier or a bottle of breast milk. Personally, I'm pleased. I wasn't crazy about the thought of her having something artificial. I guess she's her mother's daughter. When she was younge, she did take to sucking my pinkie. Eventually, she started to suck her own fingers, which she also out grew.



Personally, I didn't mind my daughter comfort sucking on my nipples. (Well, when I was hungry or had to go to the bathroom and my husband wasn't home, it wasn't so good. I got into the habit of keeping granola bars and dried cerealy and dried fruit on the sofa and would fill my water bottle before sitting down if I had to, even if she had to wait a couple more minutes.) I would think it would be more comforting for a baby to be curled up next to his or her mother sucking her breast than some fake rubber thing.



Recently, I saw a girl who looked to be about three with a pacifier in her mouth. It just seemed too old for something like that and I was just thankful that my daughter didn't take to one.

Nope.  In fact, allowing a baby to use a pacifier in the early weeks when they are learning to breastfeed can lead to nursing difficulties (there's a different technique for sucking at the breast and sucking on an artificial nipple).  If you allow a young baby free access to the breast, there is usually no need for pacifiers.  Sometimes it is useful to try one in the car if your baby doesn't like to be in her carseat, though!

I am taking my 10 month old baby to Dubai next week and very stressed and worried about this!
For one thing, it is a 12-hour flight not including the one stop! Secondly I have NEVER travelled with my baby on a plane, not even a long distance journey in car.
Shes at the stage where she is very curious & active so how would I be able to control/calm her on a long flight? 
Also, what should I be aware of in an Arab country in terms of diseases or sanitation.?
Any tips or advice from people who've had experience would be wonderful! Thankyou!

Ahh you know when i took mine on a long flight she slept almost all of the way, just had to change her in the bathrooms or feed her. Ask when you check in to get a cot, its really handy, plus you get more leg room. Make sure you take enough food and water and keep it all handy in a little bag. .
Maybe take her a little toy, even one of them ones she can chew on, maybe the tv screen will distract her a little, but the motion of  the flight should keep her calm. The only big worry is there ears popping, so if you can time it well just after you take off feed the baby to help prevent that or let them such on a pacifier if they have one. As for diseases you should have been told by your doctor if the baby needs shots. Just stay away from there water, make sure you sterilize it. If your baby is eating baby food you may want to see about taking what she is used to. if not im sure there is somewhere out there that you can get some american food. A change in diet can cause the baby to have the shits hehe. Well i hope all goes well and have a great trip.

It will be hard, but take plenty of food and formula for your baby, toys, his favourity blanket if they have any. Change of clothes or a couple as may have accidents. Also when you check in you could ask if there are any free seats and possibly move if you smile nicely at the trolley dollies as we found that it was fab hainvg that extra seat as he could lie down.....good luck..ps calpol is also good if they are teething but it also makes them sleepy.......I HAVE BEEN TO DUBAI IT IS VERY CLEAN SO DONT WORRY ABOUT DISEASE,

Don't get stressed out. I took my 8 month old son to Asia on a 13 hour flight with a stopover and then another 2 hour flight! Trust me - no stopovers is the way to go. Pack a variety of her favourite food and toys. Don't give them to her all at once - let her play until she's bored, take the next toy/food out. My son was busy wiht the hook button and the drop down tray button so that was another plus. Looking out the window and sliding the cover up and down was another great form of distraction. It drove me insane but it was great for him. Also bring her favourite toy that she brings to bed should she sleep on the plane. Bring a spare top for yourself in case of spit ups etc.

take lots of activities on the plane for your little one. allow him to explore and more around sometimes as it can be fustrating stuck in a seat for too long.

take steriliser tablets with you and lots of wipes etc for cleaning hands before your little one eats. Avoid salads, ice, water thats not from a bottle, undercooked foods in general.  make sure you are happy in the place you are eating (does it look clean etc) in general the same rules that apply when going to any country. i live in egypt and never have an upset stomach even though im quite sensitive because im careful about what i eat and where i eat.  Suncream and a sun hat for your little one is essential and be wary of taxi drivers.  dubai i wonderful though you will have a lovely time.

usually around 2 weeks, but it can fall off as soon as a week. my 1st born it fell off at 8 days, my 2nd born it fell off 2 weeks 2 days. 
they had different peditricians, my 1st born told me to clean it with alcohol everyday, the 2nd told me not to. so I think the alcohol probably dries it up quicker.

my daughter's fell off at 7 days - per the doctor and hospital staff, we didn't put anything on it.  My nephew's fell off in 4 days - my sister's pediatrician told her to sprinkle goldenseal powder on it to dry it out.  It can take up to 3 weeks though - if it hasn't fallen off by then you should talk to your pediatrician.

QUESTION ABOUT BABY FEEDING BOTTLES, ANYONE HELP?



my son is 32 week, and i would say for the past 5 days or so, when i am giving him a feed from a bottle, he is drinking it, and the teat collapses continually

Is this because its too slow for him? Or too fast flowing??
i have not noticed any difference when breast feeding, but saying that i'm kinda nonsensitive in that area lol.

Its because he's sucking so hard that its making it collapse.  I suggest getting a nipple with a faster flow, so that he won't have to suck so hard to get the milk.

It depends on the brand of bottles you are using but the ring is probably screwed on too tight. They make nipples with ridges on the inside to prevent collapse you could try those. Good luck.

Once the teat starts collapsing you need to move up to a faster flow teat. I personally think that the best teats are avent ones although they are extremely expensive. I have also found that for some reason the teats on standard neck bottles do not seem to collapse.

How long is it ok to let them 'cry it out' ?



My baby is 6 months old and no matter how hard I try I cannot get him to bed any earlier then 1:30 AM. He can be so tired and still fight it until at least that time. I didn't believe in the cry it out method, but thinking its time to try it, as much as it breaks my heart. Last night I gave him a bath, read him a book, put on lullaby's. He was so tired fell asleep at 9:30 PM. Woke up at 10 pm and started crying. Cried until 12 am. Finally I couldn't take it anymore, and went and picked him up. It was breaking my heart!

Short answer, take your child to the Doctor.  A 6 month old child should be able to sleep longer than 30 minutes that late at night.  He might be allergic to something that is causing him discomfort.  It could be nothing.  But, when someone has no language skills beyond crying, like children, the best bet is a translator, i.e. Doctor.



Several of our children could not sleep well at night if they were over stimulated during the day.  Maybe you could reduce the amount of noise, activity, many people handling them, etc., and see if that helps!  Quite a few of our family and friends got really mad at us, because we did not allow our small ones to be passed around at gatherings.  So, my stock answer became, do you want to come home with us and sit up with our baby all night?  Because he will be up all night otherwise....

I also do not agree with letting babies crying it out.



Good luck!

is he always like this? if not he could be teething or sickening for something, so leaving him for 2 hours to cry, isnt something id advise.

get a good solid routine, dont ever deviate from it, if it mean you need to stay in all week to get him into the pattern then so be it. this is my routine.



this is how i taught my girl without allowing her to cry it out.

dinner - 5.50pm

bath with lavender bubbles, then a massage and PJs - 6.10pm

in the night garden is on - 6.20pm - 6.50pm

we read a story and have some milk - 6.50pm

then she plays till she starts fussing, rubbing her eyes etc



when she does this, we pick up her fave toy - soft upsy daisy - say our night nights, kisses, cuddles, into cot with a dummy, and turn her lullaby light on.

i leave the room.

after 20sec, she whines realising im not in the room, i go back in tell her its ok, mummy is just in the other room, its bedtime etc then leave the room again. i continue to do this till she falls asleep.

1st night took 20min
2nd night took 15min
3rd night took 10min
4th night took 5min

thereafter when i leave the room i dont need to go back in anymore as she doesnt whine for me, she just cuddles upsy daisy and watches the lighty up stars on her lullaby light. i go in 10min after i put her down, and she is sound asleep.



the lavender bubbles and massage relaxes her to the point where she is tired but doesnt want to sleep because she wants to play, so i let her play till she is literally ready to fall down.



how many naps does he take a day, maybe try to work toward taking his last nap away, or shortening it. my girl naps for 1hr in the afternoon. she sleeps 12hrs straight at night, waking but self soothing in between.

Breastfeeding and supplementing? ?



My baby is 18 days old, and i breast feed exclusively, but she eats every two hours for an hour or more. My question is, is this normal?

Your baby is trying to build up the milk supply that is why she is feeding so frequently.

Make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids to help build up your supply.

Are you sure she is really feeding for the entire hour or is she just suckling for comfort?

I think  a good 10 minutes each side should do, burp her and then if she wants more give her some more.

Talk to your lactation consultant or peditracian. Also, have you tried pumping and giving your milk to baby in a bottle. This is good for 2 reasons...if your baby is having trouble getting it out of your breast and someone else can feed the baby while you get much needed rest. Formula will not 'hurt' your baby however breast milk is best and you should discuss this with the baby's doctor. Good luck and much rest!

She is just trying to build up your milk supply, but she could also be sucking for comfort rather than still feeding.  try breaking her off gently and burping her then if she is still hungry give her more.  Supplementing, especially so early, is not a good path to go down as it will affect your milk supply and there is no guarantee it will make her sleep longer - it could just give her a poorly tummy as she's used to breastmilk meaning she might not sleep very much at all!  You're doing a great thing by breastfeeding, perservere and it gets so much easier.

Most babies (now this is only my personal knowledge) after 3 weeks so a vast difference in the amount they feed. They start taking more in each feed and becoming more adept at taking more in more quickly.
I breastfed my 10 pound 11 baby for 1 week, but soon realised that I was having to constantly feed him as I was not producing enough milk to sustain him so i switched to bottled formula. 
He is 6 weeks now and feed approx every 3 hours during the day and sleeps from 930pm to 630 am each night. 
Formula is harder to digest so your baby stays fuller for longer. 
I use S26 GOLD.
When you give your baby a bottle of formula instead of breastfeeding it is called supplementing- you do this when you stop producing enough milk or when you are trying to wean your baby off the breast.
I dont believe that there is medically any reason not to supplement or to completely wean your baby off breast milk if you are tired and not enjoying the feeding routine. 
Rory is one of the healthiest, happiest and most settled companionable babies and he has been bottle-fed as I said from 1 week old.

giving formula at night makes some babies sleep longer, others it can upset their stomach and make them stay up all night. Personally I never saw a difference.

Is your baby actually eating for that whole hour? or is she latched on just using you for comfort? I recommend having a look at www.drjacknewman.com for the videos and articles about telling whether your baby is actually eating or just soothing herself. Do NOT give a pacifier though if you are breastfeeding as it can detract from the bf-ing. I hate the things anyway though.

A newborn feeding every two hours is (exhausting though it may be) completely normal. It will get better though as she takes in more and will sleep longer between feeds.

Keep it up and try not to give formula........some breastfed babies ESPECIALLY ones so young, if given a bottle will refuse the breast after. A bottle is much easier and faster than getting milk from the breast, so it can put the baby off. If you do use a bottle in the end, go for the Tommee Tippee ones as they are closest to the breast shape in their teats.

HTH!

Yep, totally normal for her age, in fact every 2 hours would've been a blessing for me. My 10 month old was eating every 1/2 hour to an hour until she reached a month old. Are you positive that she is eating the entire hour and not just comfort sucking? The easy way to tell with a newborn is to watch her jaw. If it's moving up and down, you know she's actively eating. If it's not, she is using you as a pacifier. Take her off, and even if she starts trying to eat again, wait and see what she does. If she's done, she won't cry for more. The norm at this age is every 2 hours, 20 minutes on each side.

If you supplement, your baby will probably sleep longer, but it will mess up your milk supply as it's trying to regulate itself to your baby's needs. If it misses a couple feedings because you gave your baby a bottle, it will think your baby needs less than it really does because you aren't exclusively feeding.

Sounds like you are doing awesome. I'd just watch your daughter to make sure she isn't comfort sucking and don't worry about giving her a pacifier. I freaked out about it because I thought it would give my daughter nipple confusion but my husband stuck one in her mouth at 2 weeks because we couldn't get her to stop crying and she was never confused. Soothie brand pacifiers are the best for breastfed babies. Also, if you need a good bottle that won't cause confusion, get the First Years Breastflow bottle, exclusively at babiesrus.com and their stores. My husband gave pumped breastmilk to my daugher at 3 weeks to help out and she never even knew the difference. No problem with a soft spout sippy cup later on either.

Hope this helps and hang in there. It DOES get easier.

Uh...... a little to young for a pet, as it means you'll have another totally dependent on you being to take care of. However, I'd recommend a cat. We have one (had it before she was born) and he tolerates her very well and sometimes nuzzles up to her. Our dog just runs the other way (doesn't liked to be touched by her because she doesn't know how to be gentle yet) but the cat doesn't care when she tries to eat his tail and such. I wouldn't get a kitten though, as it will go through teeting and use your daughter as a teether. Hope to help.

Cats are brilliant pets because they can be your friend, but they clean, toilet train and exercise themselves. You've got enough to handle right now without cleaning up after a puppy, so I wouldn't go there. Birds are pretty but noisy and often don't keep kids interested for long. Plus, your little boy's too small to appreciate it much yet. I'd go for a cat personally. But toddlers and small children often torment kittens a lot, so if you were going to get a cat, either do it now so that by the time he can chase it around it's old enough to be able to get away, or get it once he's a few years old and can understand the concept of being gentle.
Hope this helps.

Splitting, access and maintenance?



You may have read some of my previous questions.  It's looking like my husband and I are pretty much definitely going to split.  We're both miserable, disagree about everything and I don't want it to affect our one year old.  The first thing he talks of when I say I will leave if he doesn't stop shouting and being agressive in front of her is that he will call solicitors then, regarding access.  I have not a penny to my name, and am worried that because he has money he will get things his way and I won't get listened to.  How much access is he entitled to?  It's likely he will move 2-3 hours drive away and he is saying he wants her every weekend and 2-3 nights a week and that I will have to pay for a train to pick her up each morning (I don't drive) while he goes to work.  At the moment, he never really cares for her and they don't have much of a bond and I think going from nothing to that much access is a big leap for her to get used to.



He earns a salary of £30,000 per year which the CSA calculator says means he has to give between £60-70 a week towards his daughter, but he also gets £450 a month in lodge money which he doesn't actually use for that- he spends it on going out,  and is going to be getting £1000 per month plus in private earnings from next year, yet he says he cannot afford to pay that much maintenance.  The CSA won't know about the lodging money or private money, but he is saying he will say he cannot afford to pay that much when clearly he more than can afford to.  He says he will never ever talk to me again, even regarding our daughter.  How can we resolve this?  I don't know why he won't be civil but it seems our poor daughter is going to be stuck in the middle if I stay or go.

Well I am not sure exactly how things work in England but let me answer your question based on my personal experiences here in America. I'm sure things don't differ too much. First of all no court will take a child away from her mother unless there is ample proof of some sort of abuse or neglect. Second, seeing as how your daughter is very young, you should be able to present a good case that your ex should only have visitation on the weekends especially since he works during the week and won't be able to care for her then anyways. As far as child support, he should have to provide the court with proof of income and proof of expenses. This would include any subsidies that he receives, like his housing allotment. As long as he makes more money than you do he will have to pay child support. Also he won't be able to just say that he can't afford the court set amount. He would have to provide documentation that he can't afford it and from the sound of it that wont work. I would suggest contacting your local family court and finding out if they have any sort of legal aid for women looking to get out of a bad marriage or if they have legal aid for low income persons. This way you could have an attorney as well. Also it would look better if you were the one to file the divorce, access and support papers. Good Luck you and your daughter are in my thoughts.

Firstly you almost certainly will receive legal aid, so see a solicitor soon.  You will have to come to a more mutually beneficial solution regarding your child.  Try as hard as you can on your part to make it easy for the father to see her, but he must make the effort to travel - if he cares he will, if not he won't.

It looks like you won't be able to avoid the CSA - they truly are horrendous - but while I'm not going to discuss my salary, I pay more than £70 a week and I don't earn £30,000 - so you might be better off than you think.

FEAR is a great tool for the bully,most of what he is talking is bollox.The money he gives "maintanance" is taken by the CSA It won't matter what he says it's recovered on behalf of the Government like TAX.They can take his driving licence,passport and put him in prison.As for the baby the chances of him getting custody are the slimmest of slim.The tax man will find out his earnings look at his bank account and he won't even know.You have the power he's scared

Just checking you're the same person i have in mind - you're the one who's husband kept 'accidentaly' locking you at home and doesn't give you any money towards housekeeping etc? Am i right?
Either way, your hubby is a bully and the best way to deal with a bully is to call his bluff. He can't refuse you money - he HAS to pay a fair amount by law. He can't take your daughter away, and who cares if he doesnt talk to you again? He's a prat anyway.
Tell him if he doesn't agree to a fair amount of maintenence you may 'accidentaly' inform Inland Revenue about his private earnings and lodgings (which are taxable), which would then guarantee you a higher amount through the CSA anyway. He won't get all that access to her and you won't have to pay all her travelling costs - he's full of BS, believe me.
You will be entitled to Legal Aid, so contact your local Citizen's Advice Bureau and speak to them about your next step.
Good luck, you will be far better off in the long run! And your daughter too. That man is a bully.

This sounds so fmiliar to my situation.....
My boyfriend and I argued all the time when our son was born (he is 6 mos). 
We both sat down and discussed it and agreed to make it work for Jack's sake. We are slowly getting back to how we were. 
When we were arguing all the time we would both say that's it it's over and he would threaten me with the courts too. He also would have moved miles away to be with his family.
He also isn't as close to our son as I am because I look after him 24/7 - he doesn't know his routines, and all the little things. 
I always said if he really cares about Jack then he should let him live with me as its for the best. 
I personally think its just a threat and if crunch came to crunch he wouldnt do those things. He is just saying it to hurt you.
Im sure once all the dust has settled maybe you will both get along better as friends.
Good Luck

Firstly can i say i feel for you, its a horrible time for anyone when a relationship breaks down and 1000 times worse when you have a child or children involved. You try to think with your head but as a mother your heart kicks in first.
You have to do whats right for you and your daughter. Seek legal advice because if he leaves, you are not financially supported and will get legal aid. If he has been a hands on dad with the upbringing of your daughter then i would encourage this, but he also has to respect you and whats best for her, which isn't necessarily whats best for him. If he has to go to work how will he get to work on time by having your daughter in the week?
He is being unreasonable by saying he will never talk to you about her because he should put her first ahead of himself and there maybe issues with you and him but should never affect the child's welfare. My ex husband was very bitter that i left him and i put my kids first, shame he didn't. He tried to all sorts to make me out to be a bad mother and never once thought how it may affect his children.
I hope things work out for you

Yes, we do it nightly as part of his bedtime routine. He absolutely loves kicking his little legs and splashing the water. It is also the one thing that can calm him down if he's getting fussy. Last night nothing would work(not me holding him, not daddy, his swing, bouncer, etc.) but the minute we put him in the tub he quieted right down and begin happily splashing around.

ETA: It is absolutely fine that you give your son a bath nightly. As long as you put a good lotion on him afterwards his skin shouldn't dry out.

My doctor to me that babies being that young, they dont really get dirty so its not nessarcay to wash them every day, but every other day is best to do until they are old enough to get themselves dirty.
Also If they do something like pee on themselves feel free to wash.
My doctor also said that if they seem not to be settling down at all for whatever reason, if you give them a luke warm bath, with bed time soap for babies, it can settle them down and help you get them to sleep at night.
My doctor also told me just to wash their hands and feet every day, with a wipe at least.

If he loves his bath, feel free to make it part of your daily routine. If he doesn't love it, it isn't necessary to bathe him daily. As long as you are changing his diaper regularly and cleaning his diaper area after poops (I don't recommend using prepared wipes that contain alcohol, soap, or perfumes), and spot cleaning after spit-ups, he shouldn't need to be bathed more often than every three or four days. Longer is okay for some babies -- if he starts to smell you will know it's time for a bath! If your baby's skin is drying out too much you will want to cut back on the frequency of baths and apply an alcohol-free, unscented baby lotion daily -- and especially after each bath.

I don't. In the summer we bathe Em every other night and in the winter every third night. Mainly because she has eczema and the soap and lotion (even the most gentle kinds) tend to irritate her skin. I know at some point, once she is self feeding, it will need to be an everyday thing, but I'm hoping by then her skin will be less sensitive!

I dont give  afull bath every day.  I dont bathe more than every 2 days.  usually every 3-4 days for a full bath.  I clean her bottom area thoroughly at every change, and do a quick butt bath after every poop :)

if you give a full bath every day you risk upsetting the natural skin oils balance and cause overproduction of those oils OR drying out the skin.  if you want to give him abath every day give a water only bath every other day and soap on the alternate days.

ETA using lotion also upsets the natural balance of oil production.

I know advice is that you shouldn't as they aren't dirty and it can dry their skin out but our little man loves his bath - has from day one and we find he settles and sleeps much better if we bath him, give him a massage ( I go to a baby massage group with him & he loves it) swaddle him, feed him and put him down.

Her sleeps for a good 5 hours that way meaning I only have to do one night feed :)

ETA:

we used a dribble of sensitive baby bath only and massage his skin with pure olive oil - he doesn't have dry skin at all, its beautifully soft.

Yes I do. My daughter is 5 months old and she has never missed a night. It's part of her routine. She has a 4 yr old brother so he needs to be bathed every night so we do her also. She will miss her 1st night tomorrow though cos were going to my brothers wedding.

I know how much I worried about my son {and still do} and that he would die in his sleep. I would look up everything I could on the subject and I just came across this article. It's from Oct. 6,2008. Read it. I have been using a fan in my sons room for white noise anyway so this made me feel better. I know we all worry about SIDS. Hope this helps any moms.

After having baby.. how exactly did your weight fall off?



After you had your baby how did your weight fall off after birth for the first month? When did your body start feeling like it does normally? What did you do to help get you through this tough time? Did you exercise, eat differently, anything special?



I am almost 2 weeks post partum. I gained weight leaving the hospital (water) and have dropped only 17 pounds since I came home. I thought I would loose more. I didnt know if you continue to loose after 2 weeks.. or if this is it and I better do more squats and sit ups.



Just disappointed I only lost 17 so far. I am breastfeeding and watching what I eat .. and have been very healthy. So whats your story?

Breastfeeding definitely helped me.  My son is 8 months old and still breastfeeding.  You burn 500 calories a day just by breastfeeding.  You should eat between 1800-2200 calories a day though.  But my weight loss scheme went like this:  I kept a food diary, I made sure I wrote down everything I consumed including drinks.  You want to look at the label, and write down how many grams of fat, and how many calories you are taking in.  This should make you aware of where you can cut out some extra grams of fat.  Drink a lot of water also.  It should all start falling off gradually, you don't want to psych yourself into thinking you're going to be instantly back into your pre-pregnancy jeans.  Good luck!

I *felt* back to normal at about 6-8 weeks, but I still weighed more than I did before I was pregnant. I gained 40 pounds in pregnancy. My baby is 6 months old now, and my weight has continued to slowly melt away. I'm just a couple pounds over my pre-pregnancy weight, and it's totally normal to have a few extra pounds while you are nursing your baby. Those milk boobs have some weight to them!

I wouldn't exercise until you are at least 6 weeks. Sometimes it takes up to a year or more or go back to pre pregnancy weight. Just remember that your metabolism slows down after having a baby so you will have to watch how much calories and fat you are actually consuming. Foods high in sodium will make your body bloat and retain water. 17 lbs in 2 weeks is a lot actually. Don't expect miracles to happen, your body took 9 months to put on the weight, expect it to take around 9 months to get back to normal.

No. You are fine. They are going through a lot of learning and stress right now. In addition they are spending time with their little new one. You would be imposing on them, I think.

Personally, I wanted to be alone in the hospital, so me and my husband could have private time to bond with our baby. But not everybody feels that way. Just ask her what she wants, if she really wants family there I would go see her. It might be nice to send flowers to the hospital or have them waiting for her when she gets home.

My feelings would be so hurt if my sister didn't come to the hospital! Go see her! It gets pretty boring at the hospital. Plus, you get pretty emotional after having a baby, so you not coming could be a really big deal, more so than usual.

Do you have advice for exclusively bottle feeding using breast milk?



Hello, we're having a baby in spring. I won't be nursing directly (please don't get into trying to convince me otherwise; I would if I could, I can't) And anyway, I'll need to go back to work sooner or later.



Of course I still want my baby to have breast milk, so I plan to pump and store milk so my husband / parents can feed the kid whenever I'm not around.



Do you have any special advice for this approach? Shall I just follow the usual breast pumping instructions + the usual bottle feeding instructions, or is there something different about feeding breast milk exclusively through bottles?



(I hear formula can be more concentrated, for example, so amounts might differ...)

Exclusive pumping is hard.  So I WOULD have to encourage you to take a long hard look at your sitation and see if there is ANY way to nurse your baby rather than pumping and bottlefeeding.



If that's not possible --
First, if it IS possible, try to nurse directly for at least the first couple of weeks.  Your baby is more efficient than the pump at stimulating your supply, so nursing will get you off to a good start.  After a few weeks, you can begin pumping at times when baby would normally nurse, and gradually make the switch over.



If you can't nurse at all, then you would pump often from day one.  Because the pump isn't as efficient, you'll probalby need to pump more often than you would nurse -- at LEAST every 2 hours around the clock.  As you get better with the pump and your letdown improves, you may be able to pump less often after your supply is well established.



Of course you will want the best pump you can afford -- renting a hospital grade pump would be ideal. Otherwise, buy a top quality double pump.



Good luck.  EPing takes a lot of dedication, and I have great admiration for women who commit to doing it.

Establishing and maintaining milk supply when baby is not nursing



By Kelly Bonyata, BS, IBCLC



It is important to express your milk to establish and maintain milk supply if your baby is not nursing at all or not nursing well. By expressing, you will also have your milk available to feed baby - every bit of moms' milk that baby gets (even the tiniest amount) is like liquid gold.
When should mom start pumping?



* If baby does not nurse immediately postpartum, mom should begin pumping within 6 hours of baby's birth -- starting early makes a difference for future milk production.



What pump is best?



* If baby is not nursing, seriously consider renting a hospital-grade pump (such as those made by Ameda or Medela) that will allow you to pump both breasts at the same time. A hospital-grade pump is the best choice for maintaining or increasing milk supply.



* If you are not able to rent a hospital-grade pump, consider buying a pump (preferably a quality double pump) and/or hand expression.



How much milk should mom be pumping if baby is not nursing?



* Aim for pumping 750-800 mL (25-27 oz) per day by 7-10 days postpartum. If you have twins or higher order multiples, aim for pumping 800-950 mL (27-32 oz) by 14 days postpartum.



* It's useful to evaluate mom's 24 hour pumping output at 10 days. If supply is borderline (350-500 ml / 11-17 oz) or low (less than 350 ml / 11 oz), then galactagogues (prescription meds or herbs to increase supply) or other interventions should be considered.



* The research tells us that milk production at 2 weeks is an indicator of breastfeeding outcome, so it is important to get a good start. Even if milk production doesn't start out well, however, don't get discouraged--many moms will see an increase (even as late as 9-15 weeks after birth) if they continue with regular pumping.



How often should mom pump?



* 8-10 times per day: Until supply is well established, it is important to get at least eight good nursing and/or pumping sessions per 24 hours. Ten sessions per day is better, particularly if you have twins or higher order multiples.



* These sessions don't need to be evenly spaced, but you should be nursing/pumping at least once during the night in the first few months or anytime you notice a decrease in supply. Avoid going longer than 5-6 hours without pumping during the first few months.



* When pumping during the night, milk yield tends to be better if you pump when you naturally wake (to go to the bathroom or because your breasts are uncomfortably full) than if you set an alarm to wake for pumping.



* If you are having a hard time getting in enough pumping sessions, adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency even if milk is not removed thoroughly) is helpful.



How long should mom pump at each pumping session?



* If baby does not nurse at all:



o The first few days, before mom's milk comes in, hand expression is often the most effective way to express colostrum. Double pump for 10-15 minutes per session for additional stimulation.



o Once mom's milk is in, pump for 30 minutes per session, or for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk.



* If baby nurses but does not soften the breast well



o Double pump for 10-15 minutes after nursing.



* Empty the breast as thoroughly as possible at each session. To ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. Use breast massage prior to pumping, and massage and compressions during pumping to better empty the breasts and increase pumping output.



Additional tips



* Rest & relax as much as possible.



* Skin-to-skin (Kangaroo care) can make a significant difference in pumping output.



* If double pumping is difficult to coordinate in the beginning, then single pump, alternating sides. Move to double pumping as soon as you can.



* Avoid any medications that might interfere with milk supply (hormonal birth control, pseudoephedrine, ethanol/alcoholic beverages, bromocriptine, ergotamine, cabergoline)



* If supply is not increasing as expected by 7-10 days after birth, consider the use of galactagogues. Fenugreek, metoclopramide (Reglan) or domperidone (Motilium) can be helpful for increasing milk supply.

Well, one thing I was surprised to hear that a lot of mothers didn't know is that breast milk can't be microwaved. microwaving zaps all the good nutrients out of the milk. Instead, microwave a bowl of water for about 2 minutes and set the bottle of breast milk in the warm water for a few minutes. good luck!

My 10 week old is using me as a pacifier?



It warms my heart that she needs me to soothe her but I have to travel for business for 3-4 days at a time 1-2 times per year and I am worried for my husband. It just has started these past few days she will eat her night time bottle of expressed milk that I pump at work (only give her the bottle at night because my L.C. said my milk supply was too low for her needs and I have such a great milk supply in the morning) and then she will just start crying for no reason it seemed we tried it all rocking, putting her in her swing, changing her diaper, offering more food, burping, reading, singing, walking around finally my husband said see if she will eat from you. I said she didn't want food i mean we already offered the bottle and her pacifier. He said just to prove me wrong just try it, it can't hurt anything. Well sure enough as soon as she latched on she fell asleep. We have had the same routine since I established my milk supply at 3 weeks of age. So why all of a sudden does she need me so bad? Is this common for breastfeeding babies she still nurses about 4 times a day from me and receives approx. 4 bottles (3 from caretaker and 1 from hubby).

She's a baby. You're her mother.



She is not "using you" as a pacifier, and that's a very vulgar way to describe one's mothering. Babies with plastic plugs in their mouth are "using" them as breasts.



She knows Daddy doesn't nurse, so don't keep yourself apart from her out of worry over that.

Children close in age...nursing?



My son will be one tomorrow :).  He was born at 35 weeks and I had to have a csection (he was healthy and went home with me).  It took several days (maybe 6 or 7) for my milk to come in.  I assumed it was due to the csection and early birth.  He didn't gain weight at first and I think it was because my milk took a little while to come in.  Well anyway I quit nursing him at 4 months and I still have milk in my breasts if I try to express it.  I am 9 1/2 weeks pregnant and I'm curious if the milk will be there right away this time since it really has never went away.  I will be having another csection.  Will I still have colostrum and then milk or will my milk come right in (maybe with the added colostrum nutrients in it)?  Just curious what others experiences with this were????

Your body is smart and knows that a new baby will require new-baby colostrum not mature-baby milk. Even if you were still exclusively breastfeeding your first son, your breasts would go back to producing colostrum after your second child is born. And then your milk will come in again.



Our bodies are brilliantly designed that way.

Yes your body will still be able to produce colostrum & milk for the new baby. Just don't decide to let the one year old nurse anymore or you could go into preterm labor (I say this only b/c some women have actually done so)

You CANNOT turn it around prior to 12 months of age AND 20+ pounds (I mean, you can, but its incredibly unsafe).  However, its now recommended to leave them rear-facing even longer.  The longer the better actually.  Leave them rear-facing until they reach the weight limit for that car seat.  Some can stay rear-facing up to 30 pounds.  Just look on the seat.  It should have a sticker that states the weight limits.

The very minimum is 1yr AND 20lbs...not either or.  But really it's recommended you get a convertible carseat with a higher weight limit, most are 30-35lbs, and keep them rear facing until that limit.  Height isn't a factor in that.  Their necks even at 1 aren't very strong and they can be internally decapitated pretty easily in a crash when forward facing, rear facing is MUCH MUCH safer for kids.  As long as you can keep them that way is best.  My youngest is currently 13mo and 20lbs and is still rear facing, he has a Britax Marathon an he's really comfortable in it, and it's really easy to get him in and out of, alot easier then the infant seat was plus he can sit up more and I can give him a toy and he can play, he doesn't mind sitting rear facing at all, and really even if he did he still would be, not risking his life.  Remember it only takes one time, you may not get a redo you know?

i might get thumbs down for saying this but i put my daughter in a forward facing car seat when she was 9 or 10  months. even though its said not to till the child is one year or 20lbs, my daughter is now 18 months and just turned 21lbs, but she is tall so this is the reason i changed the seat early on, and by doing so it made trips out alot easier for her and me, she would cry less and felt more at ease being able to see me and actually had room for her legs. if i stuck to the 20lb rule she would have been rear facing up till 16 or 17 months!

Wow, "crying it out" method works!!!!!?



My baby is almost 10 weeks old. When I put him down to take a nap, he would sleep for only 30 min. then cried. I had to pick him up and hold him for another hour or so. I decided two days ago, I am not going to pick him up. So when he started to cry, I went there, gave him his pacifier, touched him and left the room. After an hour of crying he finally fell asleep. Well, two days later, I put him down, he really did not cry. I had to go there three times within 30 min. to comfort him. I just had to give him his pacifier and he went right back to sleep. He has been sleeping for an hour and a half!!! So ladies, who would like to try this method, be consistent and do not give in. Believe me, it was horrible to listen to his cry. It is a great method that will keep your baby and you happy. Good luck to all of you who decided to try this method.

Our 4 month old grandaughter has one ear larger than the other.  Should there be concern?



One ear looks 'normal'.  The other is larger in size, as in longer.  The top is pointed.  On the same side of that ear, her head appears more flat than the other.

You are supposed to gently rotate their head to avoid those flat spots.



As far as the ear, I guess if it's abnormally larger then yes have her take the baby to the doctor.  If she's 4 months old, she's due for a check up.

My daughter was the same way.  Her's was a little larger, and placed a little lower.  She also developed a flat spot b/c she was born with torticollis.  She's now 17 months and her ears look identical.  Her flat spot is rounding out nicely, but still a little flat.  No one notices but me, though.  It should all work itself out.



I understand your concern.  I was so worried about it and asked my doc about it constantly.

For me it's January.  After the new year, it's sad,  The decoration come down, nothing to celebrate and the climate is so darn cold and snowy,  All we have left to do is sit it out and wait for spring to come.  Even that takes a long time.  New England weather is the worse I think because it's nice one day and freezing the next.  It's just a sad month for me.  It's like all the fun times are gone.  The excitement of Thanksgiving and the family get together.  The Christmas tree, opening presents, watching the little one giggle with laughter, but then January arrives, and it's gone.  Sad, just sad for me.

If you're not breastfeeding, can you at least pump? And release some of the milk that you got.. if not you're gonna get some nasty clogged ducts... and they hurt like hell!!
So pump for a while not a whole lot, but at least to release teh pressure. Is there anyways you can bottle feed your baby breast milk?? It's much better you know.. specially in the first few months.

try Cold compress and when you take a shower try to make it warm maybe even cold showers, Any type of heat will make your milk drop. When you feel your milk drop press firmly on your breast. (don't press to hard. Don't want you to hurt your self.) that will stop the milk. Give it time and it will work. GOOD LUCK!!!



P.S. Take a nap when the baby dose. Your going to need all the sleep you can get

you can pump a little (not all cuz your body will just make more) to help ease the pressure. or take a warm shower and try using your hands to help squeeze some milk out. other than that you'll  just have to wait it out. if you dont use your milk, your body will automatically dispose of it and since it works on supply and demand, if you dont demand any more, your body wont make any more. normally no more than a couple days.

I know that's bad but im so afraid of her choking on something. Im afraid to feed her anything but baby food. If i feed her table food how should I do it I would like to see her feed her self.

Cook food till it is fork tender (steam, boil, bake, etc) then cut it into small pieces. Nothing bigger than a cheerio to start. Or even start with cheerios! Try easy soft things like bananas. Most babies can self feed tasty stuff really easy.



Babies, like us, use the back of the mouth to crush up their food. They just use their gums. The front teeth are for biting off pieces of food only. So having 0 teeth or 4 teeth makes little difference when eating soft table foods.



You can feed peas, cooked carrot pieces, broccoli, small chunks of cheese, noodles, breads, meats, all sorts of raw soft fruits and cooked hard fruits... you can even turn things like applesauce into a food a 10 month old can self feed. When Alyssa is feeling independant and doesn't want to be spoon fed I just mix her applesauce with a bit of baby oatmeal so it is thick enough to pick up. She gets a kick out of it.

If you are afraid of her choking give her something soft like a very ripe banana and cut it into pea size pieces. Another excellent choice are Gerber puffs the just melt in her mouth, other brands have the same thing too like Parent's Choice has them. As for feeding herself just put 2 or 3 pieces at a time of whatever you're feeding her on her highchair tray or a plastic plate and let her explore them. She might pick them up and mush them in her hand at first or something, but it's new to her and she is just trying to figure out what it is. Let her take her time. Also it would be a good idea to take a CPR class in case, God forbid, she does choke you know what to do.

My son has been on table food since 8 months old. I just feed him soft pieces of food. He likes those Gerber pasta pickups, I just cut them in half. A good rule to go by is have the pieces be no bigger than yuor thumbnail. Just offer a couple of things. My son likes peas, ground chicken, corn, cheerios, kix, mac and cheese and bananas. She will get the hang of grabbing and bringing to her mouth just fine.

I understand her concerns. She may gag and seem like she's choking, she's reacting this way because she's not use to the texter of the new foods you'll be introducing to her. It'll get better once she gets use to it. It'll probable take a few tried until she gets use to it. I never did go through this with my baby. I just start giving her cherrios, toast, and smash bananas she loves it. She's 7mos.



You can start her off with:
Soft fruit-smashed bananas, pears, peaches, and ect
tofu
steamed veggies-buy the frozen veggies
cherrios
toast-bagels or plain muffins
yogurt
avocado
cottage cheese
beans
scrambled egg yolks
graduate puffs
unsalted crackers
pasta



Once she's mastered those, introduce her to small pieces of chicken and fish. Then she can start eating what you eat. Don't over season the food though.



Good luck

I was the same way about 2 months ago about my 9 months old feeding himself real foods. I even asked a question about it. He was chocking on Cheerios so of course I was even more worried about bigger things. BUT, you just have to let them do it. I did and it worked great. Put your baby in the highchair/walker (whichever you choose) and give a piece of food (like a piece of toast, slice of banana...etc...) and let her have at it. Just keep an eye out. She'll probably gag a few times before getting the hang of it but that's normal.



Now my son is 11 months and eats just about anything himself....I can't even feed him jar foods or table foods from a fork/spoon because he wants to do it himself.



Don't be afraid to give her table foods. Just mashed or cut-up well until she gets the hang of chewing. You can start off with a small slice of toast (bite-size pieces), a slice of banana, green beans...anything soft and something she can hold onto.



Good luck!

What age are bumbo seats actually for ?



Hi I was just wondering what age your baby was when you put them in a Bumbo as I have read on some sites that its 8 weeks -14 months and other sites say 3 months - 6 months and others 4 months - 12 months.



I know it all depends on how you baby is developing but im just wanting to know, obviously at 8 weeks a babys head is still unsteady but if someone there is to support the head etc it should beok shouldnt it, its just that my 8 week old son can lift support his own head pretty well now, and we have been given a bumbo and I think they are great. I tried him in it today obviously keeping his head supported in case he gets a wobble on  and he loved it.



He seems a little to small for it yet but putting him in it at 8 weeks with supervison from me would be ok wont it.

A lot of people will say no, its not ok because it ruins the development of their back muscles and spine.... but its not like you are leaving him in there all day. Just use your judgment. I think the bumbo works best for babies who have good head control and can sit supported up until they can crawl out of it themselves... cant really put an age on that because all babies do this at different times.

Car seat- where to put?



Okay, so I know, rear facing.



But, do I put it behind the driver's side, passenger's side, or in the middle?  (For a newborn, obviously)

The middle is the safest for a newborn because of the airbags! It can deploy in the front and push the seats back and in the middle there only gonna get the edge of the seats!

Reposting my question - what would you do?



I am a SAHM with a 19 months boy and an almost 3 months girl. I breastfed my son for 10 months and stopped after 3 months of my 2nd pregnancy - I couldn't make any milk at that point.
Now with my daughter I have so many problems.
I had to stop breastfeeding her at week 1 because my nipples were bleeding. I freaked out when I saw some blood coming out of her mouth. So, I decided to pump the milk and feed her with a bottle.
I tried to breastfeed her everyday but it was too painful. When I recovered completely, she ended up refusing the breast. I tried everything including medela SNS, finger feeding and so on. No way!
She nurses only when she's sleepy but it's not enough.
I don't want to try anything else to breastfeed exclusively. I tried for a week and it was a nightmare for me and especially for my baby.
So I pump night and day. The problem is that I don't have time to do anything else and I have 2 kids. I would like to spend more time playing with them.
Question: If I pump 7 times a day I can provide 90% of the milk my daughter needs. If I drop a couple of pumps my milk supply decreases considerably and I can provide only 60% - 50%.
Of course my baby is more gassy and fussy with more formula.
What would you do in my place?



Thank you for reading.

I would pump when convenient and supplement with formula for the rest (even if you can only get one bottle from pumping).  You can put a few drops of gas X in the formula to prevent the gas problem, I've heard this helps a lot.  Also, you could look at switching bottle types or formulas, all which can contribute to the problem.  Good luck!

If you are ok with the decision to stop breastfeeding and really don't want to pump you can try formula. I had to use soy formula for my son because milk based gave him bad gas and made him spit up allt he time. We had no issues with the soy.



Pumping 7 times a day seems like a lot. Kudos to you for doing that, I would have quit long ago. Maybe thats just me.



Also, have you tried a nipple shield to see if that will help her get used to the breast again?

i definitely dont think you can just spend all day pumping. and your supply will only keep decreasing if all you are doing is pumping. i dont see anything wrong with supplementing formula. if she is gassy and fussy then you need to try a different kind. consult your pediatrician to see which one may work best for your baby.

I know some will disagree with me, but you asked what I would do and I would find a formula that worked for her and start supplementing. I had a hard time pumping and nursing with just one child (I had very low milk supply) I could never imagine how hard it is with TWO kids! Good Luck I hope every thing works out for you.

I pumped exclusively for my preemie son since he was too small to latch on when he was born. Once he was strong enough to latch he just wanted the bottle. But, I know what you mean. Pumping takes soooo long. You have to pump 20-30 minutes then you have to feed it to your child. I know the frustration. I pumped as much as I could for 3 months. I felt bad when I stopped but I was happy that I did not just quit after a few days like many people do. If I were you, I would pump as much as you can and if that means your child gets some formula, then so be it. I know how you feel as a mother not being able to provide food for your child but it is just how it is sometimes. Good luck.

Fenugreek will increase your supply so that when you do pump you'll get more milk.



You may want to think about trying a nipple sheild if you haven't already.



Honestly though, and I say this as s big time supporter of breastfeeding, you are doing SO much for your baby right now. In the end, a happy mother means a happy baby, and if this battle is causing you nothing but stress you should cut back on the pumping to the point where you feel like it isn't taking over your life, find a formula that works (and maybe find different bottles), and enjoy your time with your kids.

I'm sort of in the same boat. I only have one, but I also have 3 puppies and a husband who can't seem to take care of himself. I know puppies can't be compared to having 3 kids, but they were like my children before I had him. Practice kids? Lol



But I pump when its convenient for me, just like the first person said. I try my hardest to do it regularly but I have so much to do, plus half the time he won't calm down unless he's laying on my chest lol



Bleeding nipples don't sound fun. I think mine were bleeding slightly the other day. The milk came pith with a slight orange / red tint. Could have been something I ate though.



Anyway good luck! I know its hard and people get on you about formula feeding, but do what's best for the both of you. :)

Yes it is possible.  I have twins and this was something that my doc mentioned to me during the pregnancy.  They can sometimes stop labor after one comes out and buy the other baby a few more days or even a couple weeks.  Thankfully I was able to go full term and not deal with any of that.

I'm not saying that anything isn't possible - but it is very unlikely that once the labor process starts that they could post-pone the second twin from coming out for weeks - depending on the time, they could be born on different days but I would assume that most Dr.s would take the 2nd baby via C-section by that time.

It is possible for twins to be born weeks apart.  During my sisters pregnancy with fraternal twins, her babies were in such a position the baby on "top" was adding excess pressure to the baby below.  At 28 weeks she started dilating and having contractions.  She was put on hospital bed rest but it was not enough to prolong the labor. She delivered baby number 1 at 29 weeks.  After vaginally delivering the first fetus her cervix starting closing, and we did not meet baby number 2 until she was 35 weeks along.

i would think it was possible only if they were in two separate sacs. if they shared the same sac i would think they would both have to be born together since when your water breaks with a singular baby it has to be born within 24 hours or infection can set in.

I doubt it, I carried twins and the one died in the uterus, I had to wait until I went into labour with the live twin before I could give birth to them both. My twins arrived 11 minutes apart.



In non identical twins there are two sacs, so theoretically it is possible but not likely, as you will be having contractions for the birth as well as the hormonal response. It would, I imagine, be very inadvisable, as it was in my case, because it could lead to serious problems for the twin left inside.



In identical twins they share the same sac and thus would have to be born during the same labour.



Hope that helps!

Have you tried swadding him?  My little guy really liked to be held, too, and still is a super cuddly kid at 10 months.  One thing that helped us with sleeping, was to swaddle him before putting him to bed.  He was even happier during the day swaddled, laying on a blanket on the floor, watching me make dinner, or whatever.



To swaddle:
You take a large square cotton receiving blanket, lay it on a bed like a diamond, and fold the top corner down.  Lay baby's head on the folded corner, with his feet pointing toward the opposite (bottom) corner.  Then you bring the left corner over his body, and tuck it under his bum, and then the right corner over his body, and tuck that under his bum.  You can swaddle with his arms in, or out, depending on what works better for you.

Landon's Mommy, don't be so ignorant. A baby cannot be spoiled, especially at 3 months of age AND born premature, they don't know how to manipulate yet.



Housework, for me, always takes a backseat to my baby. Once he's settled and happy then I go about MY business. Like someone else suggested, have you tried swaddling him? I found at that age my son really enjoyed his swing. I also took him around the house with me in his bouncer because as long as he could see me then he was content. But, at that age, your baby may just need some extra cuddling time and that's okay too.

in the US we have what are called "well baby" visits. They need to have their immunizations/weight check & overall health check @ 1 week after birth, 2 mos, 4 mos, 6 mos, 9 mos and 12 mos. After that its just every year. I find it best to just schedule it around their b-day every year, makes it easy to remember.  Then around 2 years or 3 depending on how many teeth they have,  they should have their 1 st check up at the dentist. Hope that helps!

Traveling and giving solids to my 7 month old?



Each of the next two weekends we are flying out of town with my 7 month old son to visit family.  One time will be with my husband and the next will be just me and my son.  3 of the 4 flights coincide with a time when I usually give my son solid food.  He has been eating solids for about 2 months now and eats two huge meals of them (today for lunch he ate a large serving of oatmeal, a 4 oz jar of pears, and about 2 oz of mango).  The process is really messy and he always tries to grab the spoon and feed himself which makes it even more messy.  My question is, during those flights can we skip the solids and just nurse him?  Will he miss them since he is eating so much?  Should I change the timing around of when I offer them or will this confuse him?  We will be trying to keep the same nap schedule and everything else while we are away.  What have you done when traveling with your 6-8 month old who is eating solids but not yet less messy finger foods like cheerios?

id switch the nursing and solid foods schedule.as long as hes getting them sometime during the day.. i think he'd be okay and not really know  the difference.  i would try to stick to a nap routine as  best as possible..sometimes though.. you just cant when traveling.

I agree with # 1. You may want to pick up one of the feeder bottles..they actually have bottles that you put jar food into and the baby can suck it like  a bottle. I don't usually like those but if he just has to eat and if you find nursing is not cutting it, then that would be a LESS messy option, than using the spoon. Or just go ahead and feed him the food and bring extra clothes on board! :P I would make sure you bring the food wtih you just in case. you'd hate to be stuck on a plane with a screaming baby that you can't console,  and the other passengers would not like it either, so bring some just in case.... Hope that helps. Also what about bananas, or Go Gurt yogurts...those are not too messy no spoons needed.... just an idea

We traveled alot when our son was that young. We just skipped his solids. He did miss them sometimes we just nursed him more often. Be prepared for his schedule to be messed up. Everything is new to him and sometimes it stresses them out so just try to keep it as normal as possible and don't get too stressed.

I think my 5 month old is having night terrors?



my 5 month old son wakes up screaming. like hes terrified. hes not wet, poopy, hungry, not hot or cold, in any kind of pain. Usually stops after I pick him up and he goes right back to sleep. Sometimes all it takes is giving him his sucky. Sometimes I have to rub his back. Most nights he starts screaming again 5-10 minutes later and do it all over again. a lot of times this last for up to 2 hours but sometimes it only happens once or twice. It has been happening every night for the past week and a half. It has happened a few times before but not really that much. Ive spoke with his ped and she said its night terrors. and there is nothing really I can do except make sure he is safe and that he cant hurt himself which he cant. Does anyone have any experience with this? All that Ive read said that if it was night terrors it would only be happening once in a while and not every night. Does anyone know of anything that I can do? Or just basically wait for him to grow out of it? which is what I been told. Im going to make another app and get a second opinion.

I got mine back about that time as well. It was lighter than usual, so maybe you'll at least experience less inconvenience.  Your period most likely will not be regular - coming sooner or later than 28 days - for a few months, but it's here to stay unless you conceive again.

Hmmm.. nope! I find it kind of silly to do so too. I don't see how a 6 month old baby could understand what the "potty" is for. How is your baby going to get back and forth to the potty? Exactly.



I'm sure you'll get some people that say it works but I'm also sure these people have done nothing but hold their baby over the potty and they(baby) coincidentally went pee/poop.

If you start that young, it's not the baby who's being trained - it's you being trained to recognise the signs that they want to go. Babies that young simply don't have the bowel or bladder control.

You sound like a 1st time parent.....Very excited..and want to do things right! Thats GREAT! BUT...its not possible...In order for a child to begin the potty training process, they have to be able to communicate a sign or word for Pee/poop, they have to have the bladder/muscle control, to be able to produce the BM into the toliet. And generally they have to be able to walk to the toliet themselves, and get on it themselves, which a child that young can't do. Around 1 year you can begin to put him on the potty say before bed, bath, or at regular intervals,  not so much to start training him, but to get him used to the toliet and not scared of it, and he may catch on to peeing on command, but usually BM take alot longer to get the hang of. And sorry to disappoint you but its proven, that BOYS usually are not fully potty trained until age 3. Sorry! :(
My daughters were fully potty trained at age 2, and my son at age 1 week before he turned 3. My 2 adopted kids JUST finally got it! and they are 3.5 and almost 4. Hope that helps!

You won't need a diaper bag for the hospital stay. The hospital will provide you with everything the baby needs while they are there. You MAY want to bring an outfit to bring baby home in, a pacifer if you are planning on using them, and a blanket and snow suit if it will be cold.



Other than that you don't need anything. The hospital will provide diapers, wipes, and clothing while your baby stays there.

If you are going to do formula, I suggest getting a box of little formula packages. Each pack has 2 oz of formula so eventually you would use more than one, but they are great space savors in a bag in stead of a can.



Have burp rags also. If you use pacifiers, have a spare on incase you loose it. A small blanket.

If you're just going from the hospital to home a diaper bag isn't needed. Now for future reference, several diapers, wipes, 2 extra outfits, 2 extra burp rags. If you're breastfeeding lots of extra nursing pads in the beginning I went through 6 to 8 an hour the first few days, and extra shirt or 2 for you and an extra nursing bra.

I would say:
diapers, wipes, extra onesies, socks, travel sized baby lotion, burp cloths, the baby brush/comb, any special "going home outfits", if its cold then a hat or two if you want to use something besides the hospital hat, formula AND bottles just in case you change your mind (I breast fed so don't think I am pushing bottles on you).



Don't forget to pack your mommy bag too!



Once your baby is older you will giggle at how much stuff you used to carry around just in case you needed it.  I only carry diapers, wipes, snacks and a sippy cup and that's IT!



Best wishes with your little one and enjoy every moment!

Make sure you have a spare hat - the baby's generally still a bit covered in goo when they're first dressed, and while we had loads of extra clothes, we didn't think about a spare hat!



Don't mean to burst your bubble or get you worried, but I spent 4 days in hospital trying to breastfeed without success, so in the end had to give her formula. You might want to just look into it now, maybe pick out a brand and have a couple of bottles sterilised just in case. I literally had to stop a the supermarket on the way home from hospital to get bottles and a steriliser!



Oh, and a load of terry cloths to put over your shoulder when you're burping him/her.



(Also, make sure you've got something to eat for after the baby's born. I was starving, and all we could find at short notice was a couple of chocolate sponge rolls - which just made me nauseous)

I agree, no diaper bag needed.  If you have an outfit that you want hospital pictures made in, bring that.  Bring the going home outfit and a blanket for cold weather. Other than that, the hospital will provide everything you need.

Rolled from stomach to back or back to stomach. My baby can roll from stomach to back, but I still put her to sleep on her back. They are at the greastest risk for SIDS between 2-4 months old.

my 4 month old is the same way. she will ONLY sleep on her stomache(even though dr said not to all the time) or in the car seat when she is REALLY beat. and she rolls too. fun when she rolls from stomache to back and whines cause she wants to be on her stomache. then u have to flip her every 15 mins. but, now she will flip and just cry herself to sleep on her side/back. if the kid sleeps, comfy enough

Anyone else scared of baby weaning?



i think my baby is weaning.. she went all day yesterday without breastfeeding.. and 15 hours today and..still going ,of  not eating from me.  i tried not giving her solids.. but after 15 hours of not having anything.. her head was starting to get hot... so i got scared and gave her some oatmeal and pumped milk.  she is teething.. shes 10 months old.  i dont think she wants to nurse anymore...when she nurses she only stays on 2 min on one side only.. hardly enough for a let down.  i wouldnt min if she took a sippy or bottle .. but she never has.. the only way i can get liquids down her is to spoon feed her milk or mix it in with rice or oatmeal cereal.  i am scared about her fluids.. the most she ever gets is 8- 10 oz a day. and im not producing the milk good even when pumping bc shes not stimulating me. i am going crazy......... help



</question>



<additional details>



is it okay to give my baby milk in her cereal and she just stops nursing from me.. shes gettting the same amount of milk.  will my  production be hurt if i still pump and she just stops nursing? thanks

Maybe she's not getting enough milk, she's latching on incorrectly and so she gets upset. It's very easy to get discouraged about breastfeeding when your baby cries because she's not getting enough but once you find the correct position for oyur baby it'll be great.



Look I found this link on how a baby is supposed to latch on properly, it's a video with an actual mom and real baby! There are 3 parts I think it's great! It really helped me out!  The guy who's talking is an MD.



Good luck and congrats on your baby!!

you may have a "snacker" on your hands. I didn't know anything about that until I had my second. these babies are just taking their time to nurse/bottle, looking around, getting distracted, nursing 1-5 minutes, and come back for more in an hour. It was really difficult to time her feeding sessions: the dr. said to feed her every two hours when newborn. but she would nurse for 1-2 minutes now, 3 minutes 15 minutes later, 2 minutes another 30 min later, and so on for three months while I was on maternity leave, day and night.
After i started work, she did the same with the bottle.
And she had a poor latch too, either my breast were too engorged, or she would only suck on tip, that would make her frustrated. in time (3 months) she nursed better from the breast, but only prefers the short bottle nipples (like NUK, not Avent-which i had a full set from my first)



My oldest one in turn, was a very effective nurser, in 15 min she would empty the breast, burp and go to sleep.



be patient, this is the least of your worries...

I really wouldn't go past medium flow because with medium and fast flow both of my children would slobber it out as they drank or end up gagging on it as it came out too fast.



Newborn is great because they have to work at it a little more, which sort of makes weening from the bottle easier.  When they are a year old they would rather suck on a sippy cup than a bottle with a newborn nipple that is hard to extract fluid from.



The fast flow would be pretty good if you plan to add rice to the bottle, but I woudn't recommend adding rice.  It's a personal choice though

I bought the plastic little boxes/packs of Gerber 2nds vegetable purees. We microwaved the 1 pack. Our little one didn't eat the whole pack. We placed the pack in the fridge, but then I remembered reading that you shouldn't eat food that you already microwaved once. Is this true?

I THINK, not positive, if you warm it from fresh or the first time you cook it at all is that way it's ok, but not if she ate out of the pack. like if you were feeding her straight from that jar putting the spoon she ate off back in there you aren't supposed to save that.  But I would think if you just tooksome out and fed her from another bowl and not from the pack it would be ok

You aren't supposed to reheat the same package or let them eat from the same package after it has sat.  (reason for the second is that their saliva has gotten into the food and will start to break it down).  What I will do is put the amount of food that I want to feed him into a separate bowl and heat it up that way and then save the rest in the fridge for later.

If she already ate out of it you risk the chance of bacteria by putting it back into the fridge and storing it for later.



Next time just put a small amount into ANOTHER bowl for this purpose so you don't have to waste anything.

One reason why you shouldn't microwave (or use) the Gerber plastic packs PERIOD is becasue they are packed in the #7 plastic with BPA in them.  I am not some crazy Mom who rambles on about stuff, just wanted to let you know.  Check the bottom of the container, you will see a 7.

Re-microwaving isn't the issue.  The potential harm is that the food became contaminated with germs if you fed your baby straight from the resealable container, and if given enough time the germs will spread through the leftovers and your baby could get sick from it.



I admit, I fed my son straight from the container AND re-nuked the packages to re-feed later that day or the next day.  The world is full of germs, and if you try to isolate your child from them all, you're going to be very busy.  As long as you don't let the containers sit at room temperature between feedings, your little one should be fine.

you will either have to work thought it and keep letting him cry.
or bring him back to bed.  it may be easier to break the habit now.  my son is four and still sleeps with us, but we don't really mind.  but the choice is yours if you wait on him he will be six but so what...it's what you guys want.

It will take a lot of work and will not be easy to reverse this.  Start trying to lay him in the crib for daytime naps.  Eventually he will get so tired that he will fall asleep in their.  If he cries then pick him up, comfort him and then put him back in the crib.  Every time he falls asleep put him in the crib.  Just keep it up.  Eventually he will sleep in there but it may be hard to transition and it will be very tiring.  Or you can get a bassinet and put it beside your bed so that he is on his own but still close enough to hear your breathing.

Co-sleeping is a very bad thing to start because its a nightmare to stop. As your baby is only 2 months old its best to put an end to it now becasue the older they get the harder it is. The only way to stop it is to bare the crying for 1 or 2 nights let them work out that the crib is there bed.  If you think at 2 months he is having a tantrum wait until he is 1 and you want to break the habit he will turn blue from screaming. Nothing will happen to him while he is crying even though its distressing it will end; put him in his crib awake and when he cries go to him every couple of minutes to comfort him but don't pick him up and rock him just touch him so he know he's safe and leave him alone. It hard but best to stop the habit younger than older; my sister in law is still co-sleeping with her 3 year old and she is pregnant with her 2nd and just can't break the habit she is at her wits end and wishes she had never started co-sleeping.

I had the same issue with my 6 month old.  I took 3 days and dedicated myself to fixing this problem.....My motto was :sleep in your crib, or dont sleep at all".  Needless to say I had a cranky baby for the first two days but thats all it took. It'svery important to stick with a routine, like supper, activity, bath and bed, and stick to it.....A baby only has to do something 3 times before it becomes a habit! When you put him down, and he cries, hold him again until he falls back to sleep.  If he cries on the way down to the crib, make sure you lay him in there for a second before you pick him up to soothe him.  It lets him know that even though he cries you are still gonna put him in his crib.The first night I tried this with my little girl, she woke constanly, and I was doing this for 3 hours straight.the next night she woke every 3 hours, and the nest night after that she slept the wholenight.  You should break this habit now, while it'snot so hard.

Is it really hurting anything to let him sleep with you???  Our son has slept with us from day one and I have discovered there is nothing better in the world than baby snuggles and waking up with my whole world/family in my bed!  Our sex life has not suffered in the least.  If anything it is MORE exiting!  It is like being a teenager again, doing it in forbidden and naughty places!  I breast feed, so having my baby in the bed is the easiest thing in the world.  He squirms to let me know he is hungry, I roll over, latch him on, and go back to sleep!  That way, not one in our house is sleep deprived!  The way my hubby and I look at it, it is better to let my son sleep in the bed now so he knows we are always there for him  and to help him find his own independence when he is ready than to force him to be independent and end up with a clingy, needy child!  There is a great book with an author named Jay Gordon called "Good Nights".  It explains all of this and why it is SO important in much greater detail than I can here.  Look for it at your local library or buy it at a book store or on-line!  Good luck with your precious baby!

It's eye boogers, something could've gotten in her eyes, she could have an infection like red eye, or dust could be stirred up from vacuuming or her tear ducts are fully developed now and are flushing her eyes properly, it could be anything, if it is a lot of goo, then take her to the doctors.

My son has the same thing and it could be an infection so you may want to talk to a doctor if it does not go away. Or it could just be here tear ducts are closed shut. What you can try to do, this is what my doc told me, is massage her on the eye brow in the center of her face... i hope that makes sense. Just do little circles. But this is a very common problem for baby's.

Sounds like pink eye. The doctor can prescribe some antibiotic eye drops. Another possibility is a blocked tear duct. My daughter had a blocked tear duct off and on until she was a year and had to get surgery on it. Most children do not have to get surgery on it..it goes away. Still though, if it's infected either way she needs the eye drops.

It could be pinkeye.  It could just be conjunctivitis brought on by a cold.  If it her eyes become red or when she wakes up they are crusted shut from all the goop, see your doctor.  If they are just a little boogery, it will probably work itself out on it's own.  Randomly, if you are nursting and she is an infant, squirt a little breastmilk into her eyes if it's a very mild irritation.  Thats what my pediatrician recommended to me when my son's eyes got goopy.  People think it sounds nuts, but it's a fantastic natural remedy for mild eye irritation.  It will actually work for people of any age, but docs only recommend it for infants who are already breast feeding.

You can totally get away with dressing a girl in 'boyish' clothes .. but it would never work the other way around.



Older girls sometimes prefer 'boyish' clothes if they're a tom-boy, so there's no problem with that.

It was always obvious that my daughter was a girl even when she wore boyish clothes because I always had bows in her long hair.  She wore boy corduroy black pants for Christmas with a cute red sweater.  It was hard to find black clothes for girls at times so I would get her boy clothes.  She also has a few army-fatigue patterned outfits and wore some yellow, ducky outfits when she was real young.  I didn't realize how many gender neutral outfits she had until I had my son and went through all of her old clothes and pulled out all the jeans and overalls that he could wear.



My sister got my daughter pink reef flip-flops when she was little and I'm trying to figure out how my son could wear them.  I'm thinking of making him a muscle tank top that says real men wear pink and then he could wear the sandals.  LOL!

I pick out some of my 19 month-old daughter's clothes. I've bought her a few articles of boy's clothing (recently, a pirate shirt, and a sweatshirt with robots on it). Also, sometimes boy shoes are nicer looking.



I don't have a problem with her having more of a boyish look, though we also buy her lots of girlie pink clothes, but she does sometimes get confused for a boy since she still has less hair than most girls. It would be nice to not have to either correct people or feel like I should. I'm more embarrassed for the people who thinks she's a boy than I am for her though.

We have a bunch of more neutral clothing, but we usually always pair them with some gender specific clothes, just because that's how everything lays out.  I think it's much easier to dress little girls in boy colors than it is to dress little boys in girl colors.  A little girl can look absolutely adorable in a light blue outfit, a dark blue outfit, and even a blue and grey "running" suit, but you can't do that the other way with a boy.



For us I find that most of our little boy's pants are kind of gender neutral, but his shirts are usually pretty boyish, except for the plain, solid colored, long sleeved shirts we just bought.  When he was littler, though, we did have a pair of jeans for him that were technically girl jeans.  They had a flap over the front hip pocket and had little green dinosaur foot prints on the leg.  I thought they were boy pants when I bought them, but looking at their fit and the details made it pretty clear they were girl pants.  Oh well!



I do have a type of floral print on my sling, though, so anytime that I have him in my sling, even if he is dressed to the 9s as a boy, people still think he's a girl because all they see is the black fabric with flowers on it.  But, come on, the sling is an accessory for me, not for him.  :)



Edit:  Superman's mom, that sleeper (and your son) are adorable.  I can see why you would want to use it.



Here's a pic we took the other day at the duck park.  This is about as boyish as he gets.  Most days are a bit more neutral.

We mostly have hand-me-downs that are pink... And she's the first granddaughter after 5 grandsons, so you can imagine our daughter receives a lot of pink.  That being said though, some of our favorite items of hers are actually found with the boy stuff.  My rule is that as long as it doesn't actually say boy, it's fair game.  I just politely say she is...old when they ask about him :)

All of my children had gender neutral clothing- primary colors and some pastels as babies but also some gender specific colors and it traveled with them as they grew up. My oldest is a girl and she is not a girly girl and tends to stick to blacks and dark colors, but my 2nd daughter is a bling princess! My son will wear a pale pink or lavender shirt with a gray suit because it suits his coloring at age 14. My youngest is a girl and she loves to wear army fatigue type clothing to play and hang out in but is thrilled to dress up in a pink ruffled frou frou dress to attend a special occasion.



For dress up play time, I always had a variety of outfits to play with and never steered them away from any particular gender specific clothing. My son would wear a purple velvet women's hat with his dinosaur boots and my daughters loved the karate gi and cowboy hats. Let them explore!

Amber has a lot of pink clothing, but also some boys onesies as well (I couldn't pass up the price of 3 onesies for 46 cents but they only had blue ones and ones with boats left)



She also has some blue blankets (got those for 25 cents lol I'm quite the bargain shopper)



I don't think people really look at what they're wearing anymore, Amber was wearing a pink outfit today and had a pink blanket in her stroller and when I was at the vets today the women questioned if she was a boy or girl and later on for super the girl at the cash thought she was a boy (however I do believe the women was crazy because my daughter looks almost 100% like me and she said well I guess she has the dads looks cus she looks nothing like you)



Ah well maybe when she has more hair on her head people will stop questioning lol

Nope, I think the whole idea of pinks and blues is so weird.



It's like we tell children, "You can do anything and be anything you want. Your gender shouldn't stand in the way. If you're a boy and you want to go into a career field that has typically been filled with women, then we support you, and same if you're a girl who wants to be strong and be herself."



Then we go and throw them in blue and pink, effectively telling them that gender really does matter.

In anything unless it is a boy.  Blue will go on a girl, but there is no way you can dress a boy in pink and it be O.K., unless you wanted a girl and will try to turn the boy into a sissy?  I don't recommend it for boys but for girls anything goes.

Well im not a dad YET!
our baby is due in February 09, a little to go yet, baby is going to be a girl.
But i dont think there is anything wrong with dressing a baby girl in more neutral or even boyish clothes and likewise for a boy to be dressed in more feminine looking clothes, i dont even think there are that many gender specific clothes these days, if you know what i mean?
even my gf who is pretty girly, has been buying a lot of black, white, green and even blue clothes for her.
BTW, Lucy is very cute, and she has a super cute name too :)

Should i let my babys daddy see the baby when his born?



When I was 2 months far  in my pregnancy I let my boyfriend come live with me. We only lasted like like 3 weeks and we had a fight. I kicked him out . The truth is I really don't know why but i did, but the worst thing is that it wasn't the first time i had kicked him out it was the second time. So when he got off from work he went straight to pack his things . i told him i was sorry that i didn't mean what i had said. but he said it was to late n he left. Now im 8 months pregnant and i had to come to live with my parents cuz I fell in depression cuz he wouldn't come back no matter what i would do. He never really called to check on me when i was living by myself , i was the one calling him and begging him to spend some time with me ,, but he never had time or he didn't wanted to. He did go visit me twice because i asked him to. but that was it. Now that im staying with my parents he calls and asks how am i doin. And this is just right now cuz i burly have 2weeks with them, But i ready spoke to him and told him that i had decided to put oour baby my last name. I think this will let me know if he actually cares about the baby because during my pregnancy he made feel worst by pushing me away. And if he does care he will take me to court, But the question here is should i let him visit us in the hospital??

honestly yes you should let him come into the hospital to see his baby... you should also call him immediately when you go into labor.. he don't seem like a dead beat or a drugy or abusive. just picture it this way. if the table was switch around would you not want to see the birth of your baby even if you had it in bad with the mother

You let him come see the baby. he is the father. but let him come see the baby when you guys get home. Don't listen to anyone else. You guys must have had some sort of good relationship to even think about moving in together in the beginning. Try to be cordial, your child needs that. Thank God my parents were. and btw, it never screwed me up that they weren't together. so dont let any of these idiots tell you any different... Good luck.

You kicked him out twice, so he went and stayed away.  How does that equate to him pushing you away?



Now you are going to punish him by not giving the baby his name.



You sound like a fruit loop.  You are already using that child to get back at its father, and the child isn't even born yet!  You sound like prime time for Dr. Phil.



If you print off this question and these answers and hand them to your child in 18 years, is he or she going to be proud of you?



The father is better off if he stays away from you.



HOWEVER, your baby is not better off.  Your baby needs his/her father.



Give the father encouragement by giving the baby his name.  Wouldn't the baby want that, too?



Encourage the father to come see his baby as often as he wants:  in the hospital, out of the hospital, on Mars if he wants to.  Let the child get to know his/her relatives on that side of the family.



But leave that poor guy alone.  You're done playing him.



I'd take you to court if I were him.  I'd take you to court to gain full custody of that child from its manipulative mother.



Don't mess up your child by messing with its father.  Sheesh!

It's his child, so yes, let him come visit you.



I'd recommend you both get some family counselling - or at least have a really long talk about how you two are going to raise this child. You need to be talking about and agreeing on financial support, as well as visiting schedules. Counselling will help keep things sane and help work through the issues.



You both have a big responsibility now in insuring that this child has a loving home with everything he needs. You both need to step up to the plate and be the best parents you can be. Your baby's future depends on it.

There are always 2 sides to the story, and it seems to me you are making him out to be the bad guy.  How many times do you expect a person to be humiliated by being kicked out and keep coming back?  So I don't blame him for not wanting to be with you, I am sure you said a few things to make him react that way.  I warn you, do not use the baby as a tool or pawn in your scheme to get him back, that is low.  If you have been the one chasing him, that should have given you a clue to let him be until he came back on his own.  As far as him being the dad, anybody can hand out sperm, THAT does not make you a father, but your actions do.  Even a crackhead can get a girl pregnant, should he fight for custody?  LOL  Extend the invitation to him to see the child, him being out of the pic has made him detached so don't expect a paternal miracle and think everything is gonna be the way you want it cause he sees the kid.  This mess is more your fault than his.

I think you should give the guy a chance to see his child. You made it together and somewhere (between the kicking out and letting) you might have planned to take responsibility in its upbringing both of you. So a lot has happened and we don't know the cause really. let him see his child and then the rest you can talk about.

It takes two to make a baby. The child is half his, half yours. It is no more yours than his, and he has every right in the world to see it. Would you think it was unfair if men carried the babies and got to decide whether or not the mothers could see them?
Involve the father in the child's life because it is the best thing for your baby, even if you don't want a romantic relationship. No offense, but it is not about you, and it would be best for the baby and will make a more stable environment if Daddy gets visitation. If you are not living together, I agree that the last name should be yours, but he should be allowed to choose the middle name. Your baby will feel special and loved. Do not use your personal grudge against him to harm a future relationship between father and child, because that bond is important. A lot of kids grow up and have issues because their dads were never around.



Good luck and for the sake of having a normal child, do not allow your ruined relationship with him to cause harm to a relationship with his soon to be baby.

Of course you let him come see his child.  If you feel comfortable with it, I would even let him be present for the birth.  It could whip some sense into him.  If it doesn't, continue to let him see the child, and seek child support.  As long as he is not abusive, and is in good standing with the necessary child support he should absolutely have access to visit his child, supervised if need be.

It's not the baby's fault you two had a falling out. Let him see you in the hospital, if he is willing to be there to help you with labor do that too. I'm married for 11 yrs and going thru a real rough patch with my hubby I just delivered our 2nd child 19 days ago, I thought for sure he wouldn't be around, I called him to tell him I thought I needed to go to the hospital and he was there right by my side, he held my hand and helped me thru the labor and watched his daughter be born. We are still working on things but that experience helped in a way, I know he still cares and he knows I still want him in our lives whether our marriage stays together  or not I know, he will be there for the children and that is what counts the most.



Good Luck on the situation! Hope everything works out for the best, whatever that may be!



Oh BTW, I don't think he's calling and acting like he cares just because your staying with your parents I think he might have finally woke up and realized the time is almost here and he needs to step up to the plate as a man. Again Good Luck!!!

I don't want to sound rude BUT this baby is not only yours but his too. I think all keeping your child from him will do is make the situation worse. My sister and her partner split up just after having their son, they NEVER speak but it is a mutual agreement that he picks up their son every saturday morning at 9.30 and drops him off at my mums house at 2.30 on the sunday. Now im not saying you don't have to speak but what i am saying is that the love and bond YOU feel with your child, why should someone who is just as important as you to your child miss out on that feeling. I never knew my dad because he left when i was 2 years old. when i finally met him when i turned 18 its sad that i hated him, didn't love him and felt no connection. I am getting married this year and as much as i love my mother and WANT her to walk me down the aisle its sad that i don't even want to invite my father.

Wrong Section...but xmas question?



This will be our first xmas with our son and we have gone a wee bit overboard with his xmas pressies (he will only be 6mths LOL)!!!



But my question is regarding hubby...I want to make him feel special but the only things he want are really expensive....Any cute ideas that i can get him from me and bubs??



He owns landscaping company and loves building/making stuff.  Doing weights, watching sport and having fun at the beach...typical Aussie bloke....



Any ideas??
Thanks

Let your child roll over on his own pace.  Within a couple months he'll be rolling around the room.

play with him..people like to call it tummy time...roll him yourself and work with him on it...ir you can put his favorite toy on the other side so he has to roll over to get it...all babies do it at a diffrent age, and remember most boys do things slower than girls...if he doesnt do it in the next month..ask your doctor..they always have better advice...GoOd LuCk..

My son is 5 months and he is not rolling over not even trying. My niece rolled over when she was 4 months, she is now 7 and she even started to pronounce simple words like mama, papa. I heard that boys are lazy so it may take some time before they start doing anything. I would say don't worry about it, I walked when I was 8 months while my brother didn't walk until he was 2 1/2 years lol.

<question>



My 5month old baby came home with a foul smell...what would you do?



Let me give you a little background as to what happened.....My son goes to a home day care where he is the only baby and the only other child at the day care is like 2yrs old. I chose this daycare when I was returning to work after my maternity leave.



On this particular morning, I rang the doorbell and no one answered right away. When the door was opened for me, my son's caregiver's grandson (who by the way 30yrs old) had no shirt on, with a doo-rag on his head let me in. Well, Ms. R (thats what we'll call her) came from the back of the house, still in her nightgown and the other little boy with her. They both looked like they both just woke up. I was a little disturbed that she wasn't up and ready to receive my son that morning. I shouldn't have had to wake her. I was running late and decided not to question it right then and there.



Well, when I picked my baby up after work. She was still in her night gown. When I got home, took off his pram suit I smelled a very foul odor on my baby. Not to be disgusting but he strongly smelled musty and un-washed private parts (of a woman that is). I had to take my son's clothes off immediately, give him a bath, lotion him up and put on his jammies. My husband was outraged.



I spoke to her this morning about it and she claimed it didn't come from her but from her grandson who she says does not wash up. By the way, if you're wondering, HE DOES NOT EVEN LIVE THERE.



Mrs. R is an older lady of about her 60's or early 70's. I didn't want to offend her bcuz of her age but I had no other choice to speak on it. I don't believe it was her grandson bcuz I asked did her grandson handle my baby. She said no but then why would my baby smell like that if he is stinky?

Help with babysitter?



I have 2 boys and i am going to have twins in 2 weeks, but i need a babysitter. I usually dont like having babysitters because i dont know if i could trust them. My boys are 1 1/2  and 3. I dont know if i should get a babysitter or send them to a daycare center. Ive heard horror stories about having a babysitter, but i guess im a really over protective mom. What would you do put your kids in a daycare center or have a babysitter??

There are horror stories concerning daycares too. However, it all comes down to how YOU feel and what you are comfortable with.



When I go back to work it's most likely going to be at the daycare I worked at when I was pregnant so Noah will obviously be going with me to it.

Depends on your condition,



Have a babysitter, so you can watch their work and what they do to your kids.



But if you can no longer watch them at all, perhaps trusted daycare might help.

Look for a nanny from an accredited agency. They have references and back ground checks and if you have any concerns about the nanny in question the agency deals with the nanny. Also you pay the agency the fee and they pay the nanny.



I have worked in daycares and been a nanny - I would say the nanny is soooo much better - not only that with twin babies around you don't need the germs from the daycare being brought home.



Hope everything works out for you and congratulations on the babies!

New born has clicking sound in shoulders...?



My 5 week olds shoulders make a clicking noise sometimes when you pick him up. (The noise is like when you crack your fingers). Has anyone else had anything similar?

This sounds weird i know but with my last pregnancy i swear i could here little clicks from my tummy, my husband heard it to. It scared me, when the baby was born his joints made that sound, it went away though. Check with your doc to be sure but if he seems fine then i'm sure it's o.k.

However it doesn't say how often you should use them.



Do you put them in every bottle, or every now and then when he displays wind issues??

Bottles for baby? Too many choices?



There are too many darn choices! This is my first child so I have NO experience. I plan on breastfeeding, but pumping more than likely so "daddy" can keep James overnight after a few months.



What bottles worked best for you and your baby (I realize all babies are different lol). Did you breastfeed and express and/or supplement or strictly bottle fed? Which bottle and pacifier combo did you use (if baby took one)?



(Please no arguing over the whole breast/bottle deal lol)

I only breastfeed my baby but some days when I know I will be out long I pump and use Dr. Browns bottles they reduce the air in the bottle so there is a less likely chance of the baby spitting up. I also us the Nuk brand for her pacifier works great.

I breastfeed and they took bottles when I was at work.  I always used drop in Playtex nursers.  When you express milk and store it in milk bags, you can put those bags right into the Playtex bottles and not have to worry about spilling.  And they are BPA which you should be careful of, but not crazy careful.  Some nursed babies will not take a bottle or are very picky about what bottle they will take. My first child would take breast or bottle, didn't care.  My second would take a bottle, but only if it was extra warm like nursing, and my third all but refused a bottle.  I could be gone 8 hours and he would take 4 oz!  At that was at 4 months!! So you are going to have to see what your baby does.  As for pacifiers, my oldest would use any but prefered a Nuk, my last two hated them.



And if you plan to nurse, you really only need a couple 8oz bottles, you don't have to fill them!!

I don't know anything about bottles, lol, but I wanted to give you some advice about pumping.



You have to be careful with pumping that it doesn't reduce your supply, cause that can prematurely end breastfeeding. So, try pumping on one side and feeding your baby on the other at the same time. Pumps aren't as efficient as a baby so if you only pump at a time when you'd be feeding, without the baby feeding from that side afterwards, your body will start to make less milk.

If you saw yourself running low on formula?



if you saw yourself running low on formula, and you had very little money.. would you spend that money on something else, or get what your baby needs to survive?



i just read a question that someone had ran out of formula and was it ok to mix with rice or cereal until monday!!!! keeping in mind, this is friday, and the Baby was 3 1/2 mos old!



i know that if i see i only have a day or two left, i always buy more, so as not to be without, and we have a few cartons stashed away just in case. and if the worst came to the worst i would swallow my pride and ask to borrow some money!



so what do you guys think? even if you breast feed, what would you do in this situation?

I can only tell you what works for us:



5:30 to 5.45ish - rice cereal and a bottle
She usually takes a quick cap nap by 6.15ish
Bath time by 7.20
Story, playtime, or conversation time after bath
6 oz bottle by 8-8.15
She is asleep by no latter than 9.15 most nights.
We are really flexible on the times and dont push her too much. if she seems fussy and tired or hungry earlier than 8 we give her what she needs and let her get to sleep earlier.



EDIT: she is 4 months old.

i found that trying to use someone else routine just made me feel inadequate, cos my wee topsy did not fit the routine! tried Gina Ford, and was at suicide point after 2 weeks.



just do what feels natural, and if not look on the web, cos there is loads of baby books, penelope leach is a genius, and very supportive.
don't get stressed, do what you need to, not what someone tells you to



good luck mrs humpty

My 6 month old baby girl constantly moans and winges. Any idea why!?



She doesn't cry or scream, just moans a lot. Sometimes it progresses into crying but usually it's late at night and she's tired. She can be changed, fed and clean but will still moan. If I move her to a new place in the house, she'll be ok for about 5 minutes then start moaning again. Same for if I pick her up and walk around with her or put her in the stroller. When it goes on and on my patience goes as I've no idea what to do!!! Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Have you talked to a doctor about it? It sounds like she might be in pain? This could also be her sign that she is tired or her way of using her vocal chords and learning to speak.

My 7 month old likes the sound of his voice and frequently makes noises just because he can.  Like, he was screaming in the middle of the grocery store the other day.  And it didn't sound like happy screams, but I knew he was fine.  I bet everyone else there thought it was weird though.  If your daughter is tired though (and it isn't bedtime yet) try reworking her nap schedule so she gets up from her last one a little later and closer to bedtime.  Or maybe you should think about putting her to bed earlier.  She may just be moaning because she is tired.  Also she may get bored easily if it stops temporarily when you move her.  If you play with her and give her lots of attention, does she stop moaning altogether?

She could just be fighting sleep. If this is a new behavior, then I would consider foods you are feeding her prior to bedtime, maybe her tummy is too full?



Mine did that and it turned out that she just got tired of being held and didn't want to miss out on anything. It was frustrating for her that she was sleepy.



Best of luck, mom. If it progresses, I would talk to your doc.

Son won't take his bedtime bottle?



My son (5 months Nov 3) is not taking his bedtime bottle tonight and he seems super hyper..I hate to settle him for bed without his bottle, yet I hate to keep him up late till he's hungry for it......what would you do as a parent? It's already 9 PM and he seems to be getting tired....



</question>



<additional details>



It's already about an hour past his bedtime



Well he starting sippy cups at 6 1/2 months anyway (Christmastime) but he always takes one last good feed before bed....I suppose I am being a little selfish here and I want him to sleep instead of waking a bunch of times in the night to eat instead of his usual 2.



Brown Sugar I already do that....he still gets up twice (at least)......



Thanks to all....he just went to bed...we'll see how tonight goes.

wow. Tough one. You know, maybe he's full for the day. (?) Their eating habits change as they grow so its not always going to be the same routine. It seems like just as soon as you get a good routine going, they go and change it all around....maybe he just had enough milky mommy! I'd put him to bed and be prepared for a night waking. Hopefully things will be back to normal tomorrow. Babies are different every day just like adults. For example -- tonight I just ate half a tub of icecream and tomorrow I will probably starve myself to compensate. ;)

i don't know what to tell you. my children were sleeping through the night by the time they were 4 months old. i never had to get up to give them a bottle. when your son gets ready for his last bottle for the night give him a little bit of rice cereal from a spoon and i guarantee he won't bother you the rest of the night. he will sleep like a baby. lol!

Just put him to bed and let him settle himself - missing one bottle is no problem.



He may not sleep through the night and may need an early mornign feed but if he won;t take a bottle now - don't force it.



Pop him into bed and let him settle - he may be overtired already.

It may be good he is not taking a bottle before bedtime.  If he weans himself from this bottle, it is just one less battle at 12 months when the bottles are supposed to disappear.

I think you need your 4 year old to help you. Ask her to participate in dressing and feeding, then you have time with both of them. If she has a diaper on, who cares about putting clothes on her. If it is that tough, you should eliminate useless tasks.

Remember all kids are different.  Relax is the first thing you need to do.  Your baby will sense that.  Do you have a changing table?  I found that my daughter knew she was enclosed and had to stay still.  If I put her on the floor or on the bed to change her, she rolls around.  Have you tried music, or a nice warm bath to calm her down.

Ahh memories.



Either ask your older daughter to help - that way you get to have time with both of them but to be honest, does it matter that your youngest is dressed?  As for the nappy, use pull ups.  They work just as well as nappies and is easier to put them on and take them of.



I had this problem with both of mine and I made it a game for both of them.  Get her attention by saying, with a pair of tights / trousers in your hand, "Can I have your arm please so I can put your tights / trousers on".  Put them on and see their faces when they know you've got it wrong.  Your oldest will say that they belong on her legs and say something like "noooo they don't look they fit".  Carry on the banter and then say "do they belong on your legs?  Show me".  Ta da they're dressed.



I still do this when they don't want to get dressed - only this time I (try to) put them on me and this gets them into giggles and they take the clothing of me and put it on them themselves.



Your youngest is just trying to be like her sister so let her do her thing.  My oldest learnt to dress herself when she was 14 months and her sister learnt by the time she was 12 months, the oldest was 13 months when she was climbing comfortably the stairs on her own with no assistant and her sister was 11 months so let her do her thing and you will soon find that you're not doing things for the youngest for as long as you were for your oldest.



Good luck.

I was lucky my daughter took to her crib right away.  Pick a couple nights together or a weekend when you are off and just put him into bed.  Let him know that he needs to sleep in there.  Rock him maybe or put him in the swing and then directly to bed.  Maybe he feels cozy in the swing or bouncy.  Try swaddling him up in a blanket.

Help with my 8 month old baby?



my 8 month old isn't holding or trying to hold a bottle yet. i receive state assistance thru wic and the dietitian said i should give him drink with a cup. i felt it was best to wait till he masters holding the bottle first/or when he's closer to 12months (like 10-11 months).what do you think. and also, around what age does the "average" baby begin holding a bottle? thanks!

My son was about 8-9 months when he started holding his bottle. We started introducing the cup at about 9 months per what the doctor told us. The WIC people told us to give the cup at 6 months, but my sons doctor disagreed. Now the WIC dieticians are saying he shouldn't have a sippy cup, but a real cup. He turned 1 on Sunday and I know with my daughter (she is 4 1/2) her doctor told us sippy cups were fine until her 4 year check up (and she has had 3 doctors since birth and they all said about the same thing). Does your son have a pediatrician he sees regularly? I would see what they say and trust them over the WIC people, just tell them what they want to hear. That's what I do LOL.

my son is 5 1/2 months and he's dressing up.  We're not going trick or treating but I want pics of his first halloween and then we're gonna go show him off at his grandma's houses (he has 3 in town, 1 great gramma and 2 gramma's) and they each bought a specail treat for him cuz he's obviously too young for candy.

No, it's not! I'm sure many of your neighbors will think it's a cute idea. Also run him by any family members if they are close, they'll appreciate the idea.



We're not taking Noah OUT but do have a costume for him to wear to greet trick or treaters when they come to our house.

Look around in your area for someone who is holding an Octoberfest or Fall Festival.  Lots of church's and some schools do it.  You can dress up your little one and there are booths etc where they can play games and stuff.  Most of the time they will have a costume parade and a costume contest.  I wouldn't say it was stupid to take a 10 month old trick or treating, but at that age they are probably not eating candy and might not really like it anyway.  A fall festival would be ore fun for the baby and you could still enjoy the fun of dressing him in a costume.

My daughter is almost 12 months.. and she will be dressing up and instead of going trick or treating, we are just going to the local mall. THey give out candy at each store, and even have costume contests.



The reason we are not going trick or treating is because she gets scared easily and I dont want her to be miserable. And honestly if a little kid came up to her and scared her I would soooo want to sock him/ her. lol.

I have a boy who will be turning 5months on Halloween and he is dressing up just to look cute and take pictures and go outside with his older siblings while they trick or treat. Naturally he won't have a bag in his hand, knocking on doors or eating candy. Its just for the fun of it.

why would it? tattoos are just ink injected into your skin. it doesnt get into your blood or into your system in any way to get into your breastmilk and to your baby. its just ink and skin. no big deal. even if you didnt do your research and you went to a bad artist who used a dirty needle and you were infected with something, the only way you would pass it to your baby is through your blood, not your breastmilk.

I wouldn't see why it would. As she gets older she might play or poke at it during feedings because she's curious as to what it is. But affecting her in negative why I don't think that it would. If you decide to breastfeed for a long time like til she's 2 she might ask what it is and you would just have to example.

Blood in stool. Worried or no?



I have been having issues since taking Vicodin..



I've been having a hard time going number 2, and when I do there was  a little red blood in it, and on the toilet paper.  This time I was walking and got a sharp cramp got to the bathroom and kept having sharp cramps before finally mostly liquid stool and some semi hard stool came out, noticed a lot of blood on the toilet paper, then a dark red seemingly small clot spot in the toilet.  I am not on my period.  18 years old.. To be worried or not?



I always thought it was from straining but why would it be in the stool if that were it? hmm.

When you have rent, car note, insurance, cable, cell phone, heating bills. On top of that having to accommodate two babies, it's hard to shop for much else. We don't have much that goes towards food or other necessities unless for the babies. Which is why I'm glad we have a very generous family and Walmart.



On average we spend about $3,206 a month for everything.

We spend around $200 every two weeks on groceries(I'm including Noah's diapers and formula in this and our pets' food). So $400/month on that.



For gas we spend about $160-$180/month. I rarely drive since I stay at home and my husband drives one week out of the month since he carpools with three other guys.



On bills(car payments, phones, TV, credit cards) we spend around $800/month.



We don't pay for water or electricity and we also do not really pay any rent because we live in base housing. His BAH(basic allowance for housing) gets taken directly out of his checks so we never see it.

For My husband, My 8 month old and I with all bills we use i'd say about $3,000.00 but we are trying to cut down on that it's hard but once you start and find ways around it you see how much money you save up and how much you waste on things you really honestly don't need. It helps to right down everything you buy and how much and that means everything even if it's chap stick one day and a burger the next write it down then at the end of the month go through and find out how much crap you buy you don't need or how many chap sticks you buy that you lose so maybe you should invest on buying something like that, that you can hook on something so you don't keep losing it, those sort of deals. Good Luck.

Well, we only live on one income since I am a SAHM, so we try to cut back as much as we can. We have a four year old son (Sawyer) , a 2 year old daughter (Emily), and a 1 year old daughter (Lilly.)



Budget (All monthly)



Rent $800
Groceries $700
Eating out $100
Cell phones $100
Diapers $40 (for one baby)
Gas $160-$185
Health Insurance $210
Life Insurance $140
Internet $45
Car Insurance $100
Pets: $82 (bunny) $126 (cat)
Preemie Meds: $100



So our average budget monthly is about $2728 excluding things that pop up like doctors visits or vet visits.



We get our utilities free :)

Here are our fixed bills copied and pasted right from our budget:
water/garbage	$50.00
Health Ins		$210.00
life ins		$140.00
Electric/gas	$100.00
internet		$43.00
phone		$1.66
Mortgage		$1,050.00
credit card		$200.00
car ins		$100.00



college 529	$25.00
groceries		$400.00
gas



$160.00
Total



$2,479.66



Our phone bill is so low because we go through magicjack which is only $20 per year.  My husband's business pays for his cell phone and gas thankfully.  After all our fixed bills we have a surplus of about $425 for whatever else comes up.

<question>



My 9 month old is vomiting and has diarrhea?



Is it normal and okay for older babies to get the stomach flu? Because I could have sworn that he has been vaccinated for rotavirus by now. Is it possible that he has rotavirus??



Here's what happened:



I was holding him and he shat, and it went out the sides of the diaper and got all over me. I changed him, left him bare bummed for a second on the floor and he went again. I changed him and he went again.



I was holding him and trying to put him down, I breastfed him and then he sat up and vomited all over the bed. It was "projectile" vomiting, I picked him up and he vomited again, all over me.



I sat with him in the rocking chair and he went to sleep. He is sleeping now and seems okay. But I am really worried about him becoming dehydrated. Should I wake him up and feed him and see if he vomits again? Should I let him sleep?



Do you think I should call the doctor NOW, or wait until morning?



He MAY have been exposed to this "bug" at the doctor's office on Monday. This is what I suspect.

A young child can dehydrate very quickly.  Your baby has both diarrhea AND vomiting so a lot of fluid is being lost.  I would call the doctor now.  This has absolutely nothing to do with acid reflux as another person answered.  Be on the safe side and call the doctor.

Call and make an appointment with your doctor in the am.  The doc will see him the same day but it doesnt sound like its a "rush to er" kinda thing.  even if he has been vacinated against the Rotavirus, he will still get sick and still get the flu.  Continue to try to breastfeed or offer him water or pedialite in a cup to keep him hydrated.  i know you are worried but this can wait till the morning.

k I'm mexican and its called the eye. and to put you at ease it doesn't mean they hate the baby. Its just sort of an envy, lust , longing kind of thing. Actually most babies get it when they're just to adorable and you can't get enough of them. My son is one and I have cured him of this on many occasions. I believe it!  My mom usually does it so I'll have to get the details if you want to give it a whirl

Absolutely not! You have to remember the massive changes that are going on inside your baby's body every single day. It's not comfortable! The only way a baby can communicate with you at this age is to cry. So guess what?
She's tired, she cries.
She's hungry, she cries.
She's wet, she cries.
She's cold, she cries.
She's gassy, she cries.
She's hot, she cries.
She's overstimulated, she cries.
She's bored, she cries.
She's constipated, she cries.
She can't reach something, she cries.
She's scared, she cries.
She has a hangnail, she cries.
She doesn't recognize someone, she cries.
She doesn't like the way something smells, she cries.



Understand? Don't fret it. Just say to your mother "Thankyou for your concern, but I can handle this." And know that you can.

The Mexican red eye myth is called a myth for a reason.  It's not true, it's not true whether it comes from Mexican heritage or German heritage (yes we Germans have similar myths like that).  Likely the baby is just teething or she might not be feeling real well, could be coming down with a cold or ear infection, or she could be just going through a fussy stage most babies have periods of time where they are more cranky than usual.

myth's are exactly that, a myth. My husband is mexican and he believes all this weird kind of stuff. One time my baby was crying a lot and he said it's because someone really liked my baby, so he cracked an egg or something weird like that and then put alcohol on him which made no difference. I just don't believe in that weird stuff.

First month there isn't too much change but she should eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, lots of milk and take a folate supplement(to prevent problems with the baby). Hopefully she won't be too sick but dry toast and ginger tea is great for morning sickness.



Here in Australia we have a great oil for stretch marks which is called BioOil, I'm not sure if you can get it other countries but baby oil and Vitamin E cream is also good.
Good luck with your baby-to-be!

Well first off, you might want her to start drinking her fruits and veggies. Like Sunrype fruit and Veggie juice in strawberry Banana. An d taking those prenatal vitamins, and the stretch mark cream that works awesome, is you can get it at walmart. Its called BIO OIL......its awesome. But just for the body not the face. And or Palmers cocao butter formula works great too. Caution on the heavy lifting and such, cuz a growing fetus at such a young time. When the placenta isnt quite formed on the wall of the uterus can tear away. But no need to be too...too worried about that, she has you....lol. And DO NOT let her near the kitty litter, that is a cuz to get toxiplasmosis. Not good for here. But search around, and it will all work out. The best book to get though is. WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN EXPECTING! awesome. It will tell you everything you need to know

Stretch marks- I used Palmer's tummy butter worked awesome. Its really greasy though so I used gloves and only put it on before bed.

How do you hand wash cloth diapers effectively. We don't have a washer and dryer so we use the one at our apartment complex and it gets expensive quickly using the coin machines. And being that I'm a stay at home mom I'd like to wash them by hand as they need to be washed or a few at a time.

13 month old w/ rectal temp of 102.9?



She was perfectly fine all day, though i noticed she started to have a clear runny nose. She went down for a nap at 3 and when she got up at 5 she was burning up. I waited a couple hours to give her anything due to the fact that I thought she was just warm from sleeping, because she sweats when she sleeps. Anyways, Im 40 weeks and 2 days pregnant and 4 cm dilated.. This is not a good time for her to be sick. I feel so horrible for her. What should I do to make her feel comfortable, besides giving Motrin and Tylenol (im going to rotate like doctors always suggest). She ate barely half of her dinner, not much into eating.. But is drinking liquids just fine... Im going to take her temp again in a while. Thanks for any advice. This is only the second times shes had a fever, and first was due to teething, which i think might be the cause this time.. Im not sure.

Pretty high. Can be a viral infection specially that now she started with runny nose. But if she continue with the temperature is better for her to be checked by the pediatrician because now that you are pregnant you don't want that to be more complicated later when you have the baby. Better now. If that tends to be a bacterial infection instead then she will need antibiotics, but as per you said she just started with runny nose and that is possibly viral. BUT bacterial infections can be complications of viral infections.

http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...
I was surprised to learn in medical school that fever, far from being an enemy, is an important part of the body's defense against infection. While a fever in a child signals to us that a battle might be going on in a child's body, the fever is fighting for the child, not against.



Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in humans thrive best at 98.6 degrees F (37C). Raising the temperature a few degrees can give the body the winning edge. In addition, a fever activates the body's immune system, accelerating the production of white blood cells, antibodies, and many other infection-fighting agents.



[...]



A fever does not necessarily need to be treated. If a child is playful and comfortable, drinking plenty of fluids, and able to sleep, fever treatment is not likely to be helpful. Steps should be taken to lower a fever if the child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dehydrated, or having difficulty sleeping. The goal is to bring the temperature between about 100 and 102 degrees F -- not to eliminate the fever.



[...]



Fever is a signal that something is going on in your child. Usually this is a minor illness, but it can be a serious infection, such as meningitis. Any child less than 90 days old with a fever &gt;100.4 degrees F should be examined by a physician right away, to rule out a serious infection (unless there was a DPT shot in the previous 24 hours). Children of any age who have a fever &gt;105 degrees F should also be seen, unless the fever comes down readily with treatment and the child is comfortable. Any child who has a fever and is very irritable, confused, has difficulty breathing, has a stiff neck, won't move an arm or leg, or who has a seizure should also be seen right away.



Even without such symptoms, children under 6 months of age with a fever should be examined by a physician within 24 hours (again unless they just had a DPT), since they may have some infection that needs to be treated. Older children with a fever (6 to 24 months old) who are acting well and have no other symptoms should be seen if the fever lasts 48 hours (or 72 hours if they do have minor cold or flu symptoms).



http://askdrsears.com/html/8/t082100.asp
WHEN TO PAGE YOUR DOCTOR



* Remember, fevers are your body's natural response to infection, and not necessarily a sign that something serious is taking place.



* Low-grade fevers are generally not serious, are easily treated, and can wait until the morning to be evaluated by your doctor.



* Fevers of 101 to 103 (38.4 to 39.5 Celcius) are also generally not serious and can wait until morning to be evaluated, except as indicated below.



* High fevers of 104 (40 Celcius) or higher that quickly come down to 100 or 101 (37.8 to 38.3 Celcius) with the treatment measures below are also generally not serious and can wait until morning, except as indicated below.



So for now, don’t rush to page your doctor. Read through this section, and call your doctor during office hours, or page your doctor according to the following guidelines:



Here are the situations that usually warrant an urgent call to your doctor. If none of these fit your current situation, then you probably don’t need to page your doctor. Follow our treatment advice below and call your doctor during office hours.



* If your infant is 6 weeks or younger, and has a fever of 101 or higher, this is considered a medical emergency. Your doctor should evaluate your infant right away, either during business hours, or in an emergency room after hours. Do not give any fever-reducing medications in this situation (you don't want to hide the fever until after a doctor has evaluated your baby). Be sure to confirm any fevers with a rectal thermometer (if available) before contacting your doctor.



* Infants age 7 weeks to three months with a fever over 101 warrant an appointment with your doctor within the next several hours. You generally don’t need to page your doctor in the middle of the night in this situation if the office opens within the next few hours.

It is normal for breastfed babies to go days without pooping; I think you have two unrelated events here. You probably did not think "Damn cow must've eaten something funny" the last time you pooped differently after eating a cheese pizza; milk doesn't work like that.

I think that blood in the stool is a cause for concern. I believe that it was probably your breastmilk, and the seafood. However, I would take her to the doctor's because bloody stool can signify something wrong with the bowel.

yes it does...although unless you have a really spectacular pump and are super motivated it won't be as much as if you were to just do it naturally (there are natural factors between baby and mother that help the milk supply, way different than hooking up to a machine).  I lost 40 lbs. breastfeeding exclusively for 6 months, and I do not lose weight easiliy.

Yeah it will.
Breastfeeding requires about 500 calories a day to simply produce the milk. You can use those extra 500 calories to add more food to your diet or to help you lose weight after the birth.



It just making the milk is hard work, therefore you lose calories.



LOOK AT THIS
How many calories do you burn while breastfeeding?
• Have you ever wondered how many calories you burn while breastfeeding or pumping? Certainly we know the milk takes energy to produce, but how much?



When I was pumping for my first child I could eat ANYTHING! It was great! I was also pumping over 80 oz of milk per day - we purchased a deep freezer just for my milk supply.



Studies have shown the average nursing mother burns 600 calories per day.

Pumping does have the same effect, since your body will produce more milk in response - which requires calories, of course. It may not burn as many calories, though, since a baby can easily get more milk out than a pump does.

If you're worried about the temperature being to cold you can do it the old fashioned way. Go in your bathroom turn on the hot water (as hot as it goes) but make sure the vapor doesn't get out through any window or doors so cover them up with towels. Just sit in there with you son so the vapor will enter his airways. You can sit there for as long as you want.

As long as you have the heater on it will be fine and not too damp. I would leave it on all night. Also, I recommend that you use lavender instead of eucalyptus. Either is good, but lavender is more effective for colds, especially the flu.

I think humidifiers are not good for children because they breed bacteria and make the room smell like old water even after you dump it out.  I just rub some vapo-rub on my baby's chest and her cold is gone in a few days.

she takes prevacid for the reflux but she still up all night long because she is miserable... i was just wondering if it was ok to put a little bit of cereal in her bottle at night just so she can sleep better and to keep the formula down. if so how much should i give her... i dont mind being up with her all night it just that i want her to sleep for more than an hour at a time. I have heard that a little cereal at night helps fill them up so they sleep longer and also helps keep the formula down so she isn't spitting up all night

Hello...
Well, let me tell you about our experience...
Our son was spitting up (projectile spit up! Out the nose too!) and when we brought him to the doctor for this problem, the diagnosed him with reflux. They put him on 30 days of pepcid, told us to keep him elevated for 20 minutes after we fed him (using a sleep positioner/wedge was perfect for when trying to lay him down) and also to put 1 tsp of rice cereal in his formula (4 ounces)to help "keep the food down". This did work (thank goodness!) and by the time we needed to refill the pepcid, he had outgrown it. We also made the changeover to Similac Alimentum formula (you can read about it on their website - it's for fussiness/colic/gas) At 4.5 months he's still on the Alimentum and now taking 3 tsp of rice cereal in his 8 ounce bottles (also mixed with solids once a day).



I have heard so many conflicting opinions on the cereal in the bottle, but we were not doing to make him sleep better, as some people believe this does for a baby. We were doing it for the medical purpose of keeping his food in his belly and not coming back out. It's worked for us, and I'm sure for many others. But, I can see your hesitation for doing this and I'd always suggest you speak with your doctor.



Also, check with your insurance to see if you are covered for infant formulas. Some insurances will cover a full year for your baby - and if this is the case you can have the doctor write out a prescription which you'd just pick up at the pharmacy monthly. We do this with the Alimentum.



Best of luck - I know it's so hard. You want their food to help soothe them, and it's such a difficult thing to watch your baby fuss after being fed. It's a viscious cycle, but you will find the right balance in time...

A friend of mine is having the same issues. She was told to keep her daughter's head elevated after each breast for about 15 min, she also puts her in her vibrating bouncer if she's having issues sleeping.



Call your Pediatrician before doing anything to make sure it is ok to do. I was told not to give my daughter anything but breast milk and formula for the first 4 months.
FYI: the infant sleep positioners have been linked to SIDS, so please do not use one.

I don't know about cereal... I thought you weren't supposed to introduce that until three months, but you could check the box.



When you feed her hold her as upright as you can, and invest in a wedge, or infant sleep positioner. Sometimes you can find them for about twenty dollars, it keeps them at an incline when they sleep and helps with gas and indigestion.

I just went to my babies dr today and he was put on metoclopram for reflux also (he's six weeks). My sons dr said to keep him upright for a minimum of 20 min after feeding. He also said that placing him on his side may help him sleep longer. all you have to do is roll up a couple receiving blankets to keep him on his side, and that way you don't have to worry about spending money on positioners that you are going to throw away in a couple months. As far as cereal I wouldn't try it until you call the doc.

She is still a little young for cereal. try some water after a bottle to clear her mouth. as far the heart burn try giving her the medicine about a 45 minutes before you feed her to help stop the heart burn before it starts. she is going to be cranky until she gets comfortable and adjust to the formula.

Any exercise you have been doing before you were pregnant is ok for a while when you are pregnant. If on the other hand you break your shoulder it would not be good for either you or your baby.. Get the door fixed and solve the problem before you have an infant in your arms and have to try to shoulder it open and maybe drop the baby.

You should be on antibiotix for that, and when a baby is born with it. they may have to administer antibiotox to your baby as well! Ask a health prectioner on that

I had the bacteria, they just put you on meds when the baby is born and then they check the baby and if baby has any signs then baby gets some antibiotics!  It's no big!  Low risk actually!

Yes and I know the feeling. At first you felt as if your breast were going to burst! It gets better because your body knows now how much it has to supply for your babies demand. Plus your son relieves all that tension. Don't get to happy though cause gravity gets to them in the end. LOL

Base the name on her personality.  My little brother was "baby no name" for 6 weeks.  Then my mom saw a show about a Morganteller horse that overcame great adversaries dispite his problems so because my brother was a premie miracle baby she named him Morgan.

Aww, I'm sure this happens to heaps of people.. so don't feel bad. I'm sure it will come to you when you are walking with her and you see a sreet name, and it just 'comes' to you.. or something like that - it will be a good story to tell =]



You could always mix two names each of you like together.. so if one of you liked Crystal, and the other Isabelle - you could name her Chritsabell.. or a close family member's name.



Here are some names you may not have thought of yet..

if either of you can't decide, perhaps try naming her after someone in the family. for example, if you like your mothers name and his aunts name combine the two for a first and middle name. i think personally loella is a very pretty name. good luck.

It varies between kids and teeth.  No sure bets.



Should be soon though.  Give him things to chew on that will help.  Day old pizza crust helped one of mine.  A wooden peg (clothes pin) another.  One tried to take chunks out of his cot!



there are homeopathic remedies that help the discomfort or you can go for good old kiddies paracetamol at night whatever helps.  2 of mine learnt really poor sleep habits while teething but by #3 I was wise and gave them pain relief before bed and stopped the bad habit befoe it started.



Any grown up who has had a painful wisdom tooth knows the pain so be sympathetic, but try to stave off long term habits.



It will come through -- and the next and the next and the next.



Enjoy though all the firsts are exciting!

Yip lots of us have done it.  Luckily most of us have not had a serious injury though.  something about mothering instincts saves them - but not always us.



I bought a 2nd hand high chair for my 1st and didn't know the straps weren't connected properly.  5 mth old slipped straight under the tray and landed (luckily) bum first on the floor.  I think I cried more than she did!  She was fine tho (but I never told hubby about it!)



Baby # 3 was in my arms when I tripped on something on stairs -- I kept her upright on top of my chest but I was in bandages for  weeks with a chipped bone in my foot.



Accidents happen you can't predict or prevent everything, just minimise what you can and live your life.



Babies are tougher than you think, as long as you are doing your best you will be a great parent!!



NOTE our worst accident was my oldest who (for some totally unknown reason) at the age of 5 put the end of  the rake in her mouth while on the swing.  It hit the ground and stopped dead, she didn't.  Blood from her nose and mouth sure was scary esp as I didn't know what had happened and she was too hysterical to tell me.  She was lucky not to need surgery AND to eat almost exclusively ice cream for a week!

Yup! I was getting my daughter out of her swing one day, and her head fell forward and it redistributed her weight enough to make the swing come right out from under her. She fell right through my hands!! Scared the dickens out of me and we took her to the ER. She was fine (I think it hurt me more than it hurt her!!). Just a little bruise on her head.



But like anything that you carry all the time, it is possible to drop it at some point. It's an accident, but just follow up and see the doctor if necessary. Good luck! Parenting is hard work!!

Before I had children I thought I loved the newborn stage best. Now that I have two of my own, I realized that the newborn stage is actually my least favorite stage of a child's development. The sleep deprivation hits me pretty hard, plus my hormones get all wacky, so while I don't dislike it, it is not my favorite time.



That being said, I love being a mommy. It was the only career I've ever truly wanted and I am so lucky that I get to stay home with my children. My oldest is 28 months and my youngest 6 months and since a couple months ago mommy hood turned the corner to being the absolute most fun time ever. Sure, it has it's challenging moments, what worthwhile endeavor doesn't, but once colic and numerous nighttime wakes ups are gone, it just keeps getting better and better. My littlest is the sweetest baby and now that she's really interactive the true fun has begun. And my oldest, oh gosh, I learned with him that every stage is better than the last, yes, even the terrible two stage is a wonderful one! :)

DEFINITELY wait!  Having a baby really throws your hormones out of wack more and adding sever sleep deprivation and a screaming child will not help matters.  I would find the cause of your depression and anxiety first.  Is it environmental or chemical?  Or is it your way of viewing life?  I would see a doctor and rule out chemical issues (low seratonin) things like that.  If it's not that I would recommend a therapist.  But try to at least figure out where the depression and anxiety are coming from.  It is best to be as on top of your game as you can before you bring a little child into this world.  I'm sure you will work through your difficulties and when you do have that child it will be quite a physical and mental drain for a while but it is worth it!  Take care and good luck!

I'd say you should wait until you are on top of your depression and anxiety.  Pregnancy puts your hormones all over the place, I cried more than I have done in years!  Then when you've just had the baby it's tough.  You're so tired, emotional, stressed and anxious about taking care of your baby.



Good luck with whatever you decide.

I'm a little freaked out... TMI warning!?



Okay, I gave birth to my daughter 15 days ago. I've had the normal bleeding that comes after delivery, with the occasional jelly-looking blood clots, although I haven't had one in about a week or so. Then early this morning (about 4 hours ago), I went to the bathroom and there was a weird looking mass in my pad. I looked closer, and it looked like some kind of clot, but it wasn't dark red or jelly-like, like it had always been before. It was a little slimy looking, with some darker red coloring, along with streaks of pink (almost skin-colored). The part that really scares me is the fact that there was a hard piece of something in there. I'm sorry for the TMI, but I really need some advice on whether or not I should call my doctor, or if it's normal. Please please help!!



Thanks so much!

I had the same concern for my son's birthday.  We were going to do it outside but then the threat of rain caused us to have it inside our small condo and everyone had a great time.  It forced us all to talk and my son had fun going from person to person and playing.  I was able to keep an eye on his while also entertaining the guests.  We had about 13 people total.  If you are going to have more than that and the weather is nice, do a park.  If the weather will be nasty, try your church or a local community center.  Good luck!

Try a church or community center. Sometimes your city will have a Parks/Recreation Department that is reserved only for city residents so that you can get a good deal.  Or ask a friend/aunt who might have space to be the "host?"



We had the same issue - we live in an urban community in a condo. But we have a HUGE family. So we are using a place called Hulabaloo's Clubhouse. Its kind of pricey - but I'm willing to pay to keep the mess, the noise, and the stress somewhere else.



But on a budget there is a lot you can do too.

If the weather is warm, I would agree with the park idea where the kids can play. If not warm, does your apartment have a "clubhouse" your can use or maybe a family member belongs to a neighborhood that does have a common indoor area that could be used.

The hospital will show you exactly what to do, but essentially it is.. everytime you change his diaper (about every 2 hours) you make sure there is no blood coming out, it will look red, but make sure there isnt blood clots and alot of blood. Then you will squeeze the ointment onto a gauze and you place the gauze right over his penis so it is covering it all around, and then you put the diaper on.

I know my hospital send something home with you can use for your son penis. You notice when you get home they have a glaze over it with some special cream to put on it for couple of days. I think they send you some glaze has well. But be careful when you pull off the first glaze after it been done. At times it does stick and the baby can feel little pain and start crying.

the nurses will show and help you learn what to do with it.  i was told to put vasoline on it to keep it from sticking to the diaper for a change.  during a diaper change i was to clean with a warm washcloth (no wipes) and cover with vasoline to prevent sticking.  other than that it heals all on its own

Can I ask why you are planning a circumcision?  If it is for religious reasons, excuse me.  But if not WHY?



I am in New Zealand and it just does not happen here.  Unless for medical or religious reasons.  I can't imagine ever putting my baby through the pain unless I thought it was absolutely neccesary.



I am sorry I am not judgemental, just very protective of children, of course your child your choice.  Please be sure.



As for putting anything on the end of his penis after his foreskin is cut away, I think you should seek medical advice, there may be an increased risk of infection, or there may be something which is part of the surgical follow up anyway.



Good luck for your birth and I hope it all goes well. Parenthood is amazing, full of decisions, well done for seeking advice for your first big one!! (pun not intended) :-)

they give the baby general pain meds to the area.  and when my newest son was born 5weeks ago they had something called a plastibell on him it is a round peice of plastic that you don't mess with other than to run water over during bath time. it should come off in 7 days. on the other hand with a gauze you just keep the area clean and make sure to keep the foreskin pushed back. also vasaline aka petrolium jelly is necessary at diaper changes..

No don't put anything on it just keep him nice and clean down there add a tiny amount of salt to his bath don't use creams or bubble bath either that will only hurt the poor little guy!



But my personal opinion why would you want to do that to the poor little man let me chop the top of your ear off (i know thats mean) but why take something away the god intended to be there as i said that's my own opinion i don't agree with it at all you are causing pain to your baby for no reason and with no pain killers that's an awful awful thing to do

Solutions for wind in babies?



My baby gets really windy after feeding, he's breastfed not formula fed. Has anybody got any tips for relieving wind as patting him on the back doesn't seem to do the trick very well and its very frustrating for both me and him.

You could try things like Gripe Water or Infacol?



Try rubbing his back too, as well as patting him.  Or raising him very slowly from the feeding position.

well i bottle fed but my daughter was extremeley windy 2! how old is ur son? they do tend to grow out of being windy but i know how frustrating it can be. try stretching ur baby out hold them up so their legs dangle n then sit them down n pat their back. try over ur lap.
try stopping ur baby half way through a feed n winding.
my daughter was so greedy she'd be full of wind n eventually sick when she wouldnt part with it.
my daughter is now 3 month old n has grown out of it, i only need to say wind n she burps on her own.



dont worry it will get better.



best of luck xx

No, a baby will only eat when he is hungry, your has a healthy appetite and that's good, you should never ignore the babies cry for food.  They do not eat for the taste like we do as we get older, so when they tell you they are hungry, they are hungry.

that doesnt sound like to much. Sounds just right.  yes you can overfeed your baby but your baby will just probably throw up what he cant fit.  I overfed my daughter once and I was breastfeeding.  She threw up a few ounces all over me!  And today she is still fine.  Dont worry, your doing great!!

No, I don't think you can overfeed your baby, at almost two weeks 5 to 5 1/2 oz seem normal, he might end up staying at that much for some months and what would change is after every so many hours of feeding time  (i.e. 2 hrs instead of 4).  He's growing (and they grow fast) , he's starting to be more active so he will get hungry.



Overfeeding is giving him like 8 ozs at only 2 weeks old for every 2 to 4 hours and you're not, so, don't worry.



Good Luck

That does sound like a bit much. I think its supposed to be around 3-4 ounces but that depends on the size of your baby. They say babies only eat what they need. Speak to your health visitor about how much is enough. Are you still trying to breastfeed?



The link below is quite helpful if you are trying to work out how much is enough.

A babies belly can only hold so much so if he is eating that much and not spitting up the it is okay. Also, you said he wakes for it and that is a sign that he is hungry. My son ate about 2-4 oz every 2 or so hours at that age.

You cannot overfeed a baby if you let him take what he wants.



However, I'm very puzzled by your comment about not having milk yet.  How do you know you don't have milk?  By 10 days most women DO have milk.  And if yours is slow about coming in, the best way to encourage it to come in is to be nursing as often as possible.  Every time you give a bottle you AREN'T nursing, and your body doesn't know that it's supposed to be making milk.



So start putting baby to the breast.  IF there isn't enough milk and baby is getting dehydrated, talk to a lactation consultant about feeding a bit of formula with a syringe or spoon or cup.  If you continue with the bottles your baby WILL end up completely formula fed.

How can I help my 8 month old deal with separation anxiety that's affecting her sleep?



my 8 month old is having trouble sleeping.  I have chalked it up to her separation anxiety. She goes to bed at 8pm and wakes up at 830-845pm.  I put her back to sleep at shes up in another 30-45 mins!  This goes on all night unless I put her in bed with me.  I really don't like to sleep in bed with her, I feel uncomfortable and like I cant get comfortable.  What can I do to get her to sleep in her crib and not wake up so often.  Shes not hot, not cold, not hungry,  I think she just misses me?!

Please help me figure out what doc I need to go to! My infant has rectal bleeding, vomiting and crying spells?



What kind of Doctor do I need to try to find to see my son? A Pedartic Genetic Doctor an Pedatric Immunologist Doctor or some other type of doctor? Here is a good bit of info on him and the things going on with my little guy,  so someone can maybe point me in the right direction. My son is 3 months old and has had rectal bleeding for over 2 months now and vomits a lot! His ped. referred him to a Ped. Gasternologist. The ped gastor. says he believes he is highly allergic to milk protiens. He had his formula switched a total of 6 times and is now on Neocate. As well as Beechnut cereal with every feeding, the Ped. Gastern. told me to stick 2 tsp in for every ounce, however I felt that was way to much cereal, for a 3 month old to be on. He is also on 3 acid reflux medications as well. The bleeding and vomiting subsided for about a week, but now it is all back again and now he is EXEREMLY fussy! I cant seem to do anything to calm him down. He falls asleep crying and wakes up crying! He has had a rough start at life, he was a NICU baby, need to be on a ventalor, cpap, nose cannale, feeding tube, had pnumonia 2x's well in the nicu and had bronctics approx 2 wks ago. He had lung diease as well when he was born and was not able to keep his own oxygen level, they did blood gasses on him several times a day when he was in the nicu, he had yellow jaundice & had to have phototherapy as well when in the nicu. He also need a blood trasfusion when he was a week old, he had surgery for Pyloric stenonis when he was a month old. Nothing seems to be getting better for him. The doctors will try something new with him and the sythpoms subside for a week or two and are right back again. I dont know what else to do or what other doctors to have him checked by! No doctor has done blood work or any test on him. I am getting fed up with the docs. I hate seeing my baby in pain. And feel helpless when I cant do anything to make him better! I thought he may have Necrotizing Enterocolitis but I would have thought they would have tested him for that in the nicu. He has just about every sythpom of it except the budgling stomach. I mentioned it to the gastren. doc and he didnt want to hear anything about it! He is thinking it is the milk allergy as well as acid reflux, well if it is that why isnt the medication working and why is he still having all the samethings still going on! Why do they go away for a few days when they try something new for him then come back. I feel like they are using him as a guiene pig. I dont know where else to turn!



Now today he woke up crying at 615am, his crib, blanket and pjs were soaked with throw up. I picked him up out of the crib and he threw up more all over my shoulder and down my back! His last feeding was at 407am and he only drank 4oz. He had to take his medication when he got up do I gave him that at 630am. I of course cleaned him all up, changed his diaper cause he had popped! The poop had little spots of blood through, today it wasnt bright red it was darker. And the poop was a VERY dark color, hard to tell if it was DARK green or black, I used a permant black mark and made a little mark on the diaper and compared the color to the poop and it seemed to look quite the same!



He hasnt had an fevers, except a small one about a month ago. That went away in a few hours.  And he is gaining weight, atleast when we were at the doctors last he was! Thats why I think the doctors dont feel this is anything to be concerned about! But, I know my baby and I feel there is something more going on with him.  We are going for a second opion for a Ped. Gastnerologist, but cant get in til Feb. 2nd, however he is on a waiting list and if anyone cancels they said they will get him in sooner!



PLease help me! And him!!!



He had an ultrasound, upper gi and an x-ray, they said, they saw acid reflux but everything else looked ok!



</question>



<additional details>



We took him to the ER when this all first started about a 2 months ago and they said they couldnt do anything for him, cause he wasnt running a fever. And that it sounded to be milk protien allergy! I just dont understand that, he DOESNT get anything that has MILK PROTEIN in it and has for over a month now!

i don't know where you live but i doubt the ER will do anything, they will just refer you to a specialist. (except a children's hospital may do more for you than a regular hospital)



have you talked to his regular pediatrician about the second opinion and see if your regular pediatrician could call the specialist to see if they can get him in sooner?



often times if the doctor himself calls the specialist and speaks to him they will fit your baby in sooner.  call your regular ped and ask for them to call you back and explain this and just ask him or her if they could please call the specialist and see if they could do anything to get your baby in sooner for a second opinion because you feel you were not getting enough help from the one they referred you to.  this is really the only way you are going to get in sooner unless someone cancels.  just beg your doctor to call on your behalf (and i do not mean a secretary from his office, the doctor himself should call)



and if none of this works and you still can't get in for the second opinion sooner, THEN consider going to an ER at a children's hospital if you have one near you, but i would go to specifically a children's hospital if you can and hopefully they could get you in with someone sooner.

My daughter also had acid reflex and a milk allergy (that we did not know until 5 months old because we had to switch doctors) and i know how hard it can be my daughter cried for 2 straight weeks with almost no sleep and no eating because it much have hurt so bad. You best luck is to go to a children's hospital. Have the doctor refer you to one. There is something else going on with your son. My daughter also had blood in her poop but 2 formulas later and 2 med later she is finally a happy 7 month! We had to switch doctors because the 1st one told me she was normal which i knew was wrong and later found out she was in more pain because of that doctor. You def have to find out whats wrong. Hope everything turns out good for you guys. Good luck

I would take him to a major medical hospital for pediatrics only (here in CT we have one called "Children's Medical Center" in Hartford and then there's Yale New Haven Children's Hospital.  they're both quite a distance.  I don't know where you live or if any at all but it's worth taking him there to the ER and they have specialists of all kind.



My son, (he's now 15) always suffered from Asthma, pneumonia, rectal bleeding etc (similar to yours) until it came to a point that all he was pooping was fresh blood at age of 9,  No doctor helped until I took him to the Childrens Center and they did an emergency colonoscopy and endoscopy, it turned out that yes he was allergic to milk protein, so he was not able to have anymore milk protein products (not lactose intolerant, which is totally different) and they had him on Orange juice to get calcium and soy foods.  It was a life changing experience for ALL of us and he stayed on that strict diet upto 3 years ago, never again suffered from asthma, rectal bleeding, pneumonia and he's normal now and eats EVERYTHING.  It was a pain but it was well worth it and only temporary.  If I'm not mistaken there's baby formula made from Soy.



In any case, I would take him to a major medical facility specializing in children.



Good Luck and take care.

I'm a little freaked out... TMI warning!?



Okay, I gave birth to my daughter 15 days ago. I've had the normal bleeding that comes after delivery, with the occasional jelly-looking blood clots, although I haven't had one in about a week or so. Then early this morning (about 4 hours ago), I went to the bathroom and there was a weird looking mass in my pad. I looked closer, and it looked like some kind of clot, but it wasn't dark red or jelly-like, like it had always been before. It was a little slimy looking, with some darker red coloring, along with streaks of pink (almost skin-colored). The part that really scares me is the fact that there was a hard piece of something in there. I'm sorry for the TMI, but I really need some advice on whether or not I should call my doctor, or if it's normal. Please please help!!



Thanks so much!

When you first started feeding your babby solids, how much were they eating?



My mom just gave me a few jars of babby food that were left over at her house from little john, so I figured I wouldn't let them go to waste (we will be making sean's food) He ate the whole jar in one sitting...is that normal? It seemed like alot to me, but if he was taking it I wouldn't stop feeding him.



</question>



<additional details>



we're not giving him any fruits for a little while. the reason we started solids is because he wanted more then 8 oz of formula at a feeding, so i just felt he was ready (5 months)

he hasnt had a change in his bottles. he is still taking the same amount of them. giving a child food is not for just the taste..that would be pointless.

that could be normal. but when i started solids with my baby she was only eating a little at a time. i would alternate between the bottle and the baby cereal. you need to make sure that your baby is getting the nutrients he needs so don't just feel him baby food jars. especially the desserts.

Yeah that sounds fine, once Brody got the hang of eating solid food, he couldnt get enough!!
SO I always made sure to give him his formula first, and then let him eat what he wanted from the solids.



Now that he is 7 months, everyday after I pick him up from daycare he eats 1 1/2 containers of baby food, and then before bed he will have his bottle.



He takes 4 bottles at daycare so he is still getting plenty. And he wakes up EVERY night at either 2 am or 4 am. lol darn kid.

First, why do people insist on spelling it babby when it should be baby? Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, I think it's perfectly normal, especially a boy. I do know that I was advised that you should nurse or give your baby his bottle before you give them solids because the bulk of their nutrition still comes from milk.

Sounds normal.  They only eat when they're hungry and if he's inhaling it and enjoying it, that's a good sign, just don't forget to keep him on one solid for like 2 days to see if he reacts allergic to the foods (i.e. squash for two day, carrots for two days, don't mixed them, they're both yellow veggies but if he reacts to one of them you wouldn't know which one, so it's best one at a time) and at 5 months he's ready.

My daughter is the same way. She's a big eater. I started cereal with her at 4 months cause she seemed like she wasn't getting enough nursing. I wanted to wait until 6 months, but apparently she did not. She eats a 4th cup of cereal mixed with a 4th cup breast milk AFTER nursing. I give that to her twice a day and she gobbles it up!

When you START a child on solid foods, it's about letting them experience new tastes and textures....it's not about giving them solids to fill them or give them nutrition really.



When you start solids, you should be giving him just a taste or two, maybe once a day.  When you feed him an entire jar of baby food, then that's one less nursing he'll do or one less bottle he'll be taking.  There are no solid foods out there that can match the nutrition that a baby needs like breastmilk or formula.



Solids should not really be a major part of his food intake until he is a year old.  Breastmilk or formula needs to remain the biggest source of nutrition until the child is a year old.



Until then, you let him have a taste or two, and as the months go on, he can have a little more.  But you should ALWAYS offer the breast or bottle FIRST.  Then give him some solids if he wants some, NOT the other way around.

Sounds normal. The first step food isn't usually alot. But like someone suggested, give him a bottle before you give him solids. Right now he doesn't "need" solids. The purpose of giving it to them right now is so they get used to taking food from a spoon and getting used to the different textures and tastes. And like you, I make my sons food. But I do keep jar food on hand just in case we are traveling, going to grandparents houses, etc. I try to organic brands or regular Gerber. While I know jar food is safe, I don't necessarily like all the additives in them.

Well, personally, one of the things that I hated on all my breastfeeding classes that I attented was that I was not told straight up on how much it hurts and on how some milk duds (spelling?) will not open to spread the milk and what to do to ease the pain, It was all like, caring and loving and easy and support, blah blah blah, sweet talking 100% of the time, fit in some true facts too, loss of sleep, possible colic, chest pains, you'll feel lumps but don't get paranoid, etc etc and I think you'll have more moms looking for you and refer others as well.

I took classes before the birth of my daughter which touched on breastfeeding but did not go into great detail.  I breastfed my daughter and the first couple of days I had a very difficult time getting her to latch and it became very frusterating.  The nurses in the hospital were not very helpful and in fact made me more discouraged.  They would comment on how my daughter really needs to start nursing and made me feel like a bad mother.  My husband talked to a supervisor and thank God, they immediately sent in a lactation specialist who informed me I was doing nothing wrong and that it takes time, she then showed my the football hold which was so much more comfortable to hold my baby and the baby liked it more and from there it was so much better.  So to answer your questions, pleases stress to your pupils not to be discouraged that it takes time and it is not because they are doing something wrong, it just takes time and not to get frusterated.  And show the mother's the different holds, in my classes I was showed more of the basic baby across your lap , this way each mother and baby can find a postition comfortable for them.  Also, provide them with information that there are lactation specialists out there who are happy to help them and there is nothing wrong with asking for help.  Also, go over ways that mother's can sooth the pain and cracking of nipples the first couple of days and again stress not to be discouraged that it will go away.  Breastfeeding was one of the best experineces of my life after those first couple of days, time I will never forget.

Honestly, I went to two breastfeeding classes and read the entire "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding" before my first was born and none of it truly prepared me for breastfeeding. Being told that it can be difficult or how to latch a baby is one thing and experiencing a screaming baby who can't figure out how to latch or the pain that comes with bleeding scabby nipples are two distinctly different things. If you could actually have women try latching with a real, live baby, that would be the best, albiet a little weird. LOL.



The obvious things, like showing a correct latch, what to expect schedulewise, what to look for if a problem like thrush or mastitis arises etc. I would also stress that the beginning weeks might be a little difficult but that it really does get better and is worth the effort. Also, providing the contact information for a really good lactation consultant, more if you have them, would be invaluable. I saw four or five different consultants with my first and it was only the last one that was actually able to help my son figure out how to latch.

breastfeeding was very frustrating for me and i thought i was strange because i thought it was supposed to come naturally, i would cry and get very upset about it, i had a very hard time with breastfeeding and quit after 5 weeks



i have since learned it is that way for a lot of people, not just me.  i think that is the most important thing to know, that it can be very frustrating but it does get better and not to give up and seek help if you need it and that you are not weird, that many mothers have trouble with it.



also showing the different ways to latch on and that it is NORMAL if the baby constantly eats for the first few weeks and also address the biggest concern most mothers have "how do i know my baby is getting enough??"

I am in New Zealand, I have a friend who is Jamaican, who was flabergasted by the fact that antenatal classes included breastfeeding at all -- there is just NO problem with feeding AT ALL in Jamaica - she said.  I asked my midwife about this, she had travelled alot including Kenya, and told me about studies which showed that there is a strong visual element to learning to breastfeed.  That is, that in 3rd world nations where breast feeding is the ONLY choice and it is done completely openly there is no issue with success rates.



In western society, many women are frowned upon for feeding in public places, families are seperated by house, city or whole countries and we don't have the opportunity to observe breastfeeding in action as a natural part of our community.  Therefore we may be missing a huge chunk of valuable knowledge without even being aware of it.



The best possible class, in my humble opinion, (fed 3 babies successfully) would be to have members of your previous classes come along and demostrate FOR REAL breast feeding, to talk about any problems they had and to talk about how they solved those problems.



Your expectant mothers may be nervous as many of us have never seen anyone elses breasts before, so encourage them to get comfortable with their bodies and the natural rhythm of feeding.



And yes breastfeeding did hurt at first and that was OK.  I had a couple of cracked nipples but with support from my sister in law who had overcome major mastitis, I made it through and gave my kids the best start I could.



Good Luck.

The first thing I would start out with is asking the class how many of them know moms who "couldn't breastfeed".



I'd bet nearly everyone will raise their hand.



Then give them the facts that at least 97% of women can breastfeed, and the vast majority that can't have had surgery that prevents it.  Tell them that nearly every woman can, but many give up when a problem arises and that's why you're there....to show them what 'can' happen and how to work through it.



The best thing that I think you can teach is that it's not always as simple as it sounds, but it's worth it, no matter what.



For instance, I had severe pain while nursing for about 3 months.  Everyone said "it shouldn't hurt, that baby must not be latched on properly".  I felt that she was latched on properly, but I saw a Lactation Consultant anyway who verified that she was latched on PERFECTLY.



But it still hurt, a lot.  It brought tears to my eyes every time she nursed for 3 months.  But I was determined to make it to a year, even if I had to walk through fire to do it.  After about 3 months, the pain subsided and I ended up nursing both my kids for just over 2 years each.



My point being is that even if it isn't smooth sailing, moms need to seek support and just don't give up.  Even if it's inconvenient, mom's shouldn't give up.



I see people around me that were like "Oh I tried, but I leaked too much" or "It hurt" or "I'm going back to work, so it's too much of a hassle".



I think it would be great if you could remind women that it's not about them once they give birth, it's all about the BABY and breastmilk is what's best for them, and that it's their responsibility to do the best for their baby at all times, even if she leaks, it hurts, she has to go back to work, or whatever else.



Believe me, if I can get through the pain for 3 months, anyone can.



I also think that you should tell them all the facts about that your milk doesn't come in for a few days and that's NORMAL, and the baby does NOT need formula during that time.  Explain what colostrum is and why it's so important that a baby have only the colostrum until the milk comes in.



I would also be sure to let them know that it's FINE if the baby nurses more than their friends or that it seems like that baby is always hungry.  Many women see this as a sign of not having enough milk, but it's almost always NOT the case.  Remind them if they're seeing wet diapers (I forget how many a day), then the baby is doing just fine.

Moms dealing with Depression?



I am starting to feel guilty. I use to go for walks with my 10 month old DD and go a few places often but lately I can't seem to get motivated. I have been dealing with depression for over 15 years but I thought I would do better than this. I would love to take my DD to things at the library and other places but I have only been out of the house twice in two weeks. The first was on last Sat. for an hour and tonight my DD went to grandmas so my husband and I could go to the movies. I feel guilty that I can't seem to do more for her, it is hard even going to new places for me. Anyone else going through something similar or advice to give?

Since you have ,been going thru this 15 years you know the drill. Depression is affected by diet, stress, drugs, and exercise. You have to get walking again. That will help increase the natural happy drug in your brain.The sunlight is also great for depression. You feel yourself slipping, I can relate. It is good that you recognize your symptoms and acknowledge it before you are too far depressed. So get to walking again, check your diet, and remember baby picks up on your emotions.Call a friend, heck e-mail me. Have you spoken to your MD about it? Are you on any birth control? Some birth controls make the hormones so wacky that it causes depression.

Don't feel guilty.  You need your time.  It is better for baby that you do take a break.  I know of lots of mommies that go through this.  If schedule permits try to take an hour out each day w/o the baby, or at least try a couple times per week.  If you are loving, nurturing, caring for you baby there is not more you can do.  Reward yourself.

As a mom of a almost 3 year old I totally know how you feel. Some days  getting out of bed is more then I feel like and can or want to do. About 6 months ago I started seeing a therapist. She has helped me so much on dealing with littlest things to what I feel are huge problems, and never  makes me feel like a bad person. If I can suggest anything to you it would be go see some and also talk to your doc about maybe getting on something to help your depression. I was on meds for over a year after having my daughter. I wish you luck and happiness.

I know the feeling...you're in good company here. =) I had my son in January, and chose to ignore the signs that I was developing depression because I convinced myself that I didn't have time to get depression. I was in my last few months of nursing school, working part time, my hubby works 2 jobs, and of course money is always an issue. Everything kept piling up until I was horrible to be around. My mood swings were horrible, and I would be angry or crying for no real good reason.



I felt like I wasn't being fair enough to my boy. I was still attentive, but I felt like he was missing the fun part of me. When he was 5 months old I saw a doctor, and went on Lexapro for a couple months. Now my son is 9 months old and I am happier than I ever was. I was able to finish school and am enjoying quality time with my family.
My point is...if you don't feel like yourself...get some help. See a counselor or a doctor, depending on how you feel about medications. After dealing with PPD I am not at all ashamed to admit that I used medications to help me come back to normal, it saved me a lot of heartache. Don't feel guilty, or beat yourself up, it truly is something that we cannot control. But please do get some help. It's worth it...I promise. =) I hope that helps.

Extended rear-facing mommies: I think it's time, I am so sad!..?



My grandma bought a cheap car seat for her car for when she has to pick my daughter up from day care. The kind she got is not a convertible car seat, so when she had it put in her car it was obviously forward-facing. She picked Ava up from daycare today and took her to her house, then brought her home a little later. Then a little earlier tonight my mom was taking her to the store, which the car seat in her car is rear-facing. I had a hard time getting her to sit in the car seat. Usually she doesn't want to sit in the car seat, but I figured it was normal.. but tonight it was worse. So, I am thinking I am going to turn her around so she's forward-facing.



But, the problem is... I feel terrible for turning her around since I know it is best for her to be rear-facing.



How do I go about turning her around? This is a lot easier for her, because she likes being forward, but a lot harder for me to deal with because I want her rear-facing.



</question>



<additional details>



Ava is 15 months, BTW.



I know she is old enough to be forward-facing, but it is much safer for her to be rear-facing! I know she can "legally" be forward, but I didn't want her to be.



Cali - Just wondering if you can explain to me why you think a child is safer forward-facing?



Do a little research and you will find that rear-facing longer than a year is a LOT safer than forward-facing!

This may sound a bit harsh...



Is it worth more trouble dealing with the possibility of internal decapitation, or more serious injury, god forbid.... or dealing with the obstacle of getting her into the seat, rear facing?



My mom has a forward facing seat, and mine is rear facing... My son has to deal with it.  Safety first.  That's more important then weather or not he likes it or not.



Personally, I'd stay rear facing till she's outgrown the weight limit of the seat.  Trust your gut.  You are questioning yourself for a reason...



How about a distraction with a cracker, or juice to get her to get into the seat, rear facing?

I know, I knew someone would say that to me when I posted this question. That has gone through my head (about her being happy).
But, she screams the whole time we are driving until I get her out.
I think I will wait it out and see if it gets any better before making my decision.
Thanks :)

After 12 months its fine for her to sit forward facing. She probably likes it better this way because she can see out the windows a little better, along with seeing whoever is in the front seat.



Alyssa is 15 months old as well and she loves the new forward facing car seat, as i do because i can see her, and hand her a toy or her sippy cup if i wanted to.

Children over one can safely face forward, so don't fret about that. I had a hard time when my daughter turned forward facing. It was nice to see her face and be able to hand her things, but it was just another step to her growing up and no mom wants that! Good luck, and do what you feel is best for her.

honestly i think it is ok for u to switch her to forward facing seat .. im in canada and legally it is ok for a child to sit in a forward facing car seat at the age of 12 months and onwards..also the weight counts..i switched my son to forward facing when he was 13 months old. he always refused to sit in a car seat and even now he is 22 months he hates his car seat.. the battle will go on no matter what. ur trying to be a good mother but u should be happy that someone can come and take care of ur child for a while. my family and my hubby's live very far away and i am raising my son alone. im 24/7 with him and at times i really wish someone can take him away so that i can get a break. i honestly dont think so that it is as big a problem.

I feel your pain, lol.  Aidyn will be 2 in a few weeks and I think we're going to turn her around then.  There have been a couple of times she has ridden forward facing (when we went to visit G&G and for the life of me I couldn't get it in right rear facing but I could forward facing--she was over 12 months and 20lbs so we were legally okay but prefer rear facing for the added safety).  She also seemed to prefer forward facing but has never put up a big fight about rear facing.  My best advice would be to try to continue rear facing and see if she'll stop fussing so much about it.  But if you do go forward facing be sure to take it in to have it inspected for proper installation.

I guess you have two choices to make, Mommy.........either keep her backwards facing or turn her forwards facing. At this point, there is going to be pro's and con's either way.
You keep her backwards facing, and she's not happy. *But* you will feel like she's safer. You turn her around, and have a happy baby. *But* you might worry.
You just need to decide which you can live with. But remember, that any decision can be changed. If you want, turn her around and see how you feel. If the guilt/worry is too much, turn her back around. She's 15 months, she'll get over it...LOL.

How about putting a mirror at her eye level so she can see you and what you're doing?  Then she won't feel so alone and it will give her something besides a plain seat to look at.  And let your grandma know why you want her in a rear facing seat-back it up with written articles as proof if you need to.  As a mom, it is your first job to protect your kids, especially from those who "don't know any better" and think that the old ways are still the best.

To all the mommies that don't know the benefit of rear facing check out youtube type in careats rearfacing crashtests. Those videos will help you to better understand this Qers worry. Don't do it! keep her rear facing its much safer. Even though it's a struggle if something were to happen and rear facing could've prevented it then you'll never be able to live with yourself. Just keep putting here rear. I don't even know why it's legal forward facing at a year it's way to early. Those videos put serious fear into me maybe they'll help you decide to! i don't know the exact name of the videos theree's a few email me if you can't find them. Good luck with your decision!

The general rule for forward facing car seats in over 1 year and over 20 lbs. I would be more concerned with the quality of the car seat purchased. Since you mentioned it was a cheap one, I would check the NHTSA rating. If it has a high rating, your daughter will be well protected.  If it's not, you really should invest in a good one, even it's just to pick up from day care. From someone who had a devastating car accident as a child, and only 1 mile away from my house, it's important to remember that they can happen to anyone, anytime, and anywhere, and the only thing we can do is be as prepared as possible.

What is your fever reducing strategy of choice?



My 10 month old has a bug that he caught from daycare. His temp has been fluctuating between 101.9 and 102.5. He also has a bit of a rash and he's been throwing up. My husband is at the doctor's with him as I type this. So I am not looking for anyone to diagnosis him...but curious what other mothers do to bring down a fever.

Infant tylenol and motrin (alternate between them every two to three hours) and taking of sock and dress them lightly is all that is needed.  Other wise, the fever has to be about 104 before bothering with other means of cooling them off such as cool baths.

When my son had a temp of 103/104, my doctor said I could have saved myself the trip of going to the ER and given him both Tylenol and Motrin. Alternating between the two every few hours( or what the directions say). I was giving him Tylenol at first and when it shot up to 103 I took him in and after sitting in the ER for 4 hours, they told me to give him Motrin and sent me home. Oh well, better safe than sorry.

Care with a bath, if they get cold while getting out, it could spike their fever up higher. Keep him bundled up and try not to let him get too cold while drying off.



I use Tylenol or Motrin and alternate between the two every 3 hours and don't have any problems with keeping the fever down with it.



Edit - I just now noticed you said he has been throwing up...In that case it might be hard to keep Tylenol or Motrin down him...Well I suppose the bath might be the best solution.

I have four children, and my fever-reducing strategy of choice is nothing.  A fever is part of your body's method of fighting off germs.  We don't routinely do anything to bring a fever down.  If a child is absolutely miserable (like a 1 year old that cries even when being held), then I'll give tylenol as needed, but otherwise nothing.  I'd probably say that we medicate less than 10% of the time that any of us have a temperature.

A fever us a body's natural defense against disease...so in my opinion, it's best to just let it ride as long as it doesn't get passed 103-104.



By administering fever reducers, you're actually interfering with your body's natural defenses.  Now that's all fine and good when you're talking about a grown up that can "suck it up"...but with a little one...you may have to find alternate methods of dealing with the misery that comes along with the fever



If the child is uncomfortable, then a tepid bath always works and seems to cheer mine up...although...the effects of a bath are short lived in my experience.



At night I'll give him Tylenol or Motrin just because obviously I'm not there to make sure he doesn't spike....but during the day when I'm supervising his condition...I try to let his body do the germ killing the way it was designed to and avoid unnecessary drugs as much as possible.

A fever is your body's natural defense, weakening germs.  :)  It's really cool!!



You don't need to give meds, in fact that leads to the reduced fever, leading to more illness since the germs are stronger at a lower temp.
Anyway, the only real worry is chilling or overheating your child, not the fever itself.  Your body will NOT cook itself at high temps.



When my daughter has a fever, we simply offer lots of fluids (she nurses, which is just great during illness!!), and keep her from shivering or sweating.  Lukewarm baths help if she feels really hot, but we also do not want to give her a chill.
It passes just fine!!  Last week she was at 101.5 for a couple days, and then it was gone.  :)

I have two little pumpkins, 8 weeks old. Daddy picked out the outfits for them right when the store had them out. I took out my 5 year old Star Wars Fanatic as Darth Vader, while Daddy and the girls passed out candy. Today the girls are going to the school with me to help at my sons Halloween Party in their little costumes. My son his first year was a lion and we just sat on the porch and passed out candy. I don't allow my kids to go out and collect candy till they are 2, when it will be them enjoying the candy, not the adults.

Does your baby do this? ?



We think our son( 10 months) is so funny. He will be in the middle of doing anything and if he hears the theme song for The Office or Golden Girls, he stops instantly and stares at the tv. Once the song is over he goes back to doing whatever he's doing. We find it especially cute when he's in the middle of crying because he'll stop and then go right back to crying once it's over. Do your babies have a theme song they respond to like this?

Baby refusing feeds, could it be Milk Protein intolerance?



Ok, I have quite alot to say, so here goes!



Our baby (Harry) is 13 weeks old tomorrow. Since around 2 weeks, he as struggled taking his milk. To cut a long story, he was refusing milk, gewtting very upset each and every time he was awake. We tried him on Cow & Gate comfort one milk. I believe this is thicker milk. He was having Colic on regular nights too. The comfort milk was helping a little but Harry was still very unhappy. We went to see a specialist who suggested that Harry could be milk protein intolerant. Both our nephews have it so sit could run in the family? He prescribed us some Pepti-Junior milk which is virtually Lactose free (&lt;1g) Before trying the milk, we gave Harry Colief whick coupled with Comfort milk, eased his symptoms considerably. He was feeding vvery well. However, he was still getting very upset when awake and was obviously in pain. However, we had NO COLIC. Since Monday, Harry has been refusing comfort milk and the Colief had made his poos very runny. We started the prescribed Pepti-Junior (Cow & Gate) last night. He had 8oz in the night over  feeds 4 oz each. However, this morning, he has only had 3.5 ounces and has been refusing the feed. He has also been bringing a clear, watery liqued which has an acidic smell to it, back up after feeding and then refusing again. We spoke to the Doctor again today, who has advised to be 'patient and persistent' with the milk over the weekend as the intestines need to time to adjust. However, I am concerned that if Harry continues to have so little, he could become even more poorly After all this, I have a few questions, if anyone could help or had similar experiences:



Is it common for babies with this to take time to adapt?



How quickly should there food uptake increase on this new milk?



Are there any other types of milk that could help Harry?



Could it bne Reflux and if so, how can this be improved



Sorry for the length and depth of this question but any advice from those  in the know or who have had similar experiences would be most grateful. Thank You...

What a bunch of rude people on here. You clearly said that you have already been to a doctor.



Lactose intolerance in babies is very rare, so its hard to say if the lactose-free milk will help.  Milk protein allergy is actually more common.  If the lactose free milk doesn't help, soy milk would be the next thing to try, but 50% of babies who are allergic to milk protein are also allergic to soy.  After that you have to switch to the crazy expensive hypo-allergenic milk (Nutramigen here in the US).



Your doctor is only asking you to wait a few days, so I would take his advice and see if Harry adjusts.  Changing his formula several times over the next few days could make the situation worse rather than better.  Good luck - I know its heartbreaking when your baby doesn't feel well.

My son is 5 months old. He won't sleep in his crib.  What do I do?



It started about 3 weeks ago. At first I thought it was teething or the steroids the doctor put him on to clear up his excema.  Now I'm not so sure.  He will only fall asleep if I am holding him. If he sleeps in his crib he will wake up twice a night, if he sleeps in our bed or on the couch then he will sleep all through the night.  I don't know if its something i've done wrong or not.  If anyone knows what I should do to get him back to his crib I would really appreciate  some help.  Thanks

I Co-Sleeped with my baby... and as long as you don't mind. Go for it. i know its contraversal but for some people it works! If you are not or it... you just have to keep putting him back, even if he wakes up put him back in the crib. If he knows thta he can cry & mommy will come get him... he will.
When she was old enough I went staright to a bed... she felt trapped in her crib (or something?) & wouldnt go in it for nothing.

Sounds mean, but let him cry for a while by himself in the crib before you go in and comfort him.  Extend his crying time each night.  Eventually he will learn to comfort himself.



Maybe also some music or white noise will help.

You should let him sleep in his crib. If he keeps sleeping with you on the bed he would probably keep doing that until he gets older. You should make him get used to his crib now or it's too late. He might get used to it in a week or so. If he cries just leave him be until it gets out of hand. If That happens  just carry him until he falls alseep but  put him back in his crib. And don't carry him too much. It could spoil him and make him think he can have everything he wants by crying.
You wouldn't want to spoil him at such a young age.
Well I hope This works  and Good Luck.

Sleeping with him for a while will be beneficial, to your son. You can try bringing in his crib next to the bed you sleep in and having him surrounded with a body pillow and see if that will keep him comfortable. and later change this arrangement gradually as he grows out out of this stage,or his eczema clears up, and he is off the steroids. It is nothing you have done wrong, you have the best instinct that anyone can have for what is good for your son, you are his Mom. Your son now needs to feel the warmth and comfort of him Mom, in time he will grow to get stronger and want to be on his own more, to explore the world around him.

Twice a night is not a lot of waking for a 5 month old.  That's pretty good!  And transitioning to a crib does take some getting used to.  But if you stick with it, and are consistent every night, he'll get used to it!  I know, if I had the option between a full night's rest, and my sleep being interrupted twice, I would be very tempted to choose the full night's sleep!



Just be patient and consistent.



Sometimes babies like to sleep at an angle.  So you could roll up some bath towels and put them under the head of his mattress so he's a little more upright.  Make his crib as comfy and inviting as you can.



Good luck to you!!

Is there a reason why you want to wean your baby so soon?  If she won't take formula, I would simply try expressing breastmilk instead of giving it to her straight from the breast.  How does she handle drinking out of a bottle?  We used the Nuk bottles and my son had no problem transitioning from boob to bottle.

Check that she is not allergic to something in the formula... our daughter would NOT drink formula until we discovered (trial and error) that she couldn't process bovine dairy products.  When we switched to soy formula, she settled down and took all we'd give her, and my wife was greatly relieved.

Yes, keep trying.  It made my son SO MAD when I quit breastfeeding and switched him to the bottle.  He was only about 12 weeks old.  He would spit out that bottle and look really mean at me and complain - he made it clear he did not want that bottle.  It took about a week before he went along with my plan.  I would breastfeed him at night - so we could all sleep and mostly give him the bottle during the day.  They don't like the switch, but they will adjust.  Keep trying.

I'm a bit puzzled as to why you are wanting to wean this early.



If you are having breastfeeding problems, I'd encourage you to contact a lactation consultant for help in solving the problem. Most early problems CAN be solved with a little time, help, and positive support.



If you must wean for some other reason, then just be patient.  Try different bottles, different formulas, and try having someone else offer the bottle.



If there is no reason you have to wean ... why not just continue?  Breastmilk is, by far, the best food for a baby, and EVERY medical/nutritional organization recommends breastfeeding for, if at all possible, a minimum of a year.

Is there a reason why you don't want to continue breastfeeding? Did you specifically want to provide her with formula?



If you aren't going to continue with BF you will probably just need to persevere. She is used to the taste of your BM and also if it's her first time using a bottle that can make a big difference as it wouldn't have felt the same for her. Other times, some babies just refuse formula. Best of luck

When I switched my daughter to a Low Iron form of Enfamil, the doctor recommended mixing a little of the new in with the old.  Then half and half, then a little old with the new, and then finally, just the new stuff.  I did the same when I switched her over to milk.  I think that babies have an easier time when it is not such a shock to their system.  Good luck!

A quick change could upset his stomach.  A gradual change would be better for him.  Start giving him a bottle a day of the goodstart, then increase it everyday.  Although goodstart inst soy.  So it will probably hurt his stomach either way you do it.  My son is on goodstart.

I have been through the whole deal of changing babies formula several times, and though they claim they are all the same with the same ingredients that is so far off, I did with my first born switched her straight from one to the other due to her having tummy problems with the first. The switch resulted in tummy problems done in only one day. My second child was switch due to WIC situation as well, we did the half and half for each bottle for a couple of days finishing up what we had purchased, there never seemed to be a problem.
Now you never know how a baby is going to adjust, they are not all the same, you might want to start it off 1/3-2/3, it all depends on how sensitive your babies tummy seems to be. I would also be sure that while making this change to not be offer anything else new to the diet, too many new things at once can really cause tummy upsets, and maybe even allergic reactions that you can pinpoint as to what caused it.

When you buy fish from the fish market you can ask the seller if the fish contains mercury, I do this all the time. Your other option is to buy fish from the fishery rather than buying salt water or fresh water fish. You can also ask the fish seller where the fish came from, I know at the grocery stores seafood department it is noted in front of each fish. Another good idea is to ask your childs pediatrician. Good Luck!

This is a hard question.  My brother's son's pediatrician (who was our pediatrician when we were kids) told him to feed his 18 month any kind of fish since he is over a year old.  My daugher's pediatrician (they are more modern/associated with the Children's Hospital in our area) told us when she was a year absolutely no fish.  So I didn't ask again.  But when my brother told me what his pediatrican said, I asked my daughter's pediatrician again when I took my daughter for her flu shot.  She looked appalled that I could ask such a question and told me absolutely not, no fish until the age of 3 and even after that in small quantite because their digestive system even then is still developing and fish harder to digest and because of allergy concerns.  I then did some research and the magic age seems to be 3 but then I found some conflicting information that feeding babies under 12 mths. fish prevents Eczema.  But like I said we had two totally different opinions.  Personally, I followed

It doesnt neccesarily means she wants to eat, shes just interested in what you are doing, it looks strange to her because she doesnt do this.
Many people make the mistake of thinking this means they are ready for soilds and thats not the case.



Signs that baby is ready to eat are being able to sit up well, having the pincer grasp and hand to mouth coordination as well as not having the tongue thrust reflex, where they spit the food out with their tongue.

Does your baby eat inconsistently?



My baby is ten weeks old. He eats about every 3-4 hours. Sometimes he would eat only 2 oz, sometimes he would eat 4 oz. At the end of the day, he eats between 20-24 oz, and he weighs 12.4 pounds. Does your baby have a feeding like that too?

<question>



Is there anything wrong with feeding store-bought fresh mushrooms to a baby over 12 months?



I have been feeding my 16month old mushrooms for a few months now.  I waited until she was atleast 12 months, which seems to be the alergy 'over-the-hill' age.  But when I mention this to other mothers in my town they think I'm crazy, and that its bad, or harmful.  My husband is very easily lead and doesnt want me to feed them to her anymore, but she loves them and mushrooms are so healthy....I have always known them to be the 'meat for vegetarians' (lol, not that she is one)



And please back up your answers, I don't want just opinons here.  I would love it if you could list a site to back up your answer.  Or tell me what your doctor said if you have had a similiar experience.  But I will ask her doctor on our next visit anyway.



Thanks all!!



</question>



<additional details>



Oh, and I am cooking them well...I am not giving them raw or anything.  And I can't see why they would be more difficult to digest than meat which I was told by my doctor to give from 9 months. oh and according to Wiki they are high in fibre and provide vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, biotin, cobalamins, ascorbic acid and are also a source of some minerals, including iron, selenium, potassium and phosphorous.  Sooo.....don't know where the first answerer is really coming from.  And you didnt really list a source except vaguely a doctor, but you didnt actually say that your doctor literally told you this.  So....Im not going to take much stock in what you say, but thanks.



Oh thank you for the other answers so far.  I will check out that wholesomebabyfood site!! :)



Maybe its because I was brought up with mushrooms,  and brought up with the idea that they were really good for you.  I mean difficult cultures have different ideas.  My best friend from the Cheq republic won't touch pumpkin, because she says its pig food.  And where I live now in Greece they have a dish that is intestine soup.  So, I guess it depends where you grow up.  And also if you are not a regular mushroom eater, you wouldnt know that you should actually peel off the top layer so no probs with dirt then.



Which is very easy to do if you know how.



I am only asking because I like to get people's opinions from all over the world, because they differ so much.  Like here in Greece they start babies on solids at 4 months.  But it seems to be the recommendation in the US to start at 6 months.  So, I like to know what other people do.

Any doctor will say that any kind of mushrooms is NOT A BABY FOOD AT ALL. They are VERY HARD to digest product and don't have any vitamins.  Try to google "baby diet mushroom" and i'm sure you will find that "no mushrooms are recommended until at least 3 y.o."

it says here that mushrooms are fine for a baby between 8 and 10 months , so go for it!



A baby at 12 months can eat most things, provided they are cooked well, people worry too much.
As long as they dont get one particular food too much, theyre ok , its a case of trial and error.

A google search turns up NOTHING to suggest that mushrooms are harmful for toddlers, and lots of 'toddler-friendly' recipes that include mushrooms.



I'm at a loss to come up with any reason they would NOT be ok.  They are not allergenic or a choking hazard.



EDIT: I just did as USAgirl recommended and googled 'baby diet mushroom' and still found nothing to suggest that mushrooms are harmful for a 16 month old.  (My own search was 'toddler mushroom.')

Mushrooms are a good source of vitamin D actually. It is the only vegetable that has vitamin D. You are right about it being the vegetarians meat, they are very good for you. If you have already been feeding them to your baby and have not had any problems I don't see why it would do any harm, although as you said check with the pediatrician anyhow.

Ask the experts if you want expert opinion. After you have been feeding them to your baby for months, I don't know why you are even asking. And if you are really concerned and want to put your husband's worry at ease, why not call your doctor? I don't think of mushrooms as all that healthy in a steady diet. My guess would be to make sure they are well-washed, since they are often covered in dirt, and let her continue to eat them. I cannot say I ever fed them to a baby. And I would see no reason to do so. I wouldn't pay any attention to anything any other mothers say. Do what you feel you want to do.



You can go on line, as several of your answerers have and get all the information you need, if you choose not to call your doctor now.  Do what you think is best. She's done OK for all of these months. Good luck.

Any biological father has rights to their child unless they are terminated by the court. Although most times the man would not pursue those rights becasue he would be charged with the crime and in prison. The rights/visitation would of course be limited but this has happened.

I would like to dye my soon to be baby boys cloth diapers blue, I can't get over how much more it costs to buy them already dyed. Anyhow I will be using the dyed diapers as burp cloths not as diapers (using Fuzzi Bunz for that). Serious answers only please... Thanks!

I wanted to dye my son's changing pad covers red (They were hand-me-downs from a girl, so pink), and his room is blue and red.  I bought some R.I.T. dye from the craft store, and it worked great... but now he's three months old, and red STILL gets everywhere every time the changing pad gets wet.  It's a pain to have to wash it separately -- I did accidentally dye my husband's socks pink... oops!  I've gotten his clothes even dyed in little pink splotches from him wetting on the changing pad while I'm changing him.  Basically, even though I thought I was saving money and being frugal, I wish I'd just bought blue or red changing pad covers!!  (PS -- I'm not sure I would dye burp pads, because when they spit up and get them all wet, that blue dye is going to transfer right onto yours and his clothes!!)

he is not in his deep sleep mode yet, usually takes about 20 minutes after they fall asleep. When they are in the light sleep they will wake up when you put them down. Wait for the hands to be relaxed not fisted and a sure sign is when they their limbs go limp, like their arm is dangeling. Once that happens you have about 60 minutes before they hit that light sleep again. Of course check the obvious, diaper, comfort of clothing, a full tummy always helps. When I know mine is tired and she is fighting it I will put her on my shoulder and pat her back, walk around the house and make a shhh shhh shhh sound. That sound reminds them of the womb. You could always drive around the block or mine falls asleep in the stroller. I've strolled around in my house in the stroller, from room to room. Make sure there is as little stimulation as possible like the t.v. Just a few ideas. Good luck.

My baby will sleep if I lay next to her and breast feed.  If you can, give it a try.  If not, get a bowl of cereal ready for your two year old and a DVD for the TV, maybe your two year old will lie down with you two and watch TV while you get a little more sleep.



Also, try to "swaddle" your baby in a blanket, that helps them feel secure and makes it easier to sleep.



good luck

My son is 5 weeks old today. One thing that gets him really sleepy is when I give him a nice bath, get his hair washed, massage/lotion his little body, dress him in a nice warm pajama and give him a warm bottle. He's fast asleep by the time I am burping him. Needless to say I don't do this every single night, but it has worked each time I have.

first make sure he's warm because if he's anything like my son he wont sleep if he's not warm . Try feeding him cause he might be hungry and if this all fails lay him on your chest face down , and gently pad his back as if you were burping him. good luck :)

31 WAYS TO GET YOUR BABY TO GO TO SLEEP AND STAY ASLEEP EASIER
http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070300.asp
#
TRANSITIONING TECHNIQUES



Many infants need help making the transition from being awake to falling asleep, which is really a prolongation of the bedtime ritual that conditions baby that sleep is expected to soon follow.



# Nursing down. Nestle next to your baby and breastfeed or bottlefeed him off to sleep. The smooth continuum from warm bath, to warm arms, to warm breast, to warm bed is a recipe for sleep to soon follow.



# Fathering down. Place baby in the neck nestle position (nestle baby's head against the front of your neck with your chin against the top of baby's head. The vibration of the deeper male voice lulls baby to sleep) and rock your baby to sleep. If baby doesn't drift off to sleep while rocking, lie down with your baby, still in the neck nestle position, and let baby temporarily fall asleep draped over your chest. Once baby is asleep, ease the sleeping baby into his bed and sneak away.



# Rocking or walking down. Try rocking baby to sleep in a bedside rocking chair, or walk with baby, patting her back and singing or praying.



# Nestling down. For some babies, the standard fall-to-sleep techniques are not enough. Baby just doesn't want to be put down to sleep alone. After rocking or feeding baby to sleep in your arms, lie down with your sleeping baby next to you and nestle close to her until she is sound asleep. We call this the "teddy- bear snuggle."



# Wearing down. Some babies are so revved up during the day that they have trouble winding down at night. Place your baby in a baby sling and wear her around the house for a half-hour or so before the designated bedtime. When she is fully asleep (see limp-limb sign) in the sling, ease her out of the sling onto her bed. For babies who are used to nursing off to sleep in a mother's arms, fathers can wear their baby down to sleep and give mother a break.



Wearing down is particularly useful for the reluctant napper. When baby falls asleep in the sling, snuggled with his tummy against your chest or draped over your chest once you lie down, you both can take a much-needed nap.



# Swinging down. Wind-up swings for winding down babies are a boon to parents who have neither the time, energy or creativity to muster up rituals of their own. Tired parents will pay anything for a good night's sleep. Once in a while a moving plastic seat may be more sleep inducing than a familiar pair of arms. Sometimes high-need babies associate a parent's body with play and stimulation and will not drift off to sleep in a human swing. For them the mechanical one is less stimulating, if not downright boring, and therefore can be a useful part of a sleep-ritual repertoire. Yet remember, high-need babies are notoriously resistant to mechanical mother substitutes and will usually protest anything less than the real mom. Before you actually spend money on a swing, you might want to borrow one for a week or two to see if the spell of the swing will last. You may discover that you are uncomfortable with mechanical mothering and decide to get more creative. Still, swings have their moments.



# Driving down. If you've tried all the above transitioning techniques and baby still resists falling asleep, place baby in a carseat and drive around until she falls asleep. When you return home and baby is in a deep sleep, carry the carseat (with the sleeping baby) into your bedroom and let baby remain in the carseat until the first nightwaking. If she is in a deep sleep (witness the limp-limb sign – hands unclenched, arms dangling loosely at her side, facial muscles still), you may be able to ease her out of the carseat into her own bed.



# Mechanical mothers. Gadgets to put and keep baby asleep are becoming big business. Tired parents pay high prices for a good night's sleep. It's all right to use these as relief when the main comforter wears out, but a steady diet of these artificial sleep inducers may be unhealthy. We remember a newspaper article extolling the sleep-tight virtues of a teddy bear, with a tape player in his stuffing that sings or makes breathing sounds. Baby can snuggle up to the singing, breathing, synthetic bear. Personally, we are not keen on our babies going to sleep to someone else's canned voice. Why not use the real parent?

My wife had similar symptoms and it ended up being an ovarian cyst.



Something is going on in that area - it may not be gynecological, though.  Are your bowels moving regularly?  If you have a family history of diverticulitis tell your doctor.  Have you ever had any appendix trouble?  Sometimes a problem in that region of your body can upset your body and cause a period to start due to inflammation.

Guilt is a waste of emotion.  You aren't helping your baby by feeling guilty.  Make up for your guilt in a different way... be a strong parent, and a disciplinarian, not their best friend.  And as an aside, how sad is it that women aren't even aware of their bodies, what they can do and what our parts are designed for?

Even tho breasfeeding is the healthiest option, there are plenty of women who do not one way or another... You love your baby and are there now taking care of it, that is what counts now.  If you are concerned about health, educate yourself on good diets. check out saving dinner dot com for some great health advice and menu ideas.

Your child will be fine, and you need to let go of the guilt.  Don't focus on it.  Focus on your child that is growing and thriving, and will be absolutely fine on formula.



If it helps at all... I have three kids.  I breastfed my first.  My second I wasn't able to (severe milk protein allergy) and my third I didn't even attempt to breastfeed as I had a 2 year old and 13 month old when she was born.  Out of my three kids, my breastfed one was the sickliest.  They are now 7, 5 and 4 and all are healthy and thriving.  So yours will as well.



Good luck!!

Nothing to be guilty of. . .are your kids happy?  healthy?  That's all you can ask for.  My daughter was formula fed for many reasons, my son is bottle fed breast milk and they are both fine.  I notice, personally, no difference in their development, illness, etc.

Im so sorry that you were one of soo many that were not informed (myself included!) A cesarean definatly makes it harder for sure! I didn't get to breasfeed my first either....but I got educated about a year after she was born and I am determind to breastfeed next time around. I want to encourage you to learn all you can about breastfeeding and also know that its never too late to lactate! any person (male or female) can lactate at any time. There are ways to make human milk...don't give up!!!

Your child will NOT suffer poor health because you could not breastfeed, some women just can't. My mother chose not to breastfeed any of her kids, and I'm very healthy, I rarely get sick, maybe once a year.



To lose the guilt, you have nothing to feel guilty about. It shouldn't, nor does it matter how a baby is fed, as long as he or she is fed. A mother who does not feed her child at all has reason to feel guilty, you do not.



Personally, I struggled for 3 months to breastfeed before I gave up. I too felt guilty and attempted again when my daughter was 7 months. It worked for a while, but we had to stop again. If your milk has not completely dried up and if you are interested in trying again, feel free to send me a message. I will give you tips and advice, medications and herbal supplements to take to increase your supply. It will hurt at first, and it will be a battle, but it is worth it.



Good luck.

Some new mothers need extra help with breastfeeding because it doesn't "come naturally".  If you were sore, then the baby wasn't latching on properly and you didn't have the proper instruction.



It takes time to deal with the feelings. Just because you couldn't breastfeed doesn't mean that your child will not be healthy.  I couldn't either because my little one had a problem with her jaw and couldn't latch for long enough.  I ended up pumping for the first few weeks, then switched to formula.  My baby is now 2 and very active and healthy.

It will do do you and your baby better if you forgive yourself. Rather than looking at it like you did not nurse your baby try reminding yourself that you tried your best and that is all that matters. A lot of moms never even try, you tried so give yourself some credit and forgive yourself. Your baby will not suffer from poor health because you did not breast feed, if you still have milk you can try again. When I had my twins one was too small to latch on and did not nurse from the breast until she was 5 weeks old, you can locate your local le leche league and get help with that if you still want to try or call your hospital and they can also help. I hope this helped and good luck!

Actually, if you still want to try you still can after 2 weeks.  But it sounds like you want to know how to lose the guilt.  That will happen when you see your baby love you.  She doesn't care how you feed her- she just cares that you feed her!  Babies are wonderfully resilient and very forgiving for your information.  However, I don't think anything needs to be forgiven.  Breastfeeding is very hard- I had 4 sons in 5 years and nursed them all.  In fact I lactated for 8 years in a row!  Tough times but fun. Anyhow, my second son decided to wean himself very early-probably because I was pregnant with #3 right away- but anyhow he was my only one who was formula feed.  Point is: there is no difference among them.  They are all bright and healthy boys.  All that being said, if you want to try again, go for it.  I know all women are different but I went on vacation for 2 weeks and thought that my milk would dry up.  When I came back, I kind of regretted weaning the baby and so when he tried to nurse, I let him and to my surprise I had milk.  He nursed for a year after that.

You feeling guilty about it is only going to make you feel worse. Realize that you were misinformed and that it wasnt your fault. My fiance and his two siblings were all formula fed back in the 80's. My fiance has had no medical problems and was in perfect health growing up. He is now 23 and in a lot better shape then I am- and I was breast fed! His mom just didnt feel like breast feeding. Atleast you tried!

They keep trying to make me breastfeed for the the baby, but what about my boobies? It was definite for my first, then the second time I said I wasn't sure,  but she suckered me into doing it when she was born..This time I say NO WAY!! I actually had some women tell me this one would be jealous, but I'm like this one will probably say eww that's gross to the other ones. With all the good stuff that's in formula, it's probably better, considering I couldn't eat due to my second being latched on 24/7..(for a year!!) SAVE YOUR BOOBIES!!



I understand you feel guilty because you wanted to and didn't know you could still try, but like I said, there is so much put into formula these days that it might actually be better. Breastfeeding my daughter took a lot out of me, I should've stopped sooner, but i think it is kind of addictive once you start..( it was also the only way for me to calm her) It's that whole bonding thing they talk about, but don't let them make you think you won't be as bonded as if you didn't breast feed, i mean i am sitting here resenting my children!! lol.

No. He is still too young to process the Tylenol. I know it is rough to see your baby in pain or discomfort but sometimes you just have to ride it out. just make sure to keep it clean and add ointment as directed and before you know it he'll be fine.

I would call and ask a nurse before you give it to him. They gave us strict instructions on what tylenol to give to our son for his circumcision. It was 0.4 ml every 4 hrs for the first 24hrs. But our son didnt seem to have much pain with his surgery. Call just to make sure. Hope this helps.

Concentrated infant tylenol drops 1/2 fl oz (15ml). Is what the front of our son's tylenol  bottle says. The hospital gave it to us

Is your baby on soy formula?



How did you know that you had to switch?  My baby is very fussy and is very gassy and everyone that I mention it to say that she is alergic to milk and she needs to be on soy.

Talk to your doctor befor you switch your baby out. My doctor put my daughter on Soy till she was a few months old then we switched back. She is most likely fussy cause she is gassy so maybe try and burp her to be absolutly sure she doesnt have a "bubble" left in there. My daughter was hard to burp and was really gassy if I didnt get all the air out.
Some tricks I learned to get her to burp is to rub her back then lightly pat then rub; lay her back gently and bring her back up slowly; or pat her bum gently.

no but my niece was, my SIL said that she was fussy/gassy on regular formula. BUT I breastfeed and my daughter was very very gassy t he first few weeks, I think that their bodies have to get use to eating, no matter what the food is. I read somewhere that something like 90% of babies on soy dont actually need to be on it

Talk to your pediatrician before switching.  My brother's son's mother (they are not together) told my brother that he was allergic to milk because he had gas all the time and put him on soy formula.  When my brother got custody of his son, pediatrician told him just because gas not necessarily true, he just may need burped.  Which was the case because he is not allergic to milk.  Check with your doctor because your baby could have an allergy to soy.  I breastfed my daughter but supplement with soy from time to time and everytime I gave her the soy she would projectile vomit.  Told pediatrician and was told symptom of allergy and that she was allergic to soy.  So just because gasy and fussy, does not necessarily mean they are allergic.  Talk to your pediatrician, I have some sites I listed below that I saved when my brother was going through this with his son.  Hope that helps.

It just sucked that my fiance didnt make the birth because he was on a hunting trip in the woods with no cell service. Who knew I was going to go into labor 6 weeks early?!

I was is labor with my second from 4:20 am (woke up and lost  mucus plug) until she was born at 6:03 pm.  But I was in "active" labor for about 6hrs. I went to the hospital at 11:30 am because i live 40min from hospital  and I did not want to labor around my 4yr old.  I opted to have NO drugs! With my first I had drugs and hated how I felt and had no control.  I just sat up in my bed and talked with my mom.  I had  no IV too.  At about 5 or 530 pm they broke my water and i went into the tub (I was 8 cm).  I was in the tub until about 5:50 then I started to bleed When i was walking to my bed.  I pushed for about 7 min.  She let me push for as long or little as i wanted to.  So i was in total control.  No dumb counting!!!! So at 6:03 I delivered my second girl Kloee Sue weighing in at 6lbs even and 19 in long. I loved my labor and delivery with my second!!!

11. The first 12 to 13 hrs were ok I was handling it. Then he broke my water and that's when it started. I was handling that ok to. Then got asked if I want an epi( I really did not and now I kinda feel I got pressured into bc all of the ppl in the room and not wanting to disappoint).



and the next baby I will be delivering totally different and not letting certain ppl influence my decisions just bc of pain.. Also I am only letting my husband and mother in my room next time also. Too many ppl was visiting me in between contractions.

Temporary relief for breast engorgement?



My daughter is 4 days old and breast feeding. I have one nipple that is really short and cannot be latched properly. Currently it is cracked and bleeding and hurts so much to put her on it although I do suck it up and suffer through a couple feedings on it a day if I can. The problem is that I am now engorged so it is even harder for her to latch onto that nipple. The other nipple is fine and dandy and is where the majority of her feedings are coming from. I don't want to get an infection but I also do not want the sore nipple side to get engorged and/or become un usable. I plan on allowing the nipple to heal up and then trying again as we have improved greatly on our latching and I believe we should be able to avoid the pain and be just as effective on the other side as this one. I have taken to emptying the sore nipple side once a day by hand expressing the milk out but want to make sure this is alright and I am not sabotaging my efforts in the mean time. I am calling my lactation consultant tommorow but was wondering if anyone else has these problems before and what advice you can give. My nipples were both pierced before and I believe the sore one was pierced too close to the end of the nipple causing it not to retract completely when stimulated ... just the tip gets erect and it is hard to get the rest of the areola into such a little mouth .. although she is opening up wider now so we may be able to do it. Just so sore from the failed attempts before. Please let me know what you think!

You will need to empty that breast more then just once a day. If you only require the breast to fill once then it is start making only enough milk to fill up one time. You can try to use a pump. You can also get a big pot or basin fill it up with warm water and then lean over it and let your breast fall into the pot. The gravity and warm water helps the milk to flow out better. You can also try a nipple shield because of the damage until it heals. But if your baby is latched on properly you really shouldn't feel any pain (yes even with the way it is tore up now). It is harder for her to latch on if the breast is engorged so try to relive the engorgement before putting her on the breast.

Thank you very much everyone for your responses! I have been still feeding off that side and hand expressing only when the pain and fullness is unbearable but hopefully that nip heals up soon ... I tried the cream and a cold compress after and the next time around didn't hurt nearly as bad! Thanks!!

Hand express from the side that is chapped every time she feeds, even if only for 5 minutes.  Invest in some Lasinol cream, it worked wonders for me and is safe for the baby, it is instant nipple relief!!! For the engorgement, cabbage works wonders, hot showers and just massaging your breast.  Hope that helps!

Of all things people warn you about when prego, they never tell you about that!  It is the worst.  I know what you are going through.  This is what you need to do.



Take a hot shower.  The heat from the shower will help tremendously.  You may have to masage your breast a little bit, like someone would when milking a cow.  This will get the milk flowing.  Continue manually pumping until your breast is soft again.  It will help to press firmly on the hard pockets.  You have to do this.  If you don't you will be in more pain, cause possible infection or loose the ability to make milk on that side.  If you can't get a lot of milk out, do it when your baby is upset.  Have your husband hold the baby while crying in the bathroom with you.  The sound of your baby crying will stimulate your milk duct and make the milk come out.  I know it sounds crazy but it's true.



If you don't already have one, I would invest in a breast pump.  Not all of us are lucky enough to produce so much milk, but I couldn't have made it though either of my breastfeeding days without one.



Oh yeah, and the cracked nipple....there's no real way around that.  You will have to toughen it up to get past it.  The sooner you just deal with it the sooner it will be over with.  Rub it hard with a wash cloth in the shower.  It will hurt, but will speed the process.



Good luck and Congats!!!

Definately invest in a breastpump.  It's quite easy to hire them. If you plan on feeding for a while, it may be worth buying one, as any time you get mastitis, cracked nipples or engorgement, a breastpump can be your best friend.  I would pump at every feed to keep up your milk supply (you don't want to end up only producing milk on one side). Before pumping, while feeding on the good side, put a hot cloth on the engorged breast, while pumping massage toward the nipple, after pumping apply a cold pack. Definately use Lansinoh cream for the cracked nipple, but be careful using cabbage leaves, as they can dry up your milk quite quickly.  Watch out for any small white lumps on your nipple, as this could be a milk plug which would need to be unclogged.  It's a good idea to see a Lactation consultant, as I haven't found a GP that's too clued up on breastfeeding problems.  The breastfeeding association is also a great help and can be called 24 hours.  Good luck and all the best!!!!!!!

Buy Lansinoh cream (any drug store should have it) and put it on your nipples after every feeding. It will help heal your skin faster and it's safe for baby. Also, to help get some of the engorgement pain gone, get a washcloth wet with warm/hot water and put it on your sore breast. Keep applying until the milk starts coming out. This should help with the pain since you'll be relieving some of the pressure. Hopefully the LC will help with baby's latching but definitely get the Lansinoh cream....saved my life! :)

I went thru this. O.k get in a hot shower. let the water hit your breast as you express it yousellf with your hands. Try to massage from the outer to the nipple. You want to get those hard what feels like rocks in there out. it's a build up of milk. Do this until your breast is completely soft again. You can use hot wet wash cloths but nothing works like the shower. Trust me. My doc told me to do it and it worked. You can also use cabbage. I know that sounds crazy but that is supposed to work too. Look it up. The shower worked wonders. If you are bleeding you definately want to let it heal. My sister got infected and engorged and they had to cut her nipple open to drain it. Try the shower, it is very important you get that milk out. After the hot shower you can apply a cool wash cloth to soothe. Oh and don't squeeze too hard I gave myself vericose veins on my breast. Be firm but gentle.

I just kept on trying to distract him and finally got it out. I guess you just have to keep at it. If it is a sticky booger you could use a baby Q-tip since it has that little end on it. Just be careful!

My son hates his nose/mouth wiped. I've tried everything but nothing helps, maybe with your baby it'll go smoother. Here's some things I've done to help. Make sure whatever you're using, if its wet make sure its warm nobody likes a cold wipee on their nose. Also make sure it's soft not a scratchy paper towel or cheap tissue. He's nose might be chapped too and it might be hurting him when you wipe it so check with his Dr. to see if there is anything you can put on it like a dab petroleum jelly to help the chapness. Hope this helps.

As a mother I can tell you that is the norm for children, not just yours. They will keep on doing it until they can learn to do it for them selves. My daughter has to make her husband hold her son down to clean his nose and he is 3 years old. By holding him down, I just mean hold on to his head so he can't swing it back and forth so much. She has a 2 year old daughter who does the same thing, also when she gets her hair washed. Some things just never change when it comes to raising children, I have raised 3 grown children and had the same  trouble with all three when they were young. Hang in there mom, this is an on going battle.

Blood in stool. Worried or no?



I have been having issues since taking Vicodin..



I've been having a hard time going number 2, and when I do there was  a little red blood in it, and on the toilet paper.  This time I was walking and got a sharp cramp got to the bathroom and kept having sharp cramps before finally mostly liquid stool and some semi hard stool came out, noticed a lot of blood on the toilet paper, then a dark red seemingly small clot spot in the toilet.  I am not on my period.  18 years old.. To be worried or not?



I always thought it was from straining but why would it be in the stool if that were it? hmm.

Be worried, please see your doctor.



It surely is from straining, but on Vicodin you might not really feel some of the damage you have done to yourself.



You're probably impacted and need to be manually de-impacted (it's as lovely as it sounds).



Vicodin will make your stools hard and dry, and slow down your gastrointestinal tract - and cause you to tear.

While it could be something you don't need to spend a LOT of time worrying about (like an anal fissure), any blood in the stool is potentially serious and requires an immediate call to the doctor.

I have a 3 month old puppy and I have to leave him home alone while I am at work, is that o.k? any advice?



I have a 3 months old Pitbull mixed with a Bull Mastiff and during the day from 8:30am to 5:45 he is home alone in our kitchen. We put up a gate in the door way to keep him in the kitchen, we have been told that he cries a lot during the day from neighbors. I have a few concerns with different areas of my dogs life, First thing is I need to know am I doing a bad thing by leaving him alone all that time? its just I have no choice, me and my Wife work all day. When we do come home we play with him alot, take him out a few times, etc.. He is a very hyper dog to begin with, but when we get home he is very very excited..He pee's alot in the kitchen during the day, and at times he has pooped as well, I know he has no choice because he can't go anywhere else but how can I train him not to pee or crap anywhere else in my house? he is allowed in only 4 out of 5 rooms in my house, the bedroom is the only room he is not allowed in. We have the Wee-Wee pads down in the kitchen, living room and computer room but he seems to use them as his Lay-Down area, like a bed. He lays there most of the time, but wont use the bathroom there. He would rather poop or pee on my rug, and he also has the habit of walking while he is peeing, or walking while pooping..lol  I dont know why but he does. He listens at times, but he is still a puppy and very hyper, its just he hasnt used the bathroom outside yet, everytime we walk him he has not peed or pooped, but when he comes upstairs, he poops or pee's, it gets me very very pissed off. He also has a habit of bitting while we are playing with him, no matter how many times we tell him "NO" or "STOP", or push him away, he still does it. Any advice on all my concerns and questions...please help...I Love this dog but he needs help. We adopted him last saturday, he was adopted two times and was taken back because they couldnt control him. I will not bring him back, i want to help him learn because he is a good dog. PLEASE HELP

Seriously, why is this in this section, but that is way too long to leave your pup alone.  Puppies need constant attention and training.  It's going to be a while before hes fully trained and you need to either have a friend, neighbor, or hire a sitter to come feed him and at least play with him or walk him.  4 out of 5 rooms for a puppy is a lot and he must always be supervised when hes out roaming.  Puppies can't hold their bladders very long so expect a lot of mistakes and accidents, never yell, stop doesnt mean anything to him and pushing him only makes him upset and more nervous.  You need to go to puppy training courses.  They will explain how to train your dog and what not to do.

How do you wean puppies ?



My dog is a chow.  She is a great  mother to her puppies even though she is only 1 year old herself.  Chows have a high tolerance for pain so she still allows her babies to continue getting nourishment from her even though they are 6 weeks old and scratch and bite.  Also they are really aggressive little things.  We love them and her and just want to do whats best.

Is it really that bad to use fabric softener on babys clothes?



My mom had told me to buy scent free softener for my baby's clothes. So I went to walmart and bought the Simplicity simple sent hypoallergenic softener as well as the simplicity no sent dryer sheets. But now I'm reading that its not safe to add softener to baby's clothes. And I already washed a ton of clothes and her crib bedding! My mom told me it was completely fine (she does have 5 kids) but now I don't know. lol.

It is SAFE, the thing with fabric softeners is that the scent might irritate the baby's skin, and even if it does.. it wont be harmful to the baby!! We realized that the hard way with my first child, I love fabric softner but his skin was way to sensitive for that, so he got a rash all over his body. It turned out he has eczema so his skin is naturally oversensitive to pretty much everything. But he was fine, we just stop using softener and washed everything again!
But with a Scent Free Hypoallergenic it should be fine!!
And yes your mom does know best ;)

Yeah you shouldn't put it on babies clothes. Baby clothes are non flammable and I heard that the softener can reverse that...where it isn't anymore.  But I also just found this and it says researchers say there is a possible link with SIDS, something about the chemicals in the softeners that can cause difficulty breathing among other things.  It also says this



Babies often react with rashes, frequent crying and/or diarrhea. Disinfectants can have the same effects. Experts suggest a possible connection between Sudden Infant Death ("crib death") and the use of these products for washing baby clothes and crib sheets and blankets.



We don't use it because our boys are really sensitive, the only time I have...and not until they were older was Downy Sensitive liquid and then I do an extra rinse after it's done.  But I don't use it everytime, maybe oce a month and usually just on towels not the clothes themselves

Cloth diaperers know that fabric softener makes your laundry less absorbent.  It's not about the scent, although fragrances can be irritating.  If you value absorbency in your baby's laundry (and I do), then just quit using softener and dryer sheets, or use one or the other.  Vinegar is a good fabric softener, and the smell goes away.



A newborn baby doesn't drool much, and they often don't pee much either, so don't worry about the clothes you've already washed.

You probably won't get much interaction out of him at almost 2 weeks.



My son didn't seem interested in much besides sleeping, eating, and pooping, until he was closer to 3-4 months. Then he started being more alert, awake, and started playing with me and toys more.

Should i cut down on his milk intake?



we moved Reece on to SMA progress milk at 6mos, and he seems fine with it. but on the back of the tin, it says he should be drinking 500-600mls a day. this is only 2 9oz bottles + a bit more. he is having 2 'meals' a day. one in the morning, and one at night. and about 4 9oz bottles! should i add an extra meal during the day, and start to lessen his milk? i know milk is still his main source of nutrients, but i don't want to over feed him on it, by nearly 18oz!

the 500-600ml is just a guideline for a baby who is on solids so if he goes over this amount then thats fine. It is more a guideline for a baby who is established on solids with 3 meals per day with snacks. My daughter is on 3 meals per day with snacks and she generally takes around 24 oz per day. Is your son 6 months or is he older?As you start to increase his solids then his milk intake will naturally decrease anyway. If i can remember right i think my daughter took a similar amount of milk when she was on 2 meals then i gave her a 3rd meal and it wasnt long before she dropped one of her bottles. He is taking the amount of milk that he needs so everything is fine, try giving him a 3rd meal maybe with fruit or rice cakes as a snack mid morning or afternoon and you'll notice his milk intake decrease!
EDIT
7 months is fine then for him to be eating 3 meals per day. When my hv was still coming to our house she gave me a book on weaning which recommends that by 7 months they should be on 3 meals per day, although a lot of people will disagree with this but that was the information that was given to me and also, my daughter was fine with being on 3 meals a day, some babies may take a little longer, you just have to go with their pace, good luck!

What is says on the back of the packet is just a guide. Every baby is different and boys are often hungrier.
My son was having way more than that guide until he was well over 1. He probably still does!
You should think about moving him onto 3 meals a day now if he's hungry, and maybe slightly reduce his milk, but as long as it's not interfering with his meals it's fine.

if you arent happy about withdrawing the milk, try 2 meals plus a snack such as chopped fruit, yoghurt or the organix finger foods. you cant overfeed him, even if you did, he would vomit the excess up.



he will eventually need more as he gets bigger an he will let you know if he is hungry. my girl still takes 3x 8oz of C&G toddler milk at 15mos, plus 3 meals a days and prob about 4-6 snacks throughout the day.



he will tell you when he needs more.

Hi yeah it may be time to add a third meal and maybe cut slighly with maybe 5 ounces less. Milk is majorly important and you can never overfeed your baby unless he pukes if he wants it he wants it. He looks like a smart little chap he knows when he's full, he'll stop if he doesn't want anymore. Try a third meal though it's time for a third one! I feed my girl cereal and fruit morning and night and vegys, meat, sweet potat, applesauce at lunch. I do the vegies etc.. at lunch just in case she gets gassy from something new then hopefully she feels better by bed time! Good luck! Milk's important 75% milk 25%solids till 1 year. I drank tons of similac when i was kid until like age 3 b/c i was fussy and mom didn't have time for me b/c i had a baby brother who had cancer. I ended up with the best teeth in my whole family who all have rotted teeth i mean rotted dentures by age 25 kinda teeth and i haven't ever had a cavity my mom says it's the Similac! Plus i'm not a picky eater at all! Dont worry to much the back of the can is just a guide line. Just like clothes that say 6 mths in the tag don't necessarily fit at 6 mths!

Wow, no sense of humor. They are cute. People like cute clothing. There are many many outfits out there without ears. I actually barely see any clothing with ears. So i don't know where you are shopping.



Try wal-mart, target, zellers (canada) etc. I'm sure you can fine a lot if you just open your eyes.

You mean hoods and hats with ears? Generally it's because people think they're cute.



But since they're not your thing, rest assured that there ARE lots of clothes out there that don't have ears. There's no particular store for them, just keep on shopping till you spot them.



P.S.: I'm not trying to say YOU should find them cute, but you did ask why... That's why. Market forces at work. Anyway, surely there are clothes without ears for your boy. Besides, does he really even need a hood? A good earless hat would work with lots of outfits.

They have ear flaps to cover their ears so that they dont have as great of a chance at getting an ear ache....which can be really painful for a baby but u seem more concerened about what your child looks like than anything else....

That's not true.  My son has tons of clothes without ears.  In his defense, he does have ONE bath robe with....something on the hood....BUT that was Grandma's doing.  And you know Grandmas...



Of course shopping for a boy is easier because a store will have 3-4 racks of clothes for him.....but 10-20 racks for girls!!  So maybe you're shopping for a girl?



Either way, just take your time to look around.  I've gotten great stuff at Target, Mervyns (well not much longer since they're closing), Wal-Mart and Babies R Us.



▬▬edit▬▬
Do not despair Dad.  I have found very "normal" boys clothing for my son.  He's got a lot of sports related clothing and camo/military looking stuff (Dad was USAF).  He's got jeans, Justin lace-up boots (of course), dress shirts and sweat pant and hoodie sets.  Nothing really extravagant or "accessorized".  The only time he's had a suit/tie looking thing was for his Baptism.



p.s. You are not boring and quite honestly I don't care much for the ears.  =)  congrats on your boy!!  I'm enjoying mine tons!!

Most of the clothing with ears on them are hoodies or snow suits. So unless you're dressing your baby in winter clothing ALL year long then you shouldn't have a problem finding outfits without them.

Because they are adorable. It's the only time in their life when they can get away with ears. I personally love the ears on my baby girl clothes. Can you cut off the ears if you don't like them. I bet if you cut at them seam you wouldn't even know they had ear to begin with.

<question>



What is the best way to manage my baby's feeding schedule?



When we came home with her, the hospital said to wake her every three hours, during the day, and let her sleep as much as possible at night, in other words let her wake up on her own.



Now she has begun sleeping so deeply during the day that we think that she gets very upset being woken up that she does not eat well and gets really fussy.  We think it might be a good idea to let her sleep as much as possible during the day, and let her wake up normally, that way she eats well and sleeps better afterward.



Any info would be appreciated...citations would be great



Thanks



PS...she is a little over a month old

At that age if she's gaining weight at a good rate and producing enough wet diapers a day(6-8) then I would just let her sleep when she wants to.



As long as there isn't anything medically wrong with her she should be able to let you know when she's hungry. Obviously don't let her go an insanely long amount of time without eating but I wouldn't think you'd need to wake her ALL the time to eat.

You have to be careful with newborns and infants that age. They are not born knowing what hunger is or what hunger pains are, they don't know when or how often they are supposed to eat. You teach them that, by feeding them, whether you have to wake them or not. A newborn-1 month old  should eat 2-3 ounces every 3 hours, or sooner if breastfed  regardless of whether is day or night, at least until they are about  2.5 - 3 months old. By that age they will still eat every 3 hours during the day and have 1 long stretch at night where they sleep for 5-7 hours( say like from 10pm-4am). You have to be careful that you are not starving her, unknowingly, of course. They should gain about 4 ounces a week or at least a pound a month. Good luck! :)

I don't think you should still be waking her up.  Thats just for the first week or two.  if shes gaining fine, just let her tell you when its time to eat.  "A well slept baby sleeps well" is what my pediatrician told us so don't worry about her not sleeping at night if she sleeps too much during the day.

I got my daughter's ears pierce at 4mos by her pediatrician. I wouldn't have it done at the mall. I'm pretty sure all get thumbs down on this. However, she's my child, she didn't cry no more than she would when she gets shots (which is not that much), and I had a professional pierce them. I had mine pierce when I was 2 days old. I did them early because when she gets older I didn't want her to mess with them, which will make her more accessible to an infection. I know a lot of people that wished that would've pierced their kids when they were young because they don't want them to tug on them. As for others tugging on them, just give her the studs with or without diamonds. They can't grip them, but hoops can easily be pulled out.



I respect those who don't pierce those kids ears and I respect the reasons. But I don't understand why people are so critical on those who choose to do it. I mean complain if I put a post on here indicating I'm abusing my child. People need to realize that everyone raises their child up differently and that's fine. That's not our life to judge. I'm a wonderful mother and would do anything for my child.

Yes, pierced ears on babies are cute, but remember it's yet another body part you'll have to protect from infection, stop the kid from yanking on them, etc...



I prefer to wait until the child is older and the earlobes are more grown so there's more material to work with. If the kid's earlobes grow in such a way that the baby holes end up very low, that's no good...



Why not wait till your kid is old enough to ask for pierced ears? Then it will be more meaningful to your child and you can make it a special reward, teach self-care of the piercings, etc.



I mean, your kid isn't here to be decorative, it's his/her body you're modifying.

I have to agree with others who say to wait until your daughter is old enough to ask for it to be done. It's really your choice of course, but the possibility of her ear lobes becoming ripped because she accidentally ripped the earring out becomes greater. Babies can't understand that you have to be gentle with earrings. As older children they can at least understand and take care of them properly. And then it becomes their choice as well instead of forcing them to have pierced ears.

Yes, this is normal.  It is the same attraction that will later drive them to hide inside the garment racks at the store. Curiosity about doing something different just to see what it looks/feels like is what drives them to do it.  Make it fun by building a safe "fort" with blankets.

Oh yes both my boys did that, I think it has to do with security. They are used to being confined if you think about their memory being in the womb. It's not that spacious in there.



I think it gives them a sense of peace and comfort because the world is such a big place.



I also know that little ones will sneak under places because they are up to something. A lot of babies will use that time to have a bowel movement in private.

My baby loves to lay underneath the bar that is part of his swing. It has a red frog dangling from it that he just adores. He always lights up with a huge grin when we put him there and he even talks to it sometimes. It's pretty cute.

As far as I know - no taboo there at 32 weeks your baby is viable whatever happens. I have had 3 children and Prams were on ethe first things that I got, only when we were closer to the time did I get Cots etc etc

no its not bad luck its an old wives tale...i got my pram when i was 6 months pregnant and im glad i did as i wouldnt want to be waddling round the shops trying to find a pram when i was nearly ready to give birth or even worse, trust my partner to get the right one when i was in hospital after giving birth. I got all my baby stuff a few months before i gave birth so i could spend the last couple of weeks relaxing

My pram arrived by delivery when I was 35 weeks pregnant.  It went straight in the kitchen.  I had no idea it was bad luck and even when my friend told me I thought "well it's too late now!" but didnt worry because I believe that if you are not superstitious then bad luck won't come to you.



My labour and delivery went with no problems and we are both healthy

Sounds like he is a very determined kid already, I don't think you have anything to worry about, but just in case I would note it as far as how long and how often he does it, and the next time you see his doctor just let him know.
It sounds to me that he has discovered something he enjoys and that is all.
But check with his doc just in case.

Its a developmental thing..dont worry about it..wait til he actually starts talking and states "no" all the time.
He is starting to find his way in the world and realize how things work...and one thing that he has found is that if he turns his head from left to right...it means no and he has found it quite interesting.
Your child is on the right track.
Good Luck.

I doubt I would laugh.



A man with a baby says a lot about the man. It would be a huge appeal to most women. It shows responsibility, love, focus, care and sensitivity not only for the baby but for the babys mother whether it's his sister, mom, wife, g/f...whatever.

Nah, I think most women would think it is sweet of a man to take his child along for a jog.



I don't know about men.  It doesn't really matter what others would think, right?



But, I guess that's why it may be so rare to see a man rolling a stroller...maybe men think it takes away from their masculinity.

I can't say I have ever seen a man jogging with a baby either. But I wouldn't laugh if I did see one. Actually I would think it was a great idea. I'm not sure why we dont see more men jogging or taking there children out period. For instance I went to buy a baby carrier that supports the baby in the front of you for my 3 month old son and my husband thought it was a great idea, yet he said he will only wear it around the house and not out in public.



But I think that seeing men out with their baby is great, and you are thinking of jogging with your baby I say GO FOR IT!! I'm sure noone would laugh at you. You'll probley even get some smiles along the way!

My hubby is the "manly-est" man I know.



He doesn't jog, but if he did, he would take our son!  He HAS worn the baby carrier in public (and looked damn good doing it!)  I really think he is sexiest when he is doing something with our baby.  Of course, then again, he thinks I am sexiest when I am pregnant!

My husband has done this. When we go jogging in the park with our son, he has been the one to push the stroller. I think it makes him look strong and pretty much like a regular dad who likes to exercise.

When going out do you care more about what your babies wearing or what your wearing?



Ive always been a girly girl and getting ready to go out somewhere is always somthing I find fun. Choosing what to wear etc. But Ive noticed since having my daughter I care more about dressing her up nice then myself. . I love choosing cute little outfits for her and getting her all pretty and I dont get that into what Im wearing anymore. As long as she looks cute as a button Im ready to go. haha. What about you?

lol me too! I used to go through 10 diff outfits in one hour with me, now n I do it with her! lol. okay maybe not 10 but 5! I love having her wear sundresses when its hot and cute little pink sleepers with hoodies. and a lot of guys notice her too, they always say what a beautiful baby she is, lol. I dont fix myself up half as much I used to---I now just do the bare minimum--brush my teeth, wash my face quickly, shower, put on deodorant, brush my hair, and have decent clothes on. while I spend an hour or two getting her ready---picking out an adorable outfit, combing her hair, washing her little face and behind her ears, clipping her nails, etc.



Except today was an exception: I actually didnt spend as much today getting her ready as I did myself. Today I not only showered and shaved my legs (looooong overdue!), but I also put some hairspray in my hair, flossed for once, put some moisturizer on my skin, and lipstick! this was all while she was (and still is) sleeping, taking her afternoon nap.
But yes, I agree. And I find I get more joy in gettng her fixed up than I do myself. I guess its partly bc shes new news, and also bc I know I dont have to worry about people judging her based on what shes wearing since shes just a baby, lol, so I can have more fun.

I like to make sure I don't look too scary and my kids look good. I'll buy them clothes before I buy them for myself. It also depends on where I'm going and with who. I like to look neat and pretty when with my hubby. He isn't picky about that sort of thing, but I like to nice to make him feel proud.



OH, and I'm a stickler for the dirty face/clothes sort of thing. It's hard because I have a 2 1/2 year old boy! I always have wipes with me in the car, just in case! :-)

I definitely pay more attention to how cute my daughter looks than what I look like...  I usually pick her outfits out the night before (pants, shirt, sweater, socks, shoes, accessories - all coordinated, of course!), and then after I get her dressed and ready for the day, I have to scurry around trying to find something for myself!

What is the Babywise method?



My 6 month old son has always been hectic when he came to getting and staying asleep ever since we came home from the hospital. Around 3 months old, There was a point where he would be asleep by 8pm after his bath and feeding. He would sleep for 4 hours. He would go back to sleep after I fed him and waking up 4 hours later. That only lasted less than a month. He now wakes up every 1-3 hours of a night crying. He naps like twice a day with the naps only lasting like 25-45 minutes at most. We've tried every thing so far on getting him to and staying asleep while doing the whole nightly routine. He sleeps in our bed during the night even though his crib is in the same room.

Help with WIC, women's infants childre?



I haven't been on wic in a very long time. My son will be 6, and to 'qualify' i haven't done that in 5yrs.



my question, Do I count as 2 ppl? (me and baby) or just one? I would qualify if i counted as 2, not as 1. weird. anyway, if you just went or know anything that could help me, i would appreciate it. We definitely need the stuff they give you for having a baby.

If you are pregnant right now and meet the income guidelines then yes you will qualify for just you. Your son is too old. The child has to be under five to qualify. After your new baby is born then you and your child will qualify. Congrats on the baby!

I got a topper and it is amazing! It helped me sleep so much better. As long as I wasn't having contractions I slept straight through the night! The only problem is that it slides over so when you make your bed you have to pull it back to one side. It's well worth it though!

Once it was on the bed and you sleep on it a few nights to flatten it out, you hardly even notice.  I would recommend getting the mattress with the topper attached.

Not if your pregnant it won't. The weight of your belly will dramatically pull you down in the center and cause some back pain issues...I would go with a light soft over mattress, but make sure the mattress under that is firm and supportive.

Yes it is legal. If when the baby is born and they ask the mother what the name of the child is and they say for instance "John Smith" then thats the name. Regardless if Smith is the father or not or if she even knows a Smith. Just get the paternity test done if you have doubts and go from there. Just because she named the baby after you does not mean you have any responsibility for the child if the child turns out to not be yours.

Is your name on the birth certificate. If so then it is legal. The name on the child's birth certificate is the name that has to be on the ssc. If you are that worried that the child isn't yours then you need to get a blood test done ASAP.

Well, first of all, it sounds like you need to get that paternity test so you can be the father that it sounds like you already are.
but the answer to your question is " yes ", a mother can name her child anything she wants to ! however that does not mean that that you were named on the child's birth certificate. you and i could have the same last name, that doesn't make you my father .

My 10 month old will not sleep more than two hours a night.?



he will sleep about three hours thru the day and about three half an hour naps. I constantly keep him active during the day and keep him entertained but he just naps an half an hour. At night i have a full bedtime routine for him by giving him a warm bottle,putting on the baby channel,and getting him washed up but he goes to sleep at two in the morning and gets up at 4 am and goes back to sleep at 7 in the morning then sleeps til 4pm.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



do you rock him to sleep or using other soothing methods to put him to sleep ? the best is to try and teach them to sleep on their own, which is a difficult and painful process but it works. also put him down in his cot the same time every night and he will get the idea it is sleep time. also cut out the baby channel and read nighttime stories to him instead. tv is very stimulating for them especially before going to sleep. also wake him up gently the same time every morning after say 11-12 hours of sleep. in most cases they will wake up on their own. if he wakes up during the night, the best is to pat him lightly on his bum and tell him to go back to sleep and you leave the room.



it is a painful process as he will protest but it will work out in the end. just persevere. also establish a daytime routine for him.

Plenty of water, of course! But, you may want to add a bit of honey to soothe the sore throat. Some said to add a bit of salt into the water. This is to reduce the heatiness in the body.



Otherwise, you may need to send him/her to the doc so that the doc may advise if antibiotics is required.

What is the Babywise method?



My 6 month old son has always been hectic when he came to getting and staying asleep ever since we came home from the hospital. Around 3 months old, There was a point where he would be asleep by 8pm after his bath and feeding. He would sleep for 4 hours. He would go back to sleep after I fed him and waking up 4 hours later. That only lasted less than a month. He now wakes up every 1-3 hours of a night crying. He naps like twice a day with the naps only lasting like 25-45 minutes at most. We've tried every thing so far on getting him to and staying asleep while doing the whole nightly routine. He sleeps in our bed during the night even though his crib is in the same room. I'm at the point where I dont even sleep AT ALL because he wakes up so often and it's unpredictable.



I was reading online and heard of the baby wise method. The only thing I've gathered online is that it's scheduled feeding that involved 'snacking'.  I know every baby is different and like I said, he pretty much has been this way since he was born. He's not teething.

My daughter has reflux, if your son had reflux then he would have acid in his stomach and it would be making him be sick every time he ate my daughter was sick for up to 3 hours after feeding and now has to have gaviscon in her bottles, it could be colic, is your baby having solids now? My daughter had problems sleeping and waking for a bottle all the time but since she started having solids she sleeps alot better.

Maybe try a dream feed (where he is drowsy but not fully awake) at 10pm  each night..it is meant to help them go for a bit longer overnight...but you have to stick with it it wont work after just 2-3 times..try for a couple of weeks (2) then see how it is going

The babywise method is full-on - and is usually easier if started when a baby is younger but will work for older babies too.  It is about parent led feeding - not clock, or demand.  For me it seemed very routine and quite strict aswell although it says its not about looking at the clock, but also about taking other things into consideration and then making a decision about feeding your baby.  I tried it with my son when he was about 9 weeks old, and it did seem to work for a couple of weeks until he went through a growth spurt and although the book apparently makes allowance for that, I found it extremely hard to get him back on track after that.  He was a '45 minute' sleeper which the book also talks about, but nothing I tried could get him to nap longer than that during the day - Babywise seriously screwed up my confidence in my parenting skills with my first baby - until I literally threw it across the room and took the advice of a midwife friend that said when he got older and more active he would start napping for longer - which he did,  it was just him - for the first 6 months he would be up for an hour down for 45 minutes - which is why I found babywise so hard because of the main thing it teaches is the feed/play/sleep schedule which I do agree with but if you are trying to get your baby into a 3 hour routine and he is only up for 1 hour and down for 45 minutes you are pretty much feeding every 2 hours in order to keep to that routine!  My second child was a 'babywise baby' without me even needing to do anything - she naturally put herself in a 3 hour routine, was a great sleeper and only feed because she was hungry, not for snacking or comfort!!  All the best, my advice read the books (most of which contradict each other) but only take out the bits that suit you and use your own intuition rather than try and stick to what the books say as it can end up stressing you out more than the situation itself.  Also I found the best thing was not having the baby in the room as they can sense and smell you and I found I got less sleep especially having them in bed with me,  they are noisey things and do wake up but can also put themselves to sleep if left for a bit to,  for him waking up all the time is more habit rather than hunger and it sounds like you have a good bed time routine for him that is predictable so as long as you are putting him to bed awake, then as he is 6 months if you felt comfortable you could try the controlled crying method which will take a few hard nights but could work, otherwise for my son after we tried everything he just started sleeping through by himself at around 8 months around the same time his naps during the day also started getting longer.

he sleeps on his tummy and absolutely cannot sleep on his back for some reason. hes been sleeping through the night since he was a month old but now recently he's rolling over onto his back and waking up. now the problem is that he wont go BACK to sleep even after i do our usuall routine; diaper change, feeding, rocking back to sleep. he'll just cry and cry for hours, and its come to the point where my boyfriend will have to take over for me because i'll start crying too, i dont know what to do! so he ends up taking him into the other room and playing with him till he starts crying again and thats when i do another feeding and he'll sleep again. obviously this works but its taking away from both mine and my boyfriends sleep. any suggestions? and does anyone know why hes doing this now?

As your baby grows older,he learns to control his movements more and do more things which is why he is rolling over,but if it is waking him up try putting a pillow on either side of him around waist height so he can roll over...

Same thing happened to me too. My daughter is a tummy sleeper since 6 weeks and she's 4 months old now. She just started learning how to roll and she'll freak out when she ends up on her back. What I've been doing is using a hello kitty doll wedging her against her crib so that she won't end up on her back, she usually ends  up sleeping on her side, which she doesn't mind.

Wow must be this age, my son is 17 weeks and for the past week he wakes up and is wide awake in the middle of the stinking night, you cant lay down with him or anything, you have to get up with him and ya he wont eat and is pretty much inconsolable.  I am on my own as hubby works nights.  I don't know.  My other two never did this.  I just lay with him in my bed and rest my arm on him so he sleeps on his side and we lay in the dark until he gets bored and falls asleep.
Good question! Hang in there!

How often should you use wind drops?



My 7 week old son had problems with wind, so we got some Infacol wind drops.
However it doesn't say how often you should use them.



Do you put them in every bottle, or every now and then when he displays wind issues??



Thanks in advance.

Changing from lactose free to normal formula, slowly or all at once?



I asked earlier today whether I should try convert my 5mth old to normal milk as I have heard it is bad to keep them on lactose free. I know now that it wont effect how he handles lactose later if I stay with the lactose free stuff, but I do want to change him over onto normal milk based formula (mainly as there is only 2 places in town I can get his lactose free stuff and its expensive).



Should I just switch it altogether at once, or do it gradually?



Of course if he doesnt go well with it, I will go back to lactose free...

Do it gradually over time.  With my son, my doctor had me replace one bottle a day with normal formula... then if he tolerated it ok, the next day we went up to two bottles, etc.



Also - the first time you try it, do it first thing in the morning.  that way if god forbid he has a bad reaction, you can see your doctor, or if he has an upset stomach from  it, it has the entire day to work through it (rather than you being up all night).



Good luck!

You know, my daughter is 6 month and on breastmilk and ocassionaly soy milk or lactose free.
I tried to give her goodstart formula or enfamil, she would threw up an hour after that.
She could tolerate the regular formula only from Similac, but make her gassy all day long.
I try to introduce her slowly to regular formula but she would threw up all the time, so I stop.
I was lactose intolerance when I was a baby, after a year my mom just introduced whole milk right away, and here I am, can enjoy anything milk.
I just don't want to make my baby suffer, because when she threw up, she'll cry and uncomfortable (she barely spit up on soy or breastmilk).

Get the baby books for when it is older (perfectly fine to get things they won't use straight away so long as they don't take up too much space). Nightlights is a great book which is writen in a meditative way to help a child get to sleep while also stimuating the imagination.

Open a bank account in the baby's name, and promise to put money in for every birthday and Christmas. The child won't thank you when he/she is growing up, but will be grateful when he /she goes to University.
Or get together with a few other pals and buy £100 of Premium Bonds. There is always a chance of a million pounds prize, and ( unlike the lottery) you never lose the original money.

I saw this baby shower wreath once that was really cute, and the mother could take it apart and use it or just keep it as a decoration for the babies room.  They took the some metal wire and made it into a wreath shape.  Then they twisted those little baby blankets around it and tied them in place with ribbon.  Next, they used safety pins to pin things on it like booties, diapers, rattles, pacifiers, ect... and made a big bow at the top.  If your pretty crafty, I think that would be a good idea, and if it doesn't turn out looking so great or you don't wanna spend that much time making it, you can always put items in a basket like gift baskets you give at x-mas time(you always need things like diapers or feeding supplies).
Another idea is to buy the mother a baby scrapbooking kit, because almost any mother would love something to put pics in, and maybe you could help get her started with taking pics for her of the baby shower, delievery, ect...(depends if your gonna be at those events).  Also, if your gonna spend big or go in with some other people you could get her the scrapbook kit and a digital camera!
Hope this helps!

I broke mine at about 18months - 2yrs old.  With both we had them throw their binkies in the trash and then took the bag out so they knew they were gone.  They will cry for a day or two, but if you redirect their attention when they want it, they forget pretty quick.  Both of mine were fine after about 24 hours.

With my eldest daughter, i was scared of her becoming too attached to it, as i heard that it is hard to get a baby of a dummy, once they are older. So at around 6 months old i just stopped giving it her at once and she was fine, not bothered at all. My second daughter never had 1, tried to give it to her a few times, spat it out, so never persisted with it. I think the earlier you take it away the easier it will be. Goodluck

I think it just depends on how each toddler tolerates it and how often they need their pacifier.  My family has always started "hiding" the pacifier as the toddler starts to transition from bottles to "sippy" cups.  Maybe start "hiding" it and try to re-direct their attention (play, watch tv, ect) if they ask for it.  I think it would be okay to let them have it a little for comfort like at bedtime or if they are sick, so they aren't stressing out over it.  Maybe start introducing more "chewy" type foods to them also, like carrot sticks so that they have something healthy to replace the need for wanting to chew or suck on the pacifier.  I think it's up to every parent to decide how they want to wean their child from the pacifier, but I think it's okay to do it gradually as well as cold turkey.  As long as they still don't want it by the time they start school, I don't think there is really a particular age that they should stop it. Good luck!

7-8 mth old baby waking through the night, why?



Hello, I'm looking for some ideas from more experienced parents!



Our son has a history of sleeping well through the night since around 2-3 mths. From 7 months he has started waking in the early hours and is comforted only by being held. I have a few theories as to why this might be the case borrowed from psychology; i.e. attachment anxiety, stress from beginning nursery / moving home / traveling, or simple learnt behaviour from being rewarded with attention. Teething is a probability since he has broken two teeth in the last few weeks.



I teach developmental psychology and have a habit of over thinking things and am probably missing the obvious things that more experienced parents will know. I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions to help through this difficult period.



He sleeps in his own room and has done since 2 months.
He goes down at 7pm with a feed, and is fed again at 10:30pm and used to sleep through till 6:30am. Now he wakes at 1am-3am and refuses food (unless he cries until 3am and has worked up an appetite). All he really wants is cuddles when he awakens, he has comfort objects but only his main carers will do in the small hours.



I hope I have provided enough info and appreciate any shared experiences or guidance from an experienced parent.

I think you are pretty spot on to be honest.
I love this website....It is very interesting and helped to shed a little light on the cognitive development processes that may affect bub's sleeping patterns
http://moxie.blogs.com/askmoxie/2006/02/...



I must say I love your question... The but where you say you have a habit of overthinking things.... your question really exemplifies how much thought you put into things. It is well worded and informative. I really hope that this comment doesn't offend you but just remember that your child is not a case study. He is your baby and many babies don't fit into the mold of a text book. I say this because I am a speech pathologist and it took me a few months to realise this. I was so used to concentrating on the theory that I had neglected to see my daughter as an individual.



The only other thing I can suggest is to realise that there is no set length of time for this to continue. My daughter slept through the nigth until about 5 months.... I've been telling myself since then that her terrible sleeping patterns are "just a phase".... but I've recently decided that her pattern has simply changed. This is the way babies work too....just when you think you've got them figured out they change their routine and you have to start "figuring" all over again



I hope that helps and like I said, I'm sorry if I offended you at all

My son always slept through the night, but I wasn't so lucky with my daughter (now 4). She would wake a few times during the night. Her doctor told me to try letting her "cry it out" when she cried in the middle of the night and another doctor told me NOT to let her cry. I tried to comfort her at first and when that didn't work I tried the "not going to get her no matter how much she cries" method. I broke down before she did, she's very persistent.



I may not have tried long enough but when the babies crying at 3 am and you haven't slept in a few nights it's hard to stick to. I remember calling my husband when he was away and I would be sitting outside her door just waiting for her stop (sometimes I was in tears too). I gave up on that method and then we tried changing her eating schedule. It worked like a charm. As you know though all babies are different :-)



I would try feeding him a bit later.



Good luck

<question>



If you saw yourself running low on formula?



if you saw yourself running low on formula, and you had very little money.. would you spend that money on something else, or get what your baby needs to survive?



i just read a question that someone had ran out of formula and was it ok to mix with rice or cereal until monday!!!! keeping in mind, this is friday, and the Baby was 3 1/2 mos old!



i know that if i see i only have a day or two left, i always buy more, so as not to be without, and we have a few cartons stashed away just in case. and if the worst came to the worst i would swallow my pride and ask to borrow some money!



so what do you guys think? even if you breast feed, what would you do in this situation?



</question>



<additional details>



just so people know.... not about me, it's from a question i just read.



i always have plenty for my son



the person was already on WIC!



WIC is something in america to help low incomes with food for babies, i think, not exactly sure.
the person is NOT  my friend, i don't know who they are it was a question i read.



we also have very little money, but we manage! :)



it doesn't take you to be well educated to know that you need formula for your baby if you aren't going to breast feed



they only have doctor's? and?! i only had one person too. the person who delivered my baby, and the person who checked me out. all within the space off hours. this was my 1st baby too. i didn't go to ante natal classes, but heck i read  A LOT of books. i taught myself what a baby needs, and a little bit of common sense goes a long way.

The formula would always be on top priority there.
Gee, I hope she gets some, a baby that age needs the formula, especially over that long.
I'd be asking for money too, my babys health would be more important than my pride too.

OMG I saw that question...I don't know wether it's sad or just plain ludicrous.



Surely she could've realised long before it became an issue that she was going to need more soon. And what was she going to do if her bub wouldn't eat any rice cereal...I mean everyone that has started their bub on solids knows that they don't really take much to start with anyways...



I mean, I could kinda understand someone asking this for maybe one or two feedings....not that I think that would be ok but I could understand someone who has little support wondering if it would be BUT SEVERAL DAYS!!!!!!!!

Well it's easy to judge but not everyone is well educated...in America the system is very different and some parents recieve little or no baby care education...here in the UK we are pretty much told everything by midwives...in the U.S. you have to pay extra for a midwife...they only get doctors...and education varies state to state....if you already have other children to feed and nobody to lend money to you it must be very difficult.

I always make sure that I  have a extra money set aside for baby essentials such as nappies, formula and baby food etc.



And as long as I am breastfeeding I know I will have a supply of already heated milk for my girls.

When did your baby start sitting up?



My daughter will be 16 weeks on Sunday and she really dislikes lying down. She started pushing down on her legs at 10 weeks and a week later discovered that she can see so much more while sitting up, so now she wants to do it all the time! Of course we support her at all times, but my friend seems to think it's too early. What do you think?

My first two were sitting by 4 months old.  My third is now 17 weeks old and has discovered the world of the vertical as well, lol... We are working with him to get him to sit up.  It really opens up a lot of things when they can start sitting up on their own.  It frees up your hands  a whole lot!!!!  I don't think it is too early at all.  All babies are different, if yours is showing interest in sitting, then great!!  Let her sit, lol.
I remember with my first son, I had read that by 4 mo they should be sitting so when I went into my sons 4 month well check I told the doc that I could not get him to sit up.  So he sat my son up and placed his lil legs just so and boom, he was sitting.  LOL... I can tell you my life got a lot easier after that!!!!  When my two older ones were lil we didn't have all these fancy gadgets, lol, to help them sit, we actually used a small box with blankets in it to help them learn to sit...



Anyway!!!  Next is scooting, or soldier crawling... then it gets really fun, lol!!!  Enjoy!!  :)

You have to make a 360º web page through Yahoo! then use the Yahoo! web page picture as your default.



CLICK "My Profile" .. then
CLICK "My 360º page" ..then
CLICK "My Page" .. then
CLICK "Add/Edit Photo" .. then
"UPLOAD" photo.



Then you use the uploaded photo as your avatar.
(when you're finished with the steps above)
CLICK "My Profile" again .. then "Edit Info" .. then instead of using your avatar as the picture, click "Use 360º picture."



Edit to ADD:
The picture that you upload has to be a .jpg file!



Did you create a page??
Did you upload a (.jpg.) photo to the page?
click save?



When you're in your page (you can upload 3 picture) click the circle next to the picture you want (it's a tiny dot on the right) and click SET AS DEFAULT.



Then go back to your profile and hit 'Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture.'

mine would have to be the fact he squirts his insulin (he's diabetic) over the floor to check the needle is working, and it leaves little white patches that i have to clean!



oh and also, does anyone know about diabetes being hereditary or not? he developed it around 8y/o

it's tye 1, where he has to inject the insulin because his panscreas stopped making it. im heart scared about Reece developing it, because his daddy hates having it so much, and i've seen what happenes when simple things like a cold catch him! last time he ended up in hosp with keytoacidosis or something!

2. He plays hockey on Wednesday nights and thinks that when he gets home at 2am I should be "in the mood" when his beer breath hits me.
3. He constantly complains about aches and pains and thinks it is my job to give him a 30 min rub down everynight. And whines like a child if I don't.

Diabetes oh that sucks! I think it's hereditary! I'd be heartsick to. Doesn't mean for sure he'll get it though. Maybe they'll have a cure by then, they talk about all sorts of stuff getting close to it with baby pigs or something.



My hubby brings in half the outside elements into my front room which is treacherous b/c you can trip so easily and go flying down the stairs. Grass, mud, manure from animals on his boots, dust, leaves and that's the door everyone comes to!
Also i threw a shower for my girlfriend once and i told my hubby make sure you clean up after your shower! So when a guest went in there i threw out a joke saying don't mind the underwears and junk in there thinking he'd put it at least in the hamper and  to my horror i overheard her telling her freind yeah she wasnn't kidding i had to take his scuzzy underwear off the toilet seat first before i could pee i was horrified!

My boyfriends dad is diabetic (Type 2), he became diabetic about a year ago (26 years, Type 1). However his brother does not have it. There is a possibility that your children could get it as my boyfriend did. But when you have children just try to feed them as healthily as possible and make sure they exercise to reduce the risk.

I don't know anything abut diabetes, but my husband does aggravate the crap out of me sometimes.



He never wants to be the one to discipline Sam. He wants to be the good guy and best friend and let Mommy be the mean one. And when he is in trouble, Daddy comes to the rescue! He'll get him out of time out early and love and kiss on him, and tell him it's okay. Which is fine, but he needs to let him know what he did wrong and why he was in time out, which he doesn't. He just can't resist those crocodile tears!!

when he calls to ask me if I want to go out at 8pm -- like I can just whip a baby sitter out and run out the door - LOL - it's like he doesn't even have to think about these types of things.  I think that it's just his way of saying "Babe, do you mind if I go out."



But...he is a great Dad, changes diapers, etc and a really good hubby -- oh, and he won $800 at the casino last night:o)

If i were to answer this question i wouldnt know where to stop lol.



The main things are he is so untidy, dont put anything away.
Its like tidying up after 2 children other than 1 like it should be.



The other 1 is dumping his clothes on the floor next to the bed.
Ive now refused to wash his clothes unless they are put in the dirty wash cupboard.

What grinds my gears is his "you do it better" attitude when it comes to changing diapers, getting our son dressed, bathing him and swaddling....I hate that!



He's changed him maybe 20 times in almost 5 months...had gotten him dressed once or twice (aside from putting pants back on after diaper change) and bathed him ONCE with me standing there telling him what to do.

Yes Diabetes is hereditary. Type II diabetes can be avoided by proper diet and excercise, however, Type 1 is develpoed when at a very young age and most people are insulin dependant for life. However, not every body will get it. Just keep an eye out and look for signs of excess sleeping or lethargy and make sure you mention it to the ped. he will run routine tests to make sure your baby is fine.....



oh and what grinds my gears is that my husband will leave the front door unlocked and the computers and lights on every night, n I have to shut everything off.....and that when he walks in the door, he  hugs n kisses the cats, instead of his 2 month old daughter.....

I can't stand the fact that my husband never helps with ANYTHING! He never does housework and he never helps with our son. He seems to think he's just the playmate and he doesn't have to change diapers, feed him or give him a bath (that 1 he has never done!). Then when he sees me about to explode from frustration he says, "what do you want help with, all you gotta do is ask" Why do I have to tell him what needs done and why do I have to ask for help? JUST DO IT! Wow, that feels better just to go off about it, Thanks!



As far as diabetes, I'm not for sure. No one in my family has it. Sorry I couldn't help with answering that.

<question>



My 5month old baby came home with a foul smell...what would you do?



Let me give you a little background as to what happened.....My son goes to a home day care where he is the only baby and the only other child at the day care is like 2yrs old. I chose this daycare when I was returning to work after my maternity leave.



On this particular morning, I rang the doorbell and no one answered right away. When the door was opened for me, my son's caregiver's grandson (who by the way 30yrs old) had no shirt on, with a doo-rag on his head let me in. Well, Ms. R (thats what we'll call her) came from the back of the house, still in her nightgown and the other little boy with her. They both looked like they both just woke up. I was a little disturbed that she wasn't up and ready to receive my son that morning. I shouldn't have had to wake her. I was running late and decided not to question it right then and there.



Well, when I picked my baby up after work. She was still in her night gown. When I got home, took off his pram suit I smelled a very foul odor on my baby. Not to be disgusting but he strongly smelled musty and un-washed private parts (of a woman that is). I had to take my son's clothes off immediately, give him a bath, lotion him up and put on his jammies. My husband was outraged.



I spoke to her this morning about it and she claimed it didn't come from her but from her grandson who she says does not wash up. By the way, if you're wondering, HE DOES NOT EVEN LIVE THERE.



Mrs. R is an older lady of about her 60's or early 70's. I didn't want to offend her bcuz of her age but I had no other choice to speak on it. I don't believe it was her grandson bcuz I asked did her grandson handle my baby. She said no but then why would my baby smell like that if he is stinky?



What would you have done? SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY!!

You did the right thing by speaking up.  Unfortunately, in a situation like this, you are not going to get a clear answer as to what is really going on.  The events you describe - how unprepared the caregiver was to take your child, the 30 year old grandson hanging around, and the odor - all sound like red flags to me that something just isn't right.  Follow your intuition.  I would seek alternative arrangements as soon as possible.  This situation gives me the creeps.

Get a different sitter. God knows what might happen. Really I am  being serious. No good day care provider is still in her nightgown when the Moms come to pick up the child, and the baby should never smell at all unless her diaper is dirty. Something doesn't "feel" right about this to me - be careful.

Take your child out of there!!! ASAP and if oyu know who the other little boy's mom is I would contact her too and let her know how about this.
I have two young children and I'll bre freaked out about it! If she cannot handle looking after young children she shouldnt do it. And with that guy there, you gave me the creeps!! seriously I wouldnt take him there anymore. I know this will a be a hassle for you, but I think it's for your baby's safety.!



Tip: when you look for a permanent placing for your son look into a daycare center where things are out in the open, and it isnt a house, and everybody has credentials to work with children.

I would be upset too.  I say find someone else.  You are trusting someone to take care of your child.  You want them to be just as good as you.  That is not healthy for that child to be breathing in nasty smells.  Just tell her it doesn't work out.  She does not sound very professional, I would be pulling my child out of there.

My girls are 12 and 8  BUT they were in day care when little and I am glad you questioned her about it. How long has he been in her care and is this a problem that has happened before or a one time thing? Did he have on the same clothes as when you left him? Was his diaper clean or soiled? (besides the odor). I would answer those questions then go from there. Just first guess I would say find someone to keep him until you find another sitter, maybe a friend or family member you can trust, just until you do find someone else. I would be like you and very suspicious he was not taken care of well, but you need to re-evaluate the entire time she has had him. But I strongly agree you should not have had to wake her up that'ss her job and she should have been ready for him and by the time you got back, she certainly should have been dressed. Yourbaby'ss welfare is the most important, don't worry about hurting her feelings by removing him.

Personally I would have been FURIOUS, and if he came home smelling like "down there" I would jump to the conclusion she sexual abused him. Do you get that feeling from her? If so report her, she does not need to being keeping children. No matter her age. I can't think of anything else that would cause him to smell that way. I would start looking for a new babysitter at least.

I would ask the lady why she would let the 30 yo handle your child if you had an agreement that she would watch him, not the 30 yo watch your son.  I would call her again and ask all kinds of questions. I would then call the non-emergency police phone number and ask them what you should do. I would also call the state license board and get advice there too. I would definitely NOT take him back there!!! Find a reputable daycare service or stay at home with your child.



If he's 30, he should be working.
If she's a caretaker, she should NOT be in her PJs.

call the police on that place, or report them to social services. you are not sure what they have done to your child, and it sounds like something may have happened that is wrong. they clearly do not look after the children there properly, and noone's child should be in their care. and of course, NEVER take your child there again. it sounds dodgey.

Here me loud and clear!



NEVER take him back there!!!.  A friend of mine even had to file charges on her father-in-law for sexual abuse with her daughter.  This had been going on since her daughter was a few months old.  If family members will do things, so will strangers.  People can be real sick and things we can not even image, they do and think nothing of it.  Protect your Child at all times, and follow your strong feelings.



Yes, I would talk to a lawyer and file some charges, cause other children down the line could be involved, if you do not raise a red flag, NOW!.

Do you live near the grandparents? If yes, and baby likes them, drop the kid off and then do nothing. Don't use it as a planned time to do whatever chore; just spaz out. Read magazines in the bathtub for three hours.

I know how you feel.  I'm a full-time student with a full-time job and single parent (my fiance is currently in prison).  Here are some ideas.
•  Cut back on chores — and use that time to put your feet up, nap, or read a book. (if it's possible)
•  Take advantage of sick days or vacation whenever possible. Spending a day — or even an afternoon — resting at home will help you get through a tough week.
•  Try deep-breathing exercises
•  Get regular exercise such as swimming or walking  You can take your baby with you.
•  Do your best to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet so you have the physical and emotional energy you need.
•  Get some sleep while you can.  When your baby is sleeping just take a nap with him/her.
•  Find a babysitter and go out with some friends

I was told this and I was glad I was told this because it's true even if new parents don't want to admit it....



Newborn babies are BORING!  They don't do anything.  THey eat, sleep, cry and poop.  They don't start to get interesting until about 6+ weeks..so don't feel bad if while baby is sleeping one day you look down and think "Man, am I bored."  I love my son with all my heart but he was so boring in the beginning, now he's a whirlwind of fun.



Enjoy your baby....oh...one more thing....

I thought i was going to sleep, iwas in the hospital for 3 days due to high fever after delivery. Well i thought they took the baby at night into a nursery but they don't lol, atleast not at my hospital. So i never got sleep my little boy wanted me to hold him the whole time. Which now i think is better but at least my mom/someone could have given me the heads up.



(edit)
i totally agree with Starry Eyes. Baby's are boring. The first few days are like oohh awww but then you really do get like "man with he/she just wake up" lol its very true.

OMG YES! I wish someone had told me that it gets better after those first two months. All the crying and fussiness and every two hour feedings and it's SO hard to take the baby out in the beginning. I can't even think of everything now, but you'll see soon enough.



But it gets easier once you get the hang of it. You'll probably spend some time sitting up crying from exhaustion and frazzled nerves, but trust me...it does get easier.  So just hang in there when you think you're going crazy.

I had never been around babies at all either.  My DS is 16 weeks old now.  If there was one thing I could have differently was NOT TO WORRY SO MUCH!  I worried and worried and worried that I wasn't doing things right, I worried every time he cried, etc...  Babies are a lot more sturdy than we think.  There are times I wish I could turn back the clock to the day he was born and start over.



Just relax and enjoy the special closeness when your baby is so small!  Don't worry about cleaning the house!  Sleep when your LO sleeps!  Don't be afraid to ask for help!  Oh, and if you are going to breastfeed, you may want to limit your visitors to just people you will feel comfortable exposing your breasts to.  You will be breasfeeding about every hour or two while you are in the hospital - and also ask to use a breast pump to help your milk come in sooner.  Also remember your hormones are still out of whack, so you will be very emotional for a couple of weeks!



Oh - and my great aunt told me that the first 3 months are ALL WORK, and after that is gets soooo much easier - and she was right!

Actually I got told TOO MUCH stuff.  I expected the baby to be up all day and night, crying constantly, I expected to never be able to clean or take a shower, I expected everything to just be a mess.  They lie to you!  The first couple of months baby sleeps all day and all night waking every 2-4 hours to eat, and then falls right back to sleep.  I really expected to be up all day every day going to babies needs.  Newborns don't need much.  A clean diaper, a warm sleeper, a warm bottle, maybe a bouncer and they are set.  You have plenty of time to clean, take a shower, cook, and even take a FEW naps (not just one) during the day.  It's not until 4 months and up they start getting active and everything is a challenge to get done.  But by that time you have developed a routine that baby is used to and you can still get things done.  I literally thought my house was going to be a disaster for the first year or two, and that we would not know what ahome cooked meal was for a long time.  It's not as "hard" as people make it sound.



Here is some info I wish I knew before I delivered.  You still experience "contraction" like pain a few days after baby is born due to your uterus going down.  When we were leaving the hospital they gave me a prescription for pain killers and I said "oh I dont need that, I'm not that sore I'll be fine."  Well my first night home I found out what that prescription was for.  It was the middle of the night and Iwas woken up with pains like I was going into labor.  No pharmacy was open so I couldn't get my prescription until the next morning.

Be ready for post-partum depression. I wasn't prepared for it with my first baby and when the 'baby blues' hit it was terrible. I cried for two days and was ready to send the baby back, I was so tired, sleep-deprived, trying to breast feed, and sore from an episiotomy. Hubby was working full time and I had no one to help me out. When I had my second, I knew it was coming. That made it a little easier, but my angel was my mother-in-law. She was there to help me, hug me, and cry with me. It made a world of difference.
So my advice: accept help until you're ready to fly solo, don't worry about house-keeping, etc. - let someone give you a hand. You'll need to sleep when the baby sleeps at first until that sleep schedule gets on track. Don't be too hard on yourself if you feel overwhelmed...it gets better!

I agree with Carter's mommy, I was told more than what it was so I was freaked out. I was told I was going to be SOOO busy, nonstop crying and fussing. That I may need to seek extra help for household chores. Ends up being that the first three months, all they do is eat, poop and sleep. You have plenty of time to clean up, take showers, watch t.v
the only thing that was correct is the little sleep you get. I got maybe one hour every five hours of sleep.
Good luck and Congrats

Reposting my question - what would you do?



I am a SAHM with a 19 months boy and an almost 3 months girl. I breastfed my son for 10 months and stopped after 3 months of my 2nd pregnancy - I couldn't make any milk at that point.
Now with my daughter I have so many problems.
I had to stop breastfeeding her at week 1 because my nipples were bleeding. I freaked out when I saw some blood coming out of her mouth. So, I decided to pump the milk and feed her with a bottle.
I tried to breastfeed her everyday but it was too painful. When I recovered completely, she ended up refusing the breast. I tried everything including medela SNS, finger feeding and so on. No way!
She nurses only when she's sleepy but it's not enough.
I don't want to try anything else to breastfeed exclusively. I tried for a week and it was a nightmare for me and especially for my baby.
So I pump night and day. The problem is that I don't have time to do anything else and I have 2 kids. I would like to spend more time playing with them.
Question: If I pump 7 times a day I can provide 90% of the milk my daughter needs. If I drop a couple of pumps my milk supply decreases considerably and I can provide only 60% - 50%.
Of course my baby is more gassy and fussy with more formula.
What would you do in my place?



Thank you for reading.

Swaddling question... kind of?



Ok, so I swaddle my son when he goes to sleep. This morning I woke up and he had wiggled down into the middle of it kind of. I couldn't see his head at all :(



It scared the crap out of me, but I've seen him wiggle when he was partially waking up. I suppose he could have made a noise while half waking up that woke me up.



Anyway, I uncovered him right away. It was dark, so I didn't see if he had lost any color, but the second I picked him up he responded. And like 2 minutes later (after I had calmed down) I turned on the lights and he looked fine.



It was a slightly heavier blanket than a receiving blanket, only because I had read on a site about swaddling that it was ok to use a heavier or flannel blanket if it was cold... Which it is in my room.



Anyway, I know loss of oxygen can cause problems, so my question is... Do you think he'll be ok?



I'm too worried to sleep. And I only got like 2 hours of sleep. Next time I'll know better and use a lighter blanket...



</question>



<additional details>



I've tried not swaddling him, but he won't sleep without it unless he's on his tummy (on mine or my husbands chest) and I'm too afraid to lay him on his tummy in his bassinet.



Plus he's only 3 weeks old, lol. I'm not trying to swaddle an older baby or anything.



I think I was half awake and I heard him sneeze or something. I remember hearing a noise that made me want to move and check. Which is why I think he'll be ok too, I think I just want to hear it. Lol



Maybe I'll try that. He doesn't seem to like it as much as he used to, and keeping an arm out would keep it off his head too. Quite a good idea... Thanks :)



And I know I should just leave the room warm... But we've been sleeping in the living room out of laziness lol. So I didn't bother to check the room temp earlier to make sure it was warm. I tried using a receiving blanket but he was so fussy. Once he was warm he calmed, and I was so tired...



I can't help but feel like a bad mommy sometimes. I feel like I'm always doing something wrong. And I often correct my husband because of my own insecurities, and then he gets mad because he says I treat him like he doesn't know how to take care of him. And then I feel worse and can't explain.



Anyway, thanks guys. Maybe I'll get some sleep. But probably not lol.

Aw, you poor thing!! I can only imagine how scary that must've been. I imagine that since he responded imediately, he'll be fine. If he had lost enough oxygen to cause any damage, he would've passed out (consciousness goes first, then brain cells are affected).



Also, my friend actually puts a blanket over her baby (he's 10 months) when he is going to sleep... seems totally crazy to me....she says he does it himself to get to sleep so now she just does it for him. It is just a light blanket but she puts it over his face and then once he falls asleep she takes it off!!! I know...it sounds MAD, but the point is, the boy is fine.



I'm sure your little man will be perfectly ok



ETA



Try swaddling him with his arm(s) out. Lucy used to wiggle out from about 3 weeks onwards, but wouldn't sleep without it. I left one arm out and that kept her happy for another week, then the other arm had to be left out.... another week or so and she was sleeping unswaddled



ETA (again)



You're not a bad mummy!! You're a new mummy and you're still learning .... in fact the learning will never stop. There is ALWAYS something to feel guilty about when it comes to motherhood but you made an honest mistake. If you had've know what may have happened I am 100% positive you would not have done it.

You never know, that could of been a close call but Im sure hes fine now. I wouldnt swaddle with a heavier blanket only a receiving and then put a warmer one over him from about the waist down. Also make sure your swaddling right, theres many different ways and some are better than others.

I'm sure he will be okay.  Yes, loss of oxygen can potentially cause problems; however, it sounds like he wasn't lossing any for too long.  I work in the medical field, and if a baby "looses oxygen" they will turn blue and usually need some extent of resuscitation to resume breathing.  I wouldn't worry since he had good color.



About the swaddling....it's not reccommend to swaddle a baby while they sleep.  It is better to make sure the temperature in the room is nice and warm and not use covers on babies that aren't old enough to move the covers away.  Just like the potential problem swaddling caused you, it can "smother" a baby no matter how thick or thin the blanket is if the baby is unsupervised.  It's okay to use the things that help hold the baby to keep them from rolling around, but as a general rule, the less in the crib the better.  It's okay to swaddle your baby if your gonna be awake and be able to see him, but not at night while your sleeping and may not hear him (if the blanket's over his face he may not be able to cry).
Please...don't think your a bad mother or anything either.  Almost everyone swaddle's their babies at night instead of warm the room, so it's something you and alot of people probably don't even realize.



I hope this helps you out a little.

VERY early teething. Has this happened to anyone else's baby?



My daughter will be three months old in eight days. She is already teething! She is always chewing on her hands, has bright red rosy cheeks, excessive dribbling and a sore bum. This is my first child and I thought babys started teething at about six months. She is quite a big baby because I breast feed her, and being so young with a tooth she will look much older. Has anybody else had an early teether? When will her first tooth cut? Thanks in advance :-)

I had a friend that wanted to solely breast feed and after a couple of weeks the doctor told her to start including formula in the baby's diet as well because of the nutruition in it.  Her problem was not enough iron and the doctor said it would help with that, but it also had many other things that would help with developement.  Her doc said it was really hard to provide all the nutrients your baby need with just breast milk even if you ate a perfect diet for breastfeeding.  You should discuss this with your baby's doctor so that he could reccommend a formula that may be better to start with.  It also helped her with "filling up" with too much milk due to irregular feeding, because if the baby got hungry at a odd time or wanted to eat more she could give formula too.  Good luck!

We moved them into their own rooms around 1 month.  They were in a bassinette next to the bed in our room for the first 4 weeks or so, then we moved them to the crib in their room.



It worked out fine for us, my wife was always thinking she heard the babies on the monitor for a couple of weeks, but after that everyone was happy.



Good luck, but remember, it doesn't matter when anyone else did it, it only matters when you think its time.

I moved my daughter at about 6 weeks. There were two main reasons:
Everytime she woke up I'd resettle her automatically...even though all she'd do was toss and turn for about 10 seconds and resettle so easily without me, I'd automatically put me hand on her. I didn't want her getting used to that happening every hour



But the main reason is that she outgrew her bassinet and we couldn't fit the cot in our room. She is a long baby and very active, she was hitting her head on the side of the bassinet so we thought she'd be better off in the cot



She made the transition very easily and so did we. She slept through the night and I only checked on her when I woke up (which wasn't often lol).



She's now no longer sleeping through (she's 8 months and If she sleeps for 3 hours in a row it's a good night lol), and we've moved ...there is room in our bedroom for the cot now so we are thinking of putting her in there so I don't have as far to go when she wakes up

My babies stayed in my room for the first few nights of their lives only, after that they were in there own room. I use a baby monitor. I have never had a problem with my girls and sleeping, one 3 and half, and other 7months, they are and were familiar with their surroundings. I'd sleep much better coz even the littlest movement or slightest murmur would wake me and that in turn would wake up babies.

My son got his own room as soon as we finally moved into a 2 bdrm place. lol. He was just shy of one year. My son has always been a good sleeper so he was fine, so were we. I was just worried about not being able to hear him but a baby monitor does the trick. Also before we go to bed I will open his door a bit and leave ours open as well. He also sleeps with a very dim light on although Im not sure he really cares.

It could be any amount of muscle strain or tearing, since you had a natural birth. [congrats to you!!]. I would still recommend going to your OB, or even just a regular doctor, in case it's not pregnancy related... It could very well be something else. Good luck!

Healthy for single mother to sleep around?



My friend became pregnant by her long-time BF who walked out on her after she refused to get an abortion (she was desperate to have a baby).



She's now looking for a man to take care of her and her baby.



The problem is that she is $34,000 in debt and while she was with her BF, she:



Had 3 "friends with benefits"



Slept with 4 men in one month.



Had 8 one-night stands.



Will she continue this lifestyle after she has her baby? She is now more desperate than ever to find a man.



She also feels that a baby will make all the things in her life okay.



I don't think she has thought things through but she is in her 30s and acts like a teenager.



Will another man want to take on the responsibility of taking care of her and her baby? I'm assuming she won't tell the new man in her life about her VERY promiscuous past -she's NEVER been faithful to any of her ex-BFs.

Lactose free formula bad for baby?



My baby has a lactose intolerancy. Until we kinda experiement with solids, we dont know what degree of intolerancy it is.. he was switched to lactose free formula when he was about 3 weeks old by a baby nurse.



Lately I have heard that by giving them no lactose, you are killing any chance their bodies have of building up the ability to deal with lactose later. Is this true.. should I switch to normal formula and see how he goes? They can grow out of lactose intolerance depending on the level of the reaction they have to it. I just hope I am not stopping his body from learning how to di that.

Yes babies can outgrow there lactose intolerance. I would try the other formula (milk based) and see how it goes all you can do is try, my middle son had the same problem and at the age of 9 months we switched from Enfamil Lacto Free to Enfamil with Iron and we had no problems, actually became a more content baby, no more gas (well as bad anyway). This was almost ten years ago and I know they have made huge advances with formula and are much better than they used to be so I would give it a shot. Good luck...:)

When you find that you want to introduce cows milk simply do it in slow stages and the lactase (the enzyme that deals with the lactose) can gradually increase. When you're ready I'd start with yoghurt and then mix in a little cows milk with the formula and build up. The lactase just needs time to increase in production, if there is no lactose it virtually disappears, so just build it up

Did having vaccinations ruin my 12wk old baby's sleep pattern?



Hi, was wondering, My 12wk old slept through for the first time a few nights ago he slept from 8pm-6.15am I was shocked! I breastfeed so my boobs were like rocks! Anyway he had his vaccinations the day after and he was waking up again, do you think it was the vaccinations that made him wake up? He was very grizzly after his jabs so I'm thinking maybe this is why he was waking up? I did give him a little calpol like they say.  If he continues not to sleep through again why did he sleep though just that one night?

I think it was just coincidence. The  very first night we moved my son to his own room to his crib he slept from 10PM-5:30AM (it was a late night) and then the next night was from 9 PM-5:30 AM and then he stopped doing it and hasn't done it since. He was about 13 weeks. Who knows why babies do what they do....sometimes my son will wake once a night, sometimes he'll wake 4 and sometimes he'll do something in between. It's crazy, I know. lol

Mom, calm down.  Babys have VERY erratic sleep patterns for a while after birth.  And please don't fall prey to all the anti-vaccine nonsense in the media today.  Unless people like the idea of some really nasty diseases making a comeback.  I'm getting off topic.  Seriously, calm down and get used to it mom, babys are usually up every four hours for the first few MONTHS of life.  Once and a while they do sleep a whole night though;)

i breastfed my little girl until she was 1!!
ok u need to relax a little, u r both new to this and are still learning.
your milk sounds like its coming in today so she is more than likely getting the milk she needs from her short feeds the same as when she fed for a while.
i would advice keeping her on one breast until she is due her next feed, as the breast starts like a 3 course dinner, with fore milk and hind milk in the back so she is getting the right amount!! the trick with breastfeeding, is to relax enjoy and feed on demand, u cant go wrong this way, if herNappy'ss are wet and she seems content in every other way she is fine!! good luck  xx

You could try putting the moses basket in the cot, put him down in the moses basket for a couple of nights, he will get used to the location etc of the cot, then take the moses basket away , this can sometimes help.



I borrowed a crib off a friend, so went from moses basket , to crib (much smaller than a cot) then onto cot . Hope this helps , good luck :)

put something in his cot with your scent on it to comfort him like a sweater that you have worn for 2 days  also make sure he is wrapped snug try the moses basket in the cot for a while first the bigger space is making him feel insecure

The lifting of the head via a pillow under the mattress is a good idea



We also used a misting device when my baby was sleeping
there may be some vicks for children as well, for under the nose or on the chest



If all else fails a ride in the car at night always worked when things got un-bearable



I would keep using the saline it loosens things up

What is really going on with my son ?



my son is 2 months old and has been spitting up alot he also always sounds like he cant breathe right.  his nose is really stuffy.  he also gets really stiff and mad as you know what after eating.



so i took him to the doctor and he said he has acid reflex.  he gave him some medicine but it doesnt seem to be doing anything and just recently got a horrible diaper rash.  he cries bloody murder every time i change him.  the doctor also told me to change his formula i use to have him on a hypo allergen formula but now he is on enfimil a.r.  for babies who spit up.  is there anything i can do for his diaper rash is looks so bad.



</question>

<answer>



The only thing i can suggest is get a cream from the chemist. You may wanna explain to the chemist what hass been going on with your son, so they give you a cream that wont cause a reaction, also they may be able to give you panadol for newborns to manage the pain the rash is causing him.

Has anyone tried the Brauer brand "calm"?



For those that don't know, Brauer is a homeopathic "medicine" range with products for teething, colic, etc etc
They also have one called "calm". It is supposed to be good for restless babies and those that don't sleep well.... also supposed to be good to facilitate sleep in for teething babies. It is all natural/herbal
Just wondering if anyone has tried it and whether they found it any good

Generally speaking evidence suggests that homeopathics do not really work, but do no harm.  Most of the ones for babies are in a sugar base and sugar itself is a powerful medicine.



Just make sure that there are no nasty preservative (and "all natural" doesn't mean safe, I've seen some all natural products with sodium benzoate which is bad enough but even worse when they also add citric acid)
