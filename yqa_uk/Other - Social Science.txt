They just might get there you know.
If you compare todays examples with "neanderthals" we've definitely
come a long way, but I doubt if you or I are going to be



surrounded by einsteins and barbie dolls in our lifetime!

No.. we will continue to evolve though, but more likely to little fat people with dark hair and brown eyes. and though we will all know what Einstein knew our intelligence will come out of a box.

Dream on,



anyway, not only humans will evolve but who knows the result of the evolution will be. with the thinning of our ozone layer, toxic waste dumped that being sipped to our water reservoir... humans might evolve with a little mutation.

Personally, I don't want to be surrounded by those kind of people. Enough of those wannabees floating around now as it is. If we do evolve, we will look like a product of our environment. From ruining our ozone layer, we will most likely have a different kind of skin, something protective. From exhausting our wildlife, we will be eating alternative food sources, so our whole digestive systems will be different,and maybe our teeth as well. I think we will look like some kind of futuristic freak, if you think about it.

<answer>



Evolution does not make us better that way - there is no progression to more intelligence, beauty or strength. Instead evolution tunes populations to fit the local environment as best they can.



While intelligence is important for survival, we're probably smart enough already and there's few environmental factors that weed out the dumb, in fact cultural factors seem to encourage it, so don't expect IQs to rise.



Neither do we need to be superheroes - we're strong enough now to survive, reproduce, and rear our kids - that's all evolution asks. We could get stronger though in terms of disease resistance. So don't look for superheroes in the future but you will find some human populations wiped out from emerging diseases and others who survive well enough.



Neither do we need good looks - appearance (especially Barbie!) is a cultural norm and has little to do with evolution. Beautiful people may have more sex - that doesn't mean they have more kids - and Darwinian fitness is measured by reproductive success. Beyond that, beauty is not completely heritable to begin with.



Of course human populations will evolve forever - shifts in gene frequencies in populations are considered evolutionary - these change all the time and can be easily measured, but although this scale of evolutionary change is rarely evident, just because you can't see a change doesn't mean there hasn't been a change.

Do you know they hate you?  Have they told you they hate you?
It doesn't do you any good to make assumptions like that. You just end up being paranoid.



I've been teased and ridiculed at work before and you either ignore it or change jobs. Its not your problem. Its theirs. There might be something about you that makes them feel uncomfortable. But it's still not your problem. They are the ones with the issues.



Just keep your self respect and if it all gets too much either change your look or move town!

The greatest strength a person can have, is the wisdom to know how to walk in humbleness.



To be soft spoken, and shy away from aggression, anger, and frustration.  A shy person is at peace with them self.



Intelligence is marked in the right response, not by just responding.  A shy person will respond at the right time.  Usually well thought out, in few words.



Finally, which will most people listen to; loud shouting and angered word, or a soft whisper?  Doesn't the whisper calm, and cause you to listen?  And when yelled at, do not most people close their ears to such noise?



Shyness isn't fear or weakness.  It's strength of character and a show of true boldness, to walk quietly, and deliver ultimate change, not through brute force of will, but calm surrender.

Social skills are learned over a lifetime, as you meet different people.  You're still a student, so you have a lot of life ahead of you.  Just relax and take things as they come.  You can't cram for social skills like you would for an exam.  I was hopelessly inept in social situations until I was nearly 30, but now I can talk to anybody about anything.  We change as we mature.  It'll happen to you, just be patient.

I've never heard of anything like that and the fact that you want to improve your brain or whatever is just weird. the best thing really is to watch people and listen. See how they interact and try to learn how to pick up on social cues.

I would say to read a lot of common events... Books that you yourself are interested in.. And forums are sometimes good because the people hiding behind their computers aren't afraid to let out real feelings sometimes..

Is it weird ..............................…



that it kinda makes me uncomfortable when my bf touches my face and looks deeply into my eyes and tells me that I'm beautiful....it makes me feel strange because I definitely don't see what he sees I often wonder what ppl really think when they look at me and to have someone that close makes me feel weird...I wonder if I was meant to even ever be with someone because I can be around guys just fine if I don't like someone,but when I actually do I just feel kinda awkward.....how can I be in a relationship if I can't even feel comfortable??

If you don't feel comfortable, don't be in a relationship. Also, what ur bf does is extreemly sweet and romantic and i think a lot of girls including myself wouldl love that. Even if you don't see what he sees, try to be embrace and enojy the fact that he thinks your beautiful.

Self-perception is tricky that way. You may think of yourself as O.K. or average, and another sees you as beautiful or ugly. Go figure. Think well of yourself without excess egotism or negativism and see what the rest do. I've been surprised by very pretty girls who act ho-hum plain, and plain-to-ugly guys who act like movie stars. Vice-versa. If you are not comfortable, try a new bf. The emotional vibes may not mesh yet, but you'll sure know it when they do! Best wishes.

Can you suggest some nice places I could live?



I like cold weather, I hate being in the sun. I like quaint little streets, cottages, nature, lush green grass, flowers, I like laid back atmospheres and small populations. My favourite animal is the cat. I live in stinking hot Queensland, Australia where its busy and filled with road rage. I can't wait to leave when I graduate nursing at university in two years. I want to relocate to a place that suits my likes, as listed above. Where do you suggest? I visited Ireland recently, and I loved it! It was everything I've dreamed of. I sometimes think I don't really belong where I live, because I really don't enjoy any part of the busy man-made concrete environment. Please tell me what type of person I sound like, and where I should move to? Thanks!
I'm a 21 year old Caucasian female.

I like to pair colors with other colors, like purple and bright red, green and purple, etc. I don't like colors just by themselves. Idk why.... I think it's because, colors just by themself, to me, is really boring. But, when they are paired together it's more "exciting" and it pops more.



But I guess if I had to pick one color to be my favorite color, it would be either green or purple. Probably because there are so many shades of green that can match with so many other playful colors and same thing for purple. Purple, to me, is a really loud and fun color.

Pink.
As a child, I always thought my grandmothers voluminous pink drawers looked a little obscene as the whole line full billowed in the wind looking as though they could move a galleon through the roughest seas.
Pink was always known as a "fat girl colour" when we were kids because it seemed to be favoured by oversize girls.

Fellow Aussies: What is so attractive about Queensland?



I am a 21 year old female, and I've lived in outer Brisbane, QLD my entire life. It used to be nice and quiet but now its basically been invaded by floods of people from other parts of Australia and I find that QLD is way too busy and crowded and fast paced. Its quite sad, because it used to nice. I don't really care if people want to move here... because as soon as I finish uni, I'm leaving ... but basically I want to know: what do people find so attractive about QLD? I mean, its stinking hot and with 1,500 people newcomers each week its a little too crowded. I don't see the attraction? I have heard that people move here from Sydney to get away from the atmosphere in Sydney, but then won't QLD end up just like Sydney anyway due to being swamped by newcomers? I am just confused. Please enlighten me fellow citizens.

8,00,000 TIMES.
AVERAGE AGE 70 YEARS
365 DAYS *70 =25550
ABOUT 40 TIMES ANY PERSON ENTERS IN HIS ROOM EVERYDAY
SO 25550*40=1022000 TIMES BUT NO , ABOUT 25% TIMES HE DOES NOT DO SO REASON HE IS KID, OUT OF TOWN, SICK,OLD ETC.
SO FINAL ANSWER IS 8,00,000 TIMES.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Political and social chaos has been with us for a very long time. Given the revolutions of the past and present, class warfare, and scheming of those seeking power, the human race has shown a remarkable resilience and managed to survive thus far.

The new factors in the equation of the balance of mankind and the rest of nature are the technological advances that have changed how political and social chaos can develop, and the advances in industry that have the potential to inflict serious environmental alterations. Threats of nuclear war, biological catastrophe, and climate change now bring into question as to how humanity can continue to survive.

Personally, I think that with the growth of true threats to survival, there has been growth of human ingenuity as well. We have yet to release a Frankenstein's monster of technology upon the world. Despite the stockpiles of nuclear weapons, there has been no global warfare. Medical research is in a renaissance of advance. Climate change remains a concern, but I believe that we are an adaptable species, as we have adapted before and will again.

The larger question is how will humanity survive, which is what is asked. It's very likely that the resources of today may no longer be available in a century. But consider the resources available today that were not available a century before. As stated before, we are an adaptable species, and when one window of resources closes, it's likely that other windows will be openable.

Of course, the speed that everything progresses at has increased. Will we be able to adapt in time? Perhaps not for a lot of us, but consider that in the 14th century, the Black Death wiped out over a third of Europe's population. Yet Europe survived and prospered. We may again have a catastophe that has similarly devestating effects, but I feel confident that after the catastrophe, humankind will prosper.

Why do I place this faith in humanity? Because I must. Without the belief that we will continue to grow and overcome the pains of social chaos as we mature as a species, we might as well not have any faith at all. I'm not talking religion (although that may or may not be a part in its current forms), but simply the same belief that we will survive just as much as the sun will rise the next day.

Note to Stephen Hawking: Why not take the best 100 answers and put them in a new book? I'm sure it would sell well and make a lot of money, as well as give the world a condensed view of our collective opinion. Just make sure MY answer is also in the book. (I wanted to win.)

Yes, and I for once feel very reassured that a question which seems to evoke so much pessimism has also evoked strong reactions towards faith in the best of humankind and its survival.

I only agree with the point that is brought up ¶ 4, but it is important. What makes the current population sustainable at all is use of resource-depleting technology. So  there would have to be a large population reduction. The important thing is what in human nature compelled us in the first place.

Although well thought out the chosen answer is not tangible.  Just having faith and hope does not always result in what we positively expect.  I for one cannot pin humanity's fate on inaction.  Action, whether short or long term, will determine our future.

Great answer...It was well thought out and it gave me a message of hope and faith which in turn can spur the actions we need to take.  When hope and faith are lost then action becomes pointless.  Thank you.  And thanks to Dr. Hawking for actually picking a best answer.

Many thanks to Dr. Hawking for asking the question. Wouldn't it be better to also work at making the planet a better, more hospitable place for all its inhabitants, and therefore actually THRIVE? I think that's what was meant in the 'how' of the question.

I honestly think the answer lies within our most treasured book, the Bible.  I don't believe it is a question we have to ponder or wonder, for God has already shown us the way, the truth and the light.

Well stated, thoughtful answer but it doesn't give a practical response.  Maybe the question should have been stated differently if Dr. Hawkings was looking for a philosophical response.  (Or maybe my comment here is just sour grapes.)  Either way it was a thought provoking question/answer process.

This answer is proof that, Yahoo Answers are a sham and, Hawking didn't choose from or read ALL the answers. It doesn't answer the question. Rather it answers a different question of "why we might survive" with the past evidence of the fact we survived the Plague. Are you kidding me?

Great literature, bad answer. Here's why: (1)"we will adapt because we did so before"; (2)"technology will save us from its previous misuses". (1) is conjecture (tell it to the dinosaurs) and (2) is magical thinking (powerful toys allow powerful misuses). This view offers complacency, not solutions.

The chosen answer is good since faith and hope is the underlining feeling in almost everything we do and think (or at least most of us).  Reacting to events as they happen should also be balanced with proactive or preventative measures i.e. education, fines for overpollution...etc.



Alan



Remember that God has minimized His interference with us. How are we supposed to learn as a race or individually if He prevents everything bad from happening? We are supposed mature and an intelligent race (as a whole anyways).  Nothing is written that God cannot change (Revelations from the Bible)

Though there are many thoughts and action plans,discussions and wars  to go through, they key point lies in being. 
It will be with difficulty and perhaps by coincidence which is probably not coincidently happening, some of us will survive.

It may be deeper than how to.

I do feel that, considering the utterly vast number of people who answered this question, more than one answer should be "unofficially" selected. It's not quite fair that this answer - despite being quite good -  is only .003% of all answers yet gets 100% of the glory.

Much respect to Dr. Hawking and congrats to the chosen one, but the answer he chose as the "best answer" is no real answer at all. Basically, it says to leave the problem to the future generations and hope that they are smarter than us and develop the answers.



ASDFGHJK...



Man this is an honor, even if this questions answer is old! And he actually had the time to pose this to us (refering to the community)! But he actually never picked out the best, the Yahoo staff did, that's a little dissapointing.



Master Maverick



I do hope this will not be interpretted as bitterness, as I did participate in this question. I’m not bothered that my answer wasn’t selected, but I really have to express my dissent, over the one that was. Did Hawking pick that, or was it the yahoo answers staff?



Master Maverick



In either case, why in the hell did you select one that directly contradicted Hawking’s stated purpose for asking the question? I thought his point was to get us thinking about the problems we have, as a species, and consider solutions, not shrug and say, “We’ll survive somehow.”



Master Maverick



It’s all yammering that comes down to, “Hey, we’ve made it this far, we’ll survive!” I realize that optimism is important, but faith alone is not enough. The answer you picked shrugs off and basically ignores the threats we face. It offers nothing more than moral support.



Master Maverick



Are you people running some kind of after-school special, here? Sure we can overcome great disasters, and survive. But I think it would be a better idea to see if we can’t…oh, I don’t know…AVOID those disasters?!



Master Maverick



Or did I not interpret the question correctly? Was it more about preventing global catastrophes, or does a struggling species in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust qualify as “surviving”?

Elana



I am curious if Dr. Hawkings has seen any studies regarding what solving
the CO2 global warming effect really would mean.



Elana



That is, if we stop dumping carbon into the atmosphere, but continue to
consume energy at the rate we do, surely due to entropy that energy will
end up heating the planet anyways.



Elana



Presumably without the CO2, we can radiate some of that into space,
but how much more energy could we consume if we had that technology?
Is there an inherent boundry to our energy consumption until we leave
the planet?

It will work out.  There are too many mechanisms at play, naturally, socially, politically, to completely fall apart.  There will undoubtedly be problems and disasters, but nothing so devastating to match your pessimism.  Lighten up.

Simple.  Keep eating, keep drinking, keep defecating, keep urinating, keep breathing and keep having sex.  I would say keep praying also, but I've seen our culture on an increasingly constricted diet of prayer to our God, or Lord Jesus our Christ, and somehow we keep on keepin' on.  Not very good, but then quality wasn't a part of your question.  God Bless you.

People will survive the next 100 years. The real question is, will our civilization stay intact for that long, given the problems you've mentioned?

I think the only way we can be certain that it will is by re-examining some of our most basic assumptions about politics, economics, religion, science, and each other. It's those assumptions that have lead us into this situation.

Those assumptions have created social institutions that are built around worst-case scenarios, and, not surprisingly, they often produce worse-case situations. We need systems that allow us to be our best, instead of systems that force us to do our worst.

We move to mars.  I don't think we'll last that long.  The polar ice caps are melting.  We are taking too long to find ways to prevent global warming.  We need to find cheap and enviromentally safe transportation.  WW3 is a good probably.  If not that, then the bird flu.  We just might all get sent to prison.  They seem to be building enough to contain us all.  It could be anything though.  Right now, we need to worry about then next two years until we get a new president.

Hello Dr Hawking,

The human race will continue on the path humans have always been on. The human race may or may not survive.



Over the next hundred years the goals of humans will be improve, destroy, status quo, outer space, underground, other planets, cloning, natural selection, death, life. The choices each of us make are based on our knowledge at that moment in time. The "good" decision of this moment often turns into the "worst" choice a moment or years later.

I believe in the chaos theory. The before-time-always-there, never-ending universe has a quirky way of letting us mere humans know we're just a cog in the big wheel.

If we are to accept the Malthusian principle as a fact, there are likely three options: (1) change the planetary ethos so that it becomes more like a global village, with the important outcome being a fairly even distribution of planetary resources (Hitler already attempted the other less moral solution; further, bombs tend not to be good for the earth's ecosystem); (2) focus attention on technologies that make it possible to increase vital resources without having a damaging affect on the ecosystem; (3) do away with wars and focus on our ultimate human potential (i.e., exploring other planets that could possibly be used to expand the human population throughout the galaxy).

Of course, I am biased in that my biggest dream would be to have the world look exactly the way it does on Star Trek.

Unity Through LOVE.
;-)

It's UNITY baby, we'll all FALL if we are not United, and to be united, truly united, means we will find love for one another. Thus provide mutual aid to one another, and be in solidarity with our environment creating BALANCE.

The Human spirit will overcome ;-) It's within us dude we're fighters and survivors. Yeah!



If Stephen Hawking is looking for an answer that justifies ideas such as this (seen on Answers):
“Do you think that the human race will have to expand into space to survive??
I just read an article where Stephen Hawking said "The survival of the human race depends on its ability to find new homes elsewhere in the universe because there's an increasing risk that a disaster will destroy the Earth." Do you think this is possible and if so, how long do you think it will be until we can have colonies set up on other planets that will be able to survive without the aid from Earth?”

Then here is my reply…

The answer to our survival does not lay within the ability of the human race to occupy a planet that was not meant as ours and rape it of its potential or future. Who are we to decide the fate of another celestial body and deface it by tara-forming it to our will, when we have not taken responsibility of our own original planet. I’d rather drift in space on a space station colony then participate in raping another planet of its soul.



By the way I like "Sandsquish" (read above) answer too, he/she sums up my feelings pritty much LOL. (& no, I do not know him/her)

Ok I thought about it, I’ll be on the real, who cares about stupid paranoia LOL ;-)
Anyways, so what people ALSO have to do is provide the basic human needs that everyone needs and provide it to everyone for free. That way instead of focusing on keeping a family (or themselves) alive everyday, people can focus on more important things in life (as in civic stuff, economy stuff, social stuff). If someone has to work 14 hours out of the day just to pay the basic bills and rent to survive, then of course they only LIVE day to day and OF course they have a reason to NOT CARE about certain important stuff to all humanity! I mean would you care if no one "seems" to care about you? Get real with it, and you will unite all peoples. And being united will help us tackle any obsticle including survival ;-)

I suspect the same way we've survived the last 100 years.  Wars will be fought.  After enough has died, some peace treaty would be signed.  Only to fight in other wars later on.  Different civilizations will rise and fall, replacing others and be replaced.  The old will die.  The young will grow.  There will be actions taken and consequences levied.  Still the species will go on.

They will discover future technology to enhance their lives and prevent aging. Also, we might also have to find a way to expand to another solar planet, which we will be able to expand and live in peace. If that is impossible, then we must make world peace, because if there is another war being fought, we would use nuclear weapons to defeat one another, then there would not be enough people to rebuild the planet, therefore putting the whole entire world into a prehistoric environment, in a newer stone age.

Yes the human race will be around for the next 100 years, 500 , and 5000 years
If you are not already familar with Arthur C Clarke's predictions, most have already came true, still waiting on mass depopulation though.
The haves will still have, the have-nots will still have-not
technology is the new wealth the have-nots will not get
When poverty is stopped being viewed as a virtue, then the human race will give more purpose to those who live here

Should Alcohol be illegal instead of Marijuana?



think about it. alcohol makes people drunk, then they go out and drive, kill themselves, or kill others. with weed, people just sit in their basements and chill.

so the question is, which one is more dangerous?

I don't advocate either, i'm in fact against it, but why is alcohol legal if it does so much more damage than weed?

well, first of all, remember that those IT people probably think you're weird.  Not a knock on you but you and they are probably motivated differently.

Many IT people are introverted and analytical.  They think in processes, much the same way scientists or doctors think.  Because of the introverted nature, they often are not fantastic communicators.  Sometimes their brains think faster than they can speak.  It's no big deal but learning how to communicate with an IT person can be a very valuable skills.

In terms of the "power" thing, there are two things to consider.  Similar to health care, IT people often have their own language.  Language is power and different industries use that power to create either distance or to ensure they get listened to.  Doctors are probably the best at this.  So are car mechanics.  I think women are even better than docs...So I guess a woman doctor working on her car would be the best of the best :)

In terms of the whole obsessions thing, well that could be a lot of things.  Today, depending on the size of the company, control of what is stored on a computer, what a computer accesses, and how it can be used can lead to potential liability for the company.  Some companies put IT in the position to be "bad guys" because they are afraid of issues with pornography and lawsuits.  Other times, management thinks everyone will be wasting time surfing the web or playing games.  Then there is the additional cost of managing and maintaining laptops and such when people load things that then screw up their machines.  Then there's the virus' and trojans that come from people opening up malware etc.  It can be a mess.

Most of the fear of missues is garbage but creating an environment where  it is controlled ensures its generally stopped.  Some companies go too far.

Most times, the IT people are put in a bad position...sometime they really want the power.  It will depend on the people.

So..... the weird part is most likely because some IT people will have very different thought processes than you.  Learn to accept it.

The other part could be some jerk who wants power but more often than not, it's about what the company is worried about and they put IT in the position to be a bad guy.

Hope that sheds some light.

Cheers -



One of the More Normal IT types :)

Hi MJ, I recently found out I have Asperger's Syndrome which is a high functioning form of autism. Naturally I've been doing a great deal of reading on this topic and apparently many people with Aspergers, who have poor interpersonal skills often excel with computers. One article writen by a psychologist stated that it's very likely Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and half the people who work for NASA have Asperger's Syndrome. They're more into "things" than people. If you do a bit of reading up on Asperger's you'll soon see what I'm talking about and have your question answered.

A man was sitting reading his papers when his wife hit him round the head with a frying pan.
'What was that for?' the man asked.

The wife replied 'That was for the piece of paper with the name "Jenny" on it that I found in your pants pocket'.

The man then said 'When I was at the races last week Jenny was the name of the horse I bet on'

The wife apologized and went on with the housework.

Three days later the man is watching TV when his wife bashes him on the head with an even bigger frying pan, knocking him unconscious.

Upon re-gaining consciousness the man asked why she had hit again.
Wife replied. 'Your horse phoned'

STOP  CHOKING - AUSSIE STYLE



A woman  sitting in an Adelaide Pub suddenly began to cough.



After a few seconds it became apparent that she  was in real distress, 
and two locals, Bluey and  Bazza sitting at the next table turned to look at  her.



Ken ya swalla? asked  Bluey



The woman signalled 'No!', desperately  shaking her head.



Kin ya breathe?" asked Bazza.  The woman shook her head No!!!



With that,  Bluey walked behind her, lifted up the back of her  dress, 
yanked down her knickers and ran his tongue  up and down the crack of 
her butt.



This  shocked the woman into such a violent spasm that the  obstruction flew out of her mouth and she began to  breathe again.



Bluey swaggered back to his  table and took a deep swig of his beer.



Bazza  said in admiration "Ya know Bluey, I'd heard of that  bloody 
Hind Lick Manoeuvre, but that's the first  time I ever seen 
somebody do  it."

Hello, I have looked at your website.

Ok, what do I think in my mere opinion. I think it is straightforward, to the point, you explain you motives in your opening paragraphs and it comes across to me as a journey into self discovery with the invite for others to participate.



I think it will do well to develop into something more interesting as time goes on, including comments from others and commenting on them which will just make it seem more interactive and more interesting, but for the beginnings it is looking good so far

Only one very minor criticism. Waste is not spelt as in waist( look in your opening paragraph, just a couple of minor spelling errors). Other than that you seem to have made a good start, and it reads well. Hope that helps and good luck on your project.

1. preamble
2. articles
3. amendments



3 branches of gov't in the constitution is in the ARTICLES section.

Article 1: Legislative
Article 2: Exec
Article 3: Judicial

One amends the const. when it is voted by congress, passes through the legislative branch, and gets more than half the votes in congress. then it is reviewed by the president, and finally reviewed by each branch.
it is extremely hard to do this, however, because 1. the reason has to be good enough, and 2. it has to be important enough to the people.

final authority is from the supreme court. you right girl.

just like any drug, marijuana has different effects on different people. for some, it can kick in before  the person is even done smoking and for others it has little to no effect at all. most people that i know that smoke pot tell me that they never feel anything the first time. it also depends on how you smoke it. if you smoke from a bong it has a better chance of hitting you harder than smoking a joint. it all depends on how you smoke it, you own natural tolerance to it, and the quality of the marijuana.

Smoke a bowl in the bong.
Then youl be able to smoke joints and get stoned/
I know what you mean becuase i smoked maybe an ounce of soapbar before i started to feel it, not all at once tho!
It was almost like my brother gave ame a bowl and i knew what being stoned felt like.
So i felt it when I started smoking joints after.

People are not lazy per say,what the problem is, is that every thing is ready and is within easy reach.Unlike other countries, once you have a credit card you can always get what you want NOW- ,whether you can actually afford it in the long term or not.
PEOPLE get expensive cars, electronic gadgets,expensive vacations etc without sweating for it.
There is so much food that YES- you can even order food online, and it wld be delivered to your home.
what ,i will say is that it is the SYSTEM that is lazy, AND not the people.

Technology enables us.  We don't have to walk to the mailbox because we use e-mail, or go to the store because we shop online.  And we're mentally lazy because computers think for us.  With functions such as spell check and Excel's AutoSum feature.

These days science has provided all the comforts to human life. So, the people don't bother for doing any physical work which makes them lazy. The different exercises done by people do not make any difference as their ability to do physical work has greatly reduced.



This could be done over by adolescents by taking regular exercises and by different games such as jogging, swimmming and yoga. One sould must also be mentally fit to take healthy food which could increase consciousness. The aged should also go for morning walk and well you know household works. It has been observed during an experiment that people were active when they did household works. Best of luck.

Perspective.

Someone who moves between places is a migrant (i.e. they migrate).

Someone who comes into a specific place is regarded as an immigrant (i.e. they have migrated into a particular place).

Very good thought.



1. If you know an NGO / charity work around your home approach them



2. As your subject is Art english so may be there is some project you always wanted to do...some research..plan this out and do it.



3. If thre is something you wanted to learn...another language, skill...go ahead and do this.



4. Visit some places of interest and be a silent observer and note down your thoughts. In future they might be useful.



5. Ask your mom, dad, sibling if they want you to do something for for them..



Have a great time
