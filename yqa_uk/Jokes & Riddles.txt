No B in orange



No R in black



Orange is 6 letters vs. 5
Orange is the only one that ends and starts with a vowel



If you remove the first letter from each word the only one that is no longer a word is Brown - rown



I would say orange

<question>



Alot of labor pain and a lot of love?



The wife is in labor (this is before epidural), screaming in pain. The husband says, "wife, I love you so much, and you're bringing our joy into the world, you deserve an easy ride, if I could take away your pain in any way, I would etc etc".



The doctor overhears and says to the wife says "wow, lucky for you, I just finished inventing a Reproductive Pain Transferer which can transfer yours and your baby's pain to the father ".



The couple gets excited and agrees to test it out, and the wife is pleased to see that the husband loves her enough to agree.



The contractions get stronger, and the doctor hooks up the secret machine to the wife, and tells the husband to control their levels of pain with a dial on the machine. So they do, until the wife's pain slowly eases to a gentle tingling sensation.



The husband says "wow honey, I don't feel a thing yet ... let's transfer more pain to me". He continues until she feels no pain at all.



They get a healthy baby boy, and are the happiest couple in the world.



But the next day they go home and find the milkman dead at their front door.

Daddy calls home before leaving work......?



Dad suspects mom of cheating on him, but hasn't had evidence yet. He decides to call home 2 hrs before he leaves work, and his little daughter picks up.



Dad: Hi honey, it's dad. Is your mother around?
Kid: Hi daddy, mommy has been in the bedroom since Uncle Frank got here 4 hours ago. They gave me some candy and said I can watch cartoons till 5.30.
Dad: Oh. Listen honey, I want you to do me a favor. I'll bring you a toy when I get back if you do this for me.
Kid: Ok daddy.
Dad: Ok, I want you to go and quietly peep in through the key hole and tell me what you see.
Kid: Ok daddy. *silence for a while as kid does what she's told".
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kid: I looked, daddy. Mommy and Uncle Frank are in bed, under the covers and moving around a lot.
Dad: *Long pause*. Ok, this is what I want you to do. Go to the door again, and tell mommy that Dads car just pulled up in the driveway.
Kid: Ok daddy. *long pause*
~~~~~~~
Kid: I did what you told me, daddy.
Dad: Ok, so what happened?
Kid: Well, as soon as I said it, mommy jumped out of bed, naked, and started looking for her clothes, and uncle frank did too, and ran towards the door, but mommy took him to the window and uncle frank jumped out, but I guess mommy forgot that you drained the pool yesterday, but anyway mommy ran into the bathroom, but slipped on a puddle and crashed through the glass and into the shower. Now they're both all dead-like. Should I call 911, daddy?
Dad: *Really Long Pause*. What pool?!??

start toasting and cheering, "51 days! 51 Days!!" About five minutes later,



another blonde walks in,Orders a drink, and joins the other two in the cheering.



Finally, another blonde walks in with what looks like a
Cardboard picture. She puts the picture thing in the middle of the table, and



starts cheering with the others, "51 days!
51 days!! The Bar Tender starts too get really curious, so he walks over to



discover that the picture is a Cookie Monster Puzzle. He walks over to one of



the blondes and asks, "What on earth are you doing??" "Well," the blonde says,



"everyone thinks blondes are so stupid, so we proved them wrong. On the box of



this puzzle, it says 2-4 years, but we finished it in only 51 days!!!



When Nuns are admitted to Heaven they go through a special gate and are



expected to make one last confession before they become angels.



Several nuns are lined up at this gate waiting to be absolved of their last



sins before they are made holy.



"And so," says St. Peter, "have you ever had any contact with a penis?"



"Well," says the first Nun in line, "I did once just touch the tip of one with



the tip of my finger."



"OK" says St. Peter, "Dip your finger in the holy water and pass on into



heaven."



The next Nun admits that "Well, yes, I did once get carried away and I, you



know, sort of massaged one a bit."



"OK" says St. Peter, "Rinse your hand in the holy water and pass on into



heaven."



Suddenly there is some jostling in the line and one of the nuns is trying to



cut in front.



"Well now, what's going on here?" says St. Peter.



"Well, your Excellency," says the Nun who is trying to improve her position in



line, "If I'm going to have to gargle that stuff, I want to do it before Sister



Mary Thomas sticks her *** in it."



There were 2 brothers that shared a room. One was 18 and the other was 8. The



18 year old brought home his girlfriend at midnight. The little brother was



sleeping so they climbed quietly to the top bunk. Things started getting hot and



heavy so the guy told his girlfriend if she wants a new position to say



"lettuce" and if she wants him to stop say "tomatoes". So she started saying



"lettuce, tomatoes, lettuce, tomatoes.... take it out I don't want to get



pregnant." The little boy woke up and screamed, "Stop making sandwiches up



their, your getting mayonaise all over my face!"

This is a blonde hair joke.



3 woman, one black hair, one brunette hair and one blonde hair, all have a task to do. If they can climb up 100 stairs then they win a prize. But each step has a joke and if you laugh then you lose.
So the black hair woman went but laughed on the 1st joke. The brunette woman got on the 50th step and laughed. The blonde hair woman was on the 100th step and started to laugh.
"Why are you laughing? I haven't even told you the joke yet."
"I just got the first one!"



Got this one of my friend and we were laughing for about 5 minutes. Lol.

Riddle me this if you can?



I come in darkness, but fill the mind with light. I bring enlightenment to some, while gripping others in the hand of fear. With me it can be a journey of inexplicable joy and sorrow. What I will show you will often be unreachable. Journey with me and what you see may haunt you. Journey with me and you may never want to return home. Journey with me and you will never know when it will end. What am I?

How about a short one?



Little Timmy was out back digging a hole and crying when his neighbor noticed him one afternoon.  "Why are you crying?" he asked the boy.



"My goldfish died, so I'm burying him."  Timmy sniffled and filled more dirt in the hole.



"That's a mighty big hole for a little goldfish, isn't it?" asked the neighbor.



Little Timmy patted the dirt down good with his shovel, and looked up at the man. "That's because it's still in your cat!"

There are 3 sides of this question.



-The evolutionary side- When animals evolve, the first to be the new "evolved" creature is going to be the next offspring. From T-Rex to Chicken.



-The Christian side- On the 5th day, God made animals right? So the chicken came first.



The third side is when aliens put the chicken and the egg on Earth at the same time to confuse us for all eternity.

One day, farmer Jones was in town picking up supplies for his farm. He stopped by the hardware store and picked up a bucket and an anvil, then stopped by the livestock dealer to buy a couple of chickens and a goose.



Now he had a problem: how to carry all of his purchases home.



The livestock dealer said,



"Why don't you put the anvil in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?"



"Hey, thanks!" the farmer said, and off he went.



While walking he met a fair young lady with rather large beautiful breasts. She told him she was lost, and asked,



"Can you tell me how to get to 1615 Mockingbird Lane?"



The farmer said,



"Well, as a matter of fact, I'm going to visit my brother at 1616 Mockingbird Lane. Let's take a short cut and go down this alley. We'll save half the time to get there".



The fair young lady said,



"How do I know that when we get in to the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull down my skirt and ravish me?"



The farmer said,



"I am carrying a bucket, an anvil, 2 chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?"



The young lady said,



"Set the goose down, put the bucket over the goose, put the anvil on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens."

A chicken and an egg are lying in bed. The chicken is smoking a cigarette with a satisfied smile on its face and the egg is frowning and looking a bit pissed off. The egg mutters, to no-one in particular, "Well, I guess we answered THAT question!"

From an evolutionary standpoint, the egg did.



You have a bird-like creature in the past that was not considered a "chicken".  Over long periods of time, small changes and adaptations (and mutations) were made until what we know as a "chicken" is evolved.



So in short, what laid the chicken egg, was not considered a chicken by our current definition, though it probably looked very chicken-ish.

i heard that the chicken evolved from a dinasour due to some sort of mutation, so the first actual chicken would have been the baby of the species before it. so i guess the first 'chicken egg' would be the egg of the first chicken. right?

This all depends entirely on your perspective of life.  Those who believe in Adam and Eve, would prolly tell you that the chicken came first as a creation of God.  Those who believe in the theory of evolution. The idea that it all started with an amoeba.  Those people i would guess would go with the egg as their answer.  My choice is the Rooster then from the Roosters Rib was created the chicken.

The only logical answer would be a spontaneous emotional reaction.  She caught her sister in bed with the man.  If she killed her sister just to meet the man again she's stupid, but it would show she thinks like a serial killer.

Very lucky!!!  I believe it is from the eastern part of the world with certain Asian cultures that the Praying Mantis was first noted as a sign of good luck. At least I have heard this ever since I was a kid (and that's been for a fairly long time now:) ).  I think it is really neat that he has decided to hang out with you for a while.  But do be careful the bug police don't catch your hitch hiker with you because I know, at least in my area, it is considered illegal to capture these charming little creatures.

Her operation.....................…



A woman goes to her doctor and says she wants an operation because her vagina lips are much too large. She asks the doctor to keep the operation a secret as she's embarrassed and doesn't want anyone to find out. The doctor agrees.



She wakes up from her operation and finds three roses carefully placed beside her bed. Outraged she immediately calls in the doctor and says, "I thought I asked you not to tell anyone about my operation!"



"Don't worry," he says, "I didn't tell anybody. The first rose is from me. I felt bad because you went through this all by yourself.



The second one is from my nurse. She assisted me with the operation, and she had the operation done herself."



"Who is the third rose from?" she asked



"Oh," says the doctor, "that rose is from a guy upstairs in the burn unit...
He wanted to thank you for his new ears!"

Are YOU Normal (joke)?



If you or anyone you know well has been in the hospital recently,



you can relate!



A sweet grandmother telephoned St. Joseph 's Hospital. She timidly



asked, 'Is it possible to speak to someone who can tell me how a



patient is doing?'



The operator said, 'I'll be glad to help, dear. What's the name and



room number?'



\The grandmother in her weak, tremulous voice said, 'Norma Findlay,



Room 302.'



The operator replied, 'Let me place you on hold while I check with



her nurse.'



After a few minutes, the operator returned to the phone and said,



'Oh, I have good news. Her nurse just told me that Norma is doing



very well. Her blood pressure is fine; her blood work just came back



as normal, and her physician, Dr. Cohen, has scheduled her to be



discharged on Tuesday.'



The grandmother said, 'Thank you. That's wonderful! I was so worried!



God bless you for the good news.'



The operator replied, 'You're more than welcome. Is Norma your daughter?'



The grandmother said, 'No, I'm Norma Findlay in 302. No one tells me sh*t

dollars from.
The little girl replied: ''Tommy down the street gave me five dollars for



doing cartwheel while he sat in the tree.
The mother told her daughter: "Don't you know that Tommy is just trying to see



your panties."
''OOOOhhhh'' said the little girl.
The next day the little girl came running into the house yelling, "Mommy, I



got ten dollars. The mother asked, "Where did you get the ten dollars from?"
The little girl replied, "Tommy down the street gave me ten dollars for doing



a cartwheel while he sat up in the tree and laughed."
The mother replied: "Didn't I tell you that he is...''
Before the mother could finish, the little girl said, ''Wait Mommy! I tricked



him, I didn't wear any panties today.''

This is a dumb blonde joke lol.



To get into heaven, you have to walk up 100 steps on the Staircase into Heaven. On each step, God tells a joke and you go to Hell if you laugh.



The brunette gets to the 50th step and bursts out laughing and goes to Hell.



The redhead gets to the 99th step, goes hysterical, and gets sent to Hell.



The blonde gets all the way past the 100th step, and at the Gateway of Heaven, she bursts out laughing. God asks "Why are you laughing?" She responds, "I just got the first one!"

True Story from Houston Medical Center



A man went to the hospital to have his wedding ring cut off from his Hoohoo.



According to the Nurse attending, the patient's girl friend found the
Ring in his pants pocket and she got so mad at him, she used petroleum jelly to slip the ring on his hoohoo while he was asleep.



I don't know what's worse:



1) Having your girl friend find out you're married.
2) Explaining to your wife how your wedding ring got on your hoohoo.
3) Or finding out your hoohoo fits through your wedding ring.

A tall woman met a midget at a party. The midget was barely



three feet tall but they were attracted to each other.
After a few drinks they went back to the tall woman's



apartment.
"I can't imagine what it will be like making love to a midget,"



said the woman, "especially with the size difference and all."
"Just take off your clothes, lie back on the bed, spread your legs apart and close your eyes," said the midget.
The woman did as she was told and soon she felt the biggest



thing she'd ever experienced inside her.
Within a few minutes the woman had climaxed eight times.
"If you think that was good," said the midget with a smirk, "Just wait till I get BOTH legs in there!"

Say a Little Prayer
Squirrels had overrun three churches in town. After much prayer, the elders of the first church determined that the animals were predestined to be there. Who were they to interfere with God's will? they reasoned. Soon, the squirrels multiplied.
The elders of the second church, deciding that they could not harm any of God's creatures, humanely trapped the squirrels and set them free outside of town. Three days later, the squirrels were back.
It was only the third church that succeeded in keeping the pests away. The elders baptized the squirrels and registered them as members of the church. Now they only see them on Christmas and Easter.



Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?". The operator says "Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"

And Holmes said: "Watson, you idiot, it means that somebody stole our tent."

Paying the ransom. Why put a band-aid on an open gash? Did You see Ron Paul this morning?



Ron Paul told us this was going to happen 5 years ago, he was right. Ron Paul said if they raise the FDIC to $250,000 it would help for a week or two but it isn't a good idea because it gives false hope. Well, they raised it. Ron Paul said if they pay the ransom (that's my word for it) it will create or keep the prices of houses up. Why keep the prices up? They don't belong up. Ron Paul it seems is the only person in the USA that knows how this stuff works. Or at least he is the only HONEST one that knows.

<question>



Beans.  This is hilarious! ?



I sure hope this does not offend anyone! But...This is hilarious! Love to all! Deb=-)



One day I met a sweet
gentleman and fell in love. When it
became apparent that we would marry, I
made the supreme
sacrifice and gave up beans.



Some months later, on my
birthday, my car broke down on the
way home from work. Since I lived in the
countryside I called
my husband and told him that I would be late because I
had to
walk home. On my way, I passed by a small diner and the odor
of
baked beans was more than I could stand. With miles to
walk, I figured that I
would walk off any ill effects by the
time I reached home, so I stopped at
the diner and before I
knew it, I had consumed three large orders of baked
beans. All
the way home, I made sure that I released ALL the gas.



Upon
my arrival, my husband seemed excited to see me and
exclaimed delightedly:
'Darling I have a surprise for dinner
tonight!'



He then blindfolded me
and led me to my chair at the dinner
table. I took a seat and just as he was
about to remove my
blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not
to
touch the blindfold until he returned and went
to answer the
call.



The baked beans I had consumed were still affecting me and
the
pressure was becoming most unbearable, so while my husband
was out of the
room I seized the opportunity, shifted my
weight to one leg and let one go.
It was not only loud, but
it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a
skunk in
front of a pulpwood mill. I took my napkin from my lap and
fanned
the air around me vigorously.



Then, shifting to the other cheek, I ripped
off three more.
The stink was worse than cooked cabbage!!!



Keeping my
ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the
other room, I went on like
this for another few minutes.
The pleasure was indescribable. When eventually
the telephone
farewells signaled the end of my freedom, I quickly
fanned
the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap
and
folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and
pleased with
myself.



My face must have been the picture of innocence when
my
husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me
if I had
peeked through the blindfold, and I assured him I
had not.



At this
point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner
guests seated around the
table chorused: 'Happy Birthday!'



I fainted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Joke&gt; Don't you think old guys are underestimated?



The banker saw  his old friend Tom, an eighty-year old rancher, in  town.



Tom had lost his wife a year or  so before and rumor had it that he  was



marrying a "mail order"  bride.



Being a good friend, the banker asked Tom if the  rumor was true. Tom
assured him that it was. The  banker then asked Tom the age of his  new
bride to be. Tom proudly  said,



"She'll be twenty-one in  November."



Now the banker, being the wise  man that he was, could see that  the
sexual appetite of a young woman could not be  satisfied by an eighty-year-old  man.



Wanting his old friend's remaining years to be  happy the banker tactfully suggested that Tom should consider getting a  hired hand to help him out on the ranch, knowing nature would take i ts own  course.



Tom thought this was a good idea and said he  would look for one that  afternoon.



About four months later, the  banker ran into Tom in town  again.



"How's the new wife?", asked the  banker.



Tom proudly said, "Good - she's  pregnant."



The banker, happy that his sage  advice had worked out, continued, "And how's the hired  hand?"



Without hesitating, Tom said, "She's pregnant  too.."



Don't ever  underestimate old  Guys.

There's a mistake.  It says in the 2nd line Julie is taller than Steve but then in the 5th & 6th lines it say Luke is taller than Julie..as is Steve...



So that's saying in one sentence Julie's taller than Steve & then later on suggesting Steve's taller.



Well that's how I read it - hence haven't thought further about the end result.

The Fairy Story.........................…



A married couple in their early 60s was celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary in a quiet, romantic little restaurant.



Suddenly, a tiny yet beautiful fairy appeared on their table.  She said, 'For being such an exemplary married couple and for being loving to each other for all this time, I will grant you each a wish.'



The wife answered, 'Oh, I want to travel around the world with my darling husband.'



The fairy waved her magic wand and ¡V poof!  ¡V two tickets for the Queen Mary II appeared in her hands.



The husband thought for a moment: 'Well, this is all very romantic, but an opportunity like this will never come again.  I'm sorry my love, but my wish is to have a wife 30 years younger than me.'



The wife, and the fairy, were deeply disappointed, but a wish is a wish.  So the fairy waved her magic wand and poof! ...the husband became 92 years old.



The moral of this story: Men who are ungrateful bastards should remember fairies are female.....

A little old lady was in the kitchen one day, washing the dishes when suddenly a little genie appeared beside her.



"You've led a long and good life" the genie said, "I have come to reward you by granting you three wishes. Ask for anything you want and I will make it happen."



The old lady was surprised but cynical. Not really believing that anything would happen she decided to play along for a minute. "Ok" she said, "turn all those dirty dishes into money." With that there was a big Poof! and the dishes had turned into a big pile of cash.



"My" said the old lady, staggered that it had actually worked, "Perhaps you could make me look young and beautiful again?" There was another big poof and the woman now looked lots younger and was very good looking. Excitedly she carried on, "Can you turn my dear old cat into a handsome young man?"



Once more there was a big Poof, and the cat was replaced by a handsome young man. Smiling devilishly she turned to the young man and said "At last! Now I want to make love with you for the rest of the day and all night too!"



The young man just looked at her for moment then replied in a high pitched voice, "Well you should have thought about that before you took me to the vet's shouldn't you!"

A man asked me into his hotel room..................?



Haha, okay long story!
But plz take the time to read and answer!



I was on a exchange in China, We were staying in a flash hotel in Beijing. Me and my friend were waiting by the elevators at maybe 11 at night (we were waiting there because we were gona play a prank on our friends, Matt and Sam in a different room). Then this man from saudi Arabia came up to us and started talking, he was really friendly and told us his life story (ex army guy, 40 yrs old, went to collage in England rah rah rah....) He even got his camera out and showed us pics of his house and cars in saudi arabia (They looked really flash!!). He then took a photo of us and said he wanted to remember the two 'beautiful girls from New Zealand' that he meet in china.



He found out we were 16 and started talking about how at 16, there are guys out there who just want to take advantage of us??? and that they will 'talk nice to us, but think dirty things in their mind' but he told us that he 'speaks from the heart and doesn't think dirty'. He then started ranting on about god and how he was a Christian arab and would never hurt us.



He then wanted to give us his email address and phone number so we could keep in touch with us and if we ever went to saudi arabia we could stay with him as long as we want, we could even bring our friends! He then said he had pen and paper in his room and told us to come to his room with him so he could give it to us, I didn't really know what to say so we went in. He shut the door and told us to sit down (pointing at the bed) he then gave us his email and phone number. He showed us his passport to 'prove he was real' (Although he told us he was 40 his passport said he was 52). He kept saying 'don't be afraid, i will not hurt you'. He then tried to talk to us again but we said we needed to go to bed now and BOLTED!



He seemed really nice to us! And did all he could to reassure us that he wouldn't 'hurt' us, but i just sorta got creep vibes coming from him! Haha, what do you think?? Am i being paranoid??



Is he a nice guy just trying to make us feel comfortable and safe
or
creepy guy who 'talked nice to us but thought dirty'



??

What was the name of a man travels back in time to King Arther's court? ?



This was a black and white movie. I think it might have stared Bing Crosby, but may not have. The man travels back in time to Arther's court where he invents many things for the Knight's of the round table, one such item is a revolver. This movie spun other movies, one was a cartoon movie where the time traveler creates the motorcycle. Another movie was "A Kid In King Arther's Court".

Easy 10 points! Solve this riddle.?



Not sure how this one goes but:
What can be build and torn down in one day... make men blind and make blind men see?



</question>



<additional details>



here's a clue:
I think the Riddler said this riddle once.



It's not Jesus.



????? had it right. It's sand.



You can build a sand castle and knock it down all in one day. If you get sand in your eye you'll go blind, temporarily.



The Last one is kind of confusing. I guess you can make glass out of sand. So you can make glasses lens out of sand???
You can make glass out of sand. So I guess that means you can make glasses.



This is an old riddle but I still like it.

Tech Support Jokes!!!?



Once upon a time, a guy called up a 24X7 support call center.



Guy : Hi! What times is this number open?
--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Customer Support, this is Nick, how can I help you?"



Customer: "Hello, yes, it's me."



Tech Support: "Oh, it's me too." [chuckle]



Customer: "No, Esmie. E, s, m, i, e."



Tech Support: "Oh, sorry..."



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Type 'fix' with an 'f'."



Customer: "Is that 'f' as in 'fix'?"



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Tell me, is the cursor still there?"



Customer: "No, I'm alone right now."



--------------------------------------...



Customer: "Right, this computer's gone all crazy. It's blinking, beeping, and doing all sorts of stuff!"



Tech Support: "What were you doing with the computer at the time?"



Customer: "I was dusting it."



--------------------------------------...



A lady was using a power strip to plug her computer and other devices into. Windows was completely frozen, and she was unable to shut down the machine by using the power button. She mentioned the power strip, so I told her to flip it off. She said, "Ok, I gave it the finger. I feel better."



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Ok, ma'am, do you see the button on the right hand side of your mouse?"



Customer: "No, there's a printer and a phone on the right hand side of my mouse."



Tech Support: Hmmmm.... Let's try a different approach.



--------------------------------------...



A lady struck up a conversation with me on an aeroplane.



Her: "And where are you going?"



Me: "I'm going to San Francisco to a UNIX convention."



Her: "Eunuchs convention? I didn't know there were that many of you!"



--------------------------------------...



Working as an ISP phone tech, I get calls from a good deal of customers who think we have ESP:



Customer: "I have a problem. OR, I have a question."



[Long pause] Me: "Yes?"



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Now click on 'OK'."



[sounds of furious clicking and typing]



Tech Support: "Hello?"



Customer: "Hold on a second."



--------------------------------------...



One time I was trying to set up a customer's e-mail program. I walked him through setting up an account with the incoming and outgoing server names set to "mail," but it didn't work. I tried again, and it still didn't work. I was starting to right out of ideas, and then the customer said, "If my mail server name is 'male,' does that mean my girlfriend's server is 'female'?"



--------------------------------------...



Customer: "Now what do I do?"



Tech Support: "What is the prompt on the screen?"



Customer: "It's asking for 'Enter Your Last Name.'"



Tech Support: "Ok, so type in your last name."



Customer: "How do you spell that?"



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Sir, I need you to click just once on your dialup networking icon."



Customer: "Ok..."



clicka...clicka...clicka...clicka...cl... a...clicka...clicka...



--------------------------------------...



My mother called one night because her ISP had a new phone number, and she wanted to know how to update her connection information. I led her step by step through the procedure, finishing with, "So next time you run the e-mail client, it'll just dial the new number. But don't do that now because we'll get disconn--"



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "Ok, ma'am, I need you to do a ctrl-alt-del."



Customer: "How do I do that?"



Tech Support: "Push and hold 'ctrl' and 'alt' at the same time, and then hit 'delete'."



Customer: "Where are those?"



Tech Support: (explains the location of the keys)



Customer: "Nothing happened."



Tech Support: "Try again."



Customer: "Still nothing."



A minute or two later....



Customer: "Should I turn my computer on? Would that help?"



Tech Support: "Yeah, it might."



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "What seems to be the problem?"



Customer: "When I change my font sizes, the letters change size."



--------------------------------------...



Tech Support: "No, Sir...clicking on 'Remember Password' will NOT help you remember your password."

Here's another stranded in an island joke. Bit long, though.?



An accountant, a playboy and a redneck are stranded on a deserted tropical island, where everything is in plenty and there's no shortage of food or drink.



3 months later, during an evening stroll on the beach, they find a mysterious smoky glass bottle, that is tightly corked, washed ashore.



They uncork it, and out comes a squashed looking genie that grants them 3 wishes, which they have to split between themselves, so they each get a wish each.



The accountant says: I really miss my kids, my wife, my home and even my really boring job. So I wish I was at home right now, on the couch, watching ESPN.



*Poof he disappears*



The playboy says: I love living on this island, with no wife to nag me, no mortgage payments to worry about, but I really miss women ... and alcohol. So I wish I could go back to my ordinary life, with my wife as usual not knowing abt my mistresses.



*Poof he disappears*



Genies says to the 3rd guy - ok buddy, last wish is yours and then I'm going to the Sahara, to live a solitary life.



The redneck looks around, says: well, I feel kinda lonely here ... I kinda wish the other guys were back here with me.



*Poof the 2 other guys reappear on the island and the genie disappears*

The kind of **** that is so huge that you're afraid to flush the toilet without breaking it into a few pieces with your toilet brush



Drinkers **** 
That is the kind of **** that you have the morning after a long night of drinking - its most noticeable trait is the skid marks left on the bottom of the toilet .



"Gee I wish I could ****" ****
Its the kind of **** where you want to ****, but all you do is sit on the toilet with cramps and fart a few times.



Spinal Tap **** 
That's the one where it hurts so much coming out that you swear it was leaving you sideways.



Wet Cheeks **** Also known as "The Power dump" 
That's the kind that comes out of your *** so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water.

The Wife's Confession (funny joke)?



An eldery man turns to his wife and asks if she has ever cheated on him.



“I love you,” she says, “but I must confess. I’ve been unfaithful to you three times.”



“What?” yells the man. “When?”



“The first time was when we were denied a mortgage,” she explains. “I went to see the banker, and I persuaded him to give us the loan.”



“The second time you were ill and we had no insurance to cover the medical bills,” she says. “I went to the doctor and convinced him to treat you for free.”



“And what about the third time?” the husband demands.



“Remember when you ran for mayor,” the wife begins, “and you were behind by 300 votes...?”

There was a princess, and she loved to eat cupcakes.  She loved cupcakes so much in fact, that she ordered everyone in the kingdom bake her a batch of cupcakes for her birthday.  All the peasants worked day and night to make the princess her cupcakes, all that is except for a young pig farmer.  He had no sugar, or chocolate, or eggs.  All he had was his family of pigs.  But, he was determined to still give a gift to the princess for her birthday.  So, he slaughtered the best of his pigs and fried it in his family's best skillet.  On the birthday of the princess, everyone in the kingdom presented her with cupcakes.  When the pig farmer got to the princess, he bowed and presented her with his dish of food.  The princess was shocked, how could he not have made her cupcakes?  But her temper soon faded as she tried the dish.  It was amazing.  She had never tasted anything this wonderful.  She declared that the dish he had prepared be put on every breakfast menu in the kingdom.  She even named the dish after the pig farmer.  To this day it is still enjoyed at the breakfast table.  As for the pig farmer?  Her became extremely popular, and his bloodline still live on today.  I believe his heir is a famous actor.  It's Kevin, or something.

<question>



What are the advantages?



Students in an advanced biology class were taking a mid term. The last question was: "Name seven advantages of mothers milk. The correct answer will be worth 70 points or none at all."



One student who had also partied a little too hard the night before, was hard put to think of seven advantages. He finally wrote:



1. It is a perfect formula for the child. 
2. It provides immunity against several diseases. 
3. It is always available as needed. 
4. It is always at the right temperature. 
5. It is inexpensive. 
6. It bonds the child to the mother, and vice versa.



And then, the student was stuck. Finally, just before the bell indicating the end of the test rang, he wrote... 
7. It comes in such cute containers.



He got an "A."

How did i get an asbo?



every time i sat down to eat my sardines the door bell sounded. everytime i answered the door there was no-one there except some children on the otherside of the road wearing hoods and harmlessly polishing their penknives. one day i asked them if they had seen anyone at my door. they said they had seen my neibour ralf running away. i went and spoke to ralf who looked a bit flushed and was shaking. he said to me that he had been reliably informed that i had been urinating on his roses. i informed him that i thought he might be unwell. at this point he hit in the face and we both fell to the floor fighting which wasnt good for my angina. anyrode up 3 weeks later weve got an asbo! we cant leave our houses between the times of 8.30 am and and 8am however the young children still wave at us .whch is nice.

It wouldn't surprise me.  Police in England are absolute f*cking t*ssers.  They prey on the innocent because it's easier than actually getting these scummy kids off the street.

Had many dealings being on the wrong end of the law.  For example, walking home with my shopping and being stopped and searched.  Yet kids at the town smashing bottles and terrorising people is fine.  They also got the d*cks out at my mates lounge window as he played with his kids.  The police never turned up even after several phone calls stating the kids were still outside up to no good hanging around outside the shop.  Then they wonder why people take the law in to their own hands.

Once I was dog sitting and I let the dogs out in to the garden and was having a cigarette.  When all of a sudden this guy comes up to the gate and says hello.  I thought it must have been a friend of the people whos dogs I was looking after.  It wasn't.  It was a two bob policeman in plain clothing.  He then proceeded to ask if it was my house - I have no idea why, I'm minding my own business as usual.  I obviously answer no so then he asks what I am doing at the house.  I tell him and he has the cheak to not believe me.  Fair enough, I could have been a burglar, but what made him come and be nosey anyway to someone in the back garden.  He then made me ring up the people whos house it was to confirm my story was true.  They were at a funeral but he didn't care about that.  All the time I'm trying to get through to these people, he's on his radio saying, "I see one male, climbing over fences.  I'm with the suspect now"  What fence am I meant to have climbed over??  I barely just walked out the back door before he comes over.  Do not have any BBQs this summer, you will be asked why you are in the garden and if it is your house.

Apparently crime rate is down though......  so that's good

1. Little Johnny greeted his mother at the door after she had been out of town all week and said, 'Mommy, guess what? Yesterday, I was playing in the closet in your bedroom and Daddy came into the room with the lady from next door. They undressed and got into bed and then Daddy got on top of her and ....'



The mother held up her hand and said, 'Not another word! Wait until your father gets home and then I want you to tell him exactly what you've just told me.'



The father came home and the wife tells him that she's leaving him. 'But why?' croaked the husband.



'Go ahead, Johnny. Tell Daddy what you've just told me.'



'Well,' said little Johnny, 'I was playing in your closet and Daddy came upstairs with the lady next door and they got undressed and they got into bed and Daddy got on top of her and they did just what you did, Mommy, with Uncle Bob.'



2. Little Johnny walked into the kitchen, saw his mother making a cake and announced, "I'll be playing in my room for the next two hours. I sure would like a piece of cake when you're finished."



Later, when his mother brought him a piece of cooled cake, Little Johnny exclaimed, "Gee, it worked!"



Puzzled, his mother asked, "What do you mean?"



Little Johnny replied, "Daddy said that in order to get a piece around here, you have to spend a couple of hours playing first!"

3. Grandpa and Little Johnny are sitting on a bench in the park. Johnny asked, "Grandpa are you going to take that new Viagra?"



Grandpa looks at him and says "No Johnny, I will not."



"But Grandpa, why?" asks little Johnny.



Grandpa replies. "Because there is no sense in putting lead in your pencil if you have no one worth writing to."

The next question will give you the top prize of One Million dollars if you get it right ... but if you get it wrong you will drop back to $32,000 -- are you ready?"

"I think I know who it..but I'm not 100%...

No, I haven't got a clue. I'd like to phone a friend Regis, just to be sure.

Regis: "Yes, who, Barbara, do you want to phone?

Barbara: "I'll phone my friend Maggie back home in Birmingham."

(ringing)

Maggie (also a blonde): "Hello..."

Regis: "Hello Maggie, its Regis here from Who Wants to be a Millionaire-I have Barbara here and she is doing really well on $500,000, but needs your help to be a Million.

The next voice you hear will be Barbara's and she'll read you the question.

There are 4 possible answers and 1 correct answer and you have 30 seconds to answer -- fire away Barbara."

Barbara: "Maggie, which of the following birds does not build it's own nest? Is it:

A-Robin

B-Sparrow

C-Cuckoo

D-Thrush"

Maggie: "Oh Gees, Barbara that's simple.....It's a Cuckoo."

Barbara: "You think?"

Maggie: "I'm sure."

Barbara: " Thanks Maggie." (hangs up)

Regis: "Well, do you want to stick on $500,000 or play on for the Million, Barbara?"

Barbara: "I want to play, I'll go with C-Cuckoo"

Regis: "Is that your final answer?"

Barbara: "It is."

Regis: "Are you confident?"

Barbara: "Yes fairly, Maggie's a sound bet."

Regis: "Barbara.....you had $500,000 and you said C-Cuckoo ...you're right! - You have just won ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

Here is your check. You have been a great contestant and a real gambler. Audience please put your hands together for Barbara."

(clapping)

That night Barbara calls round to Maggie and brings her down to a local bar for a celebration drink and, as they are sipping their Champagne, Barbara turns to Maggie and asks "Tell me Maggie, How in God's name did you know that it was the Cuckoo that does not build its own nest?

Maggie: "Listen Barbara, everybody knows that a Cuckoo lives in a clock."

A man was invited to a friend’s home for dinner, where he noticed that his buddy preceded every request to his wife with endearing terms, calling her Honey, Darling, Sweetheart, Pumpkin, etc. He was impressed at this, since the couple had been married over 50 years. 
While the wife was in the kitchen, he said, “I think it’s wonderful that after all the years, you still call your wife those pet names.” His buddy hung his head. “To tell you the truth, I forgot her name about 10 years ago.”

The LAPD, The FBI, and the CIA are all trying to prove that they are the best at apprehending criminals. The President gets tired of the bickering and decides to give them a test. He releases a rabbit into a forest and each of them has to catch it.

The CIA goes in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. They question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of extensive investigations they conclude that rabbits do not exist.

The FBI goes in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, killing everything in it, including the rabbit, and they make no apologies. The rabbit had it coming.

The LAPD goes in. They come out two hours later with a badly beaten bear, who is yelling: "Okay! Okay! I'm a rabbit! I'm a rabbit!

Memory's Going
An eighty year old couple were having problems remembering things, so they decided to go to their doctor to make sure nothing was wrong with them. When they arrived at the doctor's office, they explained to the doctor about the problems they were having with their memory. 
After checking the couple out, the doctor told them that they were physically okay but might want to start writing things down, making notes to help them remember things. The couple thanked the doctor and left. 
Later that night while watching TV, the old man got up from his chair and his wife asked, "Where are you going?" 
He replied, "To the kitchen." 
She asked, "Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?" 
"Sure." 
Then his wife asked him, "Don't you think you should write it down so you can remember it?" 
"No, I can remember that." 
"Well, I also would like some strawberries on top. You had better write that down cause I know you'll forget that," his wife said. 
"I can remember that, you want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries." 
She replied, "Well, I also would like whipped cream on top. I know you will forget that. You had better write it down." 
With irritation in his voice, he said, "I don't need to write that down, I can remember that." He went into the kitchen. 
After about 20 minutes, he returned from the kitchen and handed her a plate of bacon and eggs. 
She stared at the plate for a moment and said, "You forgot my toast."

An Hour of Pleasure



The Dean of Women at an exclusive girls' school was lecturing her students on sexual morality. 
"We live today in very difficult times for young people. In moments of temptation," she said, "ask yourself just one question: Is an hour of pleasure worth a lifetime of shame?" 
A young woman rose in the back of the room and said, "Excuse me, but how do you make it last an hour?"

<question>



Can anyone think of the answer to this one?



3 men walk into a TV shop, and see a Flat Screen TV for £30. They each pay £10, to make the total of £30. After they left with the TV, the boss came back. He noticed the Flat screen had gone, and asked the worker how much he got for it. He told him £30. The boss, being a kind man, said that the TV was only £25, and told the worker to run after them and give them £5 back. But the worker slipped £2 into his pocket for himself, and gave them £3 back. So, say the men split the £3, each man only paid £9 for the TV.



9



9
+9
=27
+2 (that the worker pocketed)
= £29
Where is the missing pound? - They paid £30 all together

A solution will be posted in 30 minutes



</question>



<additional details>



I'm not sure how, but you are supposed to do th 9 x 3 = 27 - 2 = 25
they paid 25 for the TV
Its kinda confusing, my grandad showed me yesterday

It's still there. You said 'the men split the $3' and also 'the worker gave them $3 back'. So how could it be missing if it never was lost?

SOLUTION

The facts in this riddle are clear:  There is an initial £30 charge.  It should have been £25, so £5 must be returned and accounted for.  £3 is given to the 3 friends, £2 is kept by the worker - there you have the £5.  The trick to this riddle is that the addition and subtraction are done at the wrong times to misdirect your thinking - and quite successfully for most.  Each of the 3 friends did indeed pay £9, not £10, and as far as the friends are concerned, they paid £27 for the tv.  But we know that the clerk will tell us that they were charged only £25 and when you add the £3 returned with the £2 kept by the worker, you come up with £30.

the math at the bottom is incorrect  they were charged 25 not 27 the 2 pocketed plus the 3 given back = 30. they only paid nine each because the teller pocketed the 2.

They were paying only £9 each so that's £27

£30 then they got their change back (£1 each x 3 = £3)
So £30 - £3 = £27

TV Cost only £25 as the boss said.
Worker slip £2

So,
£25 + £2 = £27 the total that were paid by the guys.

Is little johnny up to his old tricks ?



During one of her daily classes, a teacher trying to teach good 
manners, asked her students the following question:



'Michael, if you were on a date having dinner with a nice young lady, 
how would you tell her that you have to go to the bathroom?'



Michael said: 'Just a minute I have to go pee.'



The teacher responded by saying: 'That would be rude and impolite. 
What about you Sherman, how would you say it?'



Sherman said: 'I am sorry, but I really need to go to the bathroom. 
I'll be right back.'



'That's better, but it's still not very nice to say the word bathroom 
at the dinner table.



And you, little Johnny, can you use your brain for once and show us 
your good manners?'



Johnny said 'I would say: Darling, may I please be excused for a 
moment? I have to shake hands with a very dear friend of mine, whom I 
hope to introduce you to after dinner.'



The teacher fainted...

A brainteaser for the smart people?



Here is a brain teaser i need the answer to. Three friends decided to order a pizza. The delivery person tells them the bill is $30. So, each person pays $10.

When the delivery person returns to the pizza shop, the cashier says that there was a mistake. The bill should have been $25 not $30.

The cashier gives the delivery person 5 $1 coins to take back to the friends. On the way back, the delivery person realized that the $5 could not be split three ways so he decides to keep $2 as a tip.

The friends paid a total of $30 ($10 each), They got $1 back each. This means that the three friends paid $9 each for the pizza which totals $9 each for the pizza. The delivery person has $2. This gives a total of $29.

Who has the other $1?

Its in the wording, which is wrong. We start with 25, which was the end price of the pizza. The friends all got back, in total 3 dollars. If we add their 3 dollars to the 25, we have 28. If you then add in the 2 dollars in tips the greedy, stealing delivery person awarded himself you get 30. So, in conclusion, no money is missing. We can all go home folks.

No money is missing. The pizza cost $25 . The friends got back $1 each, so its $3.The delivery person took $2. If you total all that up, its $30. Therefore , no one has the other $1.

This is a very tricky as well as complicated question. I don't know the answer, but I want to know it eagerly. I think its with one of the 3 friends as we are applying subtraction to this riddle and when subtraction is applied we have to add 1 or something like that. I am kinda sure the right answer is something related to this theory.

P.S.: I liked the question and so here is a star for you my friend.

Have a good day!

...when he noticed he had new mail: he checked the mail and the first was from a Nigerian fellow who claimed to be a prince who would give him nine billion dollars in return for sending him 500 dollars today. My god, thought Phil; 500 dollars today would be able to buy me an ample amount of time with the web camera of an attractive wench but nine billion would allow me to create a real doll army and be the commander of my own slutty brigade! It was the second e-mail in his in-box which finally convinced him, however, as it mentioned the possibility of upgrading one's penis via surgical means.

Unfortunately on the way to the bank Phil melted because he was a vampire the end.

the computer wouldn't work. He tried a couple times but his computer was fried. He flipped. He went outside and screamed. His neighbors came running over asking "What's wrong Phil?". Phil could only drop to his knees and thank God that he wasn't naked. "I just lost the mortgage on my house" he cried "I'm broke!" The neighbors helped him up and expressed  their sympathy for Phil. Then turned and walked away. Phil turned too, but he heard the wife tell the husband "thank God". Phil went back inside his house. The End.

Once upon a time ther was a guy called Phil. Phil was obsessed with porn. he knew all his fave porn stars names and had hours an hours of porn that he would watch day in and day out. 
One day phil was sitting infront of his pc and just as he went to put his porn on......................................... there was a knock at the door. Thinking it was his friend Tony, who usually popped round on Sunday's to watch it with him, he left his pc loading it up. But, when he got to the door it was his next door neighbour, who he'd had his eye on for some time, but had never actually spoke to her. He was reluctant to let her in, knowing there was an extremely good chance she would see the moniter, and the content on the screen. He didn't want to leave her on the doorstep, but couldn't let her into the house. At that moment, Tony walks up the drive and says 'Oh, if your with someone I'll come back later....if your not too busy'. He winks, smiles to himself, then goes to turn around to go back down the drive when suddenly, through the open door, Phil realises his video has fully loaded and is now playing. The thing everyone else realises is he's left the volume on full blast and they can now hear two lesbians enjoying each other's company amongst other things. Phil looked at Tony, Tony laughed and the woman looking shell-shocked stormed off in a huff. 'Ah well' said Phil. 'I'm glad that in a few years time and I'm married, when people ask me how I met my wife, I wont have to say 'well the first time we met, she was on my doorstep when my porn world videos started up''.

One day Phil was sitting in front of his PC and just as he went to put his porn on this big spark came out from behind the computer, and the computer blew up. Phil was so mad that he went into his brothers room and loaded up some porn on his brothers computer. Right when he got it all loaded and the video popped up and the moaning began, a big notice popped up and stopped the video and the sound, the notice read:
DEAR PHIL YOU ARE WATCHING TOO MUCH PORN AND YOUR COMPUTER JUST GOT 999,999,999.999 VIRUSES! CONGRATULATIONS. 
Phil was so pissed that he decided he was going to make his own porn. Phil went walking down the street and tried to approach all of his favorite porn stars. But when he would approach them they would all say "do you see this beautiful body, do you think i would work with someone as fat and ugly as you?" Phil got so tired of the put downs that he decided he would just capture young girls and make his own videos. Within 2 days Phil had 69 videos of young girl porn with him. Phil decided to go to his friends house down the street and upload all of his porn videos on you tube. After Phil got 999billion viewers all his videos were deleted. Phil was so confused and he uploaded all the videos again on you tube. but this time it took 2 hours to get up to 1million viewers, Phil jumped when all the power in his friends house was turned off, and then Phil heard sirens outside of the house. Phil went outside and he said "good day officer are you here to make a sexy time video with me?" the officer grabbed him and put the hand cuffs on him. Phil got excited "Officer if you want to play rough i have a few rules, i put the handcuffs on you." the officer for some reason said baby hold on and let me take them off." the officer took the hand cuffs off and gave him to Phil. The officer said "sweetie you are so lucky i think your sexy" then they got in the backseat and closed the door.

Phils computer then went dead, and he could not get it to even load up again. He knew that his hard drive had been fried and that all his stuff he had saved was now gone for good.  All his porn was.... gone. He about cried, not because his computer was toast, but because he lost all his hours and hours of porn.

What do you think of this one Irish priests ?



Twelve Irish priests were about to be ordained. The final test
was for them to line up in a straight row, totally nude, in a garden
while a sexy, beautiful, big breasted, nude model danced
before them.

Each priest had a small bell attached to his willy, and they
were told that anyone whose bell rang when she danced in front
of them would not be ordained because he had not reached a state of
spiritual purity.

The beautiful model danced before the first candidate, with no
reaction. She proceeded down the line with the same response from 
all the priests until she got to the final priest, Timmy. Poor Timmy.



As she danced, his bell began to ring so loudly that it flew
off, clattering across the ground and laid to rest in nearby 
foliage. Embarrassed, Timmy quickly scrambled to where the bell came to
rest. He bent over to pick it up....



......then all the other bells started to ring.

How good would it be to meet the Pope?



A shy gentleman was preparing to board a plane when he heard that the Pope was on the same flight. “This is exciting,” thought the gentleman. “I’ve always been a big fan of the Pope. Perhaps I’ll be able to see him in person.”

Imagine his surprise when the Pope sat down in the seat next to him for the flight. Still, the gentleman was too shy to speak to the Pontiff. Shortly after take-off, the Pope began a crossword puzzle. “This is fantastic,” thought the gentleman. “I’m really good at crosswords. Perhaps, if the Pope gets stuck, he’ll ask me for assistance.”

Almost immediately, the Pope turned to the gentleman and said, “Excuse me, but do you know a four letter word referring to a woman that ends with the letters ‘u-n-t?’”

Only one word leapt to mind…

“My goodness,” thought the gentleman, “I can’t tell the Pope that. There must be another word.”

The gentleman thought for quite a while, then it hit him. Turning to the pope, the gentleman said, “I think the word you’re looking for is ‘aunt’.”

“Of course,” said the Pope. “Do you have an eraser?”

Little johnny jokes?



Little Johnny watched, fascinated, as his mother smoothed cold cream on her face. "Why do you do that, mommy?" he asked. "To make myself beautiful," said his mother, who then began removing the cream with a tissue. "What's the matter?" asked Little Johnny. "Giving up?"



At Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny, a child in the kindergarten class, seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam's ribs. Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were ill, and said, "Johnny what is the matter?" Little Johnny responded, "I have a pain in my side. I think I'm going have a wife."



Little Johnny and Susie are only 10 years old, but they just know that they are in love. One day they decide that they want to get married, so Johnny goes to Susie's father to ask him for her hand.

Johnny bravely walks up to him and says "Mr. Smith, me and Susie are in love and I want to ask you for her hand in marriage."

Thinking that this was the cutest thing, Mr. Smith replies, "Well Johnny, you are only 10. Where will you two live?"

Without even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replies "In Susie's room. It's bigger than mine and we can both fit there nicely."

Still thinking this is just adorable, Mr. Smith says with a huge grin, "Okay then how will you live? You're not old enough to get a job. You'll need to support Susie."

Again, Johnny instantly replies, "Our allowance... Susie makes 5 bucks a week and I make 10 bucks a week. That's about 60 bucks a month, and that should do us just fine."

By this time Mr. Smith is a little shocked that Johnny has put so much thought into this. So, he thinks for a moment trying to come up with something that Johnny won't have an answer to.

After a second, Mr. Smith says, "Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything all figured out. I just have one more question for you. What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?"

Johnny just shrugs his shoulders and says "Well, we've been lucky so far..."



Little Johnny is approached by the lifeguard at the public swimming pool. "You're not allowed to pee in the pool," said the lifeguard. "I'm going to report you."

"But everyone pees in the pool," said Little Johnny.

"Maybe," said the lifeguard, "but not from the diving board!"

A young blonde was on vacation in the depths of Louisiana. She wanted a pair of genuine alligator shoes in the worst way, but was very reluctant to pay the high prices the local vendors were asking.

After becoming very frustrated with the "no haggle" attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, "Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!" The shopkeeper said, "By all means, be my guest. Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!" Determined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator.

Later in the day, the shopkeeper is driving home, when he spots the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he sees a huge 9 foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She takes aim, kills the creature and with a great deal of effort hauls it on to the swamp bank. Lying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watches in amazement. Just then the blonde flips the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouts out, "Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!"



A blonde stormed up to the front desk of the library and said, "I have a complaint!"

"Yes, Ma'am?" said the librarian looking up at her.

"I borrowed a book last week and it was horrible!"

Puzzled by her complain the librarian asked "What was wrong with it?"

"It had way too many characters and there was no plot whatsoever!" said the blonde.

The librarian nodded and said, "Ahhh. So you must be the person who took our phone book."

Star it if you like this joke!!!!



A woman got on a bus holding a baby. The bus driver said, "That's the ugliest baby I've ever seen."

In a huff, the woman slammed her fare into the fare box and took an aisle seat near the rear of the bus.

The man seated next to her sensed that she was agitated and asked her what was wrong.

"The bus driver insulted me," she fumed.

The man sympathized and said, "Why, he's a public servant and shouldn't say things to insult passengers."

You're right," She said. "I think I'll go back up there and give him a piece of my mind."

"That's a good idea," the man said. "Here, let me hold your dog for you."

I liked it.  Flip Wilson told a similar joke (only the woman was on a train).  I remember the person insulting her said, among other things, "That's a bad looking baby, Lady."

Good One......
Here's one for you...



Upon entering a little country store, the stranger noticed a sign warning, "Danger! Beware of dog!" posted on the glass door. Inside, he noticed a harmless old hound dog asleep on the floor beside the cash register.



"Is that the dog folks are supposed to beware of?" he asked the owner.



"Yep, that's him," came the reply.



The stranger couldn't help but be amused. "That certainly doesn't look like a dangerous dog to me. Why in the world would you post that sign?"



"Because," the owner explained, "Before I posted that sign, people kept tripping over him."

<question>



When will it start, anytime now?



A man comes home from an exhausting day at work, flops down on the couch in front of the television, and tells his wife, “Get me a beer before it starts.”



The wife sighs and gets him a beer.



Fifteen minutes later, the man says, “Get me another beer before it starts.”



She looks cross, but fetches another beer and slams it down next to him.



He finishes that beer and a few minutes later says, “Quick, get me another beer, it's going to start any minute.”



The wife is furious. She yells at him, “Is that all you're going to do tonight? Drink beer and sit in front of that TV? You’re nothing but a lazy, drunken, fat slob, and furthermore…”



The man sighs and says, “It’s started…”

One popular joke that simultaneously contains and defines a double entendre typically is told as: "A girl walked into a bar and asked the bartender for a double entendre. So he gave her one." A variation can be told as: "A man walks into a bar and asks the barmaid for an entendre. She says, 'Certainly sir, single or double?' He says double and she replies, 'OK then sir, yours is a large one.'"

Be honest, will this make you smile?



Joe rents an apartment in New York, and goes to the lobby to put his name on the group mailbox. While he was there, an attractive young lady comes out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing a robe.

Joe smiles at the young girl and she strikes up a conversation with him. As they talk, her robe slips open, and it's quite obvious that she has nothing under the robe.

Poor Joe breaks out into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact. After a few minutes, she places her hand on his arm and says, "Let's go in my apartment, I hear someone coming..."

He proceeds with her into the apartment, and after she closes the door, she leans against it allowing her robe to fall off completely.

Being completely nude, she purrs at him, "What would you say is my best feature?" The flustered, embarrassed Joe stammers, clears his throat several times, and finally squeaks out, "Oh, it's got to be your ears!"

She's astounded! "Why my ears? Look at these breasts! They're full, don't sag, and they're 100% natural! My buns - they're firm and don't sag, and have no cellulite! Look at this skin, no blemishes or scars! Why in heaven's name would you say my ears are the best part of my body?!"

Clearing his throat once again, Joe stammers - "Outside when you said you heard someone coming? That was me."

The circus advertised for a high diver. From a 50ft platform into a wet sponge. One guy did it brilliantly. The boss said "Great, you're hired. £1,000 a dive" THe guy said "No." The boss said "What am I thinking of? I mean "£2,000 a dive." The guy said "No." The boss said "Wait, your right. Diving fifty feet into a wet sponge-That's gotta be  £3,000 a dive. The guy said "No"  The boss said "Would you mind telling my why you can turn down 3 grand a dive?" The guy said "It was first time I've done it and I didn't like it."

never thought about it before to be honest!!
good thinking lol
now that I've thought about it, I'm guessing it's because when couples meet each others parents its usually the fathers who are a bit aprehensive and the mothers are usually first to come out of their shells and strike up a conversation?
but I'm not sure, I've seen the opposite happen!

Other than that: Hear! Hear! Hear! I'm absolutely sure there are just as many insufferable fathers-in-law out there as there are mothers-in-law. That said, I've only ever had two fathers-in-law (well, boyfriends' fathers), and I only met one of them - and he was actually 100% great. :0)

Hello, and thank you for calling the Mental Health Institute



If you are obsessive-compulsive, press 1 repeatedly



If you have multiple personalities, press 2, 3 and 4.



If you suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, press 5 but do it v-e-r-y- s-l-o-w-l-y and carefully.

If you are dyslexic, press 6. Now press 9. Now press 6. Now press 9. Now press 6.



If you are delusional, press 7 and your call will be transferred to the mothership.



If you have short term memory loss, press 8. If you have short term memory loss, press 8. If you have short term memory loss, press 8.



If you have schizophrenia, listen very carefully and a small voice will tell you the number to press.

If you have a nervous disorder, fidget with the hash key until a representative comes on the line.



If you are co-dependent, ask someone to press a number for you.



If you are depressed, don't bother to press any numbers. No one will be able to help you anyway.



If you are paranoid, you don't need to press anything. We know who you are, we know what you want, and we know how to reach you.



If you suffer from low self-esteem, please hang up because all our operators are too busy to talk to you.

Wowie! Coolio! Awesomeez! Ha ha! Weird language I know. Hee hee! Yes, you are absolutely right, I have read this joke before, but only till the 5th one. This is soooooooo funnnnyyyyyyyyyy. For instance you like the colour red, you will not only like it for once, but every time you lay your eyes on it. Take the same example for this joke. AI have read it before 9only till the 5th one) yet I laughed that too heartily, once again! I wonder from where you get a loadful of the funniest jokes on earth. Thanks a bunch once again! Oh my gosh! Such a funny joke! Oooh, wowie!



P.S.: I can't help but give a star to you.

I thank you once again, for reminding me of this 'ever-funny' joke. CYA!



Have a good day!

A riddle for you all?



A horse travels a certain distance each day. Strangely enough, two of its legs travel 30 kilometers each day and the other two legs travel nearly 31 kilometers. It would seem that two of the horse's legs must be a kilometer ahead of the other two legs, but of course this is not the case. Since the horse is quite normal, how is this situation possible?

A little riddle for you!?



Acting on a tip, the police raid a flat to arrest a suspected murderer. They  don't know what he looks like but they know his name and that he is inside the flat. The police burst in and they discover a bricklayer, a taxi driver, an electrician and a fireman playing cards. Without any hesitation or communication they immediately arrest the fireman.

How do they know they've got the suspected murderer?



</question>



<additional details>



Okay then .. The answer is: the Fireman is the only man, The rest of the card players are women.

Thanks everyone for playing ;-D

I have a guess but it could be wrong . . . would the glass fit INSIDE the jug? If that was the case then the water could be in the glass and yet remain in the jug . . .

Three blondes were witnesses to a crime, so they went to the police station to identify the suspect. The police chief said he would show them a mug shot of someone for thirty seconds, then ask each one for a description. After showing the photo to the first blonde, he covered it, then asked her how she would recognize the suspect.



"Easy, " she replied. "He only has one eye."



The chief was stunned. "He only has one eye because it is a profile shot! Think about it!" He repeated the procedure for the second blonde and again asked how she would recognize him.



"He only has one ear, " was her answer.



"What is the matter with you people?!? It is a profile shot! You are seeing him from the side!" He repeated the procedure for the third blonde, then said, "How would you recognize the suspect? Now think before you give me a stupid answer."



After viewing the photo, she thought for a minute, then said, "He's wearing contact lenses."



This took the chief by surprise. He looked real hard at the picture and couldn't tell if the suspect had contacts or not, so he went into the database and looked at the report. Sure enough, when the mug shot was taken, he was wearing contact lenses! He went back to her and asked, "How could you tell he was wearing contact lenses? Nobody else here in this precinct saw that!"



"Well, " she said, "he can't wear regular glasses with only one eye and one ear, now, can he?"

A man walked into a bar. Ouch! Then he walked into a pub and bought himself a pint. A little lady walked up to him and said "I'm a leprechaun and if you fulfil my one wish I will give you all of my leprechaun gold" and that was a lot of leprechaun gold. So the man said "very well what is your first wish?" he said. The little lady said "I would like a bit of 'Romance'" so they went back to his place and had a bit of 'romance'. When they were done and lying next to each other the lady asked the man how old he was. "38". The old lady replied "your a bit old to be believing in leprechauns now aren't you"

Two men at a bar had been enjoying a few drinks for the past



couple of hours and were pretty drunk when one of them notices



a beautiful woman sitting in the corner. One says to the other,



"Jeez, I'd really like to dance with that girl."



The other man replies, "Well go ahead and ask her, don't be a chicken."



So the man approaches the lovely woman and says, "Excuse me.



Would you be so kind as to dance with me?"



Seeing the man is totally drunk the woman says, "I'm sorry.



Right now I'm concentrating on matrimony and I'd rather sit than dance."



So the man humbly returns to his friend.



"So what did she say?" asks the friend.



The drunk responded, "She said she's constipated on macaroni and would rather $hit in her pants."

What is unusual about the paragraph?



This is an unusual paragraph. I'm curious how quickly you can find out what is so unusual about it? It looks so plain you would think nothing was wrong with it! In fact, nothing is wrong with it! It is unusual though. Study it, and think about it, but you still may not find anything odd. But if you work at it a bit, you might find out! Try to do so without any coaching!

Very funny joke, you will laugh!!!!!!!!!!!?



An older man had met a younger woman, but unfortunately he was unable to
last very long before he would orgasm during sex. A caring man, he was
concerned that he was disappointing his new lover,so he called his doctor
for advice.
The doc told him that masturbating before sex often helped men last
longer
during the act. The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it."
He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't
do
it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open.
He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.
Finally, he realized his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck
over on the side of the highway.
He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck.
Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate.
He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew
closer to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not
wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut
and replied, "What?"
He heard, "This is the police. What the hell are you doing?"
The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted."
The cop says, "Well, you better check your brakes too, because your truck
rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.

Funny.
Here is one for you.



Doctor Dave had slept with one of his patients and felt guilty all day long.



No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he couldn't.



The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. But every once in a while he'd hear an internal, reassuring voice that said:



"Dave, don't worry about it. You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of their patients and you won't be the last. And you're single. Just let it go.."



But invariably the other voice would bring him back to reality, whispering:



"Dave you're a vet."



How is it?

JOKE ABOUT A BARTENDER A MAN AND 1 WISH, VERY FUNNY!!!!!!?



A man walks into a bar with a paper bag. He sits down and�
places the bag on the counter. The bartender walks up�
and asks what's in the bag.�



The man reaches into the bag and pulls out a little man, about�
one foot high and sets him on the counter. He reaches back�
into the bag and pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as well.�
He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench, which he places in front of the piano.�



The little man sits down at the piano and starts playing a�
beautiful piece by Mozart!�
'Where on earth did you get that?' says the bartender.�



The man responds by reaching into the paper bag.�
This time he pulls out a magic lamp. He hands it to the bartender and says:�
'Here. Rub it.'�



So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there's a gust of smoke and a beautiful genie is standing before him.�
'I will grant you one wish. Just�one wish~~ each person is only allowed one!'�



The bartender gets real excited.�
Without hesitating he says, 'I want a million bucks!'�
A few moments later, a duck walks into the bar.�
It is soon followed by another duck, then another.�
Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks�
and they keep coming!�



The bartender turns to the man and says, 'Y'know, I think�
your genie's a little deaf. I asked for a million bucks,�
not a million ducks.'�



'Tell me about it!!' says the man,�
'do you really think I asked for a 12 inch pianist?

Yet another joke......?



a young boy went up to his father and asked, "what is the difference between Potentially and realistically?"



the father said well go ask your mother if she'd sleep with robert de niro for a million dollars, then ask your sister if shed sleep with brad pitt of a million dollars."
So  the boy asks his mother and she said, "yes of course, i'm not stupid."
Then the boy asks his sister and she said, "ya, id be stupid to pass that up."



so the boy goes back to his father and the father asked, did you find out the difference between Potentially and realistically?
the boy answered "yes. potentially we are 2 million dollars richer, but realistically, we are living with two sluts."

Can you guess this song riddle?



A man sang this song
It's sad and it's true
It's bigger than a hill
That's your first clue



Two men are the subject
Of this fine lyric
You will probably cry
Every time you hear it



My work here is done
I've given my test
Who will be the first one
To figure out the rest?
