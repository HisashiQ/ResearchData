Bring it to the boil and cover and stew for 20 minutes...... Yes adding C.S.L  can enhance it as a bait as can Scopex.

Since you use the term beach caster and want a rod of 12-14ft then I'm going to assume you're in the UK, one rod that will work very well and has a life time guarantee is the Grey's of Alnwick M2 Apollo, its great for fishing from the rocks and beach, and is well built, depending on where you buy them it should be around £189.

go to glasgow angling centre website and look for the best deals.
you can get a good choice for all budget ranges.
otherwise try sea angler magazine and look thro there for tackle dealers.
only the very, very cheap ones will be suspect to snapping and even then only really through mis-use.
try and ask your q on www.worldseaangling.com on the forum page.

un mio amico a sarde a pisogne ha agganciato una tinca quindi potresti provare li.
buona fortuna
..........nn è vero, i carssi si ci sono,ma se peschi a fondo non li becchi.
Laghi in particolare x tinche ce ne sono ben pochi e io personalmente oltre al lago d'iseo non conosco 1 altro posto!!Forse in torbiera ,ma non ce ne sono molte

Of course it is- it requires skill and tactics.



If you think about it, anything which involves physical activity is a sport, especially if it requires team co-ordination. I would say Paintball is actually a very good sport- lots of physical exertion needed to do it well, lots of fun etc- the very fact that you'd question whether or not it's a "legitimate" sport suggests that, despite the energy needed and so on, it seems enough like a game to be considered just "fun"- jumping rope may not be an olympic sport, but it's still physical activity, and hence still a sport.

Paintball is a growing recreational activity, as well a sport. Paintball is becoming more and more recognized nationally as a sport every year. As with all school sports, paintball should be included! There are less popular sports in America, that are played in high school, such as rugby and lacrosse. Why shouldn't paintball be played in school?

Some people may think that paintball violates school rules, so on and so forth. But technically, paintball isn't a firearm. There's actually no such thing as a paintball "gun", only paintball markers. Paintball is much different than most people view it, and after playing it, people may realize that this is a sport very suitable for schools.

The NCPA, or National Collegiate Paintball Association, is a growing group of teams, including college and even high school students. More high schools are accepting paintball as a sport and adding it to their curriculum, as students have requested. It's all about the students! If there is a group of students that are dedicated enough, paintball can be added to the school curriculum without a doubt!

Some schools may question the safety of paintball. There are many rules and regulations to the playing of paintball, and when followed, paintball is much safer than almost all other sports. Paintball is actually one of the safest sports offered at any school. Tennis is actually considered a more dangerous sport than paintball; there are many more injuries, and many more serious injuries at that.

So consider paintball a sport. I don't want to ever hear anyone challenge paintball as to whether or not it's a sport. It requires more dedication, strength, agility, and team work than any other sport I've ever played. So think again.

it is, it's on espn (from what my friends say, i dont have any tv channels) and from the definition of sport, it matches all of the above

i think that it is less of a popular sport because it involves shooting, and many people are against violence, also people tend to cuss when they get shot.

Paintball is the best sport! keep playing =P
