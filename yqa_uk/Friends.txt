Sometimes the truth hurts but i think you have to sit your friend down and explain what you and your friends are thinking in the nicest way possible because if you don't then i think your friend will realise when this boy has lost interest she will have no-one to turn to

I would say confront her about it, but not in a rude way, just in a nice calm way. Say something like "hey, i haven't seen a lot of you lately, what's going on?" and explain to her your side of things and how you feel. if she really is a true friend, she'll listen to what you have to say and respect your feelings.

maybe you could arrange to sit down with her and explain the situation and how u feel that she is not who she used to be, not in an aggressive way though or she will push herself further away from you. you should sit her down and tell her ur feelings and how u miss her, and if that doesnt work then she obviously doesnt care that much about u and ur friends and u shud find someone else who is worthy of your time.

the best thing to do would probably to set her go because if she still wants to be your friend then thats cool, but people change, you lose friends, and you gain friends. Sometimes change is not such a bad thing. If she is your true friend then you all will always be friends but if not then just move on. : )

What do about girl who is obsessed with me / stalking me?



I moved to a new town recently and a new job. I didn't know anyone and hung out with a colleague a few times on a friendly basis (lunch etc.). We also went out to see a few films together and to see a band. I went along on a purely friendly basis cos I was new to the town and didn't know anyone. Anyway, this girl left the office but it seems she is obsessed with me. She knows everything about me even though I can't remember telling her much. God knows how she found out my birthday. I tried to break it off with her but she started guilt tripping me, writing 'I'm so lonely' emails. (She lives by herself in a dull suburb miles from anywhere and seems to be lonely person which has added to the pressure.) Recently she has complained to her friend who still works here that I ignored her and that I used her which has guilt tripped me out. Should I write an email telling her what I think and that I don't want anything to do with her, or should I just continue ignoring her?

Tell her you're sorry she is lonely and that she misinterpreted your FRIENDSHIP which was strictly friendship and platonic and you never said or meant it to be anything else, you are not responsible for what she thought or her loneliness, she was lonely before you came along and will go on being lonely which is her own choice nothing to do with you. You never used her in any way shape or form and she needs to find new friends now as you are no longer part of her life, period then change your contact info or just block her. She is a real looney tunes predatory female and you do not want her in your life on any level.

Block her emails
She is not your responsibility
Do not respond to her at all, but talk to a solicitor on a first appointment free basis, so that if anything gets out of hand, you can explain that you have consulted them and it is on file.
Take all copies of the emails on paper with you and dates of the films etc.

Explain it exactly like you explained it here. Tell her it was strictly platonic and you don't know what to do about her being 'so lonely'. You explained it great here, just let her know. If shes been persisting before with you ignoring her, it will probably continue until you make your point clear to her.

Why are you feeling guilty? It isn't your problem that she is lonely, she is responsible for her own life. You can either block her e-mails and just let things go or you can just send her a quick note letting her know that your not interested seeing her and that your busy. Persoanlly I think I would just send a quick e-mail and let her know that I'm busy, that way you haven't disrespected her, if she doesn't get it then, I would just tell her politely that you don't want to receive her e-mails and just end it there. Good Luck.

I mean we went to a party and got drunk, i ended up making out with him and stuff, and this week every ones coming up to me and saying stuff about it, and they all said he told them, but he denys it! What am i meant to think that they're all lying and hes the truth-full one?



Everyone in our group likes him still despite the fact hes meddled in each and every one of our personal affairs! He tries it on with like everybody in the friendship group, EVEN ME! And we all know hes just desperate, but i feel that if he doesn't stop being such an idiot soon i might punch him!

well if you were on home comeing court and so was your bestfriend that would be pretty cool right, but on the other hand your thinking what if shes on and im not. well ive been put in this kind of situation before In my 9th grade year we had this big formal dance called spring fest its a big deal in my school. well me and my bestfriend were both on court, but then it came to what if she gets chosen to be the "spring queen" type of thing and i dont, well she got chosen over me and got it, i was more then happy for her and im sure she would have been for me. So as for you if you and your friend both get choosen thats great if only one of you gets chosen then the only thing to do is be happy for the other person and no matter what happens you two are bestfriend and will have a fun time at homecomeing.

We thought it was more than just friends?



i have a few very close platonic male friends but with this one boy it was kind of different. he didn't feel like as much of a sibling than my other platonic friends. a few days ago, we thoght we would try something more and we went to the movies. throughout the movie we cuddled and were very close. we also kissed, just a lip on lip kiss, but it felt very sweet and comfortable.



however, after that day we said it probably wouldn't go well as it it ends badly, our friendship also would be over. after that incident, we havn't been talking as much and we feel less open to each other.



do you think we were comfortable being intimiate just because we were close friends and knew each other well or is there something there?

Does not sound like there is anything there.  How did you feel when you kissed him?  Was it just "sweet" or did you feel a little electricity?  More than likely if you felt a little zing, then you all have chemistry. Otherwise it could just have been a random experience and both of you may have been feeling lonely or just wanted to experiment.

lol. It's so cute when a guy tries to impress you and you know he's trying to impress you but it's not really impressing you. It's hard to explain. Like if you show her a drawing you drew or something and then go "aww... your not impressed :(" it's so adorable. also if you single her out like if she wants to touch your nose or something and you only let her do it and you don't let your friends do it it's nice when guys do that.you're friends will get the point that you like her but it'll make her feel special

I love the build up to winter, around this October/November time.



Particularly in the UK, we spend so long waiting for summer that we completely disregard the beauty of winter. A cold winter morning has an element of prettiness and freshness that many people are blind to.

I love summer (well when we get the sun here in Ireland) coz its nice and warm out and its the best weather for riding my horses in - I love the long evenings and the long windy roads with just a horse for company.



I also love Winter time as its also nice to be cuddled up inside a house by a fire - in particular with someone special! And in contradiction to the summer - I enjoy not riding the horses for 2 months and just having me time!!

An answer to help all questions about friends :)?



Family:
Your parents for big choices,
your best friend for regular, meduim choices...
i would really not like obeying my parents because theyr older
and older people have different minds, and different spirit, like for instance you wanna go to the movies, your parents are too grown up for that and they dont like it so they say no, but if they were your age they would have wanted to , and knowing that fact that your parents parents would really upset them,, soo i would listen to a bestfriend with



the same age and types



Friends



if you ever have a fight with a friend, and you think its yours and her fault then make it up by hugging her and say sorry , because thats the best way :( .. if its her fault tell her the truth , if she doesnt believe you. then tell her thanks for bieng a good friend and forgive her, you can try crying infront of her, maybe she'll react.



when it comes to choosing a guy or your bestfriend,
ALWAYS PICK YOUR BEST FRIEND



a guy, when you are at the age of 10 to 20 is nothing, usually you can go out with him for what pfft, a month , 2 months a year?
a best friend stays with you foreveer, and always take care of that



Remember this fact,
Friends Forever, Guys come and go, bestfriends stay and never go,
be yourself and dont be a hoe :)



btw im 13 aha

Although I'll get to see my family, are they really worth E74?



I'm a poor student from Barcelona, but my family will be across the sea in Mallorca tomorrow! But if I want to see them, the ferry costs E74 (£65). Is the 10 hour journey, only 3 days there, and the price worth it? I can go and see them in a few weeks for a lot less, but then my aunt won't be there!

Have you asked her why she's not talking to you?  If not, I recommend it.  If you have and she won't answer you, then I think you should write her a letter.  Tell her you're sorry if you did something to upset her and that you would never intentionally hurt her.  Remind her of the fun you used to have (include specific examples), and tell her how much you miss hanging out with her.  Give her some time to come around.  If she still doesn't want to talk to you, perhaps you could talk to your cousin or your dad.  I hope it all works out.

1st. you need to figure out what is wrong... maybe you have done something to upset her or something has upset her that she just doesn't want to share with you.
Maybe they aren't the best people to hang around with, but if you really do miss hanging around with them then you just need to ask them. Say it is making you unhappy that this is happening and that you really want to stop this and become close again.
She should really understand if you are upset and then maybe try and tell you about it.
Good luck with finding out.
p.s tip for doing so, don't get upset when asking (people overreact and tend not to be so helpfull, so be calm and friendly)

I'm home schooled right now. I have no friends. I'm a freshmen and and plan on going back to public school in a couple of months but until then I need some advice on coping. "Getting out" isn't really an option for me...I just need some words of encouragement or something. Somebody who understands.. I want to be happy but I haven't been in so long... I feel like I've been abandoned by the rest of the world. I feel like going emo or something

You think you feel this way b/c you've been home schooled?  Have you been home schooled all your life?  If so, I can understand somewhat why you feel that way.  Part of your growing up is the interaction you have with others, and when you don't have that, something is missing.  You aren't a loser at all, just get out there and make some friends when you go to public school!  =)

Whatever you do, don't become someone that you are not. That is if you have to classify yourself as "emo," it's not the right direction.



The best advice I ever received from my family was to "be yourself." As long as you be who you want to be and not someone you think people will accept, happiness will be the result.

I relate! I can't relate more, I was home-schooled for two years, then I attempted going back to public school. It wasn't for me, I dropped out, and transferred to my college's adult high school program.



Every community college, or normal college has one, I believe, please check. Call a local community college, it's called Adult Basic Skills Program, or Adult High School.  NOT GED, It's Adult High School or Basic Skills Program.



Ever since I joined, I have loved it so much! There are kids there just like me! I get along great, I made better grades, I actually look forward to going to school! :)



I never had any friends from Grade 7 Till now, in the past year that I've been enrolled, I've made so many friends, I feel like a normal teen now. :) It's great



So please please check around at colleges and see about this program and if they offer it. You'll enjoy it much better than public school, in Adult High School the teacher doesn't stand upfront and give a lesson and expect everyone to get it.



They give you a syllabus (What you need to do, Lessons, etc) And give you the book, you go at your own speed, and pace. This eliminates stress, at my adult high school they give no homework!
It is open 8am to 8pm. You come when you want, as long as you maintain 16hrs a week if you are under 18.



When you complete your credits they award you the credit, and when you are finished, you have a formal graduation just like the rest. :)



Check around!

So you want to go to a public school but you parents wont let you? is that what your saying?
i didnt get the "getting out" part.



But if you do go to a public school, and you just need some help tryin to make friends, and such, heres some advice.
Like i said before Be your self, the the Main thing you need to do.
and if your not happy, maybe goign to a public school will make you Happy, i Guarantee you that you will make friends, especially if its a big school, there are always people like you in public schools. or atleast people that will be nice to you.

I think anyone in your situation would feel exactly the same way as you are. It is difficult to be home schooled without the interaction of piers. Since you have not started school yet, use this time to work on a fun creative writing story about how a home schooled student goes back to school :)



Maybe start reviewing the extra-curricular activities for the new school, and decide which groups to join. That is the best way to meet people and join a group of friends.



And I am not sure if you are Christian, but Jesus will be your best friend. Maybe in the mean time, attend church, and church groups. Everything will be okay, you are totally in the right to feel lonely. Just get ready to make friends and get active :)

Hey man, Relax! The world is a cruel place, but there's always ways to make yourself happy. Turn something bad into something good.
Try to pick up a hobby, I know it sounds very high school guidance counselor of me to say, but its true. When you pick up a hobby, may it be an instrument or video games, paint balling, or hiking, anything that makes you feel exhilarating will help. You have to find out what makes you feel open, what makes you feel worth getting up in the morning for.
As far as friends, friends ALWAYS come down the road, ESPECIALLY if they're in a certain activity that you like. ( Hence, Hobbies )
Don't feel the way you feel, its like your using only 10% of your life in abilities and the world right now. Use the whole damn 100%, and do something you feel like you wanna do. Just get up and do it.
The best idea's come out spontaneously. Buy a PS3 or XBOX 360 for now, get hooked on something and keep going, keep your mind busy so that you don't think the way you do....good luck

First of all, you are NOT a loser.  Your intelligence is obvious in your question. Life is full of ups and downs, you're just in a "down" right now. The best thing about that is that you know it will change. You're at a difficult age too, you're basically a young adult - but can't drive yet, don't have the same freedoms as older teens,etc. It sucks. But again, that all changes.  I think that once you get back to public school and you are surrounded by people your own age that are in the same situation, it won't seem so severe.  Being back in school will also give you more social options. You haven't been abandoned by the world, just in solitary confinement for a bit. : )  Don't go emo just because you're not happy right now. Just be yourself and remember that it's all temporary.  If you ask any high school senior about the changes that took place between their freshman and senior year you'd get an earful.  High school is just a weird time.  When you go back, be friendly to everyone and you'll find your group.  Don't try to make yourself into something based on a temporary emotion. Ever notice that you never, ever see emo kids on a college campus? That's because they eventually realize that it's all an act and become normal people. What you're feeling right now is perfectly normal. I'll bet if you went to Google and searched "teen angst" you'd get a million hits. I'm not dismissing your feelings at all - I'm telling you that they're common. It's part of leaving childhood behind and entering adulthood - it's just a process, and not always a fun one.  It does get better, I promise. Like all of us, you'll have good days and bad days, but as you get older, you'll notice that the good almost always outweighs the bad.  Hang in there, try keeping a journal - not to write about how depressed you are, but one with goals and hopes and how you intend to make things happen.  Make some plans and decide how you'll change things for yourself.  You're not a loser, far from it - don't wallow in the bad, look forward to the good. You have a bright future and these high school years are the tiniest blip on the time line of your life.  Good luck, I have a feeling you'll be just fine.  : )

<question>



My friend is about to commit suicide?



OK, so my friend got in an accident and got 1st degree burns on his face and totally messed up  his eye.. his parents woulndnt pay for the surgery or hospital bills so he had to raise it himself.. So now he thinks that his parents dont care about him and that life sucks.. he had to raise more then 600 dollars to pay for the surgery, now hes about to kill himself, or so he says.. Hes also been cutting himself alot.. and says it feels good...



Ive tried to talk to him about it but he thinks hes doing the right thing.
Hes already told his parents, hes already told like everybody. Which makes me wonder.. Is he really gonna do it? Or is it just for attention?

You always want to take a suicide threat seriously.  In fact, talking about committing suicide is one of the major indicators (all people who commit suicide exhibit signs that, upon completion of the suicide, others thought that they "should have seen").  You want to find out how much thought he has put into this.  Does he have the means to do it?  Does he have a plan?  Does he have a time frame he's thinking about?  These are all factors you'll want to consider.



I also would not underestimate the amount of pain he is in, physically and emotionally.  People without 1st degree burns have a hard enough time socially, let alone someone with burns.



His cutting himself is a major indication that he needs medication.  Cutting releases endorphins (also responsible for the "good" feeling you get after a workout) which induce happy feelings.  It is a stress relief and often the only way to feel good.  prozac or another medication would help here.  While it does not solve all problems, it can often act as a way to "clean the slate," allowing you to solve them yourself.



While you are most likely not able to give him medication, you can provide him with phone numbers of counselors (there are always counselors who provide services on a sliding scale, so you pay what you can).  Also, there has got to be a way for him to raise money for any future surgeries.  His school, a church or other religious organization, there is always money out there for people who need it, but most don't know how to access it.  I would also ask local stores such as Costco, Fred Meyer, anything like that about raising money for a cause.  Your friend would get money, and the company would get good publicity, and therefore business.



You are a very caring friend and I truly admire your desire to help!  Good luck!

maybe he's testing you guys. Like you said he thinks his parents don't care and he possibly thinks nobody cares. So maybe he told everyone he'll kill himself because he does want the attention and wants to see if anyone will take him seriously when he said it. Maybe if people do pay attention to him more he'll feel better about himself. If people don't pay attention he'll think it doesn't matter, what's the use of living if you're all alone in life and nobody wants you. So he'll kill himself as a way to escape the emotional pain.

takes alot to commit suicide i do not want this to happen, even though he been in accident get the surgery and look forward to life, what about all those disabled people that have to go through life it much more of a challenge. Get the surgery and start enjoying life and dont care what people say or think. life is too short for that. Obviously you care, let him know.

It may be for attention, but a "cutter" definitely needs help. I have had many friends attempt suicide. No one knows this person's true feelings, and it is wise to let your friend know you care. Don't judge anyone. The best thing you can do is be a true friend, and spread the love. No one gets anywhere by judging someone or being mean to someone. Talk to his parents... Help your friend before it's too late.

You should always take anyone who mentions such things seriously.  I would call 911!  If attention is what he wants, attention is what he'll get. He'll either get help or feel like a real idiot. It may or may not break him but at least you did your part to take care of the problem so if he did commit suicide, you'd have a clear conscience.

advice only: you should give him activities that he wanted to do, and find out what is the real situation that affects his mind



I think he would do that, at this point in life many are also committing suicide because of no jobs etc., or give him the chance to speak his own way...and comfort him first and tell a situation in life... I think only..sorry.

ATTENTION
stop discouraging him. tell him you do not want to hear that. And don't show you any more of his cuts.  He wants sympathy . He's a spoiled little user.  There is a lot more than he is telling. (believe it).  Tell him he should have done it before he saved 600.00 for the surgery. because that is now  a waste of good money.

concentrate on your studies and the freinds will follow. you might meet people in your library or common room. your uni bar. you could ask some classmates if they would like to work on a project together.
try moving to the biggest house you can, aswell.
don't worry. it's not too late to make friends, everyone's runig out of loan by now so people will be looking for cheap ways to have a good time. think of some and suggest them to people.
and get off the internet. you won't find friends here.

Yea I think no matter how hopeless a person may feel... there's always someone for everybody



Usually they are attracted to each other for differences, or something they admire in the other that they don't have



I'm not organized at all, but I think it's very attractive when a girl is organized and put together



At times, some may have it better than most and get along with a lot more people to potentially date, while others struggle to carry on a conversation with a girl/boy - it's just how it works



I hope this helps!

The most important person in your world should be "you".If you like the person you have become that's great.If you do not like your self then you need to work on that to become the best person you can be.Once you have become your true self and actually know your self then and only then should that other person come into your life.I believe there is some one for every one but most people are in such a hurry trying to find some one they think will complete them that a whole lot of self gets lost along the way.When two people who are actually mature and capable of taking care of them self meet and fall in love the whole world becomes a better place.When people fall into needy relationships the world around them becomes a life built on sand and that is always subject to crumbling under your feet.

As much as you possibly can say, "I want to be your friend and i would do nothing to hurt you, that is all I want you to know".
Try to explain to them calmly that you did not do what they think you did
Dont get mad at them whatever they say, because it will just get worse
Find evidence, try and find out how this all started, with evidence maybe they will actually listen to you when you want to talk.
Keep trying, talk in person, send texts etc just make them know that you dont want this to carry on and you want to be friends.
Good luck =]

just talk to your friend and explain things. someone told him you have been talking behind his back and he believes them. truth be told it is probably the person who told him as they must have said something that hit a nerve for your friend to believe them in the first place.people talk crap all the time, just tell him that it hurts your feelings that he would believe you would do something like this to him and go from there. good luck!

<question>



Hello EVERYBODY,  my EX GIRLFRIEND came back to me, should I take her BACK ?



Now this is a tough question.  She just got out of an abusive relationship with a man.  She told me that he may have committed
a federal offense, and he may be in jail as we speak.  She sent me an
email about a week ago.  And then some more this week as well.
She seemed to be doing much better. But is on the defense, and
is nervous about her life right now. She did tell me how angry she
was at me for calling the police a few months ago, to do a house check.  And some words were exchanged, and I exchanged some
back. There is some resentment about that. But she is still talking
to me. If not today,  she will write back.  Believe me. But she was
happy, and she still has me as a contact on Yahoo. After all she
was the one who added me first.  So what gives ?  Is she playing games with me or what ?  Does she want me back or not ?



</question>



<additional details>



Even though  I know she did not say
specifically that she wanted to get back
with me.  She lies about how she feels
a lot.  She even told me that she would
never talk to me again ever back in
June.  But of course,  we see how that
turned out.  She contacted me once again,  and is still watching my Yahoo
Answers activities.  So what does she
want from me..............

She might be using you as a rebound relationship, do you really want her back, that is the question you must ask yourself.  What happened to have you guys break up in the first place?  Is it worth the cost?  I would say no, unless you really, really like her, and I saw that because once you break up there was something wrong in the first place and I think it rarely works

You're putting up walls and making her choose with every little fight you have with this guy. For her sake, the best thing you can do is try your hardest to ignore those dumb things he does and just be civil with him. This happened to a friend of mine, and her best friend is now an ex-best friend. She choose the boy over the friend. Be careful.

you'll have to wait until she becomes tired of either you or him.
seems she has the ball in her court on both of you.  she rules.



if the boyfriend is that immature and calls you names though, he may keep up that poor habit and call her a bad name soon enough.



if youre both acting like creeps, she'll get rid of both of you.
be the better gf than her bf is a boyfriend and you'll be around a lot longer.

What's the best way to kick out my housemate?



She isn't a paticularly bad housemate, I've had a lot worse experiences. Here's the thing: the house I live in was my gran's but she's gone into a nursing home and the house is owner by my parents and my auntie and uncle (joint ownership) but my parents own more of it and I pay them a small amout of rent so they are not looking to profit or anything. The main reason I got a housemate was so that I didnt get lonely but me housemate seems to always be at her boyfriends and I rarely see her. I would honestly rather live alone than with a housemate like this, or just any housemate really!
What's the best way to tell her I don't want to live with her anymore??
Thanks!!

if you dont really know her very well, just tell her a cousin is moving in or just say you dont know how long the pair of you can live there for as your parents might sell the house soon.
That would make me start looking for somewhere new.

well i think so to. i think you may be his back up plan and your letting him make you his back up plan. stop replying to his texts and calling him or answering when he calls you. go out and have and good time and find someone who knows your worth and treats you the way you should be treated. he is not worth the pain or drama.

just ignore his text, tell him if you don't feel the same as i do then i wont even dare to speak to you. even when he says he does, ignore him, and after a week or to, he probably will be on your door step, begging you to speak to him and want something with you.

If he broke up with you then too bad for him. Don't talk to him, become "unavailible". It'll drive him crazy & realize what he did.
Just take a few days to yourself. Live it up ;) He wants you back and if he really loves you--he'll stay true to that.



BUT if he`s just looking for a booty call or something to do----the hell with him. Move on, and DO NOT let him see you cry, he'll know your hooked.

If you have broken up , be it. just ask him to leave you alone . You dont have to answer everytime he beckons to you - and make yourself so easily available. Just ignore him. Its hard I know cos we women always have this thing called "hope" that he still lvoes you. Forget it! he is just using you! Look elsewhere! You deserve better!

It's definitely worth a shot. Whether she's attracted to you yet or not, every girl finds it sweet when a guy kisses her. It's almost as good as a compliment - you should give her those too! Genuine compliments - you really have to mean it. Even if she didn't feel comfortable kissing you before, show your wholehearted self and do it anyway. If she tells you no, don't be discouraged. That was wrong on her part - not yours. Best of luck.

Should I try talking to him?



I had a long distance relationship with a guy when I was really young about seven years ago. He cut off communication with me years ago.



He accepted me as a friend on Facebook and I have his sn because it was on there. Every time I have tried to reconnect with him in the past he simply has not responded. Our mutual friend says it's not worth it because my ex is moody and can be hard to get along with, but I still want to try. I think that him accepting me on Facebook is a good sign.



Should I im him? Or is that kind of creepy when you haven't talked to someone in about seven years?

You have nothing to lose if you do, because if he keeps silent, you already have that from him, so you have not lost a thing. If he does respond, you regained someone in your life, and makes your life better if you two can reestablish a dialogue.

Aww, that's really cool!
Well the best sleepovers kind of happen spontaneously, so I'd recommend just grabbing loads of stuff to do, like watching some films (comedies, chick flicks, scary films, get a big variety!), maybe doing some cooking (I'm sure there are loads of recipes on the internet.. I love fridge cake, which is really easy to make, look it up!) or just getting out a take-away. Get loads of magazines, paint each others nails, go on MSN. The best sleepovers are never structured, I'm sure you're just have a really good night in each others company. Have a goood night xx

CVS Pharmacy carries these books called, "Friends".  It just gives certain details of what a friend means. They're really cute, and that could be one of her gifts. They're not that expensive either.



Hope these ideas help or triggers some more for ya.

OK, I don't know you people, but I have this personal?



problem.  My twin sister stole a purse from me a long time ago, tried
to act like she didn't do it, and ruined our "twinship."  How can I
ever get her to confess and let us start being twins again?



Also, she blackmailed me to several people. (We don't live together.)

Please help me! Need guys and girls help! I want your opinion!?



Alright so here's whats up. The guy I like and his friend were planning on hanging out. Heres their convo on facebook:
the girl: joe I miss you!
my crush: omg...i miss you too...you popped in my head the other day...i was gonna come to bloom yesterday but our plan fell through...i'll be up there and when i am...you'll be gettin a call...you best believe
the girl: aww you should definitelyy come! we can go to eat and you can eat all my leftovers like the good old times hahaha does lockhaven play bloom? hows ur team lookin?



That was their convo they had YESTERDAY morning. After she wrote to him, he didn't write back and she wrote that at 10:00 in the morning. He used to like her, but I don't think he still does because last year she turned him down. But do you think that he didn't write back because he went to see her yesterday? Or do you think that he just didn't feel like writing back? He has not been on his facebook since she wrote back to him, but she has been on hers. I don't know what to think! Help!

I was wondering if anyone could please help me know what to do?



This is some seriousboy trouble. I went out with this gut like a year a go. Then I broke up with him because I was really starting to fall in love with him after like a week. And that scared me a lot. Come on I was only 16 and didn’t want to be in “LOVE”! Well then we didn’t talk or see each other after the brake up, we tried once but he asked me why over and over and I could not handle it like I wanted to so I shut him out. SO…. now I have an amazing BF and I love him and I am not afraid of it either I really feel like I want to be with him, we have been going out for 6 months all happy and fine. Then all the sudden the past re-appears and “HE” now sits next to me in math class (I hate my math teacher now!!) IT TOTALY sucks. Now I have those feelings all over again for him they all just rushed uncontrollably as soon as I saw him walk through the door, and I really don’t know what to do. Because I think that all I want is closure with him because after the brake up we just didn’t talk about it. Of course I still thought about him sometimes maybe if I just held on to him a little longer it could have been better. ( but I also had a bf die like 4 months b4 I started going out with “HIM” and I loved him so I was not ready to re-love someone) but still maybe i could have done something different!??  Now that he is back I feel like I can’t figure anything out and it hurts... I think he might be getting back at me for the past somehow... HELP PLEASE!!! I’m too young to be going through this.

if God sends me S to make it easier to get over you, yes I will sleep with him and be with him to force you to distance. After that, I will think then what to do. Hating you will prevail, I do hate you very very much you will never be able to get pass that. If you wanted a teacher THAT was not a good waz to get it, did you think I will chnage my mind over night and start being a teacher....I have never been given ANYTHING, just ANYTHING, all my life people were just taking from me, a true disciple will come with an offer not a demand if he or she ever wnats to get anywhere with me. I know, it is a brilliant characteristics to be so big that you can give and give endlessly. But, I am tired and a seeker ready for the revalations must feel the same or is not ready for the experiance to be loved by a pure person. Like you.

Amazing Gift for a College Girl?



I'm a girl on my boyfriends account...



Anyway I'm 15 and my friend who is in college is 22. Her birthday is coming up and I have no idea what to get her. I'm not really close to her so I dont want to get anything weird, but I dont want to get anything boring either. And obviously, I cant buy her alcohol because I'm underage. Any ideas?



</question>



<additional details>



I didnt really phrase this correctly. I'm really close to her, but only as close as a hignschooler can get to a senior in college. If that makes any sense.



And I do like the idea of a gift card, but where should I get it from? and How much?

Give him another....what?



Should I give him another chance?



I have an interest in this guy.  (I am seeing someone else and the guy I have an interest in knows this).  So Friendship is cool with me.  And the guy of my interest said friendship was cool with him.



We've known each other for 9 months and had a cool relationship at work...Since he left for another job, we have been emailing/IMing for the last 3 months.  We are both are shy.  I've made an effort to hang out in person as friends.  He hasn't made an effort toward hanging out as friends.



And I do mean as friends...I'm the type of girl that gets along better with guys....



It's to the point where I have to stop the email/IM cause he hasn't made an effort toward friendship...and it kinda hurts.



Why hasn't he made an effort?



I know we're both shy so do you think that's why he hasn't initiating hanging out?



Should I give him another chance....wait until he's ready?

Perhaps he has a girlfriend?  Maybe you should up the ante and make it a friends with benefits?  Otherwise the first girl that comes along will easily take up all of his time and attention.  Thus leaving no time for you.



Take it from me.  I am constantly juggling my schedule around to accommodate the 4 or 5 women I'm dating at any one time.  Sometimes when a scheduling conflict arises I have to make decisions.  It all comes down to who will I have the most fun with.



I dunno.  Other than that advice all I can say is don't be boring.  If you want a guys attention, then do something to get it.

because they are being selfish.
people had changed.
sometimes, we can hardly trust anyone.
but some people do that because they need to get something, that we can forgive. Be tolerance, give and take.

Well, it's not that we like backstabbing our friends, our true friends. It's just that it's very hard to let your feelings still inside of you. It will feel like in one moment, you're going to explode. Backstabbers are not true friends!

You have to face the music.
Even though you are drunk, you did do the "licking" stuff, and you have to apologize with your parents before they knew. Get the punishment is better than hide your mistake.

A friend wouldnt have taken the pictues.The parents would be very upset.How stupid it is that he took the pictures much  less left them around to be seen.One important lesson, alcohol taken in the amount to make you do things like that can be one more reason against drinking.You are going to have to be truthful if confronted.This person has a mean streak in him.

I need advice on how to get over a friends death....?



I had a friend named Derek who died about almost 2 weeks ago(sept.19,2008). He died in a car crash with his best friend, he died from blunt force head trauma and his friend died from burns and trauma to his head. Yeah the car ignited after it crashed into a tree. I still haven't gotten over the fact that he's gone......he was the kind of guy that you thought nothing would happen to him, he's invinceble, until this happens. I know it hasn't been that long but I can't sleep anymore and im still crying and telling myself it's just a bad dream and I have to wake up......what can I do to ease the pain and try to let him rest in peace?? I would greatly appreciate the advice...god bless

I feel sorry for your tragic loss.One thing I would do is think of the happy moments you shared together. Then I remember my friend would want me to remember him, but not to be always sad .That would make your friend sad.Get all your photos and things you shared and make a nice scrap book.Call it the book of Derek.Two weeks is not enough time to get over a sudden shock like that.Another thing,visit his family.They would probably love to see somone who is grieving and loving their son.Remember too they(Derek and Dennis)  are in heaven where there is no more suffering for them.They go on living, it is in a different realm.An accident happened like that happened  to someone in my family.Also, use this great loss to treasure a little more all who are your friends and relatives.Finally, you will  feel his prescence at times in the way of really strong thoughts, or he may try to comfort you in your heartbreak by making his prescence felt to you. God Bless you.

I myself have lost so many loved ones and cried so many tears. Share with others your experience (family and friends). They should be able to provide comfort and strengthen you as a person. Preoccupy yourself with other positive and productive activities that you might enjoy (movies etc.) to take your mind off of it.Death can have a profound impact, but you must turn this negative into a positive. Be happy that you knew them and enjoyed such a great friendship, remember the good times and the influence you've had each others' lives knowing that we ALL cannot live for long and that there is a time when you must say goodbye and let go. Live. You will honor your friends the most when you remember them for who they were and you live on your life and go on, i know that's what all our loved ones who have gone want for us

ive lost a friend too, same situation except with cancer...i mean like my friend..he was my best friend. hes amazing and like you said, hes the type of guy you thought nothing would happen to him.



honestly, accept the pain. i lost my friend last year in march and even now i still cry about it at times. i miss him too too much and its really hard. but your friend derek would want you to be happy, so you should smile each day for him. but from personal experience... cry it all out, let yourself feel what you need to feel. because back in march last year... i was helping everyone else with their problems and i didnt really deal with mine. i tried avoiding it hoping that it would just go away and everything would be okay again but then later on...this fact just haunts me more and it hurts even more. so seriously..just feeel what you need to. occupy yourself, dont be afraid to show how you feel. loosing a loved one is unbearably hard and no one can imagine the pain unless you're going through it.



that was yesterdays dissappointment. today is today. dont let yesterdays misery affect today. everydays a new day, and everyday, we should smile. so just smile lovely.

I'm looking for a childhood friend...?



Ever since second grade I have been friends with a girl (now a woman about 41 or 42 years old) named Tammy Staples. We went to school in Tyler Texas at Mattie Jones Elementary. We lost touch in our twenties and I miss talking to her. Does anyone know her. At one time she was living in Irving Texas. Her family used to live on Chandler Highway in Tyler I believe. Her father's name was Albert? She may be married now and has a different last name. Please help.

It greatly depends on how you go about it. But if they are home and didn't ask for your help...it could make them feel a bunch of different ways. I had a friend with ocd and would come over start picking little tiny pieces of lint or fuzz off the carpet and it made me crazy. I personally would not do it. It could make them think you look down on them.

well listen, i went to my sister in laws house to clean it for her, because she is a nasty slob and gross, and my brother works 3 jobs and doesn't deserve to come home to a pig pen, and while HE appreciated it sooo much, it pissed her off because she was saying that i threw things of her dead mothers away, which i did NOT do. we sat down together and she said what stayed and what went to the trash. she just used that as an excuse for me to not come back. I spent the whole day just in their bedroom cleaning **** out. its gross. and when i asked her, when it was clean, i said, don't you feel much better now?? :) and she said, no not really cuz she didnt care. she's just gross! so yea, i guess some people don't like it. i figured she was embarrassed about it, but my brother said no, that she really don't care if people see the house that way or not. he won't let anyone come over because of it. i don't blame him.

Yes it is rude. No matter how close you are, it is rude to simply start cleaning. If the person has expressed some dissatisfaction with the mess, or some sense of being overwhelmed, then you could offer to help. But unless they accept that offer, you have no right to clean another person's house.

Absolutely not. I don't think they would disappointed by you taking your exams. I would tell them as early as possible, so they have it in their mind come Saturday. I would simply tell them, although you want to share your birthday with them, you have to take your exams. If they feel short changed then you guys can celebrate the next weekend. Even after you take your exams, you all can get together for a movie, ice cream, or dinner.  It's your day, so make it about you!  All in all, I think your best bet is to tell them before they get to your house for the party.  Happy Birthday!



By the way, good luck on your exams!

Lonley Hearts Ads? (Best/most relevant answer 10pts)?



Are there any websites of a similar style to lonely hearts ads in the UK where you can search for people wanting FRIENDSHIP, not a relationship, just people seeking friends of the same sex?



I found a website, newfriends4u but it wasn’t very good as there wasn’t that many people of a similar age (17-21) who lived near and were using it.

Is this an automatic reaction towards my bf's abusive call?



This guy and i. We were friends before but we started getting too know each other better, texts back n forth kinda thing. Hes a nice guy And a wicked kid, And hes so easy too talk to.



Anyways, we were texting and my boyfriend had my phone just as i recieved a text, He went to read it but i had a code lock so he couldnt. Than i read it aloud just so he could feel comfertable that im not doing anything behind his back. (WHICH I WOULDNT we're expecting a child). Anyways. He than called my friend ABUSING the crap out of him saying "You wait c*nt" and stuff like that i said sorry too my friend, and he didnt care, he said it was ok and that he'll still talk to me. Anyways i made my boyfriend apoligise, and ive noticed now that my friend doesnt seem the same.. Like he used to.
He's not as open, and he doesnt ask as much or talk as much as he used to. Is this an automatic reaction too my boyfriends phone call, is he trying too prevent it from ever happening again, Or is he just not interested.



My boyfriend also went off his head at one of HIS friends for talking too me and ever since than he hasnt spoken too me, not once.



I really like this guy as a mate, Hes has alot of respect for me, But he also has alot for my boyfriend, and im thinking he just doesnt want too ruin his friend ship with him. Im pretty much ordered too be "anti social" and im only aloud too talk too my bf's friends at the moment, My boyfriends having a major over-protective spurge. But i think that might be because im pregnant, and he just doesnt want me hurt or something.
And even though ive been talking too his friends he feels as though he has every rights too abuse them for absoloutly no reason.



How do i tell my boyfriend i wouldnt do anything against him, Hes the one whos been Unfaithful. Im sick of only being able too hang out with my friends when he's there, half of my friends are his friends so thats not hard. But still.



And this guy, Is it a reactionm Or he just doesnt want too be friends,



</question>

Oh also. I would like an answer that makes SENSE. Please.

When will you silly kids learn...YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE LOCKED FOR A REASON..and that is so your boy friend cant see your messages..If your totally faithful 2 him why the code? ..You can forget the 100% trust factor with your boyfriend.  And the guy texting you has common sense, hes backing off cause he doesn't want any problems from your boyfriend and for  you.  Plain and simple if your mate has to hide anything from you they may not be cheating but the probability factor is high that anything can happen..  And If your boyfriend was cheating, And controlling who you hang out with You staying with him is reinforcing that behavior...Time 2 reevaluate the relationship...and You didnt say why you had the phone  locked..most ppl lock it so know one can go into their phone, and most ppl dont let their children play with their $200 plus phones...I can see you dont want a truthfull opinon, you want some body 2 say hes wrong..you will get that here but its not going to help with the situation your in...Oh and you want a answer that makes sense hows this...It doesnt make any sense that ur carrying a guys baby, being controled and disrespected by a guy that is cheating on you....wake the hell up normal ppl dont get treated like this...

<question>



Should I talk to my lost friend about my low-self esteem?



Well my lost friend is my closest friend. And his appearance is good. Well sometime I need to at least like the appearance to get some self esteem. I lost my friend and I'm trying to find him. I think I know how to find my friend. Is it better for me to talk to someone else because my lost friend is the only person I can talk to? He's a huge part of my life. Well I'm just a teen and his an adult. I know his likely off limits and I don't know. I just want to talk to him though myspace but hard to find him in myspace profile search. I need self esteem because I'm really that low. I think the cause of self esteem is that I make embarrassing mistakes and no one has accepted me the who I am or being close friend. Just my lost friend accepted me the who I am. I know everyone accepts me the who I am. I really ain't sure what is the cause of low self esteem. What is this feeling I'm having? Can someone help?

You only know who is more important when you see who's there at the very end. If one has left you, then obviously they didn't care about you enough to stay around. Sometimes, your lover can be your best friend and I truely believe that.

Friends are more important because they appreciate you for what you are and likes you for being you. A lover is only interested in your physical aspects and usually won't be interested in your personal life.



Which is more important to you? A friend who will be there for you no matter what or a lover who will be there for you only during lonely nights?
A friend can be with you for those moments too without asking for return favors.

I made a promise to my friend, but I would rather not keep it...?



Now I've known this friend forever (about 12 years now, since we were in kindergarten) and he he has developed a huge crush on me.  Now I don't think he is a bad guy, he is basically my brother and the idea of dating him just doesn't appeal to me at all.



I've been in a few serious relationships and I promised that he could be my next boyfriend.



I sort of pity him, that's why I think I promised him that I would go out with him next.  But seeing as he is almost my brother, I would rather not ruin that.



How can I take back my promise without crushing him?

to the last question u asked, u can't.
I know how you feel but the only thing you could do is talk to him. Tell him you know that it hurts that ur breaking ur promise but you feel like itd hurt him more if you went out with him and didnt really want to. Tell him that you like ur relationship with him just the way it is and that its too perfect and awesome to wreck by dating and stuff when u know its not gonna work out in the end.



I say u tell him that you dont wanna do this now better than later where he'd like you more. And if he's THAT close of a friend then he'd understand.



Wishing you all the luck there is!!!!!!!!!

Actually, I was in this situation myself. If he is your "best" friend like you say he is, then just be honest. I know it's hard and something you don't want to face but it's the best decision. Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same. I decided to date my guy friend and things went really well at first. After a month, things took a turn for the worse and now we hardly even talk. So if you know you really don't want to be with him, just say that you're friendship means more to you with him at this point in your life than a relationship with him. If he's a bestie, he will understand. He probably will be hurt at first, but just give him his space to accept things and hopefully he will see and accept your decision.

You have to ask yourself: If you patch things up are you really going to be able to trust them? Is their behavior going to change for the better? If not then maybe it's best to cut ties. I had a friend who was constantly putting herself and needs ahead of everyone and, after putting me in a dangerous position, I decided I would never be as important to her and she was to herself so I broke off my friendship with her.

What do you do when you have no one?



I been lying to myself, i keep telling myself that my friends are not treating me bad, but I'm giving up on believe that and admitting the truth to myself that my friends aren't great friends to me. and now i'm left with nothing. sometimes family is not enough, well for me, im not that close to my family. and it hurts seeing people have good friends that they can trust and rely on and knowing i can't have that. I can't really go out and make new friends because where i live people are cruel, you can't just approach someone and start a conversation without being insulted. i don't know if i can last one more year. i got one year of high school left and i don't know if i can just go to school with a smile and hang out with a bunch of people who are either too busy talking about their boyfriends, or talking about the latest fashion or usually talk about mean stuff about others and i'm just sitting there pretending i care. i don't know what to do, im going insane, can i handle one more year like this or leave them and be alone. and honestly i don't like being alone.

My sister is going through the same thing, and as i told her you need to get up and do sommin about it, you have a hobby right? then join a club you'll meet people with the same interests as you. When i was lonely back in the day i used to go on chat rooms, i know it sounds sad but people kept me company and it took my mind off it for a while. Don't know how old you are so don't know if you can get a part time job. I know school is hard when you don't have friends, but

Very few people have more than one true friend. The people you hang with now will just be a memory in a couple years. People change, friendships change, and life changes. Trust me, things do get much better after high school and the things you're worried about now will seem very trivial when you look back at life. Hang in there, the best time in your life will begin after high school. I don't mean to preach, but you are never alone

Life support survival?



My friend  is on life support, and doctors can't tell if he's brain dead.
He has a tracheal breathing tube, and is unconscious.
Its been 3days, should i have any hope of him living, with a function brain.



He was in a serious car accident. Doctors think he's going down hill.



Is there more they can do, llike run test. I was told he has some swelling in his brain.



I am long distance away, and getting informations from friends. Iam trying to get more detailed information at the moment.



I just need ideas. Should I be expecting "the phone call". Any hope

<answer>



Doctors can tell if he's brain dead - there are several tests that can be run (EEG, BEAR, simple exams).  I don't know his case so I am only giving you "suggestions" - none of this can be considered concrete.



The brain swells after trauma - the swelling causes damage, but the extent of that damage is often not known for several days, often weeks.  If the brain continues to swell despite treatment, this can lead to brain death.  The type of injury is also an indicator of how well he might do - diffuse injuries are often less survivable than localized injury with secondary swelling.



Time is the only thing that can or will give you a definite answer.  The brain is a tricky and fickle organ that doesn't take trauma well, but also has a bizarre way of protecting itself.



As I always tell my patient's families: Hope for the best, but brace for the worst.  My best to you and the family in this tough time.

If you're letting him do this **** to you (OH LIKE!!!) in front of her or even if it wasn't, how can you be suprised that she doesn't think of you as a friend.
I would have punched your &*^%$#% lights out, and his if you'd carried on like that in front of me. Ex-boyfriend or not, friends are supposed to be people you can count on, not count on to screw your ex!
You sound really stupid and vain, and keep it up and you'll end up with no friends, just a whole lot of silly little boys who think they can get it easy with you.

relationships are about trust. If he can't trust you thats his problem. My girlfriend has a lot of guy friends than girl friend. There hasn been one moment that I have been insecure about that. Only thing i have been concerned is about her friends behaviour. You will meet many people in life and you cant be just avoiding them just because your spouse doesn like him/her

The best way I can say is to just be yourself. Don't try to be something you are not. Be sociable and nice to those who do the same to you and if someone seems not right then avoid them. But I learned honesty and trustworthy are qualities everyone will see. But don't be or try to be what you think they want you to. It doesn't work and you'll end up with more enemies than you asked for. Once people learn you are truthful and kind they will come to you. Don't Try to "fit in"

I need help making guy friends?



My life totally sucks.  I'm 19 years old and a college student.  I'm a student at a community college so making guy friends at school is impossible.  I've tried my whole life to make friends and I always fail.  No matter what I do; I never can make a single guy friend.  I have a girlfriend, but I hate not having any guy friends.



It annoys me so much that I don't have any guy friends.  I love football and I never have any guys to play or watch football with....it sucks.  My college has nothing for football...so that won't help and I've had enough of this b s not having any guy friends...

How do I tell someone not to do something without getting into an argument?



I moved to a new house 3 months ago and have become very close with the family next door.  We go to each others house every day.  The only problem is they have three children who eat what they want whenever they want, so when my 18 month old goes there, the mum gives her too many sweets and chocolate even when I have said No.  She will even wait until I go to the toilet and give my little girl a choc biscuit in each hand.  I feel so angry because I give my little girl healthy meals and when it comes to tea time shes not hungry because shes been stuffed up with junk.  I don't mind her having treats but not constantly.  The mum next door thinks that she is being kind to her children by letting them have what they want to eat, so when i say no to mine she thinks im being mean.  But in my eyes I think giving them good health is the kindest thing you can do for your kids.  I cant say this tho as id be offending how she lives.  I don't know how to get her to stop over feeding my little girl as she doesn't listen to my NO.  And when my little girl then has them in her hand (I say them as its never just one thing)  I feel I can't take them off her coz shes so made up.  I don't want to fall out but its going to have to stop, its not what i want for my baby.

Talk to her. Explain how you feel. You may not want to offend the way she lives, but she is offending you by doing what she is. It is your child and you have the right to tell her not to give her things. She should understand it from your point of view.



I can understand why you want her to eat properly and eat healthy. If she doesn't stop then either stop going around there or don't leave your child alone with her. If she tries to give her something you don't want her to stop your child taking it. An odd treat won't hurt, but obviously she is giving her too much

First  I think you need to lighten up. A treat or two for a child that normally eats healthy is not going to harm the child.
Second If you really want the woman to stop you need to explain your reasons and make it perfectly clear that you do not want your child to have these treats and be firm about it when you do



Third  you are just going to have to visit less often.  You cannot really tell the woman what to do in her own home,  It will be hurtfully unfair for the other children to enjoy treats while your little one must stand by and watch with nothing.  Limiting your visits is the only real way to make sure that your child is only eating what you want her to eat..... but mom there is such a thing as going too far, the poor little thing will only be a child once let her enjoy it.

Put yourself in my shoes, what do you think?



i'll try to make this as short as possible....



Best Friend-B*L
Her Boyfriend -B*W
My Ex- T*G
My Brother D*H



so my best friend BL has been treating BW very badly.... she still has feelings for my brother DH and she told me a while back. i didn't know what to do.. i was put in a bad postion because i am very close with her boyfriend BW. we have been friends for years. so now i feel like... if i dont tell Bw about how BL still has feelings for DH than i'm a bad friend... i confronted BL about the things she said about my brother. i told her it was wrong and she is hurting her boyfriend BW and i feel like she needs to tell him... i let her take care of it...



months later.. shes still treating BW like crap... and than she starts texting my EX boyfriend TG... so not only is she being a bad friend to me now... shes being a bad girlfriend.. again! she trys to meet TG at a resturant, with just the two of them. and i saw texts from them back n forth...



i said to TG... WHY do you have to pick MY best friend! why couldn't it be anyone else! just stay out of my life! .... he thinks i have no right to get involved. and he called me a 'c**k Blocker' for always getting in the way and lots of other mean things including 'selfish B***H'



i decided i think BW, deserves to know whats going on behind his back... so i talked to him... i told him everything i knew...



TG FLIPPED on me when he found out... i ignored most of his texts...



BL doesn't want to even be my friend ne more... she said to my sister ' she is pretty much the worst friend i ever had'



bw is thankful... but now his life is hell because he found out his girlfriend is disshonest and horrible...



did i make the wrong choice?



should i have just let BW be lied to



and just sit back n watch?

Would you say this my fault?



I live with my roommate and her boyfriend.  They got into a physical fight tonight, and I stayed out of it (reading a book).  For no apparent reason at all her boyfriend starts threatening my life and breaks my cell phone.  I signed a warrant on him for my phone, and she is mad at me because now he says he wants to break up with her.  What do I do now?

stick to your guns. no way should you have to put up with that sort of treatment. fair enough don't get involved in their issues but when he makes it involved you then you have every right to take action. if she was a real friend she would try to get him to apologise to you.

How do I bloody stand up for myself. I'm pissed !!!?



I've been shy through school. Now I'm 20 & I've become very outgoing. But my "friends" from school still assume that I'm the same old fella they used to push around in school & still try to push me around, call me names and stuff.. In retaliation, when I call them the names they were called in school, they get pretty pissed off. How can I make them understand that just like they dont like being called names and pushed around, I dont too.



How do I make them understand that they need to behave themselves when in front of me? How do I talk them out of this?



Please help me out. Thanks.

How about...*telling* them that you're more outgoing now and you'd like them to show you some more respect. If that doesn't work, then just prove it at a social gathering or something.

I need help making guy friends?



My life totally sucks.  I'm 19 years old and a college student.  I'm a student at a community college so making guy friends at school is impossible.  I've tried my whole life to make friends and I always fail.  No matter what I do; I never can make a single guy friend.  I have a girlfriend, but I hate not having any guy friends.



It annoys me so much that I don't have any guy friends.  I love football and I never have any guys to play or watch football with....it sucks.  My college has nothing for football...so that won't help and I've had enough of this b s not having any guy friends...

My friend blew me off, What should I do?



Saturday night me and my friend was suppose to go to las vegas overnight and hangout and gamble. He has been having problems with his girlfriend and they actually broke up for a while, I asked him if he wanted to go and he said yea. I have 2 jobs and had to make an effort to get that night off at both of my jobs. Saturday night comes around and we were suppose to leave around 10:00 to 10:30 at night, and 10:45 come around and still no call. I call him up and he tells me that he and his girlfriend are talking some problems out. I asked him how long it was going to be, and he said that he couldn't go because of them talking. I made plans with him, and didn't even call me to tell me he couldn't go earlier that night. So I am stuck doing nothing because my other friends already made plans. What should I do? what should I say to him? Oh and this isn't the first time this has happened because of his girlfriend.



</question>



<additional details>



Also, he has known me for 7 years. He has known her for 1 year, maybe 1.5 years.



I also know she dislikes me, I think she has to much control over him.

Looks like your friend has put his GF as a higher priority than you. Regardless if they were "talking things out" or whatever the case may be, he should have called/text you to let you know hed either be late or that he couldnt go. Making you wait when he knew you were suppose to leave at a certain time was very selfish of him. Id say from now on dont count on him - especially if it means taking off from your job. If he knew you took off work that even makes it that much worse that hed pull that! Id let him know that you went out of your way for this trip and that it actually cost you not only your time but money you didnt not make due to you getting off work. At the least a sorry would be nice, or even him doing something to make it up to you. To many friends are like this and its because they are living for themselves and doing whats best for number 1. Sorry your plans didnt work out. Better luck next time!

no pal, this didn't happen because of his gf, this happened because your so called "friend" is a selfish pig who doesn't have any respect for u. his mother should be ashamed of him. anyway, if i were u i would stop any contacts with him forever. why do u need such a friend who stands u up all the time? normal person would call and inform that he couldn't make it cos of personal problems.

Well you have to understand that a girlfriend comes first.



and so do the situations.



when boyfriends have plans... even if they were planned months ahead of time. and as they are getting ready to leave. maybe their girlfriend wants to have a serious talk about the future of the relationship, which any boyfriend in their right mind will blow off anything else. If you think about it in that situation it would be way rude to say stop, let me call my friend and cancel.
The last thing a girlfriend that is having a serious convo wants to hear is wait let me call my friend. It's rude and could make her snap and break it off. If he really cares for her, he will respect her and put her first.



I know it sucks for the friends, and this usually is the problem of a girl coming in between friends. You either have to respect how he feels for her and puts her first over your friendship, learn to deal with it cuz it will happen again. Or just realize thats not the kind of person you want in your life and end the friendship.
Sorry that happen though, it sucks. My girlfriends have done that to me too many times. Till I realized it's a battle I will never win.

How do you tell a friend?



I have a friend named James. James is dating my other friend Jessica, and James is completely smitten.



Another one of my friends, Jack has dated Jessica before, and recently admitted to still having feelings for her- which is natural. What wasn't expected was that Jessica told Jack that she likes him too. Even though he avoids bringing the subject up, she keeps pressing it.



This makes Jack uncomfortable since James is one of his best friends. He feels obligated to tell James that Jessica has been nearly pursuing him behind his back.



Should Jack tell James about what Jessica has been doing and saying?
If so, what is the best way to approach this situation and explain it so James doesn’t get too angry?

Title: "Fire and Ice" by Robert Frost.



Some say the world will end in fire
Some say in ice
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold wiht those who favour fire.
But if it had to perish twice
I think I know enough of hate
to say that for destruction ice
is also great



and suffice.



P.S: It's a poem about life, please guys tell me the point of view (lesson) of that poem.
Thanks in advance for answering my question, I appreciated it.

The more you keep it simple the more it makes sense.
Robert Frost speculates on the theories of others and does not tell us if he thinks it could happen at all, just that it it does here is his ideas.
Love is stronger than hate and can ultimately be more severe as a weapon. Hatred is almost as strong and can do the same amount of damage. He understands this and he chooses love but knows that he wouldn't count out hate to do the job as well.



I love poetry whether it be for the purpose of esthetics, persuasion, communication, venting, etc ... because it generally makes the reader try to think expansively. People often try to attribute meaning, in "generalized" poems such as this, based on cultural, personal, historical or emotional influences.



I always like to look at poetry from a few different perspectives. Taking a broad standpoint I'd suggest that the author is trying to convey fire as strong emotion (e.g. love, greed, envy, jealousy, vexation, etc ... pick your poison) and ice as a complete lack thereof. Now let's step back and look at it from another point of view. Robert Frost's poems often show a deep appreciation of the natural world as well as human aspiration. His childhood was filled with loneliness, depression, and confusion. If viewed this way then I would take my earlier portrayal of fire one step further and suggest that it conveys intense loneliness and depression. Ice, on the other hand, symbolyzes hatred through complete lack of compassion. Furthermore, this would also make sense from a historical standpoint. The poem was published in 1920 and would exemplify the sentiments of a generation in a world that has just been brutalized by one of the most horrific wars in human history, World War I.

for the world to end in fire is to burn all things away.as for desire it's best to have a hot fiery desire than a cold one.now for hatred it is said that"revenge is a dish best served cold".if your relationship must end let it end in fiery passion but if not cold hatred will be a welcomed comfort.

Maybe he wants a break. Or you shouldn't just ask if you can hang out. Ask him straight out when you talk to him next. Tell him how it makes you feel I guess. But that could be a problem seeing as your a guy.

Well maybe your mate is mad at you but your never going to know unless you sit down and talk to him. Just give it a shot if he really is a friend he's not going to leave you. Just ask what's going on lately? Just don't give up on the situation because then you may lose a friend for good.

How can I say no to my friend who wants my notes? - i m not as bad as i sound :(?



I recently made notes for a huge exam coming up, its state wide. The notes took about 40-45 pages. And i worked day and night on it. My friend (not close just a girl in my class) always asks for my class notes, i always give them to her. and before exams and assignments, she calls and asks me questions and i answer her the best i can, ALWAYS. But this School Certificate exam, she asked if she could borrow my notes, my trials is a week from now, and i made my notes 2 weeks earlier, in preparation. But she comes now, and asks my help a week before, i m happy to answer her questions, but i dont want to give my hardwork to her, when she doesnt do anything in return for me. She is really nice, and i told her she could look over, and see if anything is missing which then i can help her with, but she still wants my notes. I told her she could come over in 4 days and get look over it, but how do i stop her from copying my notes?? Please answer soon.

I'm in college and I face this dilemma all the time. You simply have to put your foot down. I know it's hard and you don't want to come across mean, but do you really want someone taking advantage of you? I hope not. Just tell her that you're still working on your notes and that you rather not hand them out until you're finished. She won't know when you really finish unless you tell her. It's fine if you answer her questions, but make sure it's in public like in the library or after class. Just tell her from now on that you're studying heavily so you're putting your phone on vibrate or cutting it off so you won't be bothered. Don't hand out your hard earned work to someone who is really... well.. seems to be using you.

Seriously, do not do it. People like that are only using you, i showed my 'friend' my exam essay question (we were to do it at home before the exam and hand it in with it) and she stole THE WHOLE THING! and *never* mentioned it again, she doesn't even talk to me now.



seriously, no matter how hard it is to say no, you have to, being a push over only gets you stepped on..

Say something like "I'm sorry, I can't loan you my notes because I really need to focus on studying. Maybe so-and-so will let you borrow their notes.". It seems she is taking advantage of your hard-working and generous nature.

If you really want to let her see your notes, make copies. But from what you said of her, she has no business to be asking for your notes when she could've made her own notes perfectly well. It's her own fault she's in this predicament, and you have every right to refuse to let her see or have your notes.

Well the thing is, is that you have to talk to her and make her believe you. The thing is though that you have to get her to listen. I've never been in a situation like this before but I've seen it enough times. Just talk to her and keep talking to her. Maybe for awhile even stop hanging out with her boyfriend so that he can talk to her as well.

Because of your past you may be misreading his having a bad day as something personal between you two.  He may be going through something you know nothing about.  Ask him if he is okay.  He may need your kind thoughts and that's why he was sending signals.  Don't let the past cloud you judgment.  If you value the friendship give him the benefit of the doubt.

As much as I hate this answer, I'd say this is one of the few times a gift card is appropriate.  Since you don't know her real well at this point, a gift card to some place she likes is a safe bet, that way she can get what she likes.  Maybe you can even go with her when she uses it so you can see what she picks out for herself and that way you get to know her better. =)

Gift cards are always good. If you think it's too impersonal....you could put it in a little basket or gift bag w/ a few goodies from Victoria's Secret. Their makeup and lotions are always on sale (lip gloss, eyeshadow, glitter powder). Just a few things to dress it up.

You should strike out clothing/shoes because you don't know her very well, and its kind of embarrassing if she can't fit into them.



The safest choice is a necklace or a really nice pair of earrings. It is, however, a little bit too "safe", like you haven't put too much effort into it.



Maybe a personalized gift card can spice up your present. Good luck!

In here, some teenagers like me can respond.
Ask some mutual friends that you both have.
Try to get to know her with the little time you have by looking at her Facebook/MySpace and other accounts (sort-of sneaky way).
Try to remember some details about her-hobbies, favorite stuff...etc.
It really depends on what type of girl she is.
Of course, we won't know much about her more than you do.
Trust your instincts. Also, isn't being there on her special day enough? I know it's kind-a cheesy, but it's true. She should appreciate that, but I know that a gift make something more special, so you stand out among others who were invited and came.



Some ideas are...
-help with the preparation
-look at teenage clothing stores/accessory shops...etc
-treat her to a salon, movie, concert, mini trip...etc
-make something personal like a crafts/cards...etc
-prepare something for the event like a performance



Have fun at the party! :]

(3) talk to her about it aha, or see what she weares and get her clothes :)
(4) try to visit her house and room.. and look at what she likes
(5)  if that all doesnt work , give her a gift card at a store that sells most things of all kinds.. =)



Hope she liks the gift. :)

Ex's best friend mixup?



I just want to get your opinions on something. My ex and I have been apart for about 3 months whom I had strong feelings for and the relationship went great until he decided things changed. A little after the last time I saw him during the summer (a mutual friend's bday yes I was looking goood) his best friend (mind you has a girlfriend in which he knows I know as well) who he loves so much starts chatting on aim with me like almost everyday. He has nothing for me yet he keeps asking about my life and how's my new man doing? I just play around and say he's fine tho there isn't one but What do you guys make of this?

I guess everyone hates it when someone is ignored by others....it is just one of those natural feelings!
But then, one needs to control ones emotion at that point of time and don't show it to the outside world of how u are feeling it inside.

Why don't my girlfriend friends like me?



I'm a junior in college and so is my girlfriend.  Last year, she had a group of girls that she use to hang with.  The same year "they supposingly turned bisexual"then.  My and my girlfriend started dating three months ago and those friends don't contact her when she do things but my girlfriend tries to hang with them.  One of the females told my girlfriend that "I changed my girlfriend".  Lately, the girls walk pass me on campus saying things like "hmm, look at him, he looks just like her" to each other and laugh...very immature. Yesterday, they walked pass me and then they saw my girlfriend on the other side of campus and started screaming her name and telling her that they saw me "over there"

They don't sound worth worrying about.  LIke you said...very immature.  I know it's irritating and especially affects you because it affects you girlfriend so much.  But all you can do is ignore them and make new friends as a couple with others.  Move on.  They are idiots.

I think my gay friend likes me, and it's getting freaky... what do I do?



Ok so I am a 19 year old completely straight guy, I have a really hot gf, and I am not a homophobe... If another guy is gay, it's cool, we can be friends, but I always make it clear that I AM NOT GAY. So I am friends with this gay guy for three years now, we went together to highschool. We were good buddies, but he was never in my close group of friends. However, since highschool ended in may this year, he has been really enoying me. He is sending me an sms like once a day atleast, and I started avoiding msn because he will always chat with me if he notices me. And it's not a normal conversation... he usually starts with something random, and then goes on to how he misses me, how we should hang out more often and so on... I told my girlfriend, and she said that he is just lonely, and perhaps needs friends. I was open to that idea for a while, but then he totally starts telling me that he likes me alot... I say, like a friend, right? and he says, you are more than a friend to me. And I say, YOU KNOW THAT I AM NOT GAY AND THAT I HAVE A GF, and he starts ohhh no I did not mean it in that way bla bla bla... So how do I get ridd of him, or how do I make him stop making these comments like I LIKE YOU ALOT

I think you need to realize that some gay men are more "sensitive" than straight men.  When he says you mean more to him than a friend, he could very well mean it, but not necessarily in a sexual way.  Gay men are often more like women in their emotions and personalities (I guess that's why they are gay?).  If you wouldn't be upset if a female friend said these things to you, don't take offense when he does.  Unless he starts to try to get touchy/feeling then just take the relationship like any other friendship you have, maybe he is a little needy of friendship on top of his being a feminine gay guy.
Good luck and God Bless.

I seem to get treated like this alot and I'm a nice friendly person:(?



I bump into my old tutor a bit outside of college. Its always just a coincidence that it happens, which I find rather funny. The last time I saw him, I had turned to my left to walk to the train. As I did this i noticed him do the same (walk away from me). I hadn't noticed him there. When i got out of the train, he had rushed ahead of me and down the same exit I was meant to take. When I came out to the street he was walking pretty fast but looking over his shoulder all the time. I let him get his 'distance'. I thought that it may be because he was freaked out or thought that i may be following him, but that still doesnt make sense to me. He then made what looked like a last second decision and turned into a building. In the past he had walked straight past me and just looked straight ahead of him- not say anything/ look at me. Its like hes avoiding me. I've seen him staring at me blankly once or twice before. He once ignored my input into a group conversation. He was talking to my friend and when i added something, he didn't even look at me! He had shown me a nice side of him by offering me help once but kept telling me why he was helping me and I think it might be because i was upset about my marks. I know he is a little shy but this behaviour?? I can't get what I may have done wrong to him and this bothers me. Why would he do this? What if I get him for another class?
This is not the first time I have noticed him act like this towards me.

People are extremely stupid fighting does not solve anything. Come backs can sound stupid too so you dont want to sound like the bigger person pulling one of those off. This girl I hate said to me while we were argueing "btw; You look like a bird doing that" You really think that was a good come back? No hell no, I could have said you look like a fat cow. But i was the bigger person and just laughed.



Laughing when someone is trying to hurt you always bothers them. It makes them realize that what they have to say doesn't bother you.

I Don't Want to Be Friends?



Ok, so there is a guy in my dorm I just don't want to be friends with.  I'm sure he's perfectly nice, I just don't like him and don't want any more friends.  The problem is, I have no idea how to convey this without being rude.  I've been using the "I'm busy" excuse, which is true and will be true until I leave in a few months, but I don't know if it's working.  He's in my hall, so I really can't avoid him completely, try as I might.



Basically, I just want some advice as to how I can let him know I don't want to be friends without it being really uncomfortable.  I'm sure that's impossible, but has anyone handled a similar situation successfully?

Yes it would be nice for you to still give her a card. Even though your helping with things, a card will be something she can look back on and remember what a great friend she had there with her at her time of need.

You don't have to but your friend might appreciate a little note telling her how much you care and that you will be there for her. Little things matter at times like this.



I still have the cards friends sent me when I had a stillborn son. I read them every year on the day of his birth and death and remember all of the support I got during the most difficult time of my life.



Hope this helps.

Well first of all don't be trying to stand up to people if you can't fight. You need to buy a taebo tape and some boxing gloves before you say or do anything. Over all, say what you feel when bullies come around but, listen to your conscience. I don't know your whole situation so just use good sound judgment. Ignoring them doesn't work. So, you have to do something.

My trick is just be really nice to whoever is bulling you. My grandfather always said that if someone is bulling you, you should kill them with kindness. If you are really nice to them and show them that they can't get you upset it really makes them feel mad at first and then it makes them feel stupid because they can't get you upset and they are just wasting their time. It as always worked for me!

don't flinch, turn to your side, as soon as someone starts crap w/you crush his balls. when he's on his way down kick him in the face. his buddy's (if there are any) will be shocked. hall *** while they're standing in disbelief. you have to get the mind set..it's me or him. the human has a survival mode and you control it. if he's by himself don't stop kick'in *** until he says he's had enough. DO NOT STOP.you have the upper hand. make sure he does not jack w/you then and there. YOU have to deside when you've had enough. until then they will continue on because they know you'll do nothing. prove 'um wrong.

Wear slick lip gloss, make sure it's not sticky!
Mints.



And when it comes time for the kiss, make sure you tilt your head because bumping noses can be so embarrassing.
And if you really trust him, why don't you tell him that it's your first kiss? That's what I did and my boyfriend thought it was so cute.



Go with what you feel, you think that it'll be awkward no matter what, but if you guys really like each other it'll go fine.

HELP! HELP! HELP!! has this ever happened to you? SUPPORT NEEDED! ?



ok, well.[  i'll use letters instead of names. ]



ive never really felt like ive fitted in at school. and i dont know why. year seven and eight started off really bad, but by year 8 and 9 i was hanging out with a group of friends i felt comfortable with. but they started to annoying me because they were so interested in their instruments and the school band and i completly hate it but i put up with it and stuff. they were great; fun to talk to but all they spoke about apart from fun interested convosations and jokes; was band.



so this year; i thought that although i love them, i cant go on like this; so i kinda ventured out. a new year, new subjects at school (which none of them had) time to meet new people and just get out there.
so this year, me and my friend B sat in the usually spot the 'group' from yr 8+9 sat. and sometimes during last year A, and N, and M came and sat with me and B. and we were talking and stuff. and from then one, i started to sit with A, N and M and so did B for a while untill she went back to the other group. i loved being in this group; they talked about things that i liked; things related to me and just general things we had in common. not so long into the year B2 came and sat with us. it was great, i somewhat felt alright with it. they were all popular and knew all the popular girls and stuff. but we had stacks in common.



for my birthday they bought me flowers, a cake and everything :) which was pretty nice. and we had a formal coming up that month.
for ages, i said i'd organise something, and i did. i collected the money for it and it was good and stuff.
a few weeks after i was sick and hardly at school. but when i got back to school; idk but it felt weird. and i cant explain it.



the group had changed were we sat too whilst i was good since the new spot to sit was more in the sun. and some days they were there, some days they werent. so if i didnt hurry and get my lunch and walk with them down there, i wouldnt know where they were. i didnt say much in convosations, something felt awkward. but none the less it was still ok. this group ALWAYS has their phones with them too, so one lunch time i couldnt find them, so i called one of them and she didnt pick up :S



anyways, so i was like ok somethings up?!
the school holidays are on now, with only 4 days till school starts up again. i txted them all the other day with the same message
"hey(: how are you? hows your holidays been so far? been up to much? xo"
2 of them replied. then i got a txt from B2 saying "lol did (my name) txt you?" and i was like :S was this ment for me or not? so i txt back with a question mark. no reply.



A didnt reply. and B sent me that.
SO WHAT SHOULD I DO? when i get back to school. i have to sit with them and stuff; there's not really much else i can do or anywhere else i can sit. i cant sit with my old group. it would be weird; awkward and worse. do you think somethings up? ah i know some of this doesnt make sense or im not explaining it well enough.



- but i feel like i cant say something.



- i dont know whether they're suttlely ditching me, or not.



- did that txt mean "lol she sent everyone the same message at the same time" or "omg she's txting us. haha asif she would do that. what a loser"



- did they use me for organising something for a while; and now thats over, im over?



- or am i over thinking this whole thing.



i cant just go find another group. everyone has their groups. i have mine. and i cant do that. nor can i change schools or do anything extreme. if i ask "hey is everything alright" they'd be like 'yeah of corse it is' but i dont know wether they would then go to someone else in the group and ***** about me behind my back?!

Hey!
oh my god are you my sister? seriously i have and still is in the same position as you are!! the only thing is my clique group, all they can talk about is boys and how "far" they go with them.



My group is more with 2 other girls though so its just us 3 and we were sooo close! but when i had a week off school coz i was sick, as soon as i came back they left me out a fair bit and at this day i still dont really know why.



Anyway with your friends...when you go back to school and they start to go all "bitchy" and walk off and stuff, follow them. Be louder then them make them notice you. But, if their making it clear to you that they dont want you with them be confident and say to yourself "im better then them" walk into the school bathroom if you have to, look at yourself and smile. Even if you feel like you want to burst out laughing dont focus on the negatives but the positives.



Theirs a saying i go by "fake it 'till you make it" if you fake being happy you will suddenly feel happy.
Okay now, finding new friends can be really challenging but, find out someones msn and add it or their myspace and talk to them. After a while try making friends with that person.



I know how you feel but theirs three things you gotta do:
1. Stay true to yourself --&gt; never doubt yourself and think "if only i was into the band"
2. Smile --&gt; if you see yourself smile you release happy moods in ur body.
3) Be confident =)



I hope i gave you the answer you were looking for and i wish you best of luck!

hi, dont worry i did read the whole thing unlike SOME people! its great that youve finally managed to find a good group who you have things in common with, and maybe just cuz youve been ill for a while you need to catch up on a few things. so keep going for a while, see how things go, and if they dont improve maybe you could have a chat about it. in yr seven, my group of frends ditched me because they sed i was being too clingy, but i just moved on, didnt let it bother me and now were fine again! so good luck, :)

But get through it is the tough part... Stay strong and be yourself, you "friends" don't know what a good friend they will loose if they ditch you... So don't worry, see what happens after a while...Act normal its the best thing to do.... About the txt i am sorry to say but maybe she sent it on purpose, to make you understand that there making fun of you... Good luck! :)

Aww bub, i feel for you, high school can be a b*tch.
Whoever B2 is she's not someone you want to be friends with.
She probably meant to send it to someone else and was thinking of you so sent it to you- either way these girls have been talking to you behind your back, and it sounds like the 'omg. she's texting us. what a loser.' (sorry i am so, so sorry)
Anyway if its the holidays why haven't you seen them if they are your friends?
So i would suggest that even if they are ditching you you have to find the at the start of lunch and sit with them because you can't just randomly sit with a new group.
Sit with them, and then try and find a new group and hopefully in a few weeks you can sit with them?
Good Luck!

you are going nuts.



love ya is not the same as "I am deeply and passionately committed to you" or "I have great affection for you".



I think the word "love" has so much emotional baggage attached that it is nearly meaningless, and must be abandoned for better communication.

If he said Love ya, then it is just in a friendly way. If he would have said I love you then it would have meant something a little more serious. Love ya is just a casual thing friends who are strictly friends say to each other.

Your not going nuts. But he may just mean it as a friend. Or, he means it as a hint that he kind of likes you.
Talk to him a bit more and it will become clearer what he means by it. Your friend probs just said 'no' cause your getting some male attention which she might not be, not to be rude or anything but that's what it sounds like. next time he says 'love ya' just say it back if you like him and see how he reacts. if he starts saying 'love you' or maybe even 'ly' that would sound a bit more like he fancies you.
Good Luck with everything =]

Well, to me, giving up is like, let's say you're in a relationship and it hits a snag so you hit the road.  For instance, your boyfriend is a bit of a flirt and flirts with someone else, but he's not a cheater, just a flirt.  It makes you mad so you dump him there and then.  Likewise, it could be a friend who is always broke and borrowing money.  They don't pay you back, so you dump them as a friend.



Accepting the way it is means that you realize your bf is a bit of a flirt, but that you know he's not a cheat.  This is his personality and you can't change him.  So you accept that this is how he is and then make the decision if this is something you can deal with.  If it is because you are a secure person, then you stay with him.  If you decide you can't deal with it, then you leave.  But after consideration and not in anger.



In the instance of the friend, you KNOW this person is broke and if you give them momey they won't pay you back.  So you accept that this is how they are.  If you give them money, they won't pay you back.  So, you decide if you can afford to GIVE them money (not lend).  If you can, and you can be ok with it, then you do.  If not, you still accept this is how they are and you don't get angry, you just don't lend them any money.



Hope that all makes sense to you! :-)

<question>



Are we more than best friends?



During the last 6 months or so i have gained a new best friend (my male best friend) we talk everyday and he rings me numerous times everyday. ive gotten to know him so much and we have so much in common, i feel like i know him more than my female best friend of 6 years. He makes me laugh so much and he is always on my mind. i don't know if my feelings for him are genuine or its just that h is such an ace person. my other friends say he likes me but that i shouldn't go there because he isn't the best looking person, that doesn't matter to me though. He says things that make me think he likes me but im never sure if hes being serious because he has a jokey personality. Saying this like 'ur fit, ur mint babe, i love you and  sexy' '  (could be as a mate because i do have mates that say things like that). When he talks about other girls that like him he says how he told them hes got his eyes on someone else. (sometimes i think that sumone else is me) i dont know what to make of it all. is he just a very very good friend whos openly flirty or does he actually like me.



also i introduced him to a friend ov mine who he thought was good looking and i tried to set them up but now he says that yeah shes nice but hes not the one he wants, and when i asked who he wants he said he didnt want to say because i might think of him differently..

he definately likes you
See, when you ask a guy who he likes, normally they'll tell you because its no big deal. But if your the person he likes, he'll "beat around the bush" and won't say.
If he's as close to you as your describing, then he does like you
and its good that you like him as a person, not because of his looks.
I say go for it
good luck :)

Yeah, I'm thinking he likes you.  And thats awesome of you to care for a person even when people tell you not to because he's not that good looking.  It's hard to find people like you who don't go for looks but how you're going to be treated in the end.  You seem mature enough to figure it out.  My best bet would be to write him a letter or an email expressing your insight on the situation and asking him if you're the one he likes.  Good luck to you, a best friend is always the best kind of lover...you know what to expect from them and you already know them inside and out.  Keep smiling :o)

i think that offen us girls get the 2 different types of love mixed up...i loved my firend (male) and took it further but later realised that i wasnt in love with him that i just loved him as a friend...i havent spoken to him since...make 100%sure that you like him in that way before you make a desicion...it might be better if you spoke to him and told him your fond of him and that it could be more than friendship but you dont want to ruin the friendship you have ...he might be able to help sort the situation out !!!

it is hard because if you say something you might take the chance of ruining your friendship, but i think you should tell him. life it way too short to second guess and just think if he likes you too......think of what you might lose out on by not telling him. and if he doesn't feel the same you can tell him that you had to tell him and get it out in the open and now it's out there you just want him to forget it, but i bet he likes you too. makes sense, he doesn't want to be set up with anyone else because he likes you. go for it, and good luck! :)

I have a feeling that he's already given you  the answer that you need. He said to you that he didn't want to say whom he wanted because you might think of him differently. I think you should talk to this guy. I have a feeling you both care a lot for each other and if you don't say anything then you could be losing a wonderful guy. Don't be shy to tell him how you feel. And I'm so sure right now that this guy is going to tell you that he has feelings for you. I honestly believe that he has strong feelings for you. And it's not important if your other friends find him attractive or not. The way you talk about this guy I think he's very attractive.

If you have tried to set him up with someone else and he says he is interested in another person I am sure that person is you. You need to make the decision if you want to start dating him or remain strictly friends. Sometimes if you start dating a friend and something happens between you two then it can ruin the friendship. What's more important to you? His friendship or him being your boyfriend?

Those girls that have good guy friends as you said are the ones that most likely mess with guys' minds so the guys stay friends with them until they get what they want.  Or the girl is relating to the guys well for the guys to want to hang out with her.  Translation= they do a good job letting the guys know right away they just want to be friends.  Most guys shouldn't waste time trying to get women who just want to be "friends".

You can't control other people's feelings.  You can only control your own behaviour. Don't flirt.  Treat him like you would treat your brother.  In fact, think of him as a brother.  If he gets flirty or acting like he wants more, then reinforce the "brother" thing.  And if he says he wants more, tell him your sorry, but you love him like a brother.  If he doesn't want to be your friend and stay in touch, then it's his loss.

Well, unfortunately, you can't keep other people from liking you.  You could be really mean, etc, and they may still be attracted to you.  So, just tell them that you only want to be friends- don't lead them on, don't let them pay for your stuff, and don't spend alone time with them that may be considered a date.
But, all-in-all, I would rather be liked by everyone, then to be liked by no-one...

It's harder than it sounds.  If you treat them as if you're not attracted to them, they might think you're just using them for company or a shoulder to cry on, but that they're not an attractive person.  It gives them conflicting messages.  They like you and want to be around you, and then they see you hooking up with jerks.  It can get real old real fast for a guy to be friends with a woman who doesn't see him as good enough for a relationship.  If you want to be friends with a guy, get to know him and form the attachment.  Then start a relationship with him, because he'll be the best guy you can find.  He'll be your friend and he will be devoted to you.  If you don't do that, this guy friend will be miserable and end up hating you or feeling used.

I know how you feel.  I'm just a cool, normal dude looking to make dude friends.  I hate not having any guys to play football with or watch football with...it sucks.  I'm trying to be more outgoing and try to find other dudes with the same interest, but not having any luck at all.  Just try to be more out-going.  You can join a club; but that doesn't always help.

I think it can. A good friend of mine moved over 1,000 miles away and we have made it work. Schedule 1-2 days a week where you either talk on the phone or online to catch up. It's not talking every day, but if you value the friendship as much as I think you do, it's a start.

It is obvious that your friend still isn't over whatever you guys were fighting about. You need to sit down with her and explain how you feel about the way she has been acting towards you and ask her what she thinks you both need to do to solve this conflict between you two. If the trust in the friendship is gone then you may not be able to repair it.

Wow, you are on a situation almost identical to mine...Infact if i dind't know anybetter I would think you were one of the girls in my situation asking the question. haha. Well let me see what I can tell you. I will share with you m experience. Me and 2 other girls have been close for a long time. Well about a year ago one of them started really acting weird. Just changed her personality completely so we were kinda not talking much and stuff but we still were "friends" well we had gotten in fights before and always got back friends but this time we didn't. See ther 3rd girl int he situation and I had a disagreement. And this is the first time we really got into it. And I flat blank told her what I thought and that caused her to start telling the other girl a lot of secrets that were between me and her. Well both girls ended up deleting me from there friends list from a popular website(im sure you can guess) well we are pretty much not friends. And I wish things could be better between all of us but they are not making hardly any moves to grow close again. We are friendly to one another when we see each other but I miss the old times of hanging out with them and all that. However, at the same time I dont trust either of them...Well I dont know if my story made much since because I was trying to type so fast but my suggestion to you is...if you really want to try to work things out, just come out and tell her, Hey look, I know we have our disagreements but I dont want that to ruin our frienship. I want to be close like we use to. If she dont want to then that is her problem. You need better friends than that...I honest feel better off without these girls in my life because they have too much drama in theirs. Suggest going out to hang out or something. You can send me a message of you would like and we could discuss it more. Good Luck!

Are all three of you on a lease?  If so, I'm afraid you're stuck.  Find out when the lease is up, and make arrangements for a new living situation as soon as the lease is up.  If she is not paying her share of rent and bills and you can prove it, you could take her to small claims court to get her to pay what she owes.



If you are not on the lease, you are not legally obliged to stay.  Get out immediately.  Find somewhere else to live.



If the person causing trouble isn't on the lease, you and the other roommate should get together and ask her to leave.  Give her a deadline to get out.  Especially if she is not paying her share of rent and bills.



This is not a good or healthy situation for you to be in.  It's time for you to take control and change it.

If you dont know them, how do you know if they dont like you?  You are not looking for a boyfriend, just go and have a good time. If your friend alienates you (ignores you) because she is so consumed with trying to pick this guy up, then leave.  take two cars.  Then you can go if you are uncomfortable.



BUT, you might wind up with new friend out of it.  Only she can ruin her chances, not you.  GO, have fun.  and if the guys act like jerks, punch the biggest one in the adams apple then run like hell. You wont be asked to go again. :) I promise.

It doesn't matter if you don't go, SHE'S the one that's trying to hook up. I mean whats the point in you being there?



UNLESS you want to be there to "hang out" or to "hook up" yourself.. which I wouldn't understand because they "dont like you"..

Your being used, you do not see this?
You do not know them, they do not like you.



You are no threat to her, if you were she would never, ever ask you to go with her.



It is obvious ("or would it ruin her chances?") you have  good self esteem, do not ruin it by going.

it definitely shouldn't ruin her chances
and if it does then those guys aren't worth it anyways
but no matter what if you don't feel comfortable with going, don't
you won't have fun, and neither will the others around you who will probably sense that you're uncomfortable

If you feel welcome and are interested in meeting them then go. If not, don't. IT isn't your concern whether or not it will "ruin her chances" because she invited you right? Enjoy yourself staying or going :D

sit up straight and project your voice like you want everyone to hear it but not in a pompous or rude way more like a "hey, this is what i have to say, wanna listen ?" way. i know what its like to try and say something and to have people converse over you like yoiu didnt even say a word at all, it feels horrible,
i9t takes time to become one of those people who this never-hardly ever happens to. just think about what your're saying carefully. understabd it, and make sure you say it right.

This is a hard one as I have struggled with it too (I feel your pain).



Here are some tips:



1. Know your audience.  Some people will be rude and hopeless no matter what when it comes to civilized communication.



2. Know your subject.  People can detect when you are faking it and will be turned off by it..



3. Know yourself.  Odd behavior, ticks, and uncourteous behaviour on your part can lead to turn-offs.



Hope this helps.

the funny thing about people is that 90% just want to be heard.  to be interesting to others, be interested in them.  my dad always said that to have a friend you have to be a friend.  Thus, ask others about themselves, what interests them, what they do in their down time.  when you do speak, talk from the heart, know your subject and be honest in how you answer.  If you dont know then own it and just say you dont know.

"friend" problem? what do i do?



okay.
well, this girl i know, from my group of friends, recently got extreamly thin.
okay, i know this girl...who i "think" is still in our little clique. but recently, im not exactly sure.
she wont return my texts, she deltess my you tube comments, and im pretty sure she blocked me. and its not just me she does this to. its quite a few people.
im not exactly skinny. but im not that huge at all.
im starting to think her only motivation is that she is too cool for me now :(
but then, today, i looked at her youtube page, and i saw her friends list. me and my friends name our friends and wat he love about them. she only had four. only one was from our group, one was from a more popular group, and one was her cuz, and one doesnt go to thisschool.
im wondering what i could have done. ive sent her friendly emails, ims, comments, texts, saying hey, whats up, i love your new hair, and congrats on the weight loss, but shoker, she doesnt respond.
I have school on wed, and i dont know how to face her. what do i say? do i idgore her? and advice on what i sould do, or what i could have possible done?
thanks SO much. ;)

it sounds like your friend may be going through a hard time...
or she just may think its time to move on from you guys and is going about it the wrong way.

maybe she has an eating disorder and is having a hard time with it and thinks you wouldnt be friends with her if she told you.

i think you should just try to talk to her face to face.

if she doesnt want to be your friend anymore, its done. just try to talk to her. ask her why she's acting the way she is. if she freaks out or says nothing is wrong, you know something's up. have you talked to your parents about your friend?

maybe she does think she's too cool for you, but the problem might be deeper than that.

if you haven't done anything to her and she's ignoring you for no reason, that may be because something is wrong.

just talk to her. theres nothing to lose.

good luck ;)

you probably giving her too much-in another word-youre trying to hard and not giving her space. Its lovely to have message, comments etc but not everytime -you losing the value of those things. 
She probably like you at first as a friend but she might lost interest (especially if she's independent)- all this thing drown her.



my advise, play it cool now and if she like you, she'll come around, if not, let it go.

Well if they have a crush on you they most likely will be all over you when your on your own.
If his friends are there he will treat you like dirt, tease you and generally act like a git. 
If he's in love with you, he will currently be adding the finishing touches to his shrine of you complete with candles and a lifesize cardboard cut out of you, wish he sings "your the wan that i want" to everynight :)

How can we get rid of this kid?



Me and my friends have been hanging around with a kid who is 4 years younger than us for around 3 months now. He seemed to have invited himself into the group because at no point did anyone want him to be there. We have all tried to get rid of him by doing many things - including actually telling him that we do not want him to hang around with us, swearing at him and one person actually went so far as to punch him in the head...But he's still here.



It may sound like we're being a bit nasty, but really he has provoked us to do it. He regularly insults everyone, changes a discussion to something he wants to talk about and generally does anything he can to annoy us. He knows very well that we don't feel comfortable around him but he just won't leave. We don't wish to ask a teacher as from what we have done in anger, we know we're going to end up in trouble.



I hope people can help us with this problem!

Have you ever stopped to think that you may be the only person this kid has? Sometimes there are things behind the situation or going on at home that you could never know about. I'm not saying to suck it up, but there is no excuse to be rude or physically hit another person. I don't know why that kid woud choose to be friends with you anyway.

Well, you can stop texting at night then! aha
Just think before you text
think about what you could possibly be doing for the future by sending it
make sure you realize just WHO you are texting too
maybe you can write yourself a note so you remember, no!
or you can write a list of all your dark secrets and keep it near you when you text so you remember what NOT to send aha.

My best friend is leaving=*[?



my best friend is joining the marines. he wants to be in the mechanics field, and he leaves september 2nd. I've been like, in love with him for 3 years. Right now I'm not crazy about him, but I dont think im over him, either. But even so, he's the best guy friend i could ask for, and he calls me his best friend ALL the time, we are wicked close. Between now, and the time he leaves, we may only be able to hang out once. I'm hoping i can see him off, but idk. he means a lot to me, and he's leaving=[ I miss him from not seeing him for 2 weeks, and I know it's just gonna get worse. has anyone been through a situation like this before? I would like to hear your stories, or any advice you may have even though I know there really isnt anything i can do.....this is wicked hard on me.

I did go through the same thing the summer I graduated from high school. It was very hard, and I probably didn't handle it the way I should have. But in hind sight, I have learned that, no matter what you do, it's gonna hurt! First, I would support him in whatever he wants to do! Even though that's the tough part cuz you want to make them stay! Second, it gets really lonely in the military, especially basic training when they are missing their family and friends.  Send him away with a little care package. Some pre-stamped envelopes and paper, maybe some cookies, and such. Some little things to remind him of you, and that he has someone who is cheering him on from home. This did wonders for the guy I knew, and his morale. Also, i and when he writes, make sure to write him back! And don't get discouraged, if you start out getting a letter, or 2 a day, then it starts to drop off... This happened to me, but I knew things were getting more intense for them, and he couldn't keep in touch as often... I don't know if this was helpful, but at least you can know you aren't the first to go through this. And, it will get easier, as time goes on. Plus it's not like he is going away forever! He will get passes and leave to come see you!

I would make you remove it immediately!  I would be extremely disappointed!

Forgiveness is offered to someone who is remorseful for their actions.

I HOPE you haven't done it yet, you sound like someone who knows the difference between right and wrong but wants to test her parents. "Intentionally disrespecting your parents is wrong".



Parents don't make up rules to just get there own way, it may seem that way but the fact is they are responsible for you.  If you get an infection and have to go to the hospital are you going to pay the bills?

Don't do it! Forgiveness is something that you should ask for only if you are truly sorry for something you did; and well you ARE NOT sorry.



You see that this will upset your parents and you don't care. Don't you think that maybe, just maybe they might have a reason.



Seriously why don't you wait a little while. I wanted to pierce my lip, then the next week it was my eyebrow, the week after my nose. Eventually I didn't get any of them and I'm actually a lot happier that I didn't.



If you really want to stand out from the crowd, why not try being an individual and not be one of those people/kids who try to rebel against their parents to show how independent they are.



Show respect to your parents and you'll be respected by your peers for it. You could actually make a difference in the lives of your friends and the people at school for being respectful rather than the average run of the mill rebelling teen. Just think how cool that'd be to see them slowly start emulating you and how you treat your parents.... Now that's power.

I'd make you take it out, hand over the jewelry and then ground your butt for the rest of the year.



Seriously grounded. No phone. No going out with friends. Certainly no car. And I had better see some awesome grades at school if you ever hope to be un-grounded.



If you want a lip piercing, prove to your parents how responsible you are and how much you deserve the privlage. Don't sneak around and do whatever you want in spite of their wishes.



If they can't trust you not to stick a filthy needle into your lip and endanger your health, how can they trust you with anything else?? How can you be trusted with the car? How can they know you're really at your friend's house and not getting into some stupid trouble? Just exactly how are your parents going to deal with knowing that you don't care what they think is best for you and that you will do whatever idiot thing your friends are doing?

Please have some respect for your parents and for your own safety. If you REALLY want a safe and healthy lip piercing, then work with your parents to get one. Show them how responsible you are being by AVOIDING the dangers of piercing your lip yourself. Show them how you can get awesome grades and have fabulous behavior even with a lip piercing. Let them know that you are aware that it may have to come out for future jobs. Show them illustrations of how a lip piercing can be hidden or how tiny of a mark they really leave when removed.



If you want the privlages of being an adult (like getting pierced), then behave like one. Being a sneaky teenager is only going to get you treated like a criminal and a baby. Let your parents see your maturity and your commitment to getting a piercing done correctly.

A memento, something she will treasure. Do her parents have any video, tape of her, as  i read somewhere that companies can transfer all old footage, onto DVD of childhood, teenage years, any of the person, and so you could give that as a memory of her younger years and all the ones to come, which hopefully will be happy.

Most people would probably say Wine, but since I am against wine, beer all of that, I suggest something she will treasure forever. Something that shows that you gave it to her. How about one of those picture frames that move. Then you can upload all of the pictures onto it. Like you could add pictures of her and her family, her and her friends,her and her pets, fun times she has had with people. I hope this helped.

Am I boring or do I need to meet new friends?



Hi there,

I don't seem to enjoy going out much anymore but I think it maybe the people I go out with. I generally go out with my boyfriend and his mates. This is usually blokes and girls mixed together. I get on with everyone alright but I feel I don't really belong with them. When it's me and my boyfriend we have a great time and have fun and I don't get bored. I find though with his group of mates that I get bored easy and they are not into the same things as me. The girls are really hyper and giggly and love getting recked. They can stop out in the pub all day but a couple of hours in the evening and I've had enough.

Have I got a problem or do I need to meet some people that like to have an intelligent conversation and not have to be pissed to enjoy a night out. I don't want to seem that I am looking down at people or I'm a bore but I just don't find all this stop in the pub all day all the time stimulating.

You definitely need to make some friends of your own. Preferably some who enjoy things that are a bit more interesting than those who think getting piss drunk is an actual activity. Frankly if I had to choose between pub crawling and stopping at home for the evening I would chose home and a good book! There are so many things to do, like going to a show or an art exhibit or......

No you aren't looking down on them, you are simply different. They sound quite boring and static and THAT is a bore. So go out with mates you have more common interests with and just stop with them once in while to be polite.

You just need to meet new friends who enjoy the same things as you. I dont like going down the pub and getting drunk either. I occasionally go with my friends, but they go clubbing etc without me as I dont like it. We also go the the cinema and stuff as well so its the best of both worlds. Just be yourself and find other people you can share different things with.

Should I take legal action against my friend???



My girlfriend and I are going on holiday in October.  Her brother is coming too.  My parther asked her friend to come.  We all booked out time off from work and I booked and paid for the holiday.  I have been trying to get the money of my partners friend for 9 weeks now and there is always an excuse.  Now she has told us she can't get the time off work and she is not paying.  We cannot get anyone to go and now I face losing over £300.  Shall I take action as I have texts from her to say she is going and she will pay on this date etc.....

It probably wont work.  As far as I know just saying someone is going and then them backing out is not a legal action.  If you didnt know her, you probably should have gotten the money from her first before you paid for her without knowing her.  if anything, you need to go to your partner and get the money from him then since he invited the girl along.

yesgo to the small claims court, you can put a claim in online if you have a fixed amount you wish to claim.

make sure in your statement you are very specific about dates and times of texts, conversations etc. include any witnesses.

or could you try and get some of the money back. usually 8 weeks before the hols you can get a percentage back

I guess the texts are proof of a verbal agreement,so you probably could. Most judges like to see a signed contract of sorts, however. And maybe you could try to work this out of court?? If not, then she does owe you money, and you should at least chance it in court. Good luck, and some friend! Hope you get your money!

I would tell your partner to call her and tell her you need the money by tomorrow....no excuses.  Tell her you will meet her at a certain place at a certain time.  Explain to her that you fronted the money for her to go and that this in unacceptable.  Be firm but you don't want to burn bridges if you don't have to.  Give her another shot and then take the next step.

It's unlikely that you have a strong enough case to definitely win the money back from her, and even if you did it wouldn't be worth the time and trouble of going to court.



Plus, you put your partner in a very awkward situation of having to split loyalties (support you?  rat on their friend in a courtroom?)

Call the friend and tell them flat out, "I booked your reservation because you gave your word that you were coming.  You can come, or you can find someone to replace you, or you can pay me back in full in cash by the end of the month.  It's your choice, and no hard feelings, but you need to live up to your end of the bargain one way or another."

It is helpful if you have an interest in an organized school activity, where you will meet people who have similar interests. Like if you play sports, of course there's an in. Or choir or band or drama. Or yearbook/photography, or chess or AV. Try not to act like you aren't interested in other people, try to be engaging, talkative. You'll do great. Lots of people are interested to meet new people and some are sick of their old cliques by the time junior year rolls around. Consider yourself fresh blood in the gene pool.

Maybe if there is someway you could set a certain part of your house for more people.

For example if you like to sew... maybe have enough sewing supplies and seats and a table etc for more people. Then maybe somehow find some other people who like to sew and it could be sort of a group, like a routine get-together at your house for sewing.
Something like that.

If you don't think you have enough friends, I'm sure you could find a place where other people your age go. You could go there for a short while to make some new friends.

And... *sigh* I hate to say it but... Church might actually be a good place to go too.

Well I hope somehow this helped!

why talk for free?  were you planning on paying someone to be your friend? weird way to put the question.

But anyways, try taking some classes at the adult school, they usually offer them at the community college in many cities.  There are also craft stores that offer classes: Joann's Fabrics,  Michael s, etc.  You would make some friends there, and then you could invite them out to lunch.

to all this, where is your husband? I suppose he is too young to be retired.  So for now you should plan really fun stuff to do on weekends when he is off from work.  Marriage should be fun, but only if you make it fun.  Be the one to initiate things, plan fun things for the both of you to do.  Look in the city paper for events going on that you think you would both enjoy.  Go out and have fun.

You may have some buried resentments that you prefer not to think about, and haven't dealt with. So there is freefloating irritation that can be triggered very easily. When you get into a mood, warn your bf and stay away from him. Meanwhile, think of what these resentments could be and how they could be dealt with.

At least your honest with yourself and realize when you are moody. When you feel it coming on, walk away and take some deep breaths. Most women don't realize what their doing and the guy is just a a-hole and doesn't give a crap. Men are black & white on everything. When need answers and not excuses. Like when a guy asks his girl " What's Wrong " and the responce is " I Don't Know ", what kind of answer is that. When something is wrong with a guy, they know what the hell's wrong. Give yourself time to practice on controlling your moods. You may have to go to the doctor for medication to help your mental state. Women go through this sort of thing all the time. Their chemistry changes every month and they need to be aware of what their body needs. At least your trying to improve your relationship. As you have read in YA, many of these women just want to dump their man for someone new thinking that will solve the problem !

What does it feel like to be in love with a guy?



I currently have this bestfriend of mine and I know hes straight, which I do know guys that it wouldn't work. He currently lives 15 miles from me because we met at college doing our A Levels, but everytime we are not near each other I feel lonely ect. Is this Love? and if so how do I get over my feeling for him, because I know I shouldn't be in love with him because hes straight. Am I the only one that has experienced this or does it happen all the time to people. Please help!!!!!!!!

Hi Nick,

What you’re feeling might be love, or it might be a crush, but the fact that you know it will never work with this guy because he’s straight, might be causing the sense of loss you feel when you’re not near him. You’re definitely not the only person who feels like this, falling for friends is a common occurrence! You can read an article on TheSite.org about being in love with your best friend here:
http://www.thesite.org.uk/sexandrelation...



You can’t fall out of love with someone over night, so only time can help get what you’re feeling into perspective. There’s no right or wrong way to deal with how you feel for your friend, but you might find it helps to talk the issue over with another friend, or with a helpline such as the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard (Tel: 020 7837 7324).

What about getting to know some more gay people? Making contact with other gay and bisexual people is usually easier than you think, and before you know it, you could be in love with someone who feels the same way about you!

Even though it can seem daunting to work out where to go, most large towns and cities have pubs and clubs that have specific gay nights. This doesn't mean your straight friends can't come too, it just gives you more of a chance to meet other gay people. There are many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) youth groups run locally and if you're at uni, you'll probably find they have a LGBT group, as well. You might like to search Gay Youth UK to find a group near you: www.gayyouthuk.net

All the best.

Crisis? Middle age crisis at 16? Whiny lame kid? Who cares? Can someone please help?



I don't really know what to say. I'm really not feeling sorry for myself. I just feel so..I don't know, I guess depressed lately. I'm only 16, and I know most of the answer's I'll get is "Your young, you have your whole life ahead of you." or "Get over it, your young, everyone goes through tough times.". Anyways, I'll get to the point.



Since last year, I've just been feeling a bit depressed. I started smoking and smoking weed. I started doing shrooms once and a while, but I'm trying to stop everything. But it's not easy when the only few friends you have only want to hang out if your smoking weed. I always feel like ****, I don't have any close friends, and I don't have any close family. I just feel like when I graduate, I'll be an average joe with an average job, and no one I work with will know me. I don't feel like I'll be remembered by anyone. I used to be who I wanted to be, I used to have friends, and then I got into the wrong stuff. And now I'm growing up to be my dad. I ******* hate my dad. I don't get good grades in school because I don't try, and now I ****** my life up by taking the lower level classes. I can't switch out of them and take regular ones unless I go back and take the regular grade 10 classes.



There's this girl that I've liked since grade 6. We don't hang out in the same groups at all. We really only talk on msn or text eachother, but we have hung out a few times. Sometimes I think she likes me, but then she always seems annoyed with me. I never told her I like her, but I think she knows. Anyways, I'm friends with this other chick, and she went out with this guy named Dean. She said Dean was a douche, hes a huge stoner, drinks alot, and he is always just trying to get laid. And guess what, he's going out with the chick I like. I wouldn't say I'm jelious at all, because I don't think I have a chance with her, but its just that she's been baked once, and I really don't want her to start getting into the stuff I do. I don't want her getting drunk and having sex with him either! I don't know, I've tried to move on, but when I try to stop talking to her, or get my mind off her, I get a text from her or something. Before people start saying anything like "Don't go after her, shes not worth it" or "You wont even remember her". I know theres a very slim chance she will be in my life in a few years. But before shes out of my life, I want to be in hers.. She really isn't trying to get into that stuff, and she tries really hard to not let it happen.. And I know I can't control what she does, I'm not trying to, I don't want to, if I could control what she did and everything, she wouldn't be special. Heh, that sounded so lame, but whatever.

Lol, well there's my life story. I know it's not much compared to everyone else that posts, but I'd like answers on how to deal with things. If anyone wants to talk on msn or something, ask and I'll add you.



If someone actually read all this, thanks, because I really don't think alot of people will want to read it.



Thanks;

OMG, that was a boring read. Take my advice - lay off the drugs and booze. No wonder people think youre a loser! Get a life! Go out get A haircut, go to  a gym, take pride in yourself! 
Appearances are everything and it sounds like you dont give a **** about yourself so why should anyone else care??
Pick yourself up and be your own best friend. Once you vhave  sorted yourself out everything else will fall into place. Stop feeling sorry for yourself - there are people far off worse than you and they try so why dont you?? GET OFF YOUR ***!

Well you can really talk eh lol. Well it looks like your having normal teens. The first thing I will ask is do you want to do well at school know? If you do, you'll have to start trying. And as for drugs, seriously there not worth it at all. I've been there and regret everything. I didn't want to do well at school either because I wasn't interested in learning. Everyone around me had brains sort of, and they didn't really have to try. So when they were influencing me to start smoking, drink and take drugs I was the one losing out not them and thats not fair.

See when you get a job its better not to know anyone, because they don't know your history and you can be who you want to be and they'll like you for it. Also people in the working world are mostly grown up, mature.

The mistake I made was trying to please my friends and not myself. But I changed after left school, and know I'm doing better than them and when I see them I can smile and laugh at them actually for being such wasters. I do keep in touch with a couple of girls I hung around with, but that only happened a few years after school when they had time to grow up and see that drugs etc was stupid. Although there are still some who are still wasters.

What I'm trying to say is see when you leave school everything will be different, you won't work together or hardly see each other and what there doing won't matter because you'll prob make new friends at your new job or college class. It's all great for meeting new people. But when you do, do YOURSELF a favour be yourself from the start and you will meet another guy or girl who like you for who you are not who you think you should be to please someone else.

As for this girl you like, like you said you can't control what she does so if your not her type then the two of you won't get together. I know thats hard to hear because you really like but its true, you cant force her to do anything and it doesn't sound like you two are close enough for you to even have a say.

I have to say though the fact that she txts you and talks to you is a good sign, its not like she doesn't know who you are. She sounds like he type of girl who likes a bad boy but that won't last I promise. She'll grow up too and realise the guy she's with is a loser and she'll lose interest. But unluckily for you it probably wont be soon.
But on the other hand maybe shes gona be a loser and I'm telling you, she will listen to no one she will do want she wants as long as SHE wants to do it. Put it this way if someone you knew was telling you to stop smokin etc would you do it or even listen if you were enjoying it, NO!!! I know I didn't, but don't worry nearly every human being is the same.

I will give you a suggestion just try to be her friend and if shes not happy with this guy she's with now, wait and when they split up ask her out. Just do it and see what she says, you never know she might like you, after all she does txt you etc why would she do that if she didn't like you. Seriously give it a try if she says no then its her loss.

Or you could always do it now if you can't wait and face the other guy for asking out his girl.

You sound like a really nice boy, and if you really want to change you will, just don't let peer pressure rule you 'SAY NO' and if your friends don't like then let them go in the huff at least you'll be doing what ou want and not what their telling you to do, thats just pathetic.

Good luck hope this helped.

Your probably American but I'd assume you must be able to do something. In Australia you can defer for a year and then apply for university so it dosen't matter so much about your grades. Or else who cares. Be a tradesperson. They make a fortune, dont have to pay for school and you can start your own business. You can find something else to do.

Your 16, seriously buddy. Don't do drugs and drink a lot. They fry your brain, I have seen it, smart people cant think any more so if your not naturally brilliant imagine how much more damage it is doing to you. You do that you will really get no where.

If your so hung up on this girl, just talk to her. But it sounds like she really dosen't like you, so I wouldn't attempt it. Talk to other girls. You will find someone else you like more, someone willing to have sex with you and you will get over her.



Look up the symptoms of depression, if you have many of them maybe talk to your parents and you can go on anti-depressants. Just dont kill yourself. There is no point being so miserable in life. It will just make it harder to get through, and less people will like you because of it. Which will make the situation worse. Maybe try doing some sport too. It will make you feel better and look better.

YES, that's a compliment for sure.  It means people feel comfortable around you, that you're just yourself & don't come over that you're putting on or exaggerate on things.  You're just plain you & don't try to act like anyone else.  You must have the feeling of being comfortable w/yourself, & that's the way others see you also.  Best to you...:)

He always stares at me so does that mean he likes me?



We go to highschool together, but we never talked to each other. I like him and I thought he liked me too. He heard I liked him and now I always catch him staring at me. We make eye contact for 2 seconds or more and when I catch him staring, he doesn't look away. He has this neutral look on his face. He's always with a group of guys so when he stares at me, he detachs himself from the group. He notices me quickly in a crowded room. I noticed he likes to stare at me whenever I'm talking with a guy. My girls always tell me he's staring at me. I always find him standing across from me on the other side of the room. Whenever I walk by him in the halls, I'll look at him and we'll have eye contact for a second and then he'll look away. And when I don't look at him when I walk by him, he'll turn his whole body around staring at me. He had class with my sister (they sit by each other but never talk), and he asked her if I had a boyfriend. But I think he only asked because he seen me with a guy that day. I don't know why he won't talk to me, he doesn't seem shy at all. He tried talking to me on MSN but I never responded. I think he likes me but I have a lot of doubts. What does it mean when you catch a guy staring at you and he doesn't look away? I need an opinion. By the way, we're done highschool now. But I still like him.

Maybe......why don't you try talking to him, get to know him.

You might find out you like him, (or not), but your present behavior isn't improving anything.

Have someone introduce you, talk with the guy.  FORGET MSN, talk with him in person, you'll learn more in 5min than you'll learn in 5 weeks online.

Please help, I don't understand...is something wrong with me?



So my best friend is a guy and I was home alone yesterday for 3 hours so i called him and told him he should come over and hang out while my parents were gone. So he walked over and we were just goofing off and started trying on my clothes. things got really out of hand though... the clothes started getting skimpier and skimpier... and long story short...we "kinda" had sex... i know you can't kinda do that, but (and i'm really embarrassed to say this) I couldn't handle it. I couldn't let him go all the way "in" cause it hurt too bad... (this was my first time and I'm 13) but i didn't feel ANYTHING other than pain...it didn't feel good at all... in fact, i hated it. i hated him, i hated the way he looked, felt, the way he touched and kissed me...i just hated it. Idk if this was cause of the timing, who it was with, my age, cause we didn't do it right...or what. i mean, even though it was wrong i still shoulda at least felt SOMETHING...shouldn't I?



</question>



<additional details>



i know it hurts the first time but i thought it would feel good too at the same time, like almost overwhelming because of the two completely opposite sensations...

Don't do anything you're not comfortable with ever!! It should hurt because of your age and it being your first time. You can try a lot of lube the next time you want to have sex, but don't rush it till you know you're ready. 13 is a really young age physically, emotionally, and maturity wise. Maybe you should hold off for awhile, maybe even a long while, but that's your decision. Just make sure you use condoms, and you can get birth control if your parents take you to a doctor, or from Planned Parenthood (don't think you need your parents). Just make sure you're safe from disease and pregnancy!



Try not to totally hate your best friend, he's not to blame if it was consensual sex, although if he pressured you then you should avoid him at all costs and tell someone. Most likely you were 'doing it right' but you and your body just weren't ready.

When it hurts that's pretty much all you feel, don't be surprised by that. Sex gets better with time and experience, and all the other things that go along with it. Be careful not to let things get out of hand again ever. Only do things you want to and be prepared.

Yeah that's an age thing. It's going to hurt if you have sex when you're that young, simply because your body isn't used to having things shoved up there. Even if you had been older it still would have hurt, as it normally does the first time.

Just remember to only do things you're comfortable with, and try not to let things "get out of hand"- it just creates unnecessary drama =(

Good luck my dear!

tell ur teacher the situation and uno what??



next time it happened since the teacher knows your situation. the teacher would pair u up with sum1 else.



if the teacher doesnt have any influence in pairings/groups how about u speak to her about what she needs to do. tell her u need her 2 do 50% of the work and tell her to show u that she is doing 50% of the work because u feel like she aint doing nething. then obviously she would show u her work and if its not good enough tell her to do more research cos its not as good yet. tell hr its good but u want it 2 b better thatway she wont feel stupid and she would go back and work abit harder on it. and give her some advice on her work.. say she is lacking in 1 area ..then tell her hey i think this bit needs 2 b abit better.



see if that woks. if i doesnt work nxt time just tell her that u feel like ur doing all the work and its nothing 2 do with her but u want 2 b in a group where its more equal

creepy! cut ties with this guy, if you run into him in public, play it off as casually as you can, if he brings up swinging or anything related, just say you and your husband aren't into it and your side business is a private matter that you'd rather not discuss. If he persists after that, he's harrassing you.

Some people are born with it, some people are shy because their parents are shy and sometimes it because of certain upbringing.



I used to extremely shy.  Because I was raised with a lot of restrictions.



I was not allowed to go out and socialize with people and as a result, I became extremely shy. When I was in college, I made the effort to move out of home and resided at my college dormitory.



I attended series of assertiveness training workshop.



I happened to have a good mentor who knew how to help people overcome shyness.



After the series of workshop, I forced myself to put what I had learned into practice.



I kept up with it deligently and that help me become a different person.  Although at times I still feel that I am a little shy at certain times, but it is not as obvious as it was in the past.



In fact, some people whom I recently met could not believe that I was ever shy.



So, make the effort to attend some workshop and force yourself to practice what you have learned.  It takes a lot of effort and you have to be determined.

The answer is both - some people are born predisposed to shyness and life experiences make them shy.  Depending on how shy you are, you can learn some techniques to overcome it.  Someone who is shy because their parents are shy could probably talk themselves into being more direct, having more eye contact, standing up for themselves, etc.  Someone who is shy due to a trauma (alcoholic or abusive parent or something) would likely need some type of psychotherapy to have an expert help them overcome their shyness.



I too am working on this.  There are books on this subject you should look into.  Some of the methods for coping with shyness are CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy); journals; exposure techniques (lets say you are nervous around talking to people, then you gradually start talking to low threat people, over time, move up to strangers, etc.).  Overall, these therapies are considered generally successful in dealing with shyness.

Good luck!

I'm hating school and have no friends!?



I started back at school yesterday, I'd been so bored over the summer and I was also dreading going back. I had only 1 real friend since i've been at my secondary school and she's now left and gone to another school. There's people I know and hang around with but I have no true friends. All the people I know have some really good friends but i'm always left on my own. I have really bad confidence so I dont really have the guts to go up and say hey to people. I dont do any physical exercise because I'm scared of what others will think and i hate not having any friends or anyone to talk to. Its so depressing.

i can relate to that one, i had the same problem, i wasnt really a people person and found it hard to talk to any one, i got bullied alot and had an extremely abusive step dad, when i got to high school i was in the top level for everything. then i got in to drugs because of depression, got homeless and left school without grades. i was called thick, i had one ear bigger than the other, goofy teeth and real bad danddruff, i was a right mutant. thanks to braces, and my ear being pinned back that stopped quite a bit of abuse. so i got to college but as i was still homeless had to work in pig factorys for money, living in shelters, even on the streets etc. and through the rough met some friends who have really helped me. then i joined the navy, past basic easilly, got in to weights and martial arts, and now i do web development and have even done modelling on loads of cash and  married to a gorgeous wife, live in a big house and havent been happier. as for true friends, im nearlly 30 and ive only got 2 mates who have been there all the way and i met them after school. sorry for the rant, but they say school years are supposed to be the best years of your life. theyre not! things will get better but you have to take hold of your own life. it sometimes takes people alot longer to reach their full potential. decide what you wanna do and go for it !!! f@%& eveything and eveyone else!

I'm sure you have no reason to have bad confidence :) 
You could try meeting the people's you hang around with friends? :) Or go to a club (but I know I'd never do that so I know you might not want to either haha)
You could talk to some people from your school on the internet first before you talk to them in real life if your confidence is that bad but I know that can make it harder when you actually do talk to them.
All I can really say is just get some confidence and meet new people :)

if you dont have confidence in yourself just fake it. if you think that you ar a bit over weight then go ahead and work out, who would care. if you dont want people to watch you while your working out then just do it at your house when nobody else is home. im sure that your other friends you hang out with can get closer to you you just have to hang out more often maybe go out for lunch, invite them over to your house, go see a movie, it will closen your relation ship. and dont dred going back to shcool think of it as a fresh start.

hey sorry to hear that you feel that way it will make school really tough for you. 1 thing you need to think if is that its a new school year it will take time to adjust to it, sometimes when your at school you don't always have the same confidence that you have when your an adult. even the most confident of adults will say that at school they lacked confidence. I was a bit like you at school i had no confidence at all but since leaving school i have even done modelling and some of the 'popular' kids have not achieved what i have. You have to try and bring out the confidence in yourself by finding something at school you enjoy doing. Perhaps share your feelings with your teachers and parents, maybe there is something you could get involved in with the right support.don't keep your feelings bottled up but remember that its early days and am sure you will feel bit better soon....good luck

Your problem is this "bad confidence "!!!
You should start meeting others with a positive perspective but with care also!
Don't see the other as an enemy for you, we are all different and this difference is the made up of life, but start accepting those who at least seem lovely (from your perspective), don't tell me that you can't!!for sure you'll get some with whom you share your life..
Don't waste time by thinking!!!

I was the same way at school until I got into high school, all I can say looking back now, is that if you want friends then you just have to go and make some, it is hard and scary to get out of your comfort zone and have more confidence but you have to try you dont need 100 friends just 1 or 2 good friends and if you make more then that it's great just start out slow it is hard being young and in school there are clicks and things but you have to try and feel more confident about your self once you do the friends will come good luck and dont get depressed every one go's threw this at some point in there life it gets better

I have friend issues?



so, i moved to a new state last year and i didn't make many friends except one, we'll call her p.
p seemed cool at first. then her true colors came out. she's a *****, vain, has superiority complex, and basically makes me feel like crap.
she asked me once how much my family paid in taxes.



i hung out with her last year because i didn't really have anyone else. this year, i cut her off. i don't have any classes with her, and my other friend just talks to her in the morning - i pretty much just ignore her, and she's pretty much stopped talking to me, and the lunch period we have together, she doesn't even sit at our lunch table anymore.



umm, today i went on her journal and she was talking about how sad she was that i was ignoring her or whatever, and she was pretty sad about it. she wants it to get better and back to the way it was, and i was pretty sad. she also said that she hates that i barely respond to her and around other people i act normal.



i wish i could confront her face to face, but i really can't because she doesn't do confrontation very well, and she's just make ME feel like a useless ****. last year, she even said once 'who do you have as friends besides me anyway?' she said she didn't need me, and now i ditched her. and she does need me. i really don't want confrontation, i don't want to be off on bad terms, i just don't want to be friends anymore.



i feel bad. but i don't want to be friends with her. what should i do?

The Apologetic Leter.



Writing a letter...a love letter, a friendship letter, or a letter expressing apologetic feelings, can often be as powerful and have as great an impact as saying something to someone in person. A letter is especially appropriate and best if you are very nervous, have difficulty facing the person, or do not live near them. It is wise to compose your letter, do a couple of re-reads so the phrasing and wording is exactly what you want to convey, then let it sit overnight. The next day, re-read the letter, and see if it still says what you want, or if it needs a final drafting. A fresh mind and a fresh emotional state often can make what we say and the way we SAY it very different! Always remember: Once you have written something on paper and signed your name to it, there is a chance it will be around a LONG time. Make sure you can handle the consequences should it be read by others, or by family members in years to come.

my friends treated me bad but they knew no matter how they treated me i was nvr gonna stoop to their level and that they can always count on me.  1 day b4 springbreak i decided to give them their space so that they can realize what they once had in me.  I did it for a month (nvr saw thme nor talked to them ) and they missed me when they finally told me that they wanted me back.  Sometimes u just have to let the person realize how much u mean to them and thats all u can do.  Goodluck:)  for people come and go in ones life but a friend leaves a lasting footprint in ur heart.

Sometimes each of us needs space...hold to who you are...let her work out her STUFF!  Focus on your interest and/or find a focus, study, hobbie, music, dance, watch funny movies...anyway give her a chance to think...she might renew friendship...she may not...her choice.
But you need to relax, turn it around...what if you had issues...would you want to be pressured into doing or liking something or someone.
Who knows...you might discover another friend/s.

Who is right in this argument?



I will use fake names for this:



Ok, In the beginning of the school year Sarah signed up for field hockey for the first time because of her friend Leah and Person Sarah has to give a lot more effort than a normal player because of physical conditions then Person B does not want to do Indian sprints today so she decides to not go and Sarah is upset because they are friends and she signed up for Leah and Leah is trying to change the subject and both of them get in an argument.
Who is right out of this argument?
Please be honest!!!

Sarah is wrong cause she signed up just because Leah was on the team. If Leah does not want to do Indian sprints it is none of Sarah's business.

ok.. first of all, maybe she is the kind of girl who is waiting for you to make the move. You ask her for her phone number, if you like her that is. If you like her, make it known to her... that way if she likes you she will take bigger steps. Maybe she's a shy girl...



A girl can't be the one always asking the guys out, asking for the number, etc. Guys should be the ones doing that.



It sounds like she likes you, but as I said... to find out follow the advice i gave you above. If she doesn't like you, maybe she was just looking for a friend or was being nice, though I doubt this because it does sound like she likes you.



I acted like this when I liked a guy.

<question>



Is cuddling with friends okay? I need some affection?



I'm an 18 year old boy who has never had a girlfriend and I'm hoping to meet a girl soon who I like and can possibly ask out.



I'm waiting for the right girl to come along but I am a guy who is very short of affection in my life. I can only remember a few hugs and they were very quick ones with people who I didn't really know too well.



So I was wondering, if I'm alone with a female friend is it ok put my arm around her give her cuddle when I'm not interested in a relationship with her?



Thanks :)

Cuddling a friend is okay, but make sure she understands what you're about. It's also perfectly okay to hug a male friend, but they too would need to understand that it's not meant as a gay thing ....

<question>



What should I do about the guy I like?



I'm sure this question goes around quite often, but now I really need help. My best friend (who is a guy) and I recently started high school. He goes to a private school in my town, and I go to a high school in a neighboring town (only public school in the area).



For the longest time, I've had a crush on him. My friend Lexi had a crush on him last year at the same time I did. When my best friend (we'll nickname him Jacob) Jacob told both of us that he liked us (we were playing a good game of truth or dare). Lexi was so excited that she kept telling me how much she liked him.



At the same time, I was really head-over-heels for Jacob. I didn't want to start a fight with Lexi so I pretended that I didn't like Jacob. In the end, he was dating Lexi and I was sporting a huge blow to the heart.



Now, I still keep in touch with Lexi and Jacob (who both go to the private school). Lexi is dating some other guy, and Jacob hasn't quite adjusted to school yet.



He's telling me how upset he is, and I don't think he realizes that I really love him. I don't know if I can tell him that I am. What if it's too late?

It's never to late to tell someone how you feel. I think you should just get him alone somewhere and tell him how you feel. I had the exact same problem as you almost. Mine just didn't involve private schools. But anyway, I told the guy how i felt about him and all of a sudden he started smiling at me and said he felt the same way. I of course was shocked because i had no idea he even like me as more than a friend. But long story short, we've been going out for 2 years now. so, i suggest you to try the same thing. :)



hope i helped!!! :)

there's nothing wrong with that, unless you aren't happy with yourself. there's nothing wrong with saying you admire a person.. but be careful on what you like about them.. say you'd admire someone who is good looking and popular, but gets drunk every weekend, you may want to pick someone else to admire.. but if it's used as a tool to better yourself, like by saying 'that person is really nice to everyone, thats a good quality to have' or 'wow he/she is really smart, i wish i were". it may help to motivate yourself.

<question>



Should we forgive him or charge him? Repost!?



I know I asked this before but only 1 person answered and they got all Technical about our computer. I just want to know how we can continue a healthy relationship. Don't tell us if the computer people did anything wrong! That's not my question!



When almost a year ago, my 11 year old son got curious and look at porn(I guess he went to Google and typed in woman n*aked) . We caught him and stopped him. We talked to him and he understood. He was also grounded and got counseling.



Anyway because of the websites we got a really bad virus causing our computer to crash. We lost nothing, but my husband had our pastor (a self claimed computer whiz) to fix it, despite the fact I wanted to call a professional. But our pastor did it. He put up some Anti-Spywear protection and we've been fine until about a month ago.



Pop ups will come up wanting to scan our computer, claiming we have infections but it's a scam to buy a new software (whenever we click on it says "Buy ______"). My daughter (a big computer fanatic) and I (another big fanatic) got really mad. So finally I called a professional. He told me our computer was horrible. That the anti-spywear was NOT helping and that it was actually spamming the computer! We ended up having to get a new one because if we kept it, our computer would crash again and we'd lose everything this time. We couldn't risk it since my husband is a lawyer and a lot of his important documents are on here and I have a lot of pictures saved of our kids on here. So we put all the essantials on disks and put them on our new computer.



However, I'm mad at our pastor, but my husband says it's not his fault, it's my son's. Well yes, it is, if he hadn't looked at the pictures we wouldn't be in this pickle, but our pastor fixed it. And to tell you the truth, he isn't all that great of a computer whiz.



He fixed my Sister-In-Law's computer a little while after he fixed mine and about a month later my brother from Florida came up for a visit (HE'S a professional) and he saw her computer and said "What the hell did he do to your computer?"



Now I know I'm not being paranoid because of that. My sister-in-law and brother are lucky they didn't lose all of THEIR files!



What should we do? Should we just forgive my pastor and never let him do anything to our computer again (and if so how do we do this without hurting him) or charge him for the computer?



Please help!



PS: Sorry if this is in the wrong section!

Why is my best friend behaving like this? Plz help me!!!!! so confused&gt;&lt;?



My best friend who's a girl is acting like a ***** towards me and it seems towards me only. We have been friends for a quite some time but lately every time I talk to her she always gives me this bitchy attitude and she always act like she does not care. For example, today I had some major problems so I was asking her for her advice, but she wouldn't even hear it. Yesterday she had a problem and I listened to her and helped her. I have been nothing but nice and caring to her, and itt just feels that she is trying to distance herself from me. So what the hell should I do? and any ideas why she is acting like this?

Hmm, she sounds like she has issues.
If she wants advice next time, act the same way she did and she how she likes it, and when she asks you what your problem is, tell her that's how she makes you feel.
Until then, maybe you should distance yourself from her.

Is this person playing me for a fool?



I work with this girl at a law firm. (We're both file clerks) I've been here for a year and 2 months. We talk.. everyday and the past few months been having lunch together..almost everyday. I buy. I'm not rich, but I know she has no money. Now, it's almost like she expects it. Except today. She bought. She sees me as her "only true friend".  She tells me these "sob stories" and I can't help, but feel bad. They are usually stories about how broke she is and how her husband wont work. I offered to help her pay her rent. $150. Her husband brought home a puppy. It had worms. $100. At one point she wanted to buy things from ebay, but had no debit card. I offered to put them on my debit card and then she would pay me back. About $300. We laugh and joke and then sometimes she says things that aren't right either about me or to others. I think, maybe she doesn't always know what she is saying. We're not close to the point where we have each others numbers, but I feel like that point is approaching fast. She wants to come together to make christmas baskets for the office. She needs my help and my $$$!  What should I do?



I'm not the type of person to just say no. It's not in my nature.

She seriously is using you for cash, tell her to tell her husband to work.
You could say to her that you are in a bad financial situation right now, and can't loan her any more money.
If she turns tail and runs, you know what kind of a person she is.

How can i help my friend be compasionate towards my anxiety?



Hello! I have an anxiety disorder. Sometimes it prevents me from attending school. My best friend at school doesn't seem to be compassionate towards me if i get panic attacks. She acts as if I want to be an anxious person, when I really can't help it. My mom has tried talking with her and i have tried to explain it to her. She just doesn't seem to get it at all. She acts like I'm abandoning her. My mother and I are going to sit down with her to talk to her to try once again to explain this to her, but i don't know if i can be friends with her much longer if she can't be sypathetic. Any suggestions as to how i can get through to her?

If he is the one who asked for your number and he called you then its a good sign that he is interested in you, the next thing is know him very well, family, work, friends, etc....



But if he gave you his number and he wants you to call him first? Don't meet him that means he doesn't want to make any effort or he probably has other intentions that could lead to danger his not serious...BE CAREFUL.

Take it slowly, it's not everyone who joins online dating sites to find dating partners.Guard Your Anonymity.Ask for a Photo.
You might think you know the person because you have been chatting online or corresponding via email, but remember to use common sense when you decide to connect in person with an online dating pal.You could even request for a copy of a certified ID and have it checked by the local police, it's a little too cautious, but safety i paramount. If you finally choose to meet the person then go along with a friend(s) and meet in a public place on a busy day.Continue meeting in public places, visiting him at his work e.t.c
Good Luck and take caution

It's the Internet. People lie about who they are. If you're going to meet up with someone make sure you are always with another responsible adult. There are way too many cases of abduction, rape, molestation, murder, etc. for both kids AND adults, male AND female. Be wary of who you choose to meet up with in real life, especially if all you know of them is what they tell you over the Internet.

Do you think i handled this situation well?



i'm a sophomore in high school and im taking ap global. a few weeks before, i copied two hws from one of my friends and she got mad cus i didnt rephrase it well. i told her i was sorry but i could tell that she wasnt fully over it. for one hw, one of my other friends asked if i could print out her hw and i made another copy for me. i knew it was wrong and i got into trouble. i'm doing it over to make it up and i apologized honestly to my friend. however, i talked to my other friend i copied 2 hws from because i was getting tired of the weird feeling between us. i asked if i could talk to her personally and we sat down and i asked why she was acting like a b*tch. i told her i said sorry and i'm going to do all the hw i copied from her over again and i asked her what more does she want me to do? she looked a little upset and said she was thinking of telling the teacher but she didnt and she told me i didnt have to do over the hw. i told her it was weeks since this all happened and she should let it go. i kept asking what more can i do. she felt i took advantage of her and i said i would never do that and mentioned that even she said i was sweet and nice. i told her i just needed help and that doesnt mean i took advantage of her. we kept talking and she said she doesnt want to talk about it anymore and told me she forgives me. i kept asking her if she had anything else to say that shes holding back and she kept sayin no and shaking her head and we decided to forget about everything. im so paranoid about most things and i hate gossiping and feel really upset right now even though the teacher forgave me and the friend said she forgave me. do you think she honestly forgave me?

I think if she is a true friend and you were sincere in your apology that she forgave you. Try being really nice to her and try to make it up to her in your own way without bring the situation back up again. The reason you are upset is because you feel guilty. Just be the best friend that you can be for her. And don't copy her work again. All in all it will be ok. It always will work out in the end

Why is she being so obnoxious all of a sudden?



This girl is my best friend, lets call her jess. and i like this boy, let's call him John. So, jess asks john if he likes anyone (keep in mind that john is a big lady's man) He says that he's tied between four girls. And me being one of them. She asked him because she knew i really liked him and she wanted us to be together. She likes this other guy, let's call him edward. The only guy she likes is edward. She doesn't like John, she told me so herself, because there was this rumor that he liked her which turned out to be false. (Then, she told him that she didn't like him that way and, blah, blah) Now, all of a sudden she's all mean to me, or she acts like she wants nothing to do with me, and the only person she's talking to now is John. Just yesterday I told her that i felt like she was spending more time talking to John than i was, and when we're in a big chat on aim with our friends, if he's gone for more then a minute she's freaking out, and when im gone she just goes, where's *insert my name here*. I want to tell her, because she's supposed to be my best friend, but i don't know what to say. We've talked about it at least 2 times before, but i don't know why she's acting all flirty all of a sudden, and it makes me upset. What do i do?

Dont ask her out just yet.



First introduce yourself and get to know her better. Than ask for her number. And if she gives you that, than you have to "okay" to ask her out in a week or so.



If you ask her out without even knowing her name, you might sound too desperate. And she probably wont say yes.

Meghan, "Doing nothing and looking pretty" has a lot of advantages.  But the damage is done, so now all you can do is make it up to your uncool friend.  How?  Use you "hot looks" and make him popular by being seen with you!

How can I stop my Mom from saying that I am weird?



My mom always tells me that I'm weird and want to stand out. I do like to stand out from the crowd but I hate when my Mom tells me that it's weird. Quite frankly it hurts my feelings... I can't just not take everything she says to heart... I know I can't find a straightfoward answer but if you could help.. it would be really helpful..

You need to sit her down and tell her she is hurting your feelings!!  Make it very serious, don't lose your cool by getting angry, but level with her and tell her how much it hurts.



If you are unable to talk to her about it, write her a letter.  Sometimes the written word makes more of an impact than the spoken word.



She will know that you are serious if you took the time to write a letter.



Good Luck to you!!!

Look, every mom calls their kids weird.
my mom even does,
but she never really means it.



And if it bugs you so much, tell her you like your indivitauality and it bugs you that she doesn't appreciate it.
But you are weird, everyone is weird. I'm weird. We all are, but I bet your mom can be weird too,
So you call her something.
I'm not apart of your family so i wouldnt know,
Hope it helps

How do not loose my close friend? This is very depressing... I need urgent help?



Ok so there is this girl i dated for about 3 months. We decided not continue dating because it was kind of awkward and instead just become very very very close friends. like i trust her more than anything. i still love her and care about her and stuff, but only 2 days later, this really annoying fake, but seductive guy that everyone at my school hates picks her up. One of my other best friends who is also very close with her basically got alienated by this guy, and is now turning back to drugs, which she had led him away from. he sees no point in listening to her anymore. Hes trying to do the same to me and its really awful because hes manipulating my friend. I cant fight him because it would make me look bad if i strted it. hes making her change and stuff too. We try to tell her it needs to stop and her girl friends tell her the same thing but she gets really upset and tries to defend him. she exploded in the car the other day on my other best friend about him. hes stressing her out and making her upset. shes changing. People are losing her friendship and its making everyone sad. THis guy needs to die. Anyways, im really afraid of losing her as a close friend and i want to become closer friends at the same time. i want them to break up so everything stops falling apart. I dont want her to be changed into some fake goodie he's making her. she was once the realest person i knew. What do I do???

What should I do about this problem? ?



About 2 yrs ago, me and a person (person X) became best friends. i was really glad to have X as a friend. But last year, X started to steal all my friends, so that they'd like X more than me. Don't get me wrong, but X was a total loser before we became friends. So instead of thanking me for de-loserfying X, X claims that X was never a loser before. This year, X is being a total jerk, and everytime i talk about some of my other friends, X pounces on them and talks to them, so that my other friends will like X more, too. What should I do?

Why doesn't my best friend care when people say that we're going out or something?



Like today this guys goes "Me & Tatiana have it planned, we're gonna lose our virginity tonight... oh yeah! She already lost it to Ryan! (my best friend)" And he seriously doesn't care when people do that. Like people are always saying "Are you 2 going out yet? Or are you just bonking together?" Why doesn't he get offended when people say stuff like that? I personally get really offended when people say we're screwing or something like that. I hate when people say stuff about us being together so why doesn't he care when people say stuff?

Basically, when I left my first primary school when I was 5 or 6 (I am now 14) I lost contact with my best friend. I want to know how I can try and get contact of her again, cause it really breaks my heart to know that we used to be best friends, and we don't know each other anymore.



I know about friends reunited, but you have to be 18, and as I said, I am only 14, so any idea's?



Please help. Thanks :)

Yeah I have myspace and facebook, but there are so many people that have exactly the same name as her without pictures, I found one and she kinda looked like my friend but maybe its just my mind. I live in the uk btw,  thanks for all your help :)

Well, do you live in Canada? If you do then you could search up her last name on 411.ca to get her phone # and/or address.
