Depends on the size of caravan. I used to tow a SMALL caravan behind a 1.5d Vauxhall Corsa no problem - but I wouldn't recommend trying to pull one of those enormous twin-axle jobbies...

Doubtful - the towing weight for your van is 825kg braked, there's not many caravans that light, especially if your van is loaded, you'd also be over the GTW.

Can a new driver have more lessons to improve confidence? (UK)



I passed my test in April, crashed into my gatepost on the day I passed and had a non serious crash in June it was bad enough to shake my confidence and I now feel uneasy and nervous and I just wondered if there is anywhere I could take extra lessons to improve my confidence and skills, I feel stupid and unsure. If anyone wants to tell me there stories that may make me feel better.

You can take the pass plus test- ask your instructor. This includes motorway driving which might help you to boost your confidence. It ws just unfortunate. Just keep going. I crashed into a lamp post a few weeks after I passed and I was gutted but you just have to go for it- being hesitant will make you worse and more likely to drive dangerously and crash! Get more sessions for peace of mind. Hope you feel better soon

I had a few bumps shortly after my test and then lost confidence and didn't drive for 5 years. I'm fine now though, i just eased myself back in. Went for a few drives at night when the roads are emptier and gradually built myself up. yes I'm sure most instructors will give you lessons even if you've passed your test. There's a thing called pass-plus too which i think is like extra lessons after you pass your test and a second test and after you've got it you can get cheaper insurance or something. I can't remember.

I don't see why not - but you are not legally obliged to have someone else in the car with you - why not ask more experienced friends to come along (or your dad) to explain driving situations and how to cope with them.  I've been driving for ages now and I am still learning.  I would recommend the Police driving manual 'Road Craft' as the best driving manual I've ever found.  I'd try that to give you basic car control and just ask experienced drivers for advice.

when i was taking driving lessons my instructor was giving lessons to an old lady who had a licence but couldn't drive - apparently prior to 1963 you didn't have to do a test so she applied for a licence before the driving test was brought in but never learnt how to drive.

so you can take further lessons at your own expense or maybe go out at night time when the roads are quieter to build up your experience.

They can certainly take more tuition indeed. That's what instructors are there for. Most will think that they just teach Learners to test standard, but that is totally false.

A Driving instructor is there to offer different levels of tuition based on your knowledge and personal ability.

The Pass Plus course incorporates two hours of several aspects, night driving, bad whether, and motorway driving. This can only be taken within 12 months of passing the practical car test.

If I was ever stuck or hadn't driven for a while, I would definately call a driving instructor, they can become very helpful.

Hi, May I suggest that you contact BSM (they are the best) for a review of your driving, they will correct any little faults that you have.
 I am a member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists and if you go to the website for them you can buy a copy of Roadcraft, this will be of value to you as it will tell you what you have to do to become a better driver.
 Good luck and don't worry to much, its a mad world out there, but not as mad as the M 25

Any instructor will be glad to help.  You could do Pass Plus or in due course go for the Institute of Advanced Motorists training, but for now just some support and practise with your normal instructor will make a world of difference.  He/she will be delighted, not just because you'll be paying him but also because you've admitted to yourself that you don't know everything - unlike a lot of new drivers.

Bardic - once again, couldn't agree more!

Any instructor will be glad to take someone out who can actually drive, and just wants a bit of "coaching" as opposed ot "teaching".

Everyday we take our life in our hands, and we long for people to take up Pass Plus course, as we can actually relax - slightly, and concentrate more on developing existing skills, and increasing confidence - rather than preserving our own lives!!

Only kiddin - I love the thrill of not knowing if I will come home alive that evening!

Changing tire size with rims?



Right now my tires are 215/60/17.  I am looking at 16" rims with new tires from tirerack.com.  With the bigger rims, obviously I need lower profile tires.  The size tirerack.com recommends with the package is 205/55/16.  Is this correct?  Also, any opinions about tirerack.com would be greatly appreciated.

I think there's something wrong with your data - according to what you wrote, your current wheels are larger that what you are looking at (17 vs 16). Are your current ones 215/60/15? That would make more sense.



If you want the speedometer/odometer to be accurate without have to have it recalibrated, you want to make sure the new tires are approximately the same diameter as the old ones. If the old ones are 215/60/15's, that means they are approximately 25 inches in diameter, as would the 205/55/16's (all of this info is available on tirerack).



Do you really want a narrower tire (the 205 or 215 is the width)? I would go for a 225/50/16 if I were you, it will look better.



As for tirerack - they are excellent, I have bought from them before and will do so again. Read the customer reviews of the tires you are considering, you can get the lesser known brands for a lot less money, and they are often excellent tires. Kumho, Summitomo, Hankook - all good tires for the money.



Good luck!

Yes, mine are 60R15 (not 17).  Would I be able to go with the 225's, or would that interfere with the suspension/steering/etc.?

225 is only 10 mm wider than what you have. Just make sure the new wheels have the same offset as the old ones.

PMack has a very good answer, but I would like to add that if you put a lower profile tire on your car without lowering it, you may not be happy with how it looks.  A good rule of thumb visually is that the gap between the top of the tire and the bottom of your fender should never be larger than the hight of your tire's sidewall.  If you are concidering new rims I would assume that you are doing it for visual reasons.  The question I would be asking if I were you is:  How big of a tire can I fit on my car without rubbing?  Be sure to include vehicle information and any modifications done to the suspension.

What i would suggest is put prices slightly above the price you want - but not TOO high as to put off people - and then if someone haggles, slowly work down to that price!!

Germans killed people, Japanese killed people, Italians killed people, French killed people, Americans killed people, Brits killed people...in short EVERY country has killed some people.  So why do we buy cars from all these countries? Answer: supply and demand and the human's never ending desire for new things.  So why German? Simple, their cars are superior to cars built from other countries.  We always want the "best" things and for cars it happens to be Germany.

could you be more specific,,i also have a pug 306 1.9tdi,generally speaking these engines are bombproof,peugot make excellent diesel engines.

Mine ticks,rattles at times,it will do it's a diesel.

When do you hear it?,,while driving or when idling with the bonnet up ??
Is it loud,sharp - when hot or cold ?

Some more information would help.

The thing with diesels are they are simpler than a petrol and although heavier and running 2 - 3 times the compression they will tend to last longer,as long as it's not burning oil and the cam belt is changed when it's specified there is little major to go wrong !!!!

Had a 1.9td engine for years, they are a great engine. Have had a ticking problem with a similar engine and it was due to a haudraulic lifter (tappet) sticking. It could be a sign that the oil needs changing, but it may need changing. Good news is that I would only worry when it is more constant and the repair is reasonably cheap - I believe the part is under £30, probably cheaper if you shop around.

The 19td ( Or XUD ) does not have hydraulic tappets; they're shims and buckets.



This engine is also prone to head gasket failure.

terrible and terrible! As with most modern cars the visibility is appauling, especially when trying to reverse - which, let's face it, is a pretty important part of learning to drive!

The previous corsa was a cracking car, with excellent visibility, it was a dream to teach people in - but i went and test drove a new one an knew straight away it would be a bad.

As far as the touch sensitive indicators - absolute nightmare - I don't know if there is a menu in the settings enabling you to turn off the "lane change (3 flashes)" function because it is a nightmare for learners who try to cancel the signal, and end up indicating the other way then panic and indicate the other way! Disco lights on the car!

The interior is bland, the astra is pretty ugly, but the corsa does look quite nice from the outside, but as far as teaching someone, I think they score pretty poorly.

Well done Dave J, you put that so well, I don't think I could add to it.... Damn, there goes my 10 points. 
As a BSM instructor, the old style Corsa was a dream.  With BSM they renew the cars every 16-17K and as I have a very wide area to teach I am always getting a new car every 3-4 months. When the new style came out  most of the older style car instructors came along to the office to see it, and they all commented on the indicators, the rear window, the side window, the view of the speedo from passenger side, in fact nearly everything was commented on.  The new style of Astra was a problem for BSM as their magnetic sign had to be redesigned so that it could fit onto the new body shaped roof.  I prefer the Corsa to the Astra.

People will use them, the toilets are designs to take any kind of human digested wastage. But not tampons, or wipes.

The waste is stored in a tank, which is emptied every so often. The toilets on trains are like your normal house domestic type toilet.

I removed the two rubber grommets from the inside of the boot lid but I can't see any way to get the ******* cover of the little darling lens (spelt with 3 f's).

If it was factory fitted, contact the local dealer for that make of car, they should be able to replace it but it might take a few days. If not, contact a local garage and they can probably get someone to come and deal with it outside your home but you might end up without an immobiliser! Either way, it's not gona be so cheap, this happened to my friend once :(

it really depends on where you're buying it and how old it is.  new car?  take it out and see if you like the way it drives.  used car (less than 10 years)  pop the hood and make sure it all looks in order.  check for oil on the engine and rust on parts.  aside from the obvious, the best way to find problems with a used car is to go out in the country and act like you're at a drag race.  floor it to about 80, observe any sounds or vibrations that seem out of place, then stop the car as fast as possible.  that will usually tell you if something major is wrong with it.

Hi i have been asked if i could fit a turbo to a 1.4 k series engine on a mg zr and was wondering if they even put at turbo on that engine so i could get one from scrapyard or what other turbos would fit easy. I have been told that it might catch on the bonnet is this true? Thanks

You can't - the compression would need to be lowered, and with an engine so prone to head gasket failure, you'd be asking for trouble.

Because they give a good price.
The bit about Thatcher sounds like the sort of stunt that she would pull but isn't true I'm afraid.
Each Chief Constable is responsible for the purchase of vehicles.
In my force its BMWS, Volvos, Skodas and Fords.
Believe me when I say its price which is the primary concern.
If we followed the first posters logic would we drive around in a pig yellow taxi or perhaps all ride Harley hogs.

Because Vauxhalls can be modded easily and cheaply for power gain, and are relatively cheap to maintain and insure.
They probably offer a very good service package and discount to the public sector which is why there are so many about.
Its not a political thing, each force has its own allocated budget.
Buses nowadays always tend to be Dennis or Volvo for much the same reason.

To be honest, I don't know why the cops don't use cheaper second hand cars instead of constantly buying expensive, brand new cars - that way it wouldn't matter if they bashed them about a bit instead of worrying about scratching the paintwork a little. That way instead of using rehearsed, precise, boxing in techniques they could just pit manoeuvre fleeing criminals like they do in the US. To be honest - if I was chasing some mindless, moron who was endangering everyone else's lives I would do anything I could to stop them - including driving into them as hard as possible!! I guess it's a good job I don't work for the police as I would be going through car bumpers and radiators like noone's business!

Duh. There are some panicky flailing women out there, but we usually find them mercifully locked away in crap horror flicks.



When I do drive it's MY road and no one else's. I know I can drive, but maybe the difference between men and women is the thrill seeking testosterone pumping need to prove a bit of manhood. Look at Jackass, how many women do you see thrashing themselves for the fun of it? Ok, it's fun, but only when someone else is doing it. If needs must then I will do the Reservoir Dogs bit and drive around with a mate bleeding to death in the back, but I'm not going to dither over a 360 or doing a little off road. And if anything I miss the sound of a beautiful loud engine, something with a sexy guttural growl that you can feel in your knickers, like old American muscle cars.



Put to the test more women would excel at evasive driving than you think, maybe we're just not dumb enough to put ourselves in that situation!

Road haulage pricing?



i am wondering if there is an easy formula to follow when when customers ask for quotes. i.e what to include, what to leave out, profit margin etc, i am moving up to the office soon due to injury and want a bit of a head start, so if there are any road hauliers out there. can you help. thnx.

</answer from>



<answer>



There is no easy formula.

What each hauler charges will depend on their individual overheads and what each company expects to make on margins.  It will be different for each firm.

The only to know for sure, is to ask someone else who works with you, what calculations they are told to use.

No because your car is on private property, and the council will have erected disclaimer notices like every other car park owner.  It will count as an own fault claim if you try claiming from most insurers.

Hmm, every answer gets a thumbs down...
They're all correct though, go back & look at the car park, you should find disclaimer notices everywhere.
If there are no signs, or they're poorly sited or not readily visible, you have a legitimate claim. Take photos for evidence.

The council will accept no responsibility unless you can prove their gross negligence - which is unlikely (although camera footage of one their staff vandalising, or giving permission to vandalise your vehicle would cover it!!)  You will need to make a claim against your insurer.

Politics and liability concerns. If seat belts were provided in a bus but the operator failed to ensure they were all being used properly he could conceivably be held responsible for injuries sustained by passengers who weren't belted in. And who wants to drive a bus AND play nanny to every single passenger on it as well? Easier and more financially expedient not to have to deal with the seat belts at all. In cars on the other hand we've had groups lobbying for decades to ensure we're protected from our own stupidity.

gasoline is no where near close to gone. Maybe in a few more generations it will be. And the cars arn't run solely off water. It requires electricity and a combustable fuel, like gasoline. It just doesn't give off anything but water vapor.

You have a good point. But making cars that run off of water might be a terrible idea. Gasoline is necessary to survive but water is. There's lots of places that already have problems with not having enough water. If cars were switched over to water I imagine that after a fairly short period water prices would soar and you could hardly afford to take a shower every day. Now a car that runs on salt water that might be something. No shortage of oceans.

Legally it is yours. If I give you a present and then take it back it is theft. You have the registration papers and everything else, and it is insured in your name. If he is a named driver take him off the insurance ASAP. If he attempts to drive the car report him to the police. As you have NOT given your consent to drive the car then he can be charged with Taking Without the Owners Consent (TWOC). If you remove him from the insurance then he can also be charged with Driving otherwise than in Accordance with the law (i.e. No insurance). Also he could be charged with aggravated TWOC as he knew the car was yours and there is an element of a vendetta. Do you have a key? If not call the police exoplain the situation show them the papers and they wuill advise you on getting a new key and also having then locks and ignition changed. This may cost but you could also report him for theft (of the key) as it is not his property, the police may actually go to him and retrieve the key for you. He has NO legal rights here. Go For It!

He took your car or did he just take the key?

If his name isn't on the title or on the registration, you are the car's owner and he's the borrower. In an ideal world, he would be the owner, because he's paying for it. But unless his name is on the registration, he'd have to go to civil court to get it.

Legally, if there was a problem with the car, the police would talk to the person who is registered or to the person who is on the title. The person who is registered is required to keep the tags paid and keep insurance on it. You'd get the ticket if it wasn't up to date. So the car is technically yours.

If he has the car in his possession, you might have to go to civil court to get it back. But if he only has the key, you just have to get the locks changed or re-keyed and you're good to go.

Good luck.

However, he is probably going to try and take it. It's still theft even if he has a key. Ring him up and ask for the key , if he says no, tell the cops he stole your car key and can they go and get it.

The perpetual motion engine defies the law of physics so you will never see one in this universe. Hydrogen fuel cells are a reality but who can afford to pay $200,000 for NASA inspired tech in a car? Until the free market gears-up to produce hydrogen fueled cars and the energy companies gear-up to provide a fueling network these things will remain in the research labs. Besides, at present it takes more energy to produce hydrogen than it does to simply buy gasoline.

Anywhere up to six weeks is normal.The 14 day is only a guideline,if it takes longer to trace you ,for some reason, then it does not apply.

I don't know what state you are in, but you usually have a buffer if you were only a couple over.  In Kansas and Missouri, there is usually a 10 mph buffer.  In Iowa (a giant speed trap), you only have a 4-5 mph buffer....so unless you were in a speed trap, I doubt you will be contacted.



If so, they have 14 days to contact you.

The police use any number of means to catch speeders. The policeman you mentioned may have had a radar gun and maybe he chose to exercise whether or not you were seriosuly over speeding or not.

The thing is this, quite simply DON'T OVERSPEED! 
By speeding you are decreasing your chances of reaction time should something pull out or run out in front of you.

If you are the UK it is usual to get a notice of Intended prosecution within 14 days (Posted within 14 days!). The reason for this is the owner of the vehicle is not necessarily the driver and it is 'reasonable' to assume that within a period of 14 days you would remember who was driving the vehicle at the time.  However, people seem to have the idea that this is law, that is not so, it is an advisory guideline from the Association of chief Constables.

My son is a self employed mechanic and he has a little Peugeot that he lends to customers while he is fixing their cars, but also any one of  a dozen friends borrow it now and then.  Earlier this year the car was flashed at 78 in a 70mph area. The first he knew about this was 13 weeks later!  The offence happened the day after he moved house (from a tented house). My son had not been on that particluar road for years but could not remember who had the use of the car that day as up to 6 people a day can drive it!  From what could be worked out eventually the police had sent 3 separate notices to his OLD address, despite him notifying the DVLA of his new one! The property had remained empty as the owner was going to modernise it a bit then sell it.  He explained the circumstances and pointed out that in the intervening 13 weeks the car could have had anything up to a hundred or more drivers and he had not the faintest idea who had been driving it.  He was prosecuted, including failing to identify the driver and got a £265 fine and 5 points on his clean licence.  (The day he got that there was a newspaper report of a Newcastle Footballer being prosecuted for same offence and HE got a 60 quid fine and 3 points on his already soiled licence!)

AEM cold air intake or v2?



Does anyone know where i can find a cheap AEM cold air intake system or a v2 intake system for my Mitsubishi eclipse gt? I was looking at the short ram intakes and they are allot cheaper but i don't think they can give you as much of a power boost, am i right or just an idiot? Because internet explanations have been shaky at best.

go with whatever the cheapest intake you can find is. in the end, the only difference aem makes is that thier intakes are carb legal, but this should only matter if you live in california. nowadays every intake has been designed after all the brand named product so it does not really matter. as far as to buying a cold air intake, rather than a short ram, you do get colder air thus getting more oxygen atoms into your combustion chamber. with a short ram intake you get the hot air from the engine until you begin to move and cold air enters the engine bay. With the cold air intake you have the chances of hydrolock if you live i a place where it rains, but a bypass valve would solve that problem.

the short ram intakes do not work all they do is suck in hot air and cicrculate it through your engine = no hp difference

the v2 intake is waste of money dont get it

the cold air intake is the only one that works, since its sucking in cold air from the bottom it acutally does work

it depends.  in most states the limit is 12 total points, but if you go over 6 in a 12 month span they'll often suspend you as well.  in most states this is not age sensitive, just point sensitive.

No, you need twelve points to be banned under the 'totting up' procedure, unless you've passed your test within the last two years, in which case you're banned at six points.

Dont go to court.. always pay your fines as soon as you get them. That way the judge never sees the fines or your record. Only reason mine got taken was because court was mandatory for a wreck less driving charge.. judge saw I had 80 points and promptly suspended my license for a year.



You can have as many points as you like so long as you dont appear in court and your name isnt on the docket. There isnt a flag system set up that can automatically suspend your license, a judge or county clerk must suspend your license and they wont know how many points you have if you never appear on the docket becuase you pay your fines as soon as you get them without going to court.

If they were then you may get more than 3 this time.  if not then probably only another 3 but you don't get banned until 12

It's not the price of gasoline so much as the rapid increase in price... Gas went from about $3.00 per gallon to $4.50 in a very short time, and people were not prepared for the change. Now, prices are starting to come down again, but will still remain higher than they were before.

So when she came she just showed me some important tips how to overcome them and we both practiced many times things like parallel parking etc b4 the road test.

Obey all traffic laws!  Be sure to use turn signals properly.  Not only when turning, but also when pulling away from the curb.  Do Not Talk To The Examiner while you are driving, unless they ask you a question.  They are only there to give you directions and to monitor and grade your driving skills, not for chit-chat.  Chit-chat by beginning drivers is dangerous.  It will take your concentration off the road.  Remember to come to a complete stop at stop signs.  Make sure that you yeild the right of way, in all cases.  Be certain that you do not interfere with ANY pedestrian, they have the right of way in ALL circumstances.  Be certain to fasten seat belt, adjust the seat and mirrors prior to starting the car for the test.  Follow the examiners directions, unless they instruct you to make a turn too late to safely accomodate the instruction.  Remember that should your driving test take you on a freeway, the right hand lane is for normal trafic and the left hand lane is for passing.  Don't drive on in the left hand lane.  No radio on, no ipod on, absolutely no cell phone on!  Turn it off com pletely!

Wear a short skirt, low cut top and make-up and if you are female.... lol!!

Only kidding - take your time - its better to wish you HAD gone than wish you HADN'T!!

If you are in any doubt where or what the examiner wants you to do (directions, manoeuvres etc..) ASK!!!

And don't worry if you think you've made a mistake - a, the examiner might not have noticed you do it and b, the examiner might consider it a minor fault when you are sitting there sweating thinking it was a serious fault - who knows better?!!

Enjoy showing off your skills - all you have to do is show you know the highway code and drive safely - they are not looking for expert, precision driving - just that you are safe to drive alone!

Good Luck!

I passed mine 3 months ago at the 11th attempt!!  They don't fail you on really little things - they fail you if you do something dangerous.  I failed most of mine because of my nerves but this time around - i just wasnt bothered if i passed or failed, i just kept thinking that if i fail i will just put in for it again. On my last test - a van cut me up and i was convinced that i had failed.... but i hadn't!! The examiner said it wasn't my fault, so on your test.... just remember that you haven't failed until the examiner tells you that you have at the end of your test!!  What I'm saying is that don't assume that you have failed if you make a mistake because it will put you off, just carry on driving safely and at the very worst - if you have failed, at least you will have had the experience of completing the whole driving test so you will have more experience next time.  And just keep reminding yourself that the examiner is just somebody's mum/dad/sister/brother.... whatever!! They are just normal people who are doing a job just the same as a window cleaner does his/her job!!  They are not really bothered whether you pass or fail, they go into work, do their job, pick up their wages and... that's it.... I bet half of them don't even like their job.... but they like the money (even though the salary is crap!!!)  They are not devils - just "normal" human beings!!!
One last thing...... always remember to look over your shoulder whenever you move off and every time he/she gives you an instruction - ALWAYS look in your mirror as soon as the instruction is given, do this before you do ANYTHING else, if they say "take your next left", don't indicate then check your mirror - check your mirror first then indicate then check mirror and check again, ignore all these people who say you have to move your head to look in the mirror - you don't, examiners are not stupid, they know when you are looking in your mirror and when you are not!! Plus, they will know you are not looking in your mirror when you don't react to what's going on behind you lol!! Seriously - always expect the unexpected, on one of my tests - I had two police cars behind me with their lights flashing at me (urging me to move over) but guess what?? I wasn't checking my mirrors often enough and so I didn't see them for at least 10 seconds that they were there!!!! Guess what........ he failed me lol!!!  Always always expect the unexpected, last but not least.... good luck!!!

Something comfortable. Personally I would wear jeans, a comfy top and chucks or pumps. Make sure to pack a jacket or cardigan - from my experience it can get cold on a ferry, especially if you're outside at all during the journey.

Loose comfortable clothing is the way to go. I drove half way across Canada and I cannot stress this enough. Oh, and don't rush. Take a break about every 2-3 hours to refresh yourself. And don't drink coffee or anything with caffeine. I learned that one early in the trip. Too many pee breaks required.
 Don't worry about the life jacket. They provide that onboard.

Just as easy. The gearbox you used would have been a "Range Change" ( 4 over 4). Depending on the manufacturer, the layout could be different. Scania & Volvo do a 9 speed - 4 over 4 with "crawler" gear,and a 14 speed - 3 over 3 with a "split gear" + 2 "crawler",  ZF a 16 speed - 4 over 4 with split. The hardest part is getting used to the extra gears, you do not need to use all of them. With the newer trucks, a lot of manufacturers are going down the automatic route, some with 2 pedal and some with 3 pedals. I have driven both types, and prefer the conventional 3 pedal layout for slow speed maneuvres as there is normal clutch control, against trying to control with just the throttle. Either way, we are classed as  "Professional Drivers" and as such, employers will expect you to be able to drive anything they give you!! - Even Mercedes with the "EPS" gear box.!!

well its obvioulsy a larger truck, make sure you have the CDL required to operate the truck if it is necessary, and therefore if you know how to drive a truck that size the number of gears should not matter

How do I get my money back? Has anyone rented a car with Avis?



In june I rented a car in France with Avis.I booked everything on line( included car seat).
When we got there the guy told us we had to pay for the car seat but in the receipt had to put it as a second driver (odd I know ) because car seat wasn't covered.
When we told him we already paid for it online (we even show n him our bank statement ) he told us it wasn't possible and that we had to pay which we did.

Since we came back in england I sent Avis 3 emails regarding this and never got a reply.Does anyone know how to contact them?

A good cabbie will not need satnav,he will have the knowledge.I never needed one as a tanker driver,you only need an A TO Z of each city when you are on multi van drops or C & D,satnav is brilliant in use at sea along the coast, the marine GPS system is safer than radar in tight sea areas along the coast.The road versions fall down miserably in cities and built up areas as they can only be relied on to give you a location ,not directions.If you are travelling down a dual carriageway and it tells you to turn right,you cannot,it takes no notice of centre reservation barriers and one way systems and traffic free zones.

Some yes, some no
Trafic monitoring cams, street cams, motorway bridge cams, anpr cams, van mounted cams etc all can even from a long distance.
You can get a wired hands free for a couple of quid or a bluetoth from about 15 quid so use em and save yourself a lot of worry and maybe your life.

Using a mobile phone is an offence and you will be automatically deducted 3 points from your licence. So if you continue to do this then you will have lost your licence.



MOST IMPORTANTLY, if your having a conversation or texting and someone runs out in front of you, you will have significantly decreased the chance to react - simply by holding a phone in your hand when you should have been paying attention to your driving. CARELESSNESS COSTS LIVES. THINK.



Your driving licence is given to you because you successfully passed your test - so don't throw it away.

An intersection where the traffic lights are out should be treated as a 4 way stop!

Seeing as this is an unsafe intersection, it you can turn right, and then make a U turn down the road safely, and return to the intersection to turn right again onto the road you started on (on the other side) you will be better off!

Stop, look more carefully than you would otherwise, and proceed with EXTREME caution.

Bear in mind that even if the light is working and in your favour, you never know if the guy coming the other way is drunk, had a heart attck etc - so you still have a duty to take an appropriate amount of care.

Treat this junction as an unmarked crossroads. No one has priority so you need to be ready to give way to any traffic.Make eye contact with any other drivers before you go through. Alternatively shut your eyes blast through and wake up in hospital

Treat it as a four way, BUT do not trust other drivers know the rules. In other words, make sure all have stopped before you go on, or oncoming cars are so far away they can not possibly hit you. 
The a*rse you save may be your own!
By the way, funny one badmts it happens too often. 
Oh yes, always carefully look *both* directions before going on. One of badmts mates may be out on the road that day!

starts up fine, realllly fast, hardly gives time to crank almostl ike, kr-VROOM..and makes a quiet VRoom noise, almost as if the engine never stalled in the first place. is it due to over heating or is something wrong with my fuuel system? cuz no matter how much i gas it..it feels like it aint gettin the gas. or is my thermostat broken..like what the hell??

Best cheapest way to go is buy helmet made for wearing glasses .
You can have visors made  to your prescription - not cheap.

I must admit I'm a little surprised that You're taking ADI 1 and asking for advice on it, are you sure Your ready?

I will agree about the hazard perception though. I've always thought it's an ill conceived and poorly presented part of the exam that serves no real purpose. The fact that so many people fail on it should tell the DSA something.

My students display good perception, but falter when on a computer screen.

Good luck.



Jayne, part 2 is a walk in  the park compared to part 3!



Sorry if I scared you! I was a police officer and took every driving test the force had to offer, passing them all. I was however VERY nervous about the ADI exams but managed to get through them. The questions on Part 1 are very straight forward, but as has been mentioned, don't get too mouse happy on the hazard perception and you'll get through it.



Get part 2 over with and you can start teaching on a trainee licence, that will give valuable help for part 3.

Keep at it, it's actually quite a good job, although the earning potential is a bit exaggerated by some training schools.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



As a rough rule of thumb if you work on an average cost of 20pence per mile travelling in a car such as a KA or Daewoo Matiz this should account for the cost of petrol as well as tax, insurance and wear and tear, so at 5 miles this would be about £1.



In this instance driving would be at least as cheap as if not cheaper than taking the bus which I believe would cost around £1 - £1.50 depending on the service, not to mention saving time by being direct and also making for a more comfortable journey.

However if you wre driving a 3 ltr V8 4x4 then no doubt the bus would be the cheaper option.

In summary - look at what car you driving and the engine size

The bus fare usually has a minimum charge. Driving five miles will cost you roughly 70 pence in petrol, unless you have one of those silly 2,3,4 V cars. There is no need to include insurance, car tax, depreciation, etc. Those are running costs which you pay anyway whether you drive the car or leave it at home.
Hitch hiking is a good alternative.

Sensible is right. The insurance company dictates what age.

Personally, I would not allow any employee under 18 operate mine even if the insurance company did not care.



Teen's, please do not take offense to this, but operating a forklift can be dangerous and even deadly. The dangers are sometimes hidden. It takes a mature adult to operate one safely. Of course there are adults that have killed themselves by not following the rules.

I agree, it makes sense to switch off, if you are going to be in the jam for a long time, like 20 minutes or so, but who's going to time how long you are sat there for and how many traffic wardens are likely to be assaulted by irate drivers, who are irritated by sitting in traffic already?

alot of people have said this will cause more pollution and use more fuel when you have to keep stopping and starting your engine it pushes loads of fuel through to start! also its not good for a car to be stopped and started especially when your only going to start again in a matter of minutes. i think its ridiculous as some cars havent got a strong battery etc and may not start again therefore this would cause to more tailbacks!

Given the minimal policing on the roads as at present, I.e. virtually no police presence, are we to assume then, that those of us who don't switch the engine off have then to ring up the idiot that thought of this, and give him our details so he can send out the fine?
Sounds as dumb as it could possibly get.
If the Traffic is stop start why bother switching off. If it's obvious there is a long standing/parked delay, then there is possibly some justification, how ever, in the middle of winter when you are now freezing your wheel nuts off, do we then have to get out of the car and run around to keep warm? 
So here's the scenario... elderly couple snug and dry in their car , cold winter day, switch the engine off , poddle off up the road to keep their circulation going and thus keep warm,  forget where he car is, nett result a traffic jam!
It would appear that  some bright beaurocrap has come up with this, and he is the one who has obviously showed some intelligence, so his reward is now £80 grand a year.
Wot a load a twaddle!

It was probably contrived in one of the oil / auto industry's offices (I think they're in bed together).



Here's the scenario:  while driving to work, you run into the same traffic every day.  You stop, turn you hot engine off, and sit.  While your engine is off, the heat inside of it is killing the oil because it stops flowing, your battery is going to be drained because you probably won't sit there in silence - the radio will probably be on (oh yeah, and you'll need those cold cranking amps to restart your car, which is a big draw on the battery), and the shifter in automatic transmission cars are going to be put through quite an exercise.



Each car is made with planned obsolescence - they know that you can open and close your door "X" amount of times before the hinge or bushings fail.  If you put your starter, your battery, fuel pump and oil pump through that kind of work every day, your car will ultimately fail much, much sooner than planned.

However, should you get stuck in traffic from an accident or construction and know that you will be sitting for extended amounts of time, then I fully agree that we should do what we can to conserve & shut our car off...

Isn't all this really a matter of common sense?

They won't want to risk their no claims bonus and in any case will have to declare you as the main driver and the insurer will base the premium on you not them

Insurers aren't that stupid

You are legally not allowed to put your parents as the main driver(s) and you as a named driver.  This practice is called "fronting" and is completely illegal.



Your best bet is to get the insurance in your name, (as you must) and put 1 or both parents on YOUR insurance.  This can dramatically reduce your premiums with some insurance companies.

The price of a car has no bearing on Insurance it is the damage or injury or death to a third party that is the important factor.Technically spaking you can put the cover in your parents name.Try Quinn Insurance they sell cheap cover for young Drivers.

it doesnt matter really on how much you pay for the car thats not what insurance is about.have your parents to insure it but put you down as a named driver but make sure that your parents have protection on there no claims that way if you have a accident your parents no claims bonus won't be affected by it.insurance companys look at your age,where you live in a high or low risk area,engine size wheather the car is a 3 door or a 5 door,security on the car, the mileage per year and few other things.a 5 door is cheaper because its classed as a family car and most people don't know that.with you parents taking out the insurance for you it should work out about a 3rd of the price,it would cost you on your name.ok hope that helped.

A boy racer overtook me ?



in his flashy mid 90s honda with requisite ridiculous loud exhaust today. it was on some smallish quiet roads, i had seen him driving recklessly and recklessly overtaking some other motorists travelling at normal decent speed. of course i had to step on it when he overtook me with his faster suped up modified motor. its strange cause he had plenty of space after taking me to slow down but he still managed to mount a traffic island at about ...mmmm 20-ish, skid out, hit a pole and go into some roadworks. id estimate the damage in the three to four hundred pound area. i did so want to stop and point and laugh, however there was about 4 of them in the car and i didnt want to hang around too long and provide a scape goat. my question is, is there some way that i could have driven slowly past his fila tracksuit sporting dole drawing little buddies without being involved in any 'complications' and what abuse should i have directed towards them. i did consider removing my plates stopping beside them and making suggestions as to their mothers lifestyle however i didnt want to risk getting into court cases and the likes.

Excellent result!  Glad it happened to them and not you.



Twats like this get speed-bumps put in roads, because they can't drive responsibly, and then we all suffer.  This happened a few years back near me, a little Honda CRX, as a fact.  The twonk at the wheel mounted the pavement, and hit a lamp-post.  He was sick in front of the Police, I laffed my head off!



And further back on that same stretch of road that heads to the marina, one afternoon - spookily enough, another Honda, this one was a lovely NSX, and the driver and his girlfriend were sat on the grass, as the cops turned up.  His next task was going to be explaining how one of the worlds' best handling cars had -again- taken out a lamp-post, in a 30mph area, just outside an insurance companys' office!  I'm guessing he had been showing her how much talent he had... NOT!!

You should have just slowed down to 5mph, driven past their wrecked car and shouted "haha! bellends"
I doubt they'll be in a hurry to overtake like that again incase someone else does it to them.

I've seen some barry boys crash into traffic cones because they tried to overtake a white van man at the last minute (2 lanes going into 1)
The white van man didn't let them in or was oblivious, and they slammed on their breaks about 15m away from the cones (smashing into them, ruining their bumper and quite possible radiator) :) :)
needless to say I was pissing myself with laughter, as I am sure the motorists behind me were

A similar thing happened to me in Bristol a few years ago, to$$er overtook me as i was pulling away from lights, cut in front and took left hand fork, same way i was going, he was obviously smugly looking in his rear view mirror as he didn't see stationary car waiting to turn right and slammed straight into the back of it causing lots of damage, i passed very slowly, sounded my horn and gave him a round of applause as he looked around.

Well look at it this way,because you were not driving like a c**t and 
he was, look who came off better.Just ignore the stupid little pr**ks
they normally end up smashing up their cars by showing off how fast
they can`t go. That`s why the insurance premiums are so high due
to little to**ers like this.

Sadly, Cunning Linguist, behaviour like this does put up the pr***ks insurance premiums - which is why so many of them don't bother with insurance. This means that we, the 'ordinary' motorists, are the ones that suffer when these heads of dicks involve us in their games. In this day and age, when we're being told that all our motoring information is on a computer database, why aren't the uninsured cares just being confiscated and destroyed after a certain period of time? It may not improve their driving but at least we aren't left to pick up the pieces.

having tax automatically renders the sorn unnecessary and the police computers and such will be able to see it. You may get pulled for the first few weeks, but as long as you have tax you dont need sorn.

You can't

The owners manual should be a paper copy, kept in the car.
That way it can be accessed when you need it, late at night when the car's electrics have failed and you're in the middle of nowhere.
An online version cannot be accessed in the same way.

They're good reliable engines as long as they've been looked after. Not the most refined, can be a bit noisy compared to a more modern engine. Worked on many Transits and they don't usually give many problems. A few years ago I worked on a development project for Fords on a marinised version of this engine. It produced 130 b.h.p at 3800 r.p.m. We ran it on the dyno for 600 hrs without any problems, so you can see they're fairly bulletproof.

R500 great for track and but the TVR more suitable for ordinary driving.
Both must be difficult to drive because of their massive power output.

Why diesel cars not so available in the USA.  I want one.  They have phenomenal mileage?



I rented a diesel in Europe and the tank stayed on full even though I was doing some solid driving for 5 days.  These are better than electric cars for mileage.

Most European diesel cars do not meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Tier2 emissions standards.  That's why most of those cars are not allowed to be sold in the United States.

Only a few that meet the EPA's standards made by VW or Mercedes are sold here.  http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008...

The ones that are EPA-compliant have decent but not spectacular fuel economy, and keep in mind on average diesel fuel costs 80 cents more per gallon than gasoline in the United States.

They sold some for a while in the late 70s. The quality was so bad that they tirned everyone off. They could not handle the extremely cold weather and very long driving times in America.

Plus, most of  them do not meet the pollution control requirements. They are dirtier than gasoline cars. Also, diesel fuel costs more than gasoline, which wipes out your savings anyway.

My daughter went on a trip in a diesel Golf across the USA in January a few years ago. There was no way that car was going to start in Fargo ND in January at 44 below. They had to abandon it.

Yeah, I am loving what I've seen of these new cars of the future.  I'm all for alternative fuel and hybrids so the future of cars have a good outlook.



With all the energy problems that we are having, it is imperative that we look at creating new industries around renewal sources of energy.

The greatest short term benefit would be quality jobs to replace all the ones lost and maybe we can return to the good old days when America was a major exporter of cars just like Japanese and Europeans.

I am very optimistic about my future and the future of our country so cheer up you guys, together we can do this - YES WE CAN.  The power of positive thinking.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



On your lesson before the test, drive around the streets close-ish to the test centre.  You want to be looking out for things that could affect your drive - such as road works, diversions, broken traffic lights, temporary traffic lights, massive lorries blocking roads, etc.  You don't want to be driving along and wham, you're faced with an un-expected thing which may flummox you.

Before you get in the car (for your test), you do the sight test, you then do "Show me, Tell me", you will be asked a few questions, such as "How do you change a tyre", "Where is the oil", "What goes in here?" - you'll be asked to pop the bonnet open for this.

You then close the bonnet, in the car, the examiner will adjust their mirrors and then say "Drive on when you'r ready, upon leaving the Test Centre, turn left / right / straight ahead until I tell you otherwise".

So, after a few minutes you'll turn into quieter streets and be asked to pull over.  You'll be told that you'll be doing one of the manovers, reverse round corner / turn in the road / parallel parking.  You have two of these to do.



Sometimes you get the Emergency Stop too, but they will forewarn you of this, not everyone gets them though.

After the manovers, back off out to the busier roads.  For me, I was made to drive along a 60mph twisty country lane and got a minor fault for going too slow (they can fault you for "un-due hesitancy").

After about 40mins, you are back at the test centre. Done and dusted.

Make sure you have reversed round every type of corner imaginable, not all corners are perfect right angles, they tested me on a wide, sweeping, downward corner !!



With mirrors, the examiner will adjust the tiny mirror near the rear view mirror.  This means they can see your eyes move to the mirrors so no need for exaggerated head / eye movements.

If your examiner jolts forward when you break, they are giving a subtle hint you are breaking too hard.  My instructor also told me that some examiners will give a gentle cough if you are dawdling about pulling out of a junction when they can see there is plenty of space.

Examiners don't want to fail people, they have to complete lots of paperwork explaining the reason they failed someone yet with a pass, it's just that piece of paper they hand you at the end when they shake your hand.



Take a deep breath, don't rush into things and don't take any herbal relaxant drops if you've never taken them before - you could end up like a friend of mine and be zombie-fied!!

Good luck!

Thanks for all the advice. My test was abandoned halfway through, got a puncture! The examiner said I would have passed, only had 2 minors until that point so I guess your advice worked. There's always next time :D

Hiya,  I am an ex driving instructor so I can help.  The best advice I can give you is once you get into the test centre, sit down and relax.  Go in to your test with an open mind.  Feel positive put at the same time not over confident or negative.  Most test candidates feel they are going to get an examiner with grey hair and clipboard!  This is not usually the case anymore.  Much younger examiners have been recruited.  Always remember that you will not be doing anything on test that you have not already done.  Finally a golden piece of advice, when doing the manoevoures, take your time and don't rush them.  The examiner is not expected to see an experience driver/expert but someone who is a new driver who can drive safely.  Best of luck.  James

Please don't let your nerves get the better of you. Remember the examiner is just a person like you and me :)
Last but by no means least, turn your head to look in mirrors - the examiner won't be able to see your eyes move only.

There's already some excellent advice here, so all I wanted to add was this;

The examiner will understand that you're nervous and won't expect you to be perfect. As long as you drive in the way your instructor has taught you and don't do anything that could be construed as unsafe or dangerous, you should be fine.



You don't need to whizz your head around in an exaggerrated manner to prove you are looking in your mirrors or anything like that  - the examiner knows whether you're using your mirrors correctly anyway and remember it's not just about physically looking - it's about correctly interpreting and acting on what you SEE that counts.

The most important piece of advice I can give is to listen carefully to what you are asked to do and to CONCENTRATE fully for the whole drive...don't let your concentration slip or start thinking about what you've aleady done, you must think only about what you are being asked to do at that moment in time, nothing else.

If you think you've made a mistake, let it go and don't dwell on it - the chances are that it's not as bad as you think :) More people fail through lapses of concentration caused by fretting about something they feel they didn't do perfectly and letting this affect the rest of their drive, than by the original fault...

If you're nervous, then heres a link to a website with some tips of dealing with Test Day Nerves - http://www.squidoo.com/practical-driving...

Turn off your car engine or else?



Of all the scatterbrained schemes this one takes top prize. The proposal to fine drivers for not switching engines off whilst in traffic queue's is lunacy. This will only add to polution when engines are repeatedly switched on and off. will cause traffic to build up as car after car restarts, Imagine being in a two mile "crawler" and have to restart every time traffic stops. The guy who dreamt this one up takes the booby prize. (And I cleaned that one up) Any comments ?



</question>



<additional details>



Please do not misunderstand the question, I am not refering to prolonged stops at say level crossings or the like nor if there is any reduction in fuel consumption. Here in the southeast of England traffic queues are a daily occurence on motorways and A roads. Here even a minor shunt can cause a rapid traffic build-up and a two mile queue quickly becomes a 4,6 or 8 mile one with all lanes blocked and no place to go. Ok if traffic is stationary for some time switch off but what usually happens is a slow stop start crawl as several lanes converge into one to switch on and off under those conditions is potty. In any case who is going to administer the fines, If you spot the "Gestapo" arriving whilst idling switch off smartish and say "good morning officer" or words to that effect, (no crime no fine)

It depends on how long you are stopped for but you are right if it's a short period, it can use more fuel to start a car than to sit idle for a minute of two.  You aldo do wear the engine some when every time you start it so over time, cars will not last as long and people will have to replace their cars sooner then they would have.  It is a stupid law but what else do you expect from our politicians.

Another motorist money spinner. Like you are going to want to turn your engine off in mid-Winter and freeze yer botty off. There are occasions when switching off is an option for instance at certain railway crossings when you know it's going to be a few minutes but other jams it's completely random. It doesn't seem reasonable or enforceable.

haven't heard that, must be a European idea.  however, it's not as bad as you make it out.  new cars with Fuel Injection can save gas by being shut off for only 10-15 seconds, the thought your having is back to old carberated motors that needed 60-120 seconds to make up the amount of gas lost in start up.



i do this myself already bc of gas savings, BUT it should not be mandated.  what about a car full of kids, old people or a pregnant lady on a hot or very cold day?  this sort of thing could then be fatal as the climate control system is already what is keeping them alive.  if i were where you live, this is the direction i'd go to fight the idea.

A modern car uses about 30 seconds of fuel to restart.  If you are stopped for more than 2 minutes, you are a wasteful clod letting your motor idle.  I have seen a line of cars sit 15 minutes waiting for a train to pass, many drivers sitting idling, some still in gear with foot on brake.  I would like to smuck every one of them upside the head.  Many drivers pull up to 7-Eleven and leave the car running while going in to buy smokes.  They deserve to have their cars stolen and crushed.  People leaving their cars idling while waiting several minutes for a special order at the drive-through should be shot.  Far too many people don't have the sense they were born with.



As far as the comment about the reefer trucks, that is ludicrous, because the reefer doesn't use the vehicle engine to cool, it has a separate unit that runs independant of the engine.
Shutting the car off for a few minutes doesn not cause children and dogs to turn into corpsicles in winter, or into sticky goo in summer.  However, a young baby in arms, or a sick elderly person can be an exemption.  But, a properly clothed baby doesn't freeze when walked out to that car at 40 below zero, so why would it freeze in the car as it cools down only a few degrees?
What do you think people did before cars had heaters and air conditioners?
Shutting the car off for a wait of less than 2 minutes is silly, of course.

This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
This is a large part of how hybrid cars are more efficient.
Some manufacturers have also introduced "Stop & Start" systems to existing cars (BMW, Mini, Citroën) with improvements of up to 15% in urban fuel consumption.
It does work.
I expect all cars to have similar systems in the next few years.

Also, a 2-mile crawler is a different situation from the level crossing in Shoreham-by-Sea (where the scheme is being trialled). That is a situation where traffic is stationary (not crawling) for up to 10 minutes waiting for the trains to pass and the barrier to lift.

Switzerland has had similar regulations for decades.

My tire pressure light keeps coming on, it is because of the rims?



Everytime I turn on my vehicle (2007 Dodge Nitro) a light turns on and keeps beeping. It is the symbol that indicates that on one or more of my tires, my air pressure is low. Could this be because I have put new tires and 22" rims on all 4? I checked the pressure with a guage and it was good. Could the sensor be broken?

The sensors the tire pressure monitoring system is looking for are attached to the valve stems.  Did you put those in your new rims?

If you transfered them to your new rims, and your spare tire has the correct air pressure.  Then there is a good chance one of the sensors got damaged.

You will need a factory scanner to tell you which one is bad.

You might want to check the spare tire to see if it has a pressure sensor, if not make sure you try another pressure gauge.  If still that don't work take it to the dealer they should be able to tell you which tire sensor is reading low and why.

Air Recirculation and/or the Max A/C button do the same thing. They close off the vents that let fresh air into the car from the base of the windshield.

Air Recirculation should be combined with A/C usage, which is why on some cars (older domestic US cars in particular) it's labled Max A/C.  Air Recirc setting helps the air conditioner system by recirculating already cooler air through the system, rather then trying to take warmer outside air and cool it down.



You can use it with heat, but on some cars (older Japanese and German cars in the US) they aren't set-up to run the A/C compressor in defrost mode.  Any moisture at all will cause your windows to fog, ALL OF THEM,  unless you also turn on the A/C button too.

A/C doesn't really cost much more then 1 mpg on most cars. For me personally, I'll use A/C whenever I can. My comfort is worth more then 1 mpg.

What do all these numbers mean on my car tires?



195/60 R15
88H
M+S

Those are all of the numbers I was able to obtain off of my uniroyal tires on my car. Can anyone explain exactly what these numbers mean and what size rim these tires will fit on?
I want to get new rims and i want 16 inch, but since my tires are new i don't want to have to buy new tires for the new rims. Anyway that i can use these tires on a 16inch rim?
Any additional info when shopping for car parts and good/cost effective websites are greatly apprieciated.
Thanks in advance!

Would you reccomend getting all new rims and tires or trying to find a new rim that would fit that tire? The tires are only about 4 months old. Are there any places where you can trade in slightly used tires for new ones?

"195" is the section width of the tire in millimeters.  This is measured about half-way down the sidewall.  It is NOT a measure of the width of the tread.

"60" is the section height or aspect ratio which measures the height of the tire from the bead to the top of the tread as a percentage of the section width - in other words, the sidewall is 60% of 195mm.

"R" means the tire is of radial construction

"15" is the diameter of the wheel the tire is mounted on.  Obviously the tire won't fit on a 14 or a 16" diameter wheel if the hole in the middle is 15 inches.

"88" is the load index of the tire and indicates how much weight the tire can carry at specific inflation pressures.

"H" is the speed rating of the tire and indicates the speed the tire can sustain under test conditions.

If you want to buy 16" wheels you will need tires with a 16-inch diameter hole in the middle, not a 15-inch one.  Specifically a tire sized 205/50R16 87H (or any higher speed rating such as V, W or Y) is what you will be looking for.  A tire this size will require an inflation pressure increase of 1 psi over what is recommended for your 15" tires due to the lower load index.



M+S isn't part of the tire size.  It is a label applied to show the tire meets RMA requirements for service in Mud and Snow conditions - an all-season tire.

www.tirerack.com is a great place to shop for tire and wheel packages.

Hi,

How long has he been driving and what type of personality does he have?

This is what I mean, 18 is 18.  Certain tendencies exists at that age.  When I was 18 my judgment wasn't the best, but i was a good kid.  I also was a speed demon.  Loved power, would have really loved a V8 under the hood.  Without the V8 I totaled the car if I had a V8 I would have probably killed myself because of the thirst of feeling the power.

Now i was a leader, not a follower.
If I was a follower, that would increase my chances of acting up because I would be influenced by my friends to show off, more speeding, spin outs, etc.

You might want to think about those things when deciding on that car.

Based on what I know about young guys I would advise you not to get a 2008 (especially not brand new one, waste of money) and I would advise you not to get a V8. (excessive and unnecessary power for first car)



Lots of times we as parents seek to reward our children but don't consider the full impact of that reward.  If safety of your child is an issue (which I am sure it is) and teaching about money is an issue (which it should be).  A good kid deserves to be taught lessons to live by more than to be rewarded with superficial material items.  And if he is truly a good kid he will not contest your judgment of what's best for him.

Neither of the cars you named would be my choice for a first car. I would get a safer less expensive car as a first car.  But that's just my opinion.

I had to take Driver's Ed back in Feb. and I wasn't excited either. But after your done with it you'll be GLAD you took it because you learn a lot of things, and the basic's of driving. I just got a car, and i'm taking a short 3 day driver's ed class too get ready to get my license, and it really does help! Just stay calm and listen to what your teacher says. It'll go good :)

Some will do this I would suggest you try the big companies like Eddie Stobbard or companies near you. I also believe the Post Office wll do this. The other alternative is to look in the classfied and go on a driving course you will have to pay for it but  usually they offer a guarenteed job at the end of it

1.3CDTI pulling 950KG ?



i have asked a similar question before, but this time i have weights etc available!

the van is a combo CDTI 
75bhp - 170ft lb Torque

the trailer/load combination is 950KG
will the van be able to tow that no problems?
also will it be ok to pull it up a small ramp? (boat launch ramp)



reason im asking is because im about to buy a boat, but i need to be sure, or almost sure my van will be able to take it back out of the water!

if not any one got any other suggestions or tips? Winch the trailer up the ramp? reverse with the trailer attached to front of van?

You need to check your owners manual for your van to see what it is rated for.



If you over load it, you can damage or cause failure to your engine, brakes, auto transmission or clutch, axles, tires, trailer hitch and your suspension.



Do you really want to wreck your van AND your boat because your brakes overheated and failed?

Advice on driving a Van?



Passed my driving test in June this year. Just got through a job interview for a Delivery Driver position at Waitrose, will have to pass a van assessment this week. The van they use are 3.5 tonne (LWB) Mercedes-Benz Sprinters. Any advice on driving these vans since the biggest thing I've driven so far is a Honda Accord. Plus, anybody know what the assessor looks out for on the run, and is it aas strict as a driving test? Any help will be very much apprieciated.

The assessment will not be as strict as if you were performing your driving test. 
They are Waitrose partners, not specially qualified driving professional examiners. However, they will need to be confident of your driving ability. They will check that you are able to drive the vehicle in a safe and considerate manner. 
There are two pieces of advice I would give when driving these. One, please remember the vehicle is wider and longer than what you normally drive. You should therefore allow more room to make turns than you normally do, without hitting curbs on a left turn! (Something I have been prone to do in this vehicle... I normally drive a small hatchback!). Provided you compensate for the extra width you will be fine.



Two, the gear stick will probably be located on the centre column, there will be an instinct to "reach down" to change gears, only to realise the gearstick is higher up than what you imagine.



The examiner will ask you to make a reverse maneuver, there is nothing wrong in asking them about distances behind during this.  Good luck.

tell the assessor you have never driven a van. 
Make sure you use your mirrors often.
Observe speed limits.
If you can, tell the assessor why you do things. for example if you are going along a narrow street with parked cars, say that you are slowing down incase a child should run out.
Comment on any hazards you may observe. can be as simple as a bush blocking a driveway so the user has to nudge out to see.
Basically drive carefully, dont take risks but make good progress and for goodness sake, keep a good distance from the vehicle in front as most accidents are caused by not enough braking distance.
The assessor isnt there to test you, just observe and maybe comment on how you could improve your skills. He/she is aware that you are a qualified driver.
Dont worry about it, assessors are human.

Hi, another point not mentioned so far is to be careful of the length of the van when turning left, i.e. from a side turning on to a Main Road. It's all too easy to put the rear wheel up on the kerb, not too impressive when someone's assessing you! 
Also, watch your mirrors carefully whilst negotiating roundabouts.
Hope this helps, and good luck!

Daftold... answers are very sound advice,could I add a few more?



Ask for a `cockpit` drill before your assessment,some of the controls are going to be in different places to the Accord.Allow for the length of the vehicle especially when turning left as you will need more nearside room to avoid clipping the kerb. Make sure your mirrors are adjusted to your driving position,check this before you move away,no interior rear view mirror is going to be one of the biggest things you`ll have to get used to. As with the other answer,the assessor wants to know that you drive safely and realises that a good driver quickly gets used to a new vehicle. If you had time I`d hire a similar size van for 1/2 day to see what it feels like.



Good luck,take care of your driving,too many bad ones out there.

It has been mentioned already but the most thing you need to watch is the increased lenght of the vehicle. Allow plenty room when cornering and turning left or right. When turning left especially, keep a close eye on your left wing mirror as you could easily clip a kerb, or worse still, a parked car. It might sound stupid, but don't forget the extra height. I'v seen many vans with damaged roofs where the driver must have tried to get under a 2 mitre height restriction. I assume the assessor knows you have no van driving experience and will allow for this. After 2 days it will be second nature. I don't know what he'll look for but you should try and drive "his" van with respect.

Get paid for driving with ad wrapped?



i see some websites say that they will give u a free car if u r willing to have a certain company's advertisement wrapped on the car...
those websites seem really legit and everything they say make sense
such as this site

http://www.cash4driving.net/index.html

and some others, i'm really interested in this
but im afraid they r just scams because they need u to buy their
membership to join (even though they take payments through paypal), which doesnt really make sense because if they will just pay u every month why would they charge u at the first place?

i hope somebody can tell me if they r just scams or not...

Drives - Parking -Where can I park???



I live in a small Cul De Sac, where there are 13houses.  4of these houses have Drives.  Two of these are either side of myself.  Du to this I find it extremely hard to get parking, as if i park to far over either side I am blocking a drive.

Recently we have had new tenants move in, who are making parking a little awkward.  Due to this my next door neighbour can't park outside her house.  She has a drive but doesnt use it, instead she parks on the road outside her drive an keeps it empty.



Am I right in thinking I can not park infront of her drive even if she doesnt use it.  If I park over the lamp post i am told to move my car as it means she cant park at the angle of her drive?  Is she allowed to do this? or can i park there if it isnt preventing her from getting to an from her house?

You cant legally block her access to her property but as long as you dont have double yellows then providing your car is taxed you car park anywhere you want as long as not on pavement and not blocking other road users. She legally cant ask you to move either.

By Law your are not allowed to park in the street.  No one has a right to be parked on the road.  If police become involved they will tell you the same.  I taught a woman to drive, and she bought a car. We kept in touch after her test and she phoned me one night to tell me that her neighbour would move his car to outside his house when ever there was a space. If he couldn't park directly when he drove home, he would watch for spaces and soon as one became available, he would be out there moving.  This happened one night, his neighbour went to the shops, a space of 5 minutes, but his space had been taken.  He phoned the police about it, and they came out and told both parties, no one has a right to be parked on the road.

hmm i have a slightly different answer to the others but here goes!

If you visit http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTra... this is the Highway Code online rules 238 - 252 on waiting and parking.

Rule 243 states
"do not stop or park in front of an entrance to a property" however, this is not a legal requirement or law (must not) it is just a rule (do not/should not) and as the introduction to the highway code states
"failure to comply with the other rules of the Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings under the Traffic Acts" http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTra...

If your neighbour doesn't use her drive, ask her if you can park across it slightly - even though technically, you wouldn't be breaking the law if you did - you might just p*ss her off a little, so I would suggest asking her politely first!!

good luck

hate to break your heart, but most concepts, even if they are working/running models have "experimental" designations. meaning you cant title them as a street legal vehicle. if you have a museum go ahead. as a street car, forget it. never gonna happen.

Many concept cars from auto shows (especially the GM brands) are only mock-ups. Many times GM has not even put an engine in them and the parts you see are  artist renditions of  what they think will sell the car.
So many concept  cars are non working.
Those that are, many times  are broken up and never sold. However some find the way to company museums or a designers private collections.
Even prototypes are very often destroyed. Pro-types are test beds for design and test function.
There are private concept  care that come up for sale, which unless it is a known car builder (like say Saleen) are not worth the money in many cases.

I could take a picture of myself today, next to a old car. That doesn't mean that's when the picture was taken.



Give us the reg to help us.

Why don't you submit a picture of the car and I can tell you the year and make. If you are in California the plate you show would be a black plate which was used from 1963 to 1969. The WML I would put that as a 1968 69 car because of the WML being a later plate. I have a 64 and it is G in the begining.

Info for UK plated vehicles
====================

Back then, there wasn't a rollover year plate - they would just carry on issuing until they ran out of numbers. The three letter + 3 number format indicates that it was registered before 1963

The WML indicates that it was first registered in Middlesex.

Now if the photo of the car were available it might make it easier.

If memory serves me correctly, the first number plates with a dating sequence started on August 1st 1962. ie XYZ 123A, where A was the year. The car was therefore registered before that date, but it may be of any age in the photo. I'd focus on the car itself to get a rough idea of the age of the photo.

(This is assuming it's a UK registered car!)

Because the plate does not have an age identifier (these were first introduced in 1962 in England, Scotland and Wales, and applied to all new cars by 1965, but have still not been introduced in Northern Ireland), your best bet is to identify the car make and model, and then find someone who knows that model of car and can identify the age of it. You might be able to contact the owners club for the relevant make or model.

Another option is to see if the tax disc is visible on the car, as this will allow you to date the picture more accurately (the disc should have been valid at the time when the photo was taken, but you can't tell how old the car was when the photo was taken). You may need to magnify part of the photo for this.

well it depends on who have the right of way was it a two way intersections or a four-way stop and go intersection. if so who ever got there first can go first and if the car was speeding it possible it can knock over a truck that why they try not to be at fault cause there try to say how can a little car knock over a truck that weight is twice as much. do you know what i mean there trying to put the blame on you do let them speed play a big part in your accident right

the abs light comes on for a bit because the car is doing its maintenance checks. if the light stays on and remains on whilst you drive then this is its way of telling you there is an error or malfunction with your abs. and the temperature thing...yeah...theyre showing off :D

Mine does this for ABS and Traction Control.
It is to tell you it's working OK.
If the light stays on it is a fault warning.

As the others have said, the ABS light is a function check - if it stays on the ABS is faulty and you need to have it checked - no, they're not showing off, if the ABS is faulty you could have an accident that could have been avoided.



The temperature is handy if it's getting close to freezing - the obvious reason being ice on the roads. My car gives a little warning sound as well when the temperature gets close to freezing. So - it's true to say we could live without it and the car would work ok without it, but it's not really showing off - it's just another safety feature.



We could, for example, probably find our way around at night without headlights, but it's kinda handy to have them!

Yes I do feel safe taking Greyhound buses. No more nor any less safe than flying.
One thing about it if something does go wrong you can get out and walk.  But when flying that is not an option unless you can learn how to flap your arms and legs fast enough to fly.
Also bus crashes are a lot more survivable than plane crashes on commercial airlines.



You also get to do a lot more sight seeing on a bus.
The one inconvenience is the time it takes to get anywhere as compared to flying.

This is going to sound SO dumb! (About driving...)?



I'm 18. I have done my classroom drivers ed and passed everything. I took my permit test and passed the test. (when I was 17) My dad doesn't live with me, and the only other person who I would be able to drive with that is 25 and older with a Valid drivers license is my mom. But she got a DUI (from taking a sleeping pill then having to pick me up about a year ago.) so her license is suspended.
So I can't drive with her.
I'm signed up for Behind the Wheel driving classes that are coming up. I have driven before though with my uncle who came down from Arizona and I've driven with my boyfriend.



I am promised a car as soon as I get my license. I want my car and I want to drive, but I am so nervous and scared.



I know all the rules of the road but just recently when I drove with my bf I was so nervous that I almost ran through a Stop Sign, thank god he shouted stop sign before it was too late.



The thing I am most scared, and nervous about is staying in my lane! My bf says I am hugging the right side of the lane. While I cannot figure out how to be okay and secure with where I am in the lane. I always feel like I'm gonna hit another car. Or a parked car.



Can anyone give me any tips or anything that will help me to feel more comfortable? How do you know you're okay in the lane?
Thats the only thing holding me back from driving.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks.

depending on the size(width)of car, you should be at least aligned with the tread wear line on road, if smaller vehicle then closer to center of your lane, basically suppose to be close to white line,



~if you have time, go out on empty road and park where you think you should be, then get out and look on passenger side how near you are to white line or side of roadway, then move to white line or side of paved edge, and check again with alignment through windows,



if no roads clear, use vacant shopping mall lot with lines to practice in,

Space to the Side:
Keep as much space as you can between yourself and oncoming vehicles. On a two-lane road, this means not crowding the centerline. In general, it is safest to drive in the center of your lane.

With the lane part have someone you know drive in front of you. Then line your car up to his. Like you can see the back of the driver seat of the car in wrong of you. Also adjust the mirrors where you can see the lines. My dad also told me to look ahead. You will see a line down the middle of the lane. You should be just to left of the line

the best thing for you is...if possible... start out with a small (narrow) car.. that way your lane space will be much bigger and youll have plenty of room to learn to stay in your lane...besides im sure thats not all you're having trouble with so that should help u concentrate on other areas..

Alright I have been racing in the track since i was 16



to refrain yourself from going too much to the right, here is what you have to do.



Look at your RIGHT side mirror. If you look at it will give you the reflection of the ground. You can then see how far you are way from the curb.



BTW DO NOT LOOK at the right side of the hood. Because that is always proportional to your view and makes everything seem closer. Look at the right side mirror and it will give you the exact position you are on the right hand corner



and dont worry about it, after a week of practice, that will be easily gone

You working yourself up, don't think of driving as such a big scary thing, just let it come natural. Try not to breath deeper and think happy thoughts to calm yourself down because it's when you freak out that you start messing up. If you are hugging the right lane try driving in it for a while, just until you get used to the whole driving idea. Than once you feel up to it start switching lanes. Hope this will help.

have your side view mirrors angled down a little bit. this way youl be able to see where your wheels are in relation to the side of the road or the lane lines.



you just have to relax. being behind the wheel can be scary and intimidating. but trust me, the more you drive the more comfortable you get and the easier it becomes. it will feel more natural. but you gotta be real careful about those stop signs. just relax. it sounds like youre so stressed out worrying about everything around you, that you dont pay attention to whats in front of you. like i said. it all gets easier. definitely drive with someone else the first few times and take it slow. youl be feeling comfortable and driving safe in no time.

Try the Yellow Pages or simply Google it.
My reason for responding though was to say do not use a Karcher on the engine.
This is a jet wash and water will get into your electrics and every place it can find.
A steam clean is more of a dry heat that mostly evaporates without saturating the engine and in any case is the only way to shift the grease.

If you've got the money to buy one and roads twisty enough to make the most of the sweet chassis, I would highly recommend you get one. The Elise is not massively powerful or supercar fast, but it is probably one of the best handling sportscars out there.

<question>



Is anyone here a lorry driver (in the UK)?



I'm thinking of becoming a lorry driver as I've heard that you can potentially earn good money.



There are loads of websites advertising 5-10 day training courses to pass your 'Class C' and'Class C& E' lorry driving tests.
They don't give prices but I've heard from people they rip you right off.



Has anyone ever used one of these companies to pass? How much did it cost roughly and how much do you earn on an average week now you are qualified?



A friend has said of mine told me that if you get a job with Robert Wiseman they pay for your test but you have to work for them for 2 years, does anyone have any more info on this?



I need a better paid job!
Many Thanks

A training course should only last 5 days, typically you start on a Monday and take your test on the following Friday. I did my HGV Class II, now called / known as LGV " C " in May 2004, it cost me 600 quid. In Feb this year I did my LGV C+E ( formerly known as HGV class 1 ), this was more expensive, at 900 quid, inc the test fee. The question to which I don't know the answer, is, how much it will cost you to train directly for attaining the C + E licence ? However, most drivers would recommend you take your C licence ( rigid vehicles ) first of all, and gain some experience, before taking your C + E . Re. wages, all companies pay about the same ( unless you get a job in a more specialised area eg. chemical tankers or car transportation ), but the wages will depend on whether you do " nights out " ie you sleep in the lorry and are away from home, if so, for how many nights ?  Also depends on things such as does the company pay you bonuses such as a load bonus  ?  whether your on a basic plus overtime, or just an hourly rate and so on. You can expect to earn anywhere from 300 quid a week to 450 quid after tax ie. in your pocket.(but to earn 450 Im away from home Mon until Friday and you will work @ 60 hours a week) . The difference between our artic drivers and rigid drivers is only about 1500 quid a year.

Inside storage is a sensible option, it costs a bit but the damage done by leaving it outside may well cost a lot more or even damage it beyond repair. If your motorhome is brand new, I would surmise it cost a considerable amount of money and as such I would protect my investment they best way I could, I guess this really goes for a used one also. Save £500 on storage but suffer £2000 worth of damage. Motorhomes are an expensive piece of equipment which usually hold their value, but any damage however minor will affect resale value if and when you come to sell it. A well looked after motorhome will always draw top resale money.

If you must leave it outside a breathable cover is a good bet. A cover that does not come into direct contact with the roof or body is even better, which is why most owners prefer to put theirs in a shed or garage.



My neighbour does not have the luxury of a storage building so he just builds an enclosure around his for the winter and covers it with construction plastic. The cover is vented and is supported at key points by struts attached to the motorhome.

they do pay more.



1. exotic cars typically need higher-octane grade fuels, which are more expensive.
2. they stop at the gas station more often.



hence, they pay more. you can't price it higher for them. it's the same gas  that was made regardless of what car it goes into. it's like asking them to pay more than you do for their mcdonald's value meal. you don't punish them for being rich. they just have to pay more taxes, that's it.

Why should they ? The fuel consumption of a vehicle automatically penalises owners of vehicles which consume a lot of fuel because tax and duty on fuel is a massive proportion of the cost. Sports and exotic cars are not necessarily more uneconomical than even large family saloons and driving style is the biggest factor in poor fuel consumption. There are probably arguments for very strict safety checks on performance cars but straight taxes on a 'type' of vehicle are a very unfair way of influencing buying decisions. Perhaps the fools who buy Prius type vehicles should be penalised for being so naive in thinking that they have made an environmentally sound choice. Whole life environmental impact assessment is the only way to fairly link product purchases with some kind of tax.

I tend to drive sporty cars and i have to fill up with higher octane fuel,and pay more on insurance and taxes.
But to be fair i get 17mpg driving slow but there are plenty of trucks and cars and lorries etc which get less mpg than me and even someone driving a smaller car fast all the time.
Driving a sporty car makes you take it out less due to fuel cost so better for the enviroment,than someone with higher mpg driving all the time.
Owning a sporty cars restricts you driving long journeys so is on the road less.So to be fair its a punishment in its own right owning a sporty car.

Question about types of headlights (cant figure how to ask it here)?



Just out of curiosity, like especially when im driving down the road. Some cars when im driving have headlights that aren't like normal headlights, they have a low tone and kind of a blue tint maybe even gray and im trying to find out what type of headlights those are. I know they aren't halogen for the least. Pretty much they almost don't even look like normal lighting and only certain types of cars have them. I was just seeing if anyone knows exactly what im talking a about. I wish I could be more descriptive but im open to your answers. Thanks =)

Yep the blue ones. If your car uses a halogen bulb then you can pick a set up at walmart for your car for around 40.00. I think they are bluestars or something , read the package you can't miss them.

they're high-intensity discharge or H.I.D. lighting systems. think if it as the fluorescent bulb and socket and your typical halogen bulb is the incandescent bulb to house lights. it uses less power and shines brighter, but because they're a pretty new technology, they cost more. most high-end variants of cars and almost all luxury brands have these installed out of the factory, but they usually don't have the purple-ish tinge (basically because the purple-ish ones aren't safe anymore, they're too bright and actually are more of a bother to the oncoming cars than lighting up the road in front of you). you can buy those as aftermarket parts, though.

How much does it cost to get your driver's license in Michigan?



If you already took your driving skills test and got your certificate of completion, then you're next step is to take it to Secretary of State and get your license. Well, my question is, how much does it cost at SOS to get it?

That's what I thought, but I went to get it and they didn't charge me anything. She noted all of my documents, took my picture, gave me my paper license and let me go... I thought it would cost something and I read that it cost $25 but I wasn't charged... (which is good on my part, I guess)

I agree with the others to definately speak with the principal. This is totally unacceptable. What was the other bus driver thinking? This happened to my younger brother when he was about 6. He kept telling the bus driver this isn't my stop and the bus driver told him yes it is and to get off the bus. The bus driver had the two Michael's confused. Thankfully some nice old woman saw my brother sitting on the curb crying and drove him home. I really can't remember what happened with the bus driver..this was about 22 yrs. ago. Yes accidents happen but not like this and especially with young children. Plus how could it be an accident if the other bus driver KNEW??

At the next school board meeting, go to it and tell them you want some good answers about this. Also the driver should be confronted about it and reprimanded. If they don't give you any satisfaction go to the news media. They love stuff like that and the schools hate it.

Call the school and talk to the principle and who ever is over the bus drivers and raise heck.  It is up to the teachers to see that they get on the right bus and it was also up to the bus driver to tell them he was on the wrong bus.  Here the teacher puts a color on the back of the hand of a child that rides the bus that matches a color on the window of a bus to make sure they get the child on the right bus.

In this situation I think I would make an appointment to talk to the principle of the school and CALMLY express your situation and make it a point to stress that your intention is to prevent this from happening again to someone else's child.



Maybe a suggestion could be to pin a color coded cloth or piece of paper on the child's shirt and have the matching color in the front window of the bus. Or something that gives a visual que to the child to help them get on the right bus for at least the first week of school.



Good luck, I know I would have gone BALLISTIC if it would have been me, so you did good:)

anything not bolted in.  clothes, food, anything.  also, spare tire, jack, handle.  only use a gallon or two of gas, it'll save you 150 lbs vs full.  if you know how, all the seats that you are not using can be pulled.  usually only 4 bolts holds each one.

Consult your cars owners manual. The higher the octane the slower the fuel burns. Slow burning generates more heat. Some cars need High octane fuel High Compression Superchargers and Turbocharging Corvette, GTO's Nissan 350Z Maximas Muranos all reccomend high octane. Running those cars on low octane will cause spark knock ping and dieseling. Most modern cars adjust for fuel to some extent so running low octane can cause less gas milage. I suspect your Chrysler 300 runs fine on 87 octane.

<answer>



Most vehicles require regular "87" octane gas and using a higher octane rating will most likely not give you better fuel mileage.



While higher octane gas is required in some vehicles, its use is to prevent "knocking or pinging" within the engine of your vehicle.



Using a much higher octane rated gas when it is not required can cause the fuel to not burn completely.



This results in poorer fuel economy.



Some vehicles require this higher octane gas and not using it can leave one with undesirable results.



As always, consult your owners manual.

If you do not experience preignition ("spark knock") then drop one grade of fuel and use the entire tank.  When your engine develops the characteristic rattle of pre-ignition, go UP one grade level of fuel.



If you have the owner's manual or can ask a nearby Chrysler dealer, go with factory recommendations.

Laurence B. is right: you can'.t convert a gasoline engine to diesel; you have to swap the engine in it for a diesel. This will be very expensive; perhaps near the value of the car, if you have it done by a competent mechanic. Since good mechanics are always busy, you may not find any willing to do it in your area.

Can you do asphalt work on a rainy day?



It is supposed to rain after noon today.  My fiance works at the airport (small for personal jets, crop dusters, etc... not for commercial airlines).  They are making 2 new strips and the asphalt was supposed to be laid down today.  I just wonder if he will get to come home early or if if he wont work because you can (or cant) do asphalt on a day that there will be 90% chance of rain.  He just left...and Im hoping he comes home! :)
Thanks!

Unless the rain is really torrential then it's no problem.



Hot asphalt is laid using wet rollers and the water just boils off. In heavy rain it just means that the rollers don't need spraying. Torrential rain though can cool down the asphalt too quickly as it's being laid, but even then there are ways to adjust the mixture, laying speed and temperature to offset most of the problems.



Road gangs generally will do all they can to complete the job, when I used to do it no laying meant no paying!

Of course everyone is nervous.  You get nervous when you drive with your parents b/c your afraid of messing up.  You get nervous when you take your driver's test.  But those things are petty, b/c they lead to the excitement of getting your license, getting a car, getting from A to B w/o parents!  Its a sign of independence.  Everyone is nervous at first!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Everytime I get to set someone straight about a tuned car, is the most fun.



For example, putting a turbo on a car, is not tuning it. Changing the wheels, is not tuning it. An intake, exhaust, etc, is not tuning.



All these things simply modify or replace original parts.



Unless the car has sat on a dyno for weeks, as you adjust every bit of fuel mapping, or suspension rebound, or camber angle, etc.......the car isn't tuned.



And then I laugh as the poor kids realize that they're complete tools and don't understand the first thing about cars.



Source(s):



I own several tuned vehicles. My pride and joy is my 1988 Supra Turbo, which competes in autocross racing. Has taken 3 years and several engine rebuilds to get the optimal performance.

I only want the radar to go off when a cop has theirs on.. i DONT want it to go off at security and alarms.. i could care less about them.. it is a 12 band radar detector and i dont know how to turn off which bands i should..



Detects 6 radar, 4 laser and 2 safety signals. Radar signals include X Band, K Band, Ka Superwide, Ku Band, VG-2 and Spectre. Laser signals include LTI 20-20, Ultra Lyte, ProLaser and ProLaser III. Safety signals include Safety Alert® and Strobe Alert®.

turn down the volume for one...that can get annoying...



now if you start shutting off bands, you start shutting off your security.



typically cops use KA and K, so if you just want the bare minimum, kill the X, and KU bands...the safety alert is for ambulances, so you probably want that one left on...



good luck

How easy is it to do this ?



Have speed restrictors placed on all our company vehicles to stop employee's thrashing them up and down the motorways ?
Is it a straight forward procedure for a mechanic ?
Or maybe even have it so they cannot go over 3000 revs in each gear ?

it is a reletively straight forward operation to have restictors fitted. the initial outlay could be costly, depending on the size of the fleet, however with the reduction of fuel consumed at a lower restricted speed it would soon pay for itself. also the enviomental benifits and road safety should also be considered. I drove a mini bus the other week which was restricted to 62 mph, and it stopped me thrashing it up and down the motorway.

you could also equip theses vehicles with a GPS tracking. It connects to a central computer, where you can track the speed whereabouts and all. probably cheaper than restrictions so if you monitor someone going over a certain rpm of mph you can reprimand them. and track where they go as well just in case!

Can't stand pressure in driving test.?



I know the answer will be that a lot of people have the same thing, but i seriously have the problem of not being able to take the pressure, I took a test in march and failed as examiner was really strict and didn't explain properly for 1 serious mistake something about the car behind me having to change lanes to get in front of me (isn't that just overtaking).



But since that i have went in normal lessons 1hr 38 without a single minor. The moment somebody else gets in the car ( friend of instructor ex examinor) i made 7 serious and 6 minors then i made 4 serious 2 minors. Its not just him, its the moment i amtold its a mock test etc. as i have been with 4 instructors



All instructors gave up on me, as there is nothing else they can teach me i can drive but cant stand the pressure of being assessed on my driving.



What do i do?



</question>



<additional details>



Its not the fact that i ***** and moan or that i act like a kid i am actually quite mature it's the fact that it is something i cannot find a way around dealing, thats why i am asking for a way, so that was a bit of a useless answer

I think you are trying much too hard. Get a friend to go with you to practice. Get used to having someone in the car. Don't concentrate on the details, just drive and relax. Stop trying so hard to not make mistakes. It might take you a little longer than most, but you can do it. Good luck.

You have to consider exactly how this affects your driving - if you can only drive well dependent on who is in the car with you, then you obviously aren't driving to the required standard.
Everyone gets nervous during tests, the examiners are used to this & mark your performance accordingly.

You need to learn to relax about who is in the car.  Train yourself to only worry about the road.  Have some more lessons, make sure you get as many different people in the car as possible all the time.  In the end you WILL relax and you WILL pass your test.



If an instructor gives up with you then they are bad teachers.
BSM were very patient with me.



I was so nervous in my lessons I sweated buckets and left the seat wet every time.  Out of lessons I was ok.  So nervous the 1st time I failed and left it for 10 yrs.
2nd time  I thought...oh well...if I fail I'll just keep on till I do pass, and if I make a mistake I won't worry I'll just continue the test.  Passed with flying colours.
Don't give up!!!

As Big Poppa Worm says



There are far too many variables



I drive an older model Corsa 1.0 (1999)



So because of that I'm in the lower bracket for Road Tax .



I only pay £15 a month for insurance



but that's because I'm not- so- young ,



and have had a Driving licence since 1989,



I've also got many years of no -claims bonus,



Although I do live in the city Glasgow,



even here Insurance costs vary according to postcodes



To conclude  - A Corsa is one of the cheaper cars to run



overall,,especially if the engine size is a 1.0 L

re-post your question giving the following details and we sill still only be able to give you a very vague idea:



Engine size, model, transmission, year of manufacture of the corsa, security devices. Your age, sex, licence held for how long, any convictions, any accidents, any "no claims" bonus, insured on any other car, details of anyone else to be insured on your car, where you live, where you keep the car at night, where you work, what occupation you do, where your car will be parked in the day, what you will use the car for, how many miles a year you expect to do.............

there not enough info really what size engine it is, how old is the car, has or will be serviced regularly, where it will be driven ie motorways o round town, how it will be driven ie like and old lady or a boy racer, will they slow for speed bumps, will they slow down for corners, etc



then you have the driver are they young or old, male or female, have they had any accidents, or points on their licence etc

Which is better when thinking about fast cars?



A Bugatti Veyron, An Ascari A10, A Caparo T1 or An Ariel Atom



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A Bugatti Veyron top speed is 253 mph, and goes 0-62 in 2.5 seconds.



An Ascari A10 top speed is 220 mph, and goes 0-60 in 2.8 seconds.



A Caparo T1 top speed is 205 mph, and goes 0-62 in 2.5 seconds.



An Ariel Atom top speed is 140 mph, and goes 0-60 in 2.7 seconds.



So those are the facts but the  "Ultimate Aero TT" is the fastest production car with a top speed of 256 and 0-60 in 2.7 seconds

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



The 1.0 version should average around 50mpg - the book figures vary from 48mpg to 53mpg dependant on model & age, so at 110p per litre, or £4.90 per gallon, equates to about 10p per mile (9.8 to be precise).
This equates to 17.7 litres/100km, or 0.177l / km. (0.285l / mile)

This a bit of a "how long is a bit of string" question.
Making the assumption that you are in the UK, depends on who's driving it, how they're driving, where they're driving, what time of the year,etc.
A good guide, particularly if you are to do lots of urban driving, is to take the Govt. published consumption figures and HALVE them.
This should give you a fairly accurate figure for what the car will achieve out there in the real world, as opposed to on a test track or in some experimental laboratory.

BUT



Before we go ahead, let me tell you something.



Marketing is Vital aspect in any Industry (whether it is service Industry, Manufacturer, etc..) it is very important to have marketing aspect to run any industry smoothly without any hurdles.



But what is Marketing ?



Most people think that marketing is only about the advertising and/or personal selling of goods and services. Advertising and selling, however, are just two of the many marketing activities.



"Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, services, organizations, and events to create and maintain relationships that will satisfy individual and organizational objectives"



in simpler word marketing is "process"; marketing involves researching, promoting, selling, and distributing your products or services.



scope of marketing



i think if you analyse yourself with the above answer you will understand the scope of marketing yourself.

Why do some drivers feel the need to change lanes every five seconds?



Maybe they think the freeway is their personal NASCAR track, or maybe they think they are saving time by getting around the "slow" drivers.



Don't they realize that the reason why the traffic keeps braking and slowing down is because THEY keep changing lanes every five seconds?

Driving styles are a direct reflection of the personality of the driver. That's why bonehead drivers remain bonehead drivers throughout their entire lives. I share your rage on this one.



My bigger peeve is those who never use turn signals. They're indicators to the drivers around you of your intent - something the rest of us need to know to plan our next move. Just because you know that you're going to suddenly break and take a right doesn't mean we do.

Because they don't think the rules of the road apply to them. These same drivers are also guilty of getting as close to your back bumper as possible expecting you to move out of their way. If everyone would drive the correct speed limit there would be no need in passing and then the left "passing lane" would not be full of speed happy drivers.

stopping is not necessary, just be sure to vary your speed by 10 or 15MPH or so every half hour or so.  Keep it under 70.



The engine will be ok with whatever rest stops your human body requires.  Four hours is not too long without stopping.

It's not as important to 'Run In' a cars engine as it was 30 years ago, but as long as you keep it below 2,500 rpm and don't accelerate hard you will be fine.
Also the police advise you have a rest every 2 hours anyway, so you will be resting the engine too.
Have a good trip.

No problem, just make sure you don't drive at a constant speed.  Vary your speed and when it is safe behind slow down and then gently speed up again.  The idea is to allow the engine to wear itself in without being treated roughly.

Don't fall for the HHO generator scams.  The reasons they sell books on how to build and install them is because it doesn't do what one thinks.  It can create bigger problems that will in the long run cost more than the gas you save.



Books can be false and reliably produced. Generators that do not meet claims made are classified as false advertising and fraudulant therefore they could be sued and they probably will be sued if they every build and sell their product.



Duralube did this,  http://neptune.spacebears.com/cars/legal...
they claimed things this oil could do but after testing it it was not able to meet what they said.

it means that the gearbox is not engaged to a gear.



example if your in a manual car then you take it out of gear and let the clutch out if you rev the engine with the handbrake off (assuming your on flat ground) you wont go anywhere. as soon as you take it out od "neutral" and put it in first release the clutch and press the gas it moves forward. In an auto N is neutral and D,1,2,3,R are your driving gears.

When the car is in neutral, it means the shifter is in the center position that takes the transmission out of all pulling gear positions and the engine will run but the car will not move. In reality, the power from the  engine is disconnected from the rear wheels by the transmission and the car will not move but the engine will continue running. This is called NEUTRAL.

In some states and countries they're illegal if they're blue, because blue lights are reserved for emergency vehicles. In some states they're entirely illegal. Being as I don't know what state or country you are in, I believe the best thing to do is call your local police department's non-emergency number and ask them, they get calls asking what is and what isn't illegal all the time.

Does leaving the car running waste gas?



I was wondering if leaving the car running while waiting for someone saves more gas rather than turning it off and waiting for that person?



I've always been the one to turn it off, because I feel like my car needs a rest from the heat and because it seems to me that gas is being used even while it's idle.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



For a typical engine, it takes more gas to start an engine than it does to let it idle for about 3 minutes.



So, for saving fuel, if the errand is less than 3 minutes, then let it idle, if its longer, shut it down.  In cold weather you want to add about 50% to this, so about 4 1/2 minutes.



Also, starting an engine is one of the hardest things you can do to it, so a lot of engine start/shut-offs can actually make the engine wear faster.



As far as "rest from the heat", your engine is running the coolest when coolant (anti-freeze) is running through it.  Shutting the engine off stops the circulation of coolant and there is actually a rise in temperature right after you shut off the engine, again hard on it if this happens a lot.

Yes , it does wastes the gas. How ever if you feel you may need to move WITHIN 2-3 mins ( say: you are waiting for a  small trian to cross at the railways cross) then its wise to keep the engine running because it will waste more gas once you switch off the car and re-run it.



But... But, hold on if you find yourself  waiting fo some one or in a situation where you have to wait more than 2-3 min



, its better to switch off your car. Its nice to see people concerned and willing to save ennergy.

Yep, it is wasting the 3.30+ per gallon crap.  Even though you are not driving the car the engine still needs fuel to create the energy to turn the crank and cam shafts.  Without the fuel there would be no explosion when the spark plug shoots.  So ya it is wastin gas, turn the car off and save your self some money!!!

Why do we call it GASOLINE if it's a liquid?



I'm not asking about the name Petroleum, i want to know why the word "gasoline" is used to refer to that substance, when it isn't a gas, its a liquid.



Thanks :)

</answer from>



<answer>



The name is actually entirely made up. Before we started running cars on the stuff, it was just an annoying by-product of the lamp-oil distillation process which was sold as a cleaning product. Some nineteenth-century marketer came up with the slick chemical-sounding name and bottled the stuff.

No is the simple answer. they use more resources to manufacture than ordinary cars, the batteries life is too short, and disposal of the batteries and the electronics are a environmental disaster when the car is scrapped.



Add this to the fact that some hybrid cars don't even get very good fuel economy, and are just gimmicks to make people look caring. like that lexus 4x4 hybrid.



Get a VW Lupo diesel, 75MPG is better than ANY hybrid, and will last alot longer.

Travel card or oyster?



I'm in London, I'm going to be using the DLR to travel to Heron Quays, and then the tube from there to the West End. Then I will be going to a bar somewhere else which will require using tube and DLR again. And then I'll be using DLR once again to get home. I have an 18+ oyster card so I'm just wondering whether it would be better to buy a travel card on zones 1-2 for £4.90 or just simply use my oyster card. And does anyone know the rules of one day travel cards on oysters?

<answer>



I'd use the Oyster.



There are daily price caps on an Oyster which means that you should always be charged less than the cost of an equivalent one-day travelcard, irrespective of the number of journeys you make within a 24 hour period. The current off-peak price cap for zone 1-2 is £4.80, which is immediately 10p cheaper than the travelcard.



The other thing to bear in mind is that your journey might actually end up costing you less anyway if you use the Oyster. The total fares you incur in the day will be calculated on the journeys you actually make, so if you're not using it all that much you may never get anywhere near the price cap. With a travelcard you are automatically paying the maximum fare which may be wasteful if you're not extracting the maximum value from it.

If they are permenant then they are probably traffic counters,- they take the numberplate and compare it against another reading further up the road to work out the traffic flow speed.



If they are temporary (or possibly permenant, we just have temporary ones where I stay) they are probably speed cameras, work the same as above, but are used for enforcement, working out your average speed over the distance between the two sets.  The ones we have here are blue and yellow though? so probably just the first thing.

They're for traffic monitoring. The purpose is to feed traffic information back to the control centre to highlight slow moving traffic (i.e. traffic jams), and then to relay this information via various multimedia products.



That's where the info comes from when your local radio, for instance, says that "traffic is very heavy at such-and-such"

Yes I must say that is pretty impressive.  I read an article on the same vehicle.  I myself might be a little bit wary of spending $654,400 on a vehicle that started off with a bad history of overheating.  It's not like you pull up to ARCO in that thing to add water.

what the hell is your instructor on? People don't have their fate sealed when they are born. You learn to drive, you are not born to drive. Besides, driving is a privilege, not a right. Your instructor is smoking something besides cigarettes lol

My immediate comeback to a statement like that might be something like: and so it is surely evident that you are not a born teacher.
She did not pull that comment from her employee Manual OK?  Totally unjustified comments as such will do anything else but improve the morale of the student.  A rebuke and reassignment of a new instructor is warranted.  You don't have to take that from people that you are paying money to be instructed by.  I personally think that she has to be a little bit cracked to say something like that while someone else's driving.  You could lose your attention on the road and veer off the road and collide with a telephone pole on her side.  It sounds like it might nearly take that much knocking to put some sense into her head to think about what she is saying before she says it.  Just what to people know?  It is said that most of the time that Einstein spent in the classroom, was in the corner.  Don't sweat it.  The expression; bad apple in every bushel goes for teachers too.

The harsh response (which must not be said!) is that if after 8 lessons you are still learning to steer, she is not a born teacher!



Methinks you need another teacher.



I learned to steer on my father's lap when I was about 8 and could not reach the pedals.  There was a private road we could go up and down.  I did the same for my son, when I still saw him.



I presume you have done the clutch control (avoiding kangarooing), hill starts using the handbrake, gear changing and when and how to brake.  A useful exercise for steering control is the slalom - weaving around obstacles.  Use cardboard boxes and a quiet private road to practise this.



Once you have mastered this, try the same in reverse.  Don't worry about squashing the boxes - just keep going back to the supermarket for more.  Bonfire night coming up soon, so by the time you get it right, there should be a goodly pile.



Once you can handle the controls without thinking too hard, you can then concentrate on thinking about road hazards. You this with a running commentary of everything you observe coming up in front or behind you.



As for not being a born driver - well, we are all pretty hopeless at it when we start.  The most dangerous driver though is the one who thinks he or she can do no wrong.

That is an excellent car to begin driving with.  Being a new driver in such a small car, you must learn to be extra cautious of other vehicles.  New drivers need a little bit more room, so make sure to remain aware of all the surrounding vehicles.  I usually tell people to first by an indestructible car that they can't kill.  It is my advice to always stay clear of any large mass vehicles because they can flatten a car like yours and just buff out the scratches like they never hit a thing.

Where do you take your car if it dies?



...and you don't want to get it back in working condition? A junk yard? Are there any other alternatives to a junk yard, craigslist and basically any other obvious choices? If you leave your car somewhere, like an abandoned parking lot or something, can you get in trouble for that? My car broke down and it's very expensive to get it towed to a junk yard, but I didn't know if there was some kind of courtesy thing that went on. If not, I'll obviously pay for the tow truck to take it to a junk yard, I just wanted to know if there was a cheaper alternative.

there are a number of things at play here.



first, last year the gov changed the rules for calculating MPG, so a car like the cobalt xfe which is rated at 37 mpg this year witha  stick would have been rated at 44 the year that your car was made.



second, b/c americans like speed and power, until 2 or 3 years ago most advancement was going to speed and had nothing to do with MPG's, but we're finally getting that turned around.



third, cars are heavier right now than they were then in part b/c they have to meet higher safety standards than the cars did the year yours was made.  advancement means weight, weight means MPG lost.



fourth,  cars are also heavier now b/c they are bigger.  the ford focus today is larger than the original ford taurus.  the honda civic is bigger than the old accords and the corolla is bigger than the old camry.  all of them still get better MPG's than the original larger car did.  a taurus today is as big as a crown vic was and still gets better mpg's.

People are addicted to power, and won't sacrifice it for mpg. The car companies only make cars that people will buy, and sometimes they mix performance with mpg, and get a car that lots of people will buy, with a little of each. If lots of people were looking for just a straight fuel efficient car then the car companies would make them. Also, there is only soo much mpg you can get out of a gasoline engine.

If oil prices have dropped 'so low'..?



Why aren't the prices at the pump.. 'so low'?



I guess I would of expected that they would be in the $1.50/gal range or lower at the price of oil, am I wrong?



When oil prices shot up, gas prices shot up, so why when its so low now for a barrel is gas really not equivalent at the pumps?



I hope that makes sense?  But I have seriously been wondering it?

The gas you buy today was made with oil that was purchased by the refiner weeks, ago so there is a lag with the gasoline price.  Also there is cost associated with refining and market forces on gasoline that may not be reflected in crude oil prices.

If ya can belive it......



Until several years ago, the average price of diesel fuel was usually lower than the average price of gasoline. In some winters when the demand for distillate heating oil was high, the price of diesel fuel rose above the gasoline price. Since September 2004, the price of diesel fuel has been generally higher than the price of regular gasoline all year round for several reasons. Worldwide demand for diesel fuel and other distillate fuel oils has been increasing steadily, with strong demand in China, Europe, and the U.S., putting more pressure on the tight global refining capacity. In the U.S., the transition to low-sulfur diesel fuel has affected diesel fuel production and distribution costs. Also, the Federal excise tax on diesel fuel is 6 cents higher per gallon (24.4 cents per gallon) than the tax on gasoline

Diesel fuel and heating oil are the same thing. Seeing as cold weather is hitting many parts of the country, and many people did not fill their heating oil tanks this summer due to the increased prices, there  is a higher demand for diesel fuel / home heating oil that there is for gasoline right now.

Yes, because it has to power a compressor to make the cold air. That in turn reduces gas mileage by making the engine work harder.



At low speeds it is generally more efficient to have the windows down.



HOWEVER - at high speeds it is more efficient than having the windows down (windows down makes a lot of drag), although still uses up more gas than having the windows up and the A/C off. (Use economy mode whenever possible, econ mode does not engage the compressor and therefore does not cause the engine to have to work harder and therefore use more gas)

It depends on whether you are in stop and go city traffic or are on the highway at 60 MPH. City driving with the AC on uses more gas. Highway driving with the AC on uses less gas due to decreased drag from having the windows open.

The difference is tiny, but the answer is yes. Like all systems on your car, the A/C needs power to run and that has to come from somewhere. Ultimately it's going to be felt in your gas tank.



It's now getting towards the time of year when you really don't need the A/C switched on at all. I have the climate control set to a comfortable temperature and the A/C off. If the system needs cold air to adjust the temperature it can draw some in from outside where there's plenty instead of having to manufacture some of it's own.

any time you have a device that draws power from the engine it puts a higher work load on the engine, this in turn requires more fuel. this is one reason auto makers are working as much as possible to design cars lighter, the more weight you take off the less the motor has to work to move the car. this calculates out to better fuel mileage. Now a little bit about the EPA mileage, This is done in a controlled environment. They have All the accessories turned off and the car is running on a dyno with no wind resistance. at 55 mph for X number of miles. they then measure how much fuel is left in the tank (they start with a measured quantity) and calculate out how much fuel the car used. Based off this information they can then calculate out the MPG. now if they would drive the car as a normal person in the real world did, We would see mileage more common to what people calculate out. not the fictional number the EPA has developed.

to tell you the truth. i did quiet a few tests on this while i was in tstc for racing engineering. Yes it does use more gas but only by the oz per mile...  the answer is that your water pump creates more "drag" in power of the engine than the ac compressor. even though it is a pump that uses energy to drive freon through about 37 feet of aluminum lines, freon has a very low density, there fore not a whole lot of energy is used to "pump" it. so don't worry your windows being down create more drag against your vehicle, than using the a.c...



just to make my answer a little more complicated you can use a small electric motor like the one out of a rc car to pump freon. i could go on and  on about the chemicals and friction states of an engine. but i think you got your answer. thanks for giving me something to explain. i hope i was help to anyone.

the answer is simply YES
u ask why, let me tell u why
1st of all, u need power to operate the compressor on the AC and that power will definitely be taken from the engine CRANKSHAFT
and this mean that the engine will have an extra load beside to the whole weight of the car
so it maintain the same speed without losing power, the engine will use more FUEL to compensate on that
of course using AC will use more fuel on the same engines (1.3, 1.5 and 1.8) but engines larger than 2.0 will have a small effect on the fuel
becuase the engine is big enough to stand any load
hope i answered ur Q

Myth busters did do this and came up with a conclusion. Before 45 mph windows down and after 45mph windows up and AC on. It was not a HUGE difference but they did do it in a mid size ford SUV. For shorter trips it is better to go no AC, and yes AC fo longer trips.



They also tried drafting, that really does work- I have tried it and added 10mpg highway!

That would be expensive ... you can get E85 fuel which is 105 octane from many gas stations, and that will be much cheaper. You don't need to make your own alcohol-fuels when you can get them at the gas station!

Sounds like one of those stories generated by old men that have nothing better to do than try to impress the young'uns. Pure Methanol has been available for ages for use as a racing fuel and has always been inexpensive. To distill methanol from windshield wiper fluid would require a still and so much labor along with the cost of the wiper fluid that this story is just that, a story.

Car dealers used to get methanol in 55 gal. drums to dilute and use as washer fluid. It had blue dye in it.but you could still run it,and it was easily available. some guys would use that as the base for their home made racing fuels.I've heard of using mothballs to get higher octane,it didn't ,the naphthalene actually lowered the octane rating. and model rocket fuel is more expensive then nitromethane racing fuel too.If your around cars long enough,you hear these stories now and then. here's an interesting article on how to make a still to make your own E85.

In 1929, American Paul Galvin, the head of Galvin Manufacturing Corporation, invented the first car radio.



The first car radios were not available from carmakers. Consumers had to purchase the radios separately.



Galvin coined the name "Motorola" for the company's new products combining the idea of motion and radio.

they are ok but ive found when dealing with them in the past that they give you a car whith hardly any fuel in so the first place you have to go is a petrol station which isnt fair, just make sure you give it back with none in!



i had one once and it ran out of fuel on the way to the station which was a mile down the road!



sometimes if you ask nicely they will give you a slip of paper for a tenner to use at the station but that very rarely happens!

Idling in the driveway to warm up the engine does nothing to prolong the life of the engine and wastes fuel.  Start and drive.



Modern cars are designed to be used in all weather conditions.  There is no reason to warm them up before you drive them, unless it is to defrost the windows.



There is no need to warm up the oil.  You are using multi viscosity oil in the engine.  If you are using the correct weight oil for the weather conditions, there is no need to warm the oil.  The engine has enough lubrication to be driven as soon as the oil pressure light goes out or there is oil pressure registering on the gage.  This is usually about 1 second on a well maintained engine.



By starting and driving, you will be doing more good than harm to your engine.  First, by idling in your driveway, you are causing normal wear and tear on your engine, but it is doing NOTHING.  Next, idling in your driveway makes your engine warm up more slowly.  When the engine is cold, the fuel injection adds additional fuel to the fuel / air mixture.  This causes more carbon buildup in the engine and gets more contaminates in the oil.  By starting and driving, your engine is up to operating temperature much faster and this rich fuel air mixture cycle is much shorter.



Now, the biggest reason not to idle in the driveway to warm up.  Think about it.  When you are idling in the driveway, you are getting ZERO miles per gallon.  It doesn't get any worse than that.



I live in northern Wisconsin were the winters can be quite harsh.  The temperature can get well below zero in the middle of winter.  I have been starting and driving my cars without warm-ups for decades without any problems.



My current cars are a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am and a 2000 Chevy Malibu.  I bought both of these cars new.  The only time I warm them up is to remove frost.  I have never had any problems from driving them like this.

warmup time should be just enough to get the oil circulating to the valve gear. In summer that is 15 seconds!! In winter, with winter oil, take about 30 seconds. Then DRIVE OFF GENTLY. You still have to warm up the running gear. Your 10 minutes of idling is a collossal waste of money and causes much more wear on the car than driving off after 30 seconds. It also pollutes the air! The only exception is when your windows are frozen over; then you may neeed to run a little longer so you can see out.  your car warms up best and quickest while you are driving it. You can drive your car any time you want, you don't need to warm it up if it's in good condition. If it stalls when you put it in gear then you need to warm it up a few minutes.



Most people warm up their cars not because of the engine but it's SO cold they want the heater and defroster to be working when they hop in. There's nothing worse than driving in the cold with no heat.

bumping would be the tires bad or wasnt balance right... theres a test put car in drive but give no gas just let it roll what you will feel will be bad tire or wheel either in hands or butt... now if you drive it over 45 mph that will be tire balance so first thing is to go back and have them rebalance and check for a bad tire and you could look at shocks or struts many times when they go bad the will leak some oil and be wet looking which easy to look and see... best anytime one gets new tire the front end shoul dbe check to save the tires life and make the ride better

You'll find a massive difference - the steering will probably be heavier, the brakes poorer, it will probably stall more easily, the gearbox & clutch will feel very different.



Be prepared to spend the entire lesson just getting used to your car, and then practice regularly between lessons - don't switch back & forth between cars, you'll struggle to compensate for the differences.

But apart from that make sure of the followings:
the tyres are not flat
lights are working



indicators are working
L plate clear on the front and back of the car
you MUST have an interior mirror on the examiners side and also headrest

MAKE SURE you have a spare interior Mirro for the Instructor or they will be forver leabing their's in your car !!

Apart from the obvious things like making sure is legal and insured and road worthy then its just a case of getting used to a different car.  If your car is quite old then it will not have power steering so it will be very heavy to steer when going slowly.  Enjoy your lesson and don't be afraid to go back to your instructors car if you don't feel happy.

How are traffic lights' times coordinated?



Can two traffic lights in the same city (a relatively small city) have different timings? Who decides on these issues?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Traffic lights have three different types of coordination that dictate how they operate.  The first would be a simple timed controller which the local controller (usually a large box mounted on one of the traffic light polls at an intersection) has a timer that cycles the red and green lights at a set duration.  Also utilized are magnetic loop sensors embedded into the asphalt at the beginning of an intersection that will detect presence of cars and then eventually change the light from red to green. it can use a combination of these sensors, timers and programming dependent on time of day to determine which direction of traffic to prioritize to reduce congestion and delay.  Lastly there are coordinated lights that are part of a network of traffic lights in a specific area designed to stay green at the same time for example.  Lastly, the network of lights often in cities can be controlled by a central control center to control speeds or relieve congestion.  See link below for all of the different possibilities....

Couple questions about Nitrous for my car?



For a 4 cylinder engine...



What preparation for the engine would be necessary if a 100 shot or 150 shot of nitrous was installed? I know if i just did a 50 shot that the stock parts can handle it.
(This would all be professionally installed and tuned)



Also do nitrous kits have everything needed or are more additional parts needed? such as this kit:
http://www.andysautosport.com/hyundai/20...



And last, can someone tell me more about wet and dry systems and the advantages and disadvantages of each?



No negative answers, just ones which will help. Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



For a 4 cylinder engine, you may want to go to forged pistons, connecting rods, and crankshaft if you are going over 100 horse power.  This is a must if you are going to 150+ horse power.



Also, you need to make sure the rest of the drive train is up to the task.  Your drive train is only as good as its weakest link.  Make sure the clutch, transmission, differential, and axles are up to the task.  Install stronger parts as necessary.



In higher horse power applications, a wet system is better.  A wet system adds more fuel to the mixture.  A dry system depends on the fuel injectors to add the additional fuel.  In higher horse power applications, a dry system may not be able to keep up with the additional fuel requirements and may lean the engine out.  This could cause burned valves or pistons.



The additional fuel from a wet system will make more power.

Scratching a car is not like scratching the paint on the garage door. It's only natural your parents are going to be very angry ...I would be too.



However, the fact that you've taken time to write here and ask for advice on what you can do to help, shows that you're really sorry. In that case, I would offer your parents to pay towards the repair work.

There are several ways to do this.



a) the backup plan... If you get stopped on a hill and are in a panic, put emergency brake on, Then when you go to take off, give it gas, ease clutch out and when you feel it start to pull forward, release the emergency brake.



b) Once stopped, keep the car in position by giving a little gas and also a little clutch out. not enough to move forward, but enough to stop roll back.



c) When you get better, You'll just stop like normal, and when lite changes you will take left foot off brake, push in clutch, give gas and slowly release clutch all very fast. it will be second nature and is the normal way of doing this.



You need to go to parking lot that has a hill in it, and on off hours practice. that's how i taught my wife and she does great !

Well theres a couple of ways to handle this.
i live in the flattest state in the world but we have a bridge so i get my practice there.



Anyways the way i found easiest to learn was



hold the parking brake with the buttom pressed in and then pretend to go.
as in let the clutch out and add the gas when your confident that you have it so it wont roll back on you let the parking brake down and then just go.



i'd suggest you find a hill that isnt crowded so that you can practice with out hitting some car behind you.

Then you "don't" know how to drive one.  This is one of those areas of skill.



Try using the handbrake to hold the car with one hand on it ready to release it slowly as the clutch grabs the engine more(slowing it down)- as you will have to add a bit of gas to increase engine speed higher than idle speed.



As you release the park brake you should feel the car move forward instead of backward and continue to stay running - instead of stalling.



Remember that control of the clutch pedal is what controls the contact between the engine and the wheels.



Slow release will keep the engine going until the wheels grab.



A quickly released clutch(or dropping the clutch) will either cause the wheels to spin or stall the engine.



You want to find the happy medium with minimal rollback.



And it varies on every hill (because they have different slopes).



Or try on lesser hills....stopping and starting.  It is very repetitive (but it is thru repetition that you learned to tie your shoelaces.)



Off road on gravel roads, do it where you don't hear the tires spin out in the gravel.



Later, this skill you learn here (of listening to the engine) will help you greatly in the winter snow as a "spinning tire gets no traction - whereas one that rolls slowly will pull you through".



I always think about it when coming to a stop on a hill.  It is not the preferred  place to stop for one and what am I carrying or towing at that time which adds additional weight to the starting power required to pull the car forward, and road conditions - dry pavement/wet/gravel/or snow.



Got to remember you want the tires to "turn or roll forward" not spin out.



Once you start spinning, you have lost the traction.

Reporting someone for towing a car!?



My mom is a nurse and had a meeting today. She parked at the nursing home next door, which is usually ok. She came out of the meeting to find that her car had been towed. This is now setting her back $190.00. It is not her fault, its the nursing homes. They have been reported before for elder abuse and filth. I want to report them again, even if unrelated... it makes me feel better knowing I might get them shut down. They deserve this! Who can I report them to? They are filthy, scum.

Ford Ranger Sport truck 3l compared to 4l?



I have heard that Ford will not be coming out with a 3l for 2009, just 4l.



My question is for the 2008 models, is there any different in gas mileage comparing a 3l to 4l? i've looked at sticker window and it shows both pretty much the same and on fuel economy website it shows you get better mileage overall with the 4l.



That's hard to believe.



Is the 4l a gas guzzler?

the toyota tundra maxi cab and the dodge ram mega cab are about the same size.  the rear seats are more comfy than the front ones on both of them b/c of all the room in the truck... but you loose some carrying capacity with that option b/c of the extra weight of the truck.



typically a crew cab and a quad cab are standard 4 door trucks, which are probably the best all around.



personally i like the F-150 and the Tundra quad cab as both offer true 6'+ beds with a crew cab vs the 5 footers the other companies use.

Ouch! Not sure because I don't have an RV but I know with all types of automobiles, the faster you go over 55 your likely to waste about 23 cents per gallon so if they are all highway miles that might cost you quite a bit.

What's the best way to park a trailer and live in it for a year?



The trailer has been garaged since July, with the slide-out extended & all hookups connected. It is level & pretty stable. I am worried about whether the tires will be any good by next June when we move out of it. Would jacks, cinder blocks, etc., work to take weight off the tires and still be solid enough for us to live in? Or would it be easier to just write off the tires (about 5000 miles on them) and replace them next summer?

Typically when a trailer is level, most of the weight is off of the tires. But to be safe, replacing the tires is not a bad idea.

My trailer (27" toy hauler) sits in my driveway year round with quads and a dune buggy inside it. I have not changed the tires since I bought it 4 years ago. Unless the side walls start to crack on the tires, don't worry.

Jack it up and put cinder blocks under it. This takes a lot of the weight off of the tires. It actually makes staying in the trailer feel more sturdy. (Less rocking) We lived in a trailer for about 5 months last fall.

There are 75 countries that drive on the left (or as the British say, "The correct side of the street"), which include the UK, Japan, Jamaica and others.



Why do they drive on the left? Because that was the standard set by the Romans, who built the first roads in Europe



In fact, some (e.g. C. Northcote Parkinson) believe that ancient travellers on horseback generally rode on the left side of the road. As more people are right-handed, horsemen would thus be able to hold the reins with their left hands and keep their right hand free—to offer in friendship to passing riders or to defend themselves with swords, if necessary



The first legal reference in Britain to an order for traffic to remain on the left occurred in 1756 with regard to London Bridge. The Highway Act 1773 contained a recommendation that horse traffic should remain on the left and this is enshrined in section 78 of the Highway Act 1835.



In the late 1700s, a shift from left to right took place in countries such as the United States, when teamsters started using large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. The wagons had no driver’s seat, so a postilion sat on the left rear horse and held his whip in his right hand. Seated on the left, the driver naturally preferred that other wagons pass him on the left so that he could be sure to keep clear of the wheels of oncoming wagons. He did that by driving on the right side of the road



The British, however, kept to the left. They had smaller wagons, and the driver sat on the wagon, usually on the right side of the front seat. From there he could use his long whip in his right hand without entangling it in the cargo behind him. In that position, on the right side of the wagon, the driver could judge the safety margin of overtaking traffic by keeping to the left side of the road. Countries that became part of the British Empire adopted the keep-left rule too, although there were some exceptions. Canada, for example, where the maritime provinces and Vancouver (later to become British Columbia) drove on the left, eventually changed to the right in order to make border crossings to and from the United States easier. Nova Scotia switched to driving on the right on April 15, 1923. During World War II, American truck makers Ford, Chevrolet and Chrysler built 'Canadian Military Pattern' [CMP] trucks for use throughout the British Empire and most were right hand drive to use in left hand traffic countries

About a quarter of the world drives on the left and the majority of them are old British colonies.



Its a throwback to olden days when everybody travelled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies.  Swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.



It was also easier for right handed people to mount/dismount horses on the left - better than on the right and onto the path of oncoming traffic.

"Rhymes with orange" has done his homework.
In Australia we drive on the left, seated on the right side.
For Stephen K and others with a similar opinion,  I would feel very much out of place if I had to change gear with my RIGHT hand. I would be "all at sea"- until I had enough practice.



Same thing.
It's all a matter of how you learned. There is absolutely no problem at all driving on the left for someone who has always done so.
I fly. I sit in the left seat. The left hand is on the control column. That's not a problem either. A light aircraft is controlled in flight solely by the left hand most of the time. The right is for throttle, propeller, flaps, trim, whatever. There is no time when it is necessary to use both hands for the job.
When you need to use both hands for something in the cockpit, you fly NO hands, often. That's illegal in cars.
In the end it boils down to be rather like the "Which came first... the chicken or the egg?" dilemma.
One might also ask of Americans, why do they compulsively change the spelling of English words? It's English language!

Notice a pattern in the answers you're getting?



It's simple - 'everyone' is different - you should do whatever suites you. Don't be swayed by anyone else, including your instructor.



Driving schools will always try to persuade you that 2 hour lessons are best - but that's because that's what suits THEM! Some people find 2 hour lessons very hard because they get tired - some people find them just right.

Hiya. When I had mine years ago I had 2 hour lessons because then it gave my instructor a chance to talk to me and go through things and then for me to drive to further away places and try any parking etc that I needed to do and we drove around the place where I would be taking the test aswell. I did mine in the evenings in October and that was good as I was mostly driving in the dark and am used to it loads, which is good. Some people think 2 hours is to long but from personal experience I think its much more better and you get more out of it. If you have a hour ny the time your in the car and chatted to the instructor and the had a little drive and tried a few things its time to go back.

2 hour, definately



Add it up.



If you get 2 x 1hr lessons, at the start of each lesson you will be getting used to the car again and going over the last lessons work.



If you get 1 x 2hr lesson, you will be doing nothing but driving in the second hour, no need to get used to the car again, because you are still in it.

2 hours can get very boring!!



depends on the company/instructor too..some people make u drop back the previous student at the start of the lesson and pick up the next student towards the end of the lesson so you aren't learning new skills but it gives u time to drive around in general



u don't need much time to practise manouevers, they teach u it, u do it a few times and then move onto something new....
maybe get a few 2 hour lessons towards your test, but initially 1 hour is fine!

Likely he will keep it, and if he pulls you over again, you'll get the ticket at that point.  For now, as long as you kept your mouth shut and were polite, it's probably not going to go any further.

The fact is Peter, you did something illegal. The hard shoulder is for emergencies, not to save you five minutes of queueing.



Unfortunately there were probably about thirty others doing it at the same time and you were just the unlucky one.



Chances are you will get a letter but wait around two weeks to find out.

The traffic cop will write the incident up, that's a given. If you weren't given any tickets or documents then there will be no further action as a traffic cop must tell you about any further action that might take place against you for the offence as detailed in the ticket given to you. The ticket is a kind of receipt for you regarding the offence committed.

Morally, you should go back and talk to the driver.



Logistically, if the car was just parked, and you don't think anyone got your license plate #, you should probably do your best to forget about it.



You committed a hit and run, if you go back you will get caught for a hit and run.  Also your insurance will go up.



Rationally speaking, it makes more sense to not go back.

the right thing to do is go back. or at least call the police, tell them that you thought you ran over something but after you looked at your car you realized you hit something. if the other party does not make a report you will be fine. if they do and you get caught you will also be charged with leaving the scene of an accident or hit and run.

Typically cold air and exhaust systems help fuel/exhaust flow better which means more power which equals MORE gas used.



1. Make sure car is completely tuned up- plugs, airfilter, etc
2. Eliminate excess weight such as anything you don't have to carry around kept in your car.
3. Tires inflated to max pressure, balanced, wheels aligned.
4. Predict stops ahead by letting off gas, coasting to a stop, and trying NOT to use the brakes.
5. Accellerate slowly, do not punch the gas.



If the car is automatic transmission you will use more gas than a manual...not much can be done.

A 'hard ride' means fairly stiff suspension, which means you can feel each bump in the road, but you can go round corners quite quickly.  A 'soft ride', not unreasonably, is where you don't feel the bumps in the road but the car tends to wallow in corners.  Pays your money and takes your choice!

How many miles will my Punto do with 10 L of petrol?



well....im driving to oxford academy from ME2 3QF...and the return jouney....i need to know how many L of petrol i need....my Punto is a '95 1.1L engine



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A 95 punto with a 1.1 engine should spend 6,5l per 100km ( I'm adjusting because the age of the car should make him more thirsty, if it's perfectly maintained remove 0,5 L), that's 153 Km or 95 miles with 10L.

yokohama, pirelli, goodyear, bf goodrich.  all about the same level, generally one step behind the quality of a michelin tire, which has been rated the #1 replacement tire for eons.  you'll find that when you go look for tires, most of these companies are within a few dollars of each other, including michelin, so it may not help.



in my experience, toyo, hankook and kuzmo are a tier down in both traction and tread life.

I don't live in KY, but as far as I know, blue and red are illegal everywhere in the states. The reason is because the police use those colors, and it would make the cop lights less useful because people would be used to seeing blue/red lights all the time.

you do have to ask for one, most companies have it as an option now, it costs extra and requires that you have at least a midsized car.



if you want one, run down to walmart and buy a tomtom.  they are one of the better ones, you can get walmarts base one for about 150, or the same as 8 days of renting one, and then you'll have it for your own car and other things that you do.

When you reserve the rental car just ask if one is in the car. Most car rentals have them now, but ask anyway.

I know for a fact that Avis & Hertz do as well as budget. I myself rented a vehicle earlier this year in florida and paid an extra 12.95 per day for the GPS. I believe that one of the big companies have them installed as part of the rental.
