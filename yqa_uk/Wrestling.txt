Why are people complaining about Mike Adamle?



So what if he wasn't the best announcer. Are you gonna hold that to him for ever? Oh yea that's not childish at all (sarcasm). You know, Eric Bishoff was a crap announcer in WCW, but was a great GM in the WWE. Whats to say it won't be the same for Adamle (besides the Adamle not being in WCW). And if I get any answers sayin "Adamle sucks" or 'Wrestling is fake" I will report them.

15 year olds don't go around accusing others of being childish.



His poor announcing skills are because he cannot remember lines. That is one of the most important aspects of being in the WWE. It's why Lashley was held back, it's one reason why Jeff Hardy was held back before his drug issues. A man who cannot sell promos or his 'character' doesn't belong in the WWE.

Okay, I'm not gonna say "Adamle Sucks", cause that will mean I;m gonna get reported, but  for me, the reason why people are complaining about Adamle is that, sure he did  ECW for a few months and yeah okay, he  did  some interviews with some of the fans before  commentating, but  now hes become  Raw manager, these people are wondering what sort of matches he'll make for every week on Raw, whos going to get fired, and  how hes going to control the  Raw show.  I personally couldnt care less as to who is the manager really, just as long as  the action constantly runs for the  two hours its on.

If it was apparent at the time that Benoit killed his family, WWE would not have had the tribute show.  There still wouldn't have been an actual show, but I'm sure WWE would have mentioned his death, and then maybe shown some other WWE programming in it's place.

It still surprises me to this day that WWE ran the tribute show, as it's been reported that although WWE didn't know Benoit was the main suspect before the show aired, it's something they knew was a possibility.

Question about Stone Cold & Who throws his Beers?



I asked this like a few min ago but deleted it lol i put bears instead of beers.



Does anyone know who throws Austin his beers? It might be my total lack of athletic talent, but whether it's 5 feet of 50 they pretty much just throw it to exactly where his hand is. Is it the same person? Is it someone special or is just one member of the ring crew missing out on an NFL career?



This question is random and kinda stupid but its just something i've always wanted to ask. Again...i know its stupid lol.

I wish I could give you a more exact answer..but he does have a designated beer thrower. It's always the same guy, I forgot who he is..but I remember him mentioning that somewhere.

It's the same guy everytime which is why the throws are accurate...he has practice...

EDIT: I remembered where I read it..I read it in Stonecold's book..so I went back and looked it up again in the chapter where he talks about how the beer thing started in the ring.
The guys name is Mark Yeaton, he works for the WWE ring crew (the book has been out a while so I'm not sure if he's still there). But Mark is his designated beer tosser.
Stonecold says he gets most of them on target, and can usually catch them, but he sometimes drops them and sometimes Mark is a little off target.

Wow...I never thought about this, but what a GREAT question!  And you're right.  They are ALWAYS DEAD ON ACCURATE when they throw them to Austin.  Even though it's throwing beer, thatls pretty amazing...just as much as Steve catching them so easily.  I'd go with those who said ring crew.  Starred.

I'm not in High School yet but when I do go, I would like to have a handful of wrestlers as my BFFs. I would have John Cena, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy, Lita, and Mickie James as my friends, These 5 wrestlers seem to be very nice people in real life and they seem to have very interesting personalities. It would be very cool to walk alongside and pass highschool with them as my friends. It's interesting to see how wrestlers are in and out of the ring but to have them as your friend is a whole different interesting story

I'd want to be friends with John Cena, he seems like a pretty cool guy to hang out with.



Just from looking at their on-screen personalities, it's pretty easy to get a sense of what type of group some of the wrestlers would be in.
John Cena would be the star athlete who's one of the most popular kids. Triple H wouldn't be on a team but he'd still be seen as really cool by everyone else. Jeff Hardy would be part of the skater group. You know, kind of a nice guys but he's a little different. The Undertaker would be the quiet gut nobody would want to mess with. Mickie James would be one of the nice popular girls that everyone wants to be around. Melina would be one of the bitchy popular girls. The Miz would be that jerk who always seems to be around the cool crowd and you can't get rid of. Randy Orton would be one of the popular guys whose a total jackass to people who aren't popular. Kane would be that creepy goth guy who everybody is a little weirded out by. Edge would be kind of friends with everybody but he'd spread the gossip around. Batista would be one of those guys who spends every lunch hour in the weight room and takes gym class games way to seriously. Chris Jericho would be the type of guy who fits in with everyone.

You mean if they were students in my high school?



Well, I'm in college now and I was such a friendless loser in high school but supposing I went to high school with my college attitude, then you'd probably see me hanging out with Edge and Christian, or Paul London and Brian Kendrick, or sharing music with CM Punk and Alex Shelley (I know he's not WWE but yeah he IS still a wrestler).



I'd be trying to win a date with Lita or Roxxi, too. *swoon*

No I dont think so cause he has very limited moves in the ring but yes he is better than many overrated superstars in WWE(like Buttista).IMO he atleast deserves to be a US or IC champ but as for now he is not ready for Heavyweight championship.

considering that tomko is a mid-carder and not a main eventer, i don't think he is over or underrated. he does; however have the potential to become a great superstar. he just needs a couple of new moves to use. but he is definatley better than Cena and his "five moves of doom" but hope to see him in the main event soon

Do you agree with the following  reason that I give that wwe should not target kids as much as they have?



It ruined finaly's carrer. He was a hot heel with hornswaglle when he was a heel ! Then they  used hornswagle to target kids, while finaly could be a top heel right now with people being made that he used a midget to win. Bq:Do you agree that wwe should either let their be finsishis to a great match or not do them at all etc shows like smackdown and raw? Also do you agree that 2002-2005 was a good era? Still attiude is the best.

First of all, they need smackdown and raw because not everyone can afford the PPV's and those shows are a tradition dating back to the attitude era, which as you said, I agree is the best. Wtihout those shows there would be no more wrestling, and the kids are targeted because they're most likely to buy the action figures and memorabelia because those things are childish things. I also know that adults buy these things too, but children are the majority of the fans. Also, when I watched wrestling, I refused to let the fake factor ruin my interest in it, but once I was in high school, I could not help but notice all the fake and repetition night in and night out.

i think that WWE should lessen their target on kids a little, but it is better buissness wise to target the kids because most of their merchandice is what kids would be in to, thus when they buy the toy of say CM Punk, and find out he is on T.V. they will want to watch.
and if u mean main events then yeah. lots of the mains on a WWE weekly show have been preety boring as of late and they should put in matches like TLC on the weekly shows. i became a fan in 2005 and that was the best year for me.

Bret the Hitman Hart. Bret is a great Technical wrestler and can out move Dean Malenko's size. Once Hart gets Malenko on his stomach, SHARPSHOOTER!!!!!



In the end, a jobber like Val Venis will run into the ring and pick up the victory. Or the BOOGEYMAN,

Gonna go the other way from other answers
I think Malenko would win. Especially in his early days, he was a incredibly good technical wrestler but never really got a push because he wasnt given a gimic like Hart. Although Hart is one off my favourite all time wrestlers I dont think Malenko should be written off.

Let's see:



Jericho literally stole the belt from CM Punk so nobody really cares anymore



The IC belt is held by a comedian for 10 weeks now...



The tag team belts are held by the "agents" kids which is ok for the name appeal but Priceless vs Cryme Tyme isn't exactly a draw



HHH is trying to make new stars on Smackdown to bad none of them are worthy of the push.....and he constantly holds people down by his promo style of always insulting them....



The US championship isn't defended on tv or PPV at all



So clearly the most important belt right now is the ECW one which Matt Hardy holds.

WWE title, for some reason, people talk about and recognise it more.



I dont see why you cant email Aries instead of asking questions about her, she stars other peoples questions as well as mine, i dont see the big deal. People star if its a good question or star if they want other people to see it, just stop nit picking at something small, your making a big deal about something small. Geeze.

People admire the WWE and WHC belts the most because they are considered to be at the top of the mountain. To get one of those title, you rlly have to know wat ur doing and you have to be considered one of the most professional.



OK, but I find it strange that you used the same Qs as her. Also, its ur choice but in case u havent noticed only impersonaters use that avatar to impersonate her. DO you see anyone with my avatar? Didn't think so. Hannah is a good user, these days people havent been asking good Qs and it seems like her Qs are the best. The best Qs recieve the stars...I promise you that once good Qs e asked, I will star them (no offense to anyone). And if you had this much of a problem with me, y not e-mail me?
