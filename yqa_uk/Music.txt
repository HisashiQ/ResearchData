Does anybody know the name of this 70s/80s song?



The only words I actually remember, are something along the lines of,



'i wanna say i love you, but that would give away too much..'



Its a guy thats singing it and the words are probably a little different.

least time- gotta be between Rush, AC/DC or most any indie band. AC/DC are happy in their denim & t shirts, Rush just dresses casually on stage & indie band members just look like people you walk by on the street.



Most time- today: probably Tokio Hotel or most black/death metal bands
past: all the hair metal bands

Yup, and getting a lil nervous. Just cuz Barack has the lead right now people saying he going to win, but every state he's won so far, Kerry won last election, and still lost. He has to win at least 2 or 3 southern states to wrap it up!
Obama just won Ohio, you can pretty much call it over!

I've heard their two latest cds, and to be honest i used to be totally against them until i was forced to listen by a younger friend and realized that their actually not that bad. nick's voice is really whiny and annoying but if you can get over that and the fact that some songs are kinda cheesy, its pretty good stuff. Clean lyrics with good music :)

I heard a little bit on MTV awards, but it was when I was flipping through channels so I can't really say that that counts as listening to them, I heard the song for less then a second. I agree with you I don't play to listen to them any times soon, even though I'm sure that I wouldn't like them.

I can't 'belt out' songs?



Well at the moment, I'm trying to teach myself how to sing properly.
I'm doing well so far, I can sing in tune and with my diaphragm etc etc
But when I try and sing powerfully (like belting out songs etc) I can not do it.



I'm guessing there's just different muscles involved, and if I practice 'belting' out enough, I'll be able to do it eventually?



I can sing quite powerfully when I do it in an 'opera' voice actually, but I don't really want to use that singing style.

One of my favourite one's atm is A Boy Brushed Red.... by Underoath. The Getaway Plan are a really good band, their Other Voices, Other Rooms album is ******* awesome!



Also, anythin by The Used is really good, such as The Taste of Ink or Buried Myself Alive.



Look up bands like AFI, Boys Like Girls, Cute Is What We Aim For, Bullet For My Valentine (metal), My Chemical Romance etc.

Well I know you're wanting songs, but check out these bands.



Interpol, My Morning Jacket, Razorlight, Bloc Party, Band of Horses, Telepopmusik, Kings of Convience,The Cat Empire,  Royksopp, Eels, The Flaming Lips, Rogue Waves, of Montreal, The Whitlames, Mates of State, Iron and Wine, Stars, Citizen Cope, Copeland, The Frames, The Knife, Uh Huh Her, Rilo Kiley, Feist, Poe, Bernard Fanning, Blue King Brown, Sarah Blasko, Powderfinger, The Presets.



I also suggest checking out Pandora radio at www.pandora.com. You can type in any song or band that you love and they will make a personalized radio station for you. All you have to do is rate each song they throw your way so that they can be "in tune" to what you personally like. They do a great job at finding awesome unique bands/songs for just your taste! Its great. I don't know what I do with out Pandora at times.

A question about song lyrics by M.I.A?

Yea....I think songs like that you ethier LOVE or you HATE. I can see why people love it, because it is very catchy, easy to dance to, and has a cool unique beat. But also, you can understand why people dislike it. He says the same things over and over, and lets be real with each other, the words crank that soulja boy have very little meaning to anything. Some bands, I'll take nickelback for example, put everything and so much time into there songs to make them mean something to be and at the same time be catchy and nice to listen to. They are each very talented musicians and songwriters. When someone becomes and instant millionaire because the song has a good beat, its almost unfair. He really has NO singing ability, no songwriting ability, he does not play an instrument, and he is now filthy rich because his song is constantly played in clubs. Understand?

i heard, and this was - believe me - strange,
especially to hear frm someone two years younger than me,
as i thought i was really up to date, and 'chilled'
but 'superman' is some crazy sexual act...??
hmmmm, news to me.
Anyway, i think, having some personal objections to it, it has something
to do with the fact that kids on the street or in libraries (!) play the song out loud on their phones, and people just think, 'oh, its some of that cr*p rap, this generation' etc etc.
i don't like it cause when i go to libraries, i wanna not have to hear other people's friggin music preferences, no matter how good they sound pumping out of a dubbed out Escalade or 300. catch my drift?
i think the song is fine, personally, and its hilarious to watch people try and imitate the dance - often successfully! - and breathe the air of taking part of communal dancing.
okay, that last part didn't make sense,
but i think its part of a general anti-rap backlash, and even though it is not quite rap - not quite sure what it means, but hey! - its loud, and blaring out of some speakers, so 'conservatives' or people who like to be in their own bubbles probably don't like it



as for the chat forums, maybe they only like the established players in The Game - sorry, bad pun. i mean like Missy Elliot, 50 and co

cause soulja boy sucks. thats really all there is to it, the only real talent he has is to cash in (which isn't bad for him), just like jonas brothers, miley cyrus, nickleback, and lil wayne. Their music all sucks but one mainstream demographic or another buys it so they just keep going and making POS music
I think this is one of soulja boys best songs

Have you even heard the lyrics? The lyrics are such crap. If you listen to hip hop you would know what i mean. The beat is just catchy and it's something to dance to. Unfortunately, that's the direction hip hop is going. That's the reason people hate him. His music sucks. End of discussion.

Read this and tell me you think he doesn't deserve it. He is an ignorant son of a ***** and I hope a proper rapper gives him the good slapping he deserves, soon.

<question>



Not just another "recommend me some Black Metal bands" question.?



This is a challenge.



I've asked for people to list some Black Metal bands that I havn't heard of before but all people seem to come up with is the obvious ones (Emperor, Mayhem, ect.), or they just post links to a ready-made list.



So here's how it's going to be.



You list as many Black Metal bands that you don't think I've heard of (and I've heard of quite a few), along with what they sound like (you can just compare them to other bands here for convenience's sake), one song that you think deserves a mention and the album it's on.



I'm not looking for obvious ones to get me started off here, I've been listening to metal for years and I want to see what you can come up with, so the more obscure, the better.



As you know, there's 10 points going for the best answer.

Lime wire is so bad, it laggs your computer and brings viruses.
I reccommend Ares, you can download Ares for only 3 mg.
you can get Ares from download.com.
Or just go to google and type "download Ares"
good luck. P.S Ares is just like Limewire.

Check out ska-punk bands like Less Than Jake, Goldfinger, and Reel Big Fish.  Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphys both play celtic punk, which has an Irish sound to it.

Does anyone know this song?



Can anyone help me. I'm trying to find the name of a song. The only thing I know is that the video features a dog, I think it's a staffordshire bull terrier running through what looks like London. And the video cuts to people dancing but the club is inside the dog. Sounds strange I know but it's been bugging me for days.
Thanks for any help.

Does anybody know who was the artist (Band) who sung the song" Someone Really Loves You, Guess Who?



I searched the internet music stores and found the song"Guess Who" BUT it wasn't sung the the artist as I remember, the song was popular around the 60's and was sung by a male singer in a slow danceable beat.

<answer>



Ok this is what i take to Leeds festival every year.



- 2 jeans ( in case it rains, i have one dry set for the night and wet for the day)



- 2 t shirts ( same reason,  you really dont want to be soaking wet at night since it gets really cold)



- Mobile phone (try not to take your best one on the off chance it goes missing) - they should have a Nokia tent there where you can charge your phone up for about £3 also they charge every phone not just Nokias



- Beer ( that's if you drink alcohol) - if you are bringing spirits i.e vodka, you have to pour it into plastic containers since glass bottles are prohibited



- Money (I normally take about £100 but i never spend it, also take as much as you think you will need but remember not to lose it.  Also everything there is a rip off, a burger costs about £7 and a can of coke costs about £2



- Food (i normally take them pasta things where you just rip open the packet and pour it into some hot water) - since you really dont want to have to slice, cut and prepare all your meals



- a small camping gas cooker (these are perfect and cheap)



- lighter ( always comes in handy



- flashlight (wow these things come in handy when you need a piss at night or you are stumbling back to your pit in the dark)



- sleeping bag & tent (obviously) - if your worried that your tent might get robbed,, ive been to festivals for about 12 years now and not once have i been robbed since theres alot of security



- wash kit & toilet roll - but i recommend you dont have a crap there since the toilets are just gross



thats the bare essentials you will need, just remember what you take is what you have to carry since at Leeds the car park to the camp sites is about 2 miles away, also DO NOT BRING A SUITCASE you are there for a weekend and everyone will laugh at you since you have to trek it across the grass you will look like a tit



another note, bring condoms if you wish but just remember these girls havent washed properly for a few days

If it's anything like the festivals i used to go to...you won't be doing much reading.
LMFAO!!



OK&gt; you need dope...and a girl willing to do some quite adventurous sex things.In the open (or in a tent which is virtually the open). The dope will come in handy in convincing her about that...so pack plenty!!!



then you want a fair amount of booze, some clean underwear, headache tablets, a water bottle and lots of condoms.



Have a blast!!!

<question>



Should i lose all respect for biggie smalls?



I was listening to his song "Just playing" and he rapped about TLC in a negative light.



http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/notorious+b...



Now i don't know who this fat f*ck thought he was, but trust, no one wanted to have sex with him. If he hadn't got famous, he would've been beating off, and wouldn't have had any hoes. Is he an a*shole for this? metioning TLC in a negative way?



</question>



<additional details>



I thought i blocked you a*shole



TLC is hip hop. listen to their first album

LOL. Apparently you didn't listen to the chorus of the song...



"I'm just playin', know what I'm sayin?'"



or the end of the song that mentioned he was just playin'.



or the title of the song "JUST PLAYING"



He rapped about almost every R&B artist in a negative light, but none of them took it serious. Alot people thought it was a funny song when it came out. If you disrespect him because of that, then that's your choice. Are you going to lose respect for Sporty Thievez because they spoofed "No Scrubs"? It's only a joke.

no  you shouldnt lose all respect for biggie, you should lose all respect for yourself.  seriously.  the title of the song is just playing.  he is "just playing". (but even if hes not hes still biggie and hes still the best)  i seriously hope that you are just joking too.

I think you missed the point of the song, but go ahead and smash your Biggie cds with a hammer if it makes you feel better.



EDIT: Also, I think you should take note that he was naming R&B groups in that song (just in case you still think TLC is hip hop).

I just started playing guitar, is this normal?



I just started playing guitar and I'm having a lot of trouble with upstrokes (dragging the pick across the strings towards the ceiling). I don't know if this is a problem all beginners face or if it's just me. I also have trouble sometimes strumming chords that require certain strings not to be strummed. Some advice or tips would be very appreciated.

Keep your swinging arm parallel to the body top up and down. You can also keep your arm still and "flick" your wrist. Try a very soft pick.



When in doubt about chording, just play the highest tuned 4 strings.
Rock on!!

Yes, it's normal. So is putting your fingers on the wrong strings. Just keep the rhythm going with your right hand. These things will soon straighten themselves out.

Has anybody seen Hinder in concert in their newest tour?



The reason I am asking is because I saw them over a year and a half ago, they played a new song "Thing For You" off the cd and I loved it. They played it acoustic, but when they recorded it for the cd it has electric guitar and drums and it's like their regular rock songs.
So I am hoping that even though they didn't record it acoustic, maybe they still perform it acoustic! I am thinking about seeing them in Tulsa later this month
So if you've seen Hinder recently, did they play "Thing For You" acoustic?

Some people think it is about rape through the eyes of the rapist, blaming the victim for his actions.  Or it could just be about a guy who's eager to get into someone's pants.  Either way, I don't think it's a good song to sing to someone you like; it's a little aggressive.

Lyrics: Late night in chicago?



What song has a line "late night in chicago" or something similar?  It is a song style with a jam band feel to it.  I would assume it would not be too abstract considering the radio station i heard it on.

The bloke who wrote the song saw a bloke in the middle of nowhere, up a pole fixing the wires. He imagined how the man must be missing his wife.  There's not much more to it than that, but it is a beautiful song.

No, it refers to guys working on the high tension electricity network (I think). That line about needing a vacation but it not looking like rain is a reference to when they get time off, i.e. when it's raining (?). Anyway what could it be a euphemism for? His drug habit? His d*ck?

I hear good things about the 2000XL because its pretty much the go-to MPC with regards to having features...But not too many features to confuse you with.



The 1000 is good except i hear there is something bogus about the chopping..Like you can only chop a loop and lay it down in a specific order..



Sign up here and you can get even more information/e-books/forum threads about MPC's

And if you get up to scratch with the MPC, Try www.mpc-samples.com for good disk packs for loops/samples etc .

<additional details>



I have heard some of the leaks, and they're pretty bad. I don't want the ablum. However, Axl is so insane who can say if any of them will be on the album. Ten years ago, I heard the first single off Chinese Democracy, it was "Oh My God". ( On the End of Days soundtrack. ) I doubt it will be on the ablum.

Tell me What you think ladies of this song?



I remember how it came to be
I aint look for her love her love came me
Looking at her and it's plain to see
She's a perfect picture to me
Baby girl got a swag that you cant believe
bonie with out the clyde independent she
Sexy also just to mention
She ghetto and classy all in the same sentence
Look good plus she working them thighs
Light skinned do it with them light green eyes
Anytime she come thru it's a clip-clop
Make you feel like a fool open sweatshop
Apple bottom jeans make yo jaw drop
And she got a touch make yo heart stop
Baby girl is the Main one that I'm tryin to capture
Looking at her she my perfect picture



Hook: I'm thinking about me and you



what you trying do baby you sexy
baby girl trying to grind trying to ride with you
cause girl your my perfect picture



Them otha chicks talk jealous of you mad of you
Always talk to the fellas of you haters on you
Mad at miss independent



She aint like them types that get to gold diggin
Baby girl got swag and they hate that



And to mention she real for a real fact
And she just smile to show deem pearly whites
Got class the girl so top flight
Baby girl got brains and to go with the goods
No time for the lames baby girl all good
And when it comes to a girl who gets to running her mouth
No need to cop an attitude she just walk it out
And she don't need to show off to get attention
Find it so attractive



She the one I want to capture
She a Kodak moment baby girl my perfect picture



Hook: I'm thinking about me and you



What you trying do baby you sexy
Baby girl trying to grind trying to ride with you
Cause girl your my perfect picture

Do you find it sad that McCain won most of the southern states?



Considering that most racist hillbilly rednecks are from the south? what are your thoughts on that? and are you scared for minorities in the south if Obama wins? I mean, i know hate crimes are going to happen down there.

I'm not prejuidice. If you want 4 more years of failed policies that have put the economy in a hole, go ahead. But i'm going to be smart and support someone who is going to try his best to work the situation out. And i'm not old enough to vote anyway. you fail.

I am from Alabama am no I am not. Where I live we have a huge diversity of races. I live in central Alabama and I have never seen anybody racist. I don't think it's fair to generalize an entire population like that. In fact, around town I have seen more Obama signs than McCain signs. From what I can tell most of my town supports Obama. Racist live everywhere, not just down here.  &gt;:(



And we have some pretty southern country people here too.



EDIT: I do support Obama.

i find it sad that people vote obama for no halfway decent reasons



that is pretty prejudice of you



i see you havent done your homework to see how radically liberal obama is he has voted with his party 97% of the time thats extremely dangerous plus id rather have 100 years of the past 8 than 4 years of socialism

Neil Diamond sang these words in his song "Holly Holy", which was not a religious song:
Lyrics:



Holly holy eyes



Dream of only you



Where I am, what I am



What I believe in



Holly holy



Holly holy dream



Wanting only you



And she comes



And I run just like the wind will



Holly holy



Sing a song



Sing a song of songs



Sing it out



Sing it strong



Call the sun in the dead of the night



And the sun's gonna rise in the sky



Touch a man who can't walk upright



And that lame man, he's gonna fly



And I fly



And I fly



Holly holy love



Take the lonely child



And the seed



Let it be filled with tomorrow



Holly holy

Sing a song of songs

Is this a good song for a funeral?



My uncle just passed away suddenly on Sunday in a motorcycle accident.  He left behind a wife & 7yo daughter.  They were doing really bad last year and almost seperated, and then in the last 4-5months they have been doing excellent and i guess you can say that they....fell back in love.  Well, I am trying to find a song to play at his funeral that could be like a dedication from him to her.  How do you think this song would sound for that situation??

You should choose a song that will effect everyone.



Maybe, play 2.?



But "Fall For You" seems more personal.



Am I making any sense.?



Cause it's hard to explain.

Maybe "My Immortal" by Evanescence.

Need help finding a good song?



My uncle passed away suddenly on a motorcycle accident this past Sunday.  and left behind a wife & 7yo daughter.  I am looking for a song to play at the funeral that will kind of pertain to their situation.  They had a rough patch last year and almost got divorced.  But then in the last 4-5 or so months they have been picking up the pieces and doing really good and i guess you can say...fell back in love.  Now all of a sudden this happens and she is a disaster.  We are searching for a song to play at the funeral for her.  Kind of like it's from him.  But the hard part, is that we are trying to find a song from one of the artists he used to listen to...Led Zepplin, Guns N Roses, 2 Pac, Kid Rock...he loved all kinds of music but those were his favorites.  Anyway, does anybody have any suggestions for a dedication song from him to his wife & daughter to play at his funeral for them?

American Pie



A long long time ago,
I can still remember how that music used to
make me smile
And I knew that if I had my chance
I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while



Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so
Now do you believe in Rock 'n' roll
And can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow



Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cos I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues



I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pick-up truck
But I knew that I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing



Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die



I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
When I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play



Well now, in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
Tho church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire the most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died



We started singin'



Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die



Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee
But the levee was dry
And good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singing this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

RHH: Instead of Guitar Hero for rock, do you think they could have "Turntable Hero" for hip hop?



After listening to Dj's like Premo over and over you eventually learn the juggles and scratch patterns.



Do you think you could be a Turntable Hero?



Would it be popular or flop?

If you could pick the anthem for Obama Winning what would you pick?



So last night while watching the inspiring speech by Obama I was listening to the music he came out with. And I was thinking if I could pick out his song what would it be and the first thing that came to mind was "I know I can" by Nas. Or maybe "We are the Champions" by Queen. Hmm or maybe the Rocky anthem and him say "YOOOO Michelle WE DID IT" lol Sorry in a good mood. So if you could pick his anthem what would it be???

Has anybody seen Hinder in concert in their newest tour?



The reason I am asking is because I saw them over a year and a half ago, they played a new song "Thing For You" off the cd and I loved it. They played it acoustic, but when they recorded it for the cd it has electric guitar and drums and it's like their regular rock songs.
So I am hoping that even though they didn't record it acoustic, maybe they still perform it acoustic! I am thinking about seeing them in Tulsa later this month
So if you've seen Hinder recently, did they play "Thing For You" acoustic?

I haven't seen Hinder live, but I have heard that acoustic version. The chances are that they won't play it acoustic as that was a one off, where as the 'orginal' version was more upbeat.



I'd still go see them in Tulsa though cos they're cool.

If you know what songs are on the soundtrack, I always use www.playlist.com to listen to music. You might have to register to start a playlist, but it's free and I really enjoy it. You can also post the playlist on a myspace or any other site.

They were good all the way from the beginning of their career through the album "Permanent Vacation".  After "Permanent Vacation" they became a wussy band that appealed mostly to 13 and 14 year old girls.  Songs such as "Crazy", "Crying", and "What It Takes" pushed the band over "wuss cliff".  The only album after Permanent Vacation that had any guts was "Honkin' On Bobo".  Their greatest work was the first album and "Toys In The Attic".

They have about 5 or 6 songs that are a constant for airplay that have been so since the 70's , not many can say that. That white wannabe black rapper whatshisface used their "Dream On" in one of his..er..hmm..songs? If you like radio friendly music and greeting cards you may like their late 90's to current stuff . For me they only have two really " Rock/Blues cd's that will get played , Draw The Line and "Done With Mirrors".Neither of these cd's were too popular but that's because they rock.

Ronnie, no competition. I'm not going to be one of those that says "Ronnie Radke is Escape the Fate!" because, obviously, that's not true. However, I fell in love with ETF because of Ronnie's voice, and Craig's just doesn't cut it for me. I don't hate Craig's voice in the slightest, but I don't think it fits with Escape the Fate. No offense to the band in the slightest, but nothing they do now will ever come close to their first CD.

Well it depends on your taste. as much as some dont like it Metallica has a variety of songs.



If you like a more thrash, heavy melodic sound go with:



Blackened
Harvester of Sorrow
Motorbreath
The 4 Horseman
Whiplash



If you are more into jammin rock with some hooks(more mainstream):



The Unforgiven
Bleeding Me
2X4
Wherever i may roam
Nothing else matters

Look at the back of a Metallica CD. If the publish date says any year between 1983-1988, it's a good album. "Ride the Lightning," not so much, IMO, but otherwise, it's some of the best metal you'll ever hear. These are my personal favorite songs:



Seek and Destroy
Hit the Lights
The Four Horsemen
Metal Militia
Ride the Lightning
Battery



Sanitarium
Damage, Inc.

Depends what your into, but they do have a wide range of songs, they have 3 different era's (I guess) from thrash to just metal, to hard rock, try these:



Seek and Destroy - From their first album, thrash metal at it's finest, if your not too into the intro riff's your prolly not gonna dig them to much, hah.



Creeping Death - Just badass. :D From Ride the Lightning, the middle part with the backing vocals... awesome, especially live, not to mention good lyrics.



For Whom the Bell Tolls - Another awesome intro, sounds like a guitar, but it's a bass intro... look up Cliff Burton. One of their few/their only song from their "early days" which doesn't include a solo, but, really, another awesome song live, well, all three mentioned are.



Fade to Black - Their first "slow" more harmonic song, but it progresses, the lyrics and just in general the song were ground breaking at the time.



Master of Puppets - This goes without saying, overall their best, in many people's opinions, check the 2 solo's in the middle, the first a slower more harmonic one, then the drums kick in and it gets even faster, check the second solo especially.



Battery - Starts out with a clean crisp intro, and kick's into heavy drums, not including Damage Inc and maybe Metal Militia, it's prolly their heaviest song, but the best of the "heaviest." Imo.



One - Epic song, especially live, it's about how a landmine caused a dude to lose his limbs, speech, hearing, though, sight and etc, yet is still kept alive, fictional? Maybe, but the music video with the movie based on it... awesome, that's not even mentioning it's prolly one of the best progressive songs ever, imo, kicks into heavy stuff, awesome solo.



Enter Sandman - Most said they totally changed their style and sold out, they kinda did, but I don't know anyone who doesn't like this song, never mind can't stand it, you might have heard this, don't miss.



The Unforgiven - From their self titled album, the same as Enter Sandman, this is a unique song, a slower one, don't miss.



Nothing Else Matters - Not metal by any means, but, still... epic song, youtube Nothing Else Matters rock am 2008.



That was hard, i'd recommend listening to their 3 instrumentals... To Live is to Die (Cliff Burton tribute song, middle intro is... yeah) Orion and the Call of Ktulu.
Others; Harvester of Sorrow, Welcome Home (sanitarium), the Four Horsemen, Ride the Lightning, Blackened, Sad But True, Wherever I May Roam, The Memory Remains, Fuel, their cover of Turn the Page (check it, def).



Hope that helped, try listening to all 10 above, give them a chance, they are all so different. Actually, live versions of just Creeping Death (seattle 89', Rock am Ring 2008) youtube em, really show how they have evolved. Hope ya like, sorry for the overuse of badass, but back in the day.. they were!

As has been stated, htat depends entirely on ones personal taste.



I happen to love em.  Have listened to them since 1985, and don't regret a second of it.



Their first 4 albums (Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets and And Justice For All) are masterpieces of Thrash Metal, and Master of Puppets is one of the best Metal albums (well..IMO, THE best) ever composed).  Many of their songs during this era were long, but also were very complex, mixed with an amazing brutality. (but no tthe Brutal with ZERO melody that is so popular with todays Deathcore crowd)  Personally I think their weakest link in htese is their first, Kill Them All, because it was their most narrow and non-diverse album.  It is importnat more for what it represented (the birht of Thrash) than for its musical merits.



After these, you have the "Accessible" Years.  Hear Metallica played a softer blend of Metal with Alt and Southern Rock.  these were the Black Album, Load and Reload.  Some call them sellouts, some feel they lost their way, and some would say this is their best stuff.  THe songs were shorter, and they did generally simplify their style.  Decide for yourself.
Personally not my favorite stuff, but they Load and Rleoad were still overall good Alt Rock albums (though Re-Load is IMO, their weakest offering, period)



RIBIRTH:  Started with the critical failure of St Anger.  IMO actually a Better album than Re-Load, but also very disjointed, and not yet focused.  Actually really catches the turmoil  they had just gone through.  Followed up with Death MAgnetic, which I feel is their best album since And Justice for All.  A thoroughly Modern Metal album  that blends elements from ALL of Metallica's past albums..and yet still is it's own.



Now that we have looked at WHAT Metallica is..let me list some good tracks.



"Best" (now there is a Loaded term)
Orion
For Whom the Bell Tolls
One
Fade to Black
And Justice for All
Master of Puppets
Call of Ktulu  (S&M version)
Anaethsesia (pulling Teeth)
Sanitarium
The Thing That Should Not Be (S&M version)



Best OVERALL Metallica: (gives a feel for ALL their stuff)
Jump in the Fire (Kill Em All)
Fade to Black (Ride the Lightning)
Master of Puppets (Master of Puppets)
One (And Justice For All)
The God that Failed (Black)
King Nothing (Load)
Devils Dance (Reload)
No Leaf Clover (S&M)
Turn the PaGE (Garage Inc)
St Anger (St Anger)
Broken Beat and Scarred (Death Magnetic)



Most Accesible:
Fade to Black
Unforgiven
The Day that Never Comes
Unforgiven II
Until it Sleeps
Hero of the Day
One
Sanitarium
Wherever I May Roam
Fuel



Just my thoughts on it, as a LONG time metalhead, and Metallica fan.. Of course...some of what was amazing to me, might not stand out to you..because while when Metallica did it..they broke new ground..but in the decades since...otherrs have doen the same stuff..and you are more likely to have heard the bands that came AFTER before you heard Metallica...which will make it seem less impressive, potentially.

Eric Avery and Dave Navarro's post Jane's Addiction album with a bunch of great tracks from LA song, single, iris (great instrumental), fire in the hole ........and so on and so on.  This album showed the chemistry that was there between EA and DN that was missed on the later Jane's reunion(s)

The song was originally called "Zants Can't Dance", by John Fogerty (ex-Creedence Clearwater Revival).  He wrote the song about Fantasy Records chief Saul Zaentz (now deceased).  Fogerty hated Zaents because he owned the old Creedence songs, and Fogerty had vowed never to perform Creedence songs again.  Zaents sued Fogerty over the above song, and he was forced to change the title to "Vanz Can't Dance".  At the time, he said "I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I just wrote a song about a pig who can't dance..."



It appeared on Fogerty's "Centrefield" album.

Verse One
Check the watch on your risk no time it is

Like what I does most of all what is
A lil dude on his grind trying to handle is
Ya I'm still here got my feet planet
Listen my music stick to ya like syringes

The hottest thing on the street since the R Kelly sex tape
And ya mad because what my buzz is

Ya still trying to see were the loop is
Steady trying to get where the blue tooth is
And ya trying to make good music



But sounds like every body els that do it
Up on stage nobody rocks to it
Well I'm gone show them how to get stupid



Hook:
I'm the truth far from a myth
It's evident that the evidence i'm spiting verses still hitting
No intentions dissing it'ss just the craft i'm looking for
So sit back pay attention and listen to theese metophores



Verse 2
Coming in my flow so exciting



I got ya ear like my name might Tyson
It's said the boy spit lighting
Ya couldn't move a crowd if mop was yo hype man
And I've been told that the kid the truth
Aint trying to tute my own horn but they loving the dud
Can't drive so you know my boy com thru
Fully equipped the only thing missing is the roof
So theirl on the beat said the kid so sweet
I can tell cause my music bump like acne
And sometimes I be loving myself
And sometimes I aint gone lie I amaze myself
And ya aint even holding rounds
Just trying to make a point like a kick after a touch down
Ya dudes is a myth



Bet when you hear this have you run it back like emit smith



Hook:
I'm the truth far from a myth

I'm assuming you only want singers and bands from the 80's.  Almost everything I've listed below is either a female solo singer or a band with a female lead singer (in almost all cases, the other band members are male, with the Go-Go's one of the few exceptions). Also, I've not listed New Order. They do have one female member, but she plays keyboards and never sings for them.  I hope this helps!

Question for Joy Division fans about Ceremony?



Is this live performance on May 2nd 1980 the only existing Joy Division performance of Ceremony? What happened to the rest of the lyrics...I read somewhere when they mixed it, it mixed out Ian Curtis's voice until the last part where he sings "I break them down".



I wanted to hear the whole thing in it's entirety. Would've been cool if he stayed alive to finish off the song and record it in the studio.

In the Still contemplation on the little booklet, it says " I just read a post on Neworderonline claiming that Tony Wilson trimmed off the start of Ceremony to make it seem even more like a bootleg..."



Pretty much I think that's the only version they actually have recorded. I wish they could have recorded a studio version of it because it's a great song.



EDIT: I found this version...But the one you posted and this one are the only ones I can find...

The sound engineer for the show that night messed up good & proper.He mixed Curtis's vocals far too low for the first half of the song.There is another demo version on the "Heart & Soul" box set which Peter Hook recovered, but not with much better vocal quality.There are bootleg recordings which crowd members made in which all the vocals can be heard. but the treble is terrible.
When Bernard Sumner did the vocals for the New Order version, he had to put Curtis's vocals through a graphic equalizer to figure out the lyrics.

Anyone know this club song? Can only give very little info?



There is this song, pretty newish which you would probably have heard in most clubs. It's a dance/house type track... Starts off slow at the beginning and then comes in with the bass and then goes back to the slow bit. I think it could possibly be a remix of an older song.



Awful bit of information I know and I don't really expect anyone to get it from that... But if anyone has any sort of ideas that would be great. Much appreciated.

Mystery song, can't determine name or artist?



I heard a song playing in our stadium prior to kickoff but I can't determine what it was.



What I remember:
Chorus had few if any instruments and had at least two different male singers almost shouting something like "When our ship comes in" or something to that extent. Its tempo was going at a pretty good clip too.



Judging by the style, I'd say that it was produced sometime between the mid to late 90's and now.

General admission means its a room with no seats so basically, first come first serve.



You'll be in the same area but might get separated by the crowd if anything.

You can go wherever you want. They list the sections on the tickets because that shows them the current sold capacity, as if there were seats.

This is tricky.  If I were you, I would contact the venue and ask specifically.  General Admission typically means you can stand where you like.  However, I have been to General Admission concerts where it's General Admission by section.  For example, I bought a Section 2 General Admission ticket.  So I couldn't be on the floor (Section 1), but I could be on the first tier of seating above there wherever I wanted.  So do be careful.  Like I said, contacting the venue and asking specifically could be the best way to go.

I don't like the "Glam Rockers" Guys like Metallica can just rely on their music to get the job done. I wish Iron Maiden would come to the U.S. more often, but they get a better reception in other parts of the world. I like 80's metal. They're the ones who were worried about their stage shows. I remember seeing Jethro Tull and they could rely on their performances more than their looks. I like the performance more than the stage show.

least time- gotta be between AC/DC or most any indie band. AC/DC are happy in their denim & t shirts, & indie band members just look like people you walk by on the street.



Most time- today: probably Tokio Hotel or most black/death metal bands
past: all the hair metal bands

It is always better to start with a classic guitar as it strengthens your fingers especially your finger tips but the best way to start is to learn the basic chords g c f a b and d you could always use stickers at first to mark them on your guitar and practise every day there are lots of beginners books out there which show finger placings as tabliture as quite hard ro read Good luck

Mystery song, can't determine name or artist?



I heard a song playing in our stadium prior to kickoff but I can't determine what it was.



What I remember:
Chorus had few if any instruments and had at least two different male singers almost shouting something like "When our ship comes in" or something to that extent. Its tempo was going at a pretty good clip too.



Judging by the style, I'd say that it was produced sometime between the mid to late 90's and now.



</question>



<additional details>



I've tried using the usual lyrics search engines but no dice. The problem is that I remember the music more than the lyrics.



The War- Angels and Airwaves wasn't it.



The one I have in mind was considerably faster and seemed to be upbeat. I think the lyrics concerned the singer and a female acquaintance.

I just watched a Led Zeppelin documentary and did you know...?



The very first song on the very first album put out by Led Zeppelin was 'Good Times Bad Times'. The VERY FIRST 2 notes you ever hear with the name 'Led Zeppelin' attached to them are the first 2 notes of this amazing song.



This just blows my mind how amazing these guys were.



For laughs, rate Led Zeppelin. 1-10. Tell me your favorite songs too!

The Wedding Song (There is Love) by Peter, Paul, and Mary, is one of the purist song about love.



Noel Paul Stookey claims he felt divinely inspired when he wrote this song.  Paul Stookey created a charity organization called The Public Domain Foundation to receive the royalties from "The Wedding Song (There Is Love)" and distribute them to charity. The organization's web site states that it has donated over $1.5 million.

'bpm' means 'beats per minute'



It refers to the tempo or speed of the song.



'20 bpm faster' might refer to starting out playing a song slowly in order to learn it, and then increase speed by 20bpm increments until you can play it full speed.



There are programs and equipment for slowing down music without changing the pitch to allow you to learn parts that are difficult (if not impossible) to figure out full speed.

I love Simon Phillip's drumming too.  My theory on SAS is Priest went more in the prog direction instead of punk.  Their albums after SAS were indellably influenced by Punk Rock.  Stained Class is really their first consistent "metal" album.  I love Sin After Sin.

Glad to see I'm not the only one who likes their oldest albums. In my opinion, Nostradamus was their weakest, most boring album. Halford is just getting too old, the songs were too monotonous and seemed to stretch on forever, etc. And that's coming from a guy who calls Judas Priest his 2nd favorite band.

Okay, seriously this has to be the hardest song to find! Help!?



Evanescence did three versions of the song "my immortal" one was slow, the second started slow and became a more "rock-like" song ( I can find these, I have the cd) HOWEVER.....
The third version which I heard on the radio, featured a Amy singing the first verse and a man singing the second verse and it was also more Rock-like.



WHERE CAN I FIND THIS VERSION OF THE SONG!!!! ITS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!



thank you for any help you can offer! :)

Definitely. I understand American hip-hop culture better after listening to the music. Artists base Songs on their environments, so when people listen to music from different countries they begin to understand their culture better. Furthermore, people try to find out about everything they can about the country where their favorite artists live.

yea i think so. especially when artist to collaborations into a different genre of music meaning rap n rock, rnb and country things like that. Me my favorite colabo is Jay-Z n Linkoln Park Encore/Numb. You got the best of both worlds and even though you have two different sounds, both sides are talking about the same thing. Music is basically the expressions of yourself through words and sound, the one common ground of all types of music. You rite, you cant understand anotha culture unless you take the time to listen and take to heart what is heard. Could n the long run make you a better person!!!!!!

After listening to Dj's like Premo over and over you eventually learn the juggles and scratch patterns.



Do you think you could be a Turntable Hero?



Would it be popular or flop?

It would flop. Actually, it already has. Go to MTV and go to the news section. The developers of either Rock Band or Guitar Hero were thinking about doing it until they realized it would be a waste of time.



Hiphop music is just loops. So basically, you would be just pressing the same buttons over and over again repeatedly.

Nikki... Parappa the rapper had weak flow &gt;_&gt;.



I think it would be good...Anyone who's into video games probably remembers "Beatmania" on Playstation and possibly on Ps2..But don't quote me on that.



If you take the graphical capability of the xbox360 and PS3 and the innovation of the Wii..That would be a sick game. I can see it being a serious niche though..



The idea of turn in a turntablism game for most people will never have the same feel as say drums/bass/guitar in Guitar Hero or Rockband. That and using decks as an instrument is more or less a HH thing.



I'm pretty good at guitar hero and most rhythm games...I think i could do it pretty good.

I'm very interested to see what he will do. He has the talent and an "in", as well as guidance from his father who knows the business.



But, he does lack stage presence. This could be due to him being so young. Unfortunately, to be successful, there's gotta be more than raw talent.

somewhere in beween I think........If you consider any side project he attempts away from Van Halen as just a side project. My point is that Wolfie will probably always have a place in Van Halen and they seem to have a bigger draw than Jason's regular job with Foreigner.

well my band does it and im am the screamo guy



u need to idnetify waht type of scream u wnt, liike underoath screamo, or like alesna scream



then u would probaly need to say a few words shouting, then sort of incorparte the sound you want



you also need to be able to control your breathing because, i remeber when we started doing that i collapsed becuase i ran out of breath, but are a singer and you shouldve already learnt that.



Also, dnt try to hard to sound good, just let it flow and keep practicing



dwnload some songs, that have differnt types of sreamo sound, get the lyrics and try do it.



hope you find that helpfulll

Just DO It...



Take some songs, play em, and just work around with them, scream along with them and test your voice.
That's the thing, everyone has a unique voice, so play around with it..



whisper and clench your throat like you are gargling, and keep a little spit/water in your mouth.
Typically screamers have a water bottle with them on stage and stuff.

If you have no idea at all, search youtube for screamo voice lessons. Learn to control your diaphragm and scream from it. Control your breathing--take in lots of air. Like I said, youtube is a great place to get some lessons.

Yes!!! I love that song! Monica and Brandy together in one song is perfect. Love Monica and Brandy. I love Brandys new song right here and Monica has a new song called still standing but its not a single its just for promotion, you can listen to it on youtube. Cant wait for both of their cds. Brandys cd Human drops dec. 9th and Monicas cd Still Standing should drop early next year.

I've always heard David Coverdale is hit or miss.  I've seen clips on YouTube where he was great and some where he is aweful.  I've never seen them personally.



Ozzy was always great but I haven't seen him since Ozzmosis.  I would have my doubts about seeing him now.
Maiden is always good and Queensryche has always delivered live even if their albums have been weak since Promise Land.
Dream Theater has blown me away every time I've seen them; 5 times since Images and Words.
I'm kind of rambling but I've hear Iced Earth is hit or miss as well.

Priest?  Really?  Wow that shocks me.



My experience would be Aerosmith.  I have seen them approximately 8 times and each time was different.  I would have to say 1/2 the shows were horrible and the other 4 were awesome.  The last one I saw w/Lenny Kravitz was awesome.  Another one would be the Allman Brothers.  I see them every year and each time is a toss up.  I love their music, but you can never tell what type of show you will get until you are there.  Some are mind blowing and some are just not worth speaking of.



Most consistent



Priest - for me anyway - I have seen them approximately 9 times and each time was kick a**.  Rob is my metal God.
Dio - approximately 9 times - each one awesome.
Maiden - about 8 times and all awesome
Tesla - 12 times and all incredible.
Queensryche - 4 times - all were unbelieveable.

Do you think the new Rammstein album will be better tahn Rosenrot?



I've always been a rammstein fan for about 10 years but when Rosenrot came out I was totally disappointed, it didn't grow on me, infact I could listened to it about 4 times and I am a huge rammstein fan. Do you think the new album will be more like their older stuff - especially mutter or even reise reise?



Does anyone else think rosenrot sucked?

I used to think Closer was better, but I fell in love with Insight and Candidate all over again, plus I love Disorder, She's Lost Control, and Shadowplay, so now I say Unknown Pleasures.

<asker's comment>



Unknown pleasures ("UP") is slightly better than Closer.  I love the intentional minimalism of Closer, and no experimental rock album does minimalism better (in my opinion).  But UP is unique, brilliant, tragic and beautiful at the same time.  True art.

I prefer Unknown Pleasures. I simply find it to be a more enjoyable, engaging listen. Though Closer is a bit more 'cohesive' overall, the individual songs aren't as strong.

HA! those are great!  Honestly, they are both really cool in their own way.  And both groups were breaking out of the norm to make a new kind of music.  They were both considered "rebels" in the music scene.



I like the Run DMC one better - I just enjoy it.  But you can't negate the importance of either one.

What are the Top 3 Comeback Albums?



It has happened to some of the best bands, they're at the top of the world, then crash back and go out of whack with their music. Then they become reinspired by going back to their roots, or in some cases, reinventing themselves.



You could call this a comeback. But what are the 3 biggest comeback albums ever?



My Answer:



Album (Artist)



Brave New World (Iron Maiden)-This is the same band that put out The Number of the Beast, Powerslave, Killers, etc. After Bruce left in 93, they brought in Blaze Bayley. Needless to say, the band was going to an all time low. They lost Bruce, they lost Adrian Smith, and going to rock bottom.



2000 came, so did Bruce, so did Adrian, and a three guitar system. They came out with their now trademark theatrical musical approach that I was all for when it came out. At over an hour, it's Maiden going back to what they were doing before, being on top of the heavy metal world.



Back in Black (AC/DC)-How do you recover after you lose your lead singer? Do you call it quits, do you start a side project? NO. You go out and get a new singer and churn out one of the heavyiest records of all time (Hard to believe come from a classic rock band). This is a record to party to, get drunk to, and to have 40 minutes of great sex. What more can you want?



Painkiller (Judas Priest)-The Priest of the late 80s was such an embarassment to the Metal Gods. They came out with Turbo in 1986, synthesizers and in the process losing their core sound. Then Ram it Down came out in 1988, uninspired and made me wanna Ram it Down the toilet when I got it as a X-Mas gift (the remastered version). It is Painkiller in which Priest realized they were a heavy metal band, not a commerical one.



Without a doubt, it is a statement when they came out with this album. It is 50 minutes of thrash, fast guitar work, and fist-pumping anthems. Rob Halford absolutely outdid himself on his vocal performance, from the title track to the closer "One Shot at Glory," it is one of the 15 albums I can listen to back and forth, without skipping, shuffling, or getting bored. All Hail the Metal Gods.

I think LA Woman was pretty awesome after a couple so-so albums (Morrison Hotel, The Soft Parade).



Motorhead:



Orgasmatron.  After Fast Eddie Clarke left the band they got Brian Robertson from Thin Lizzy and did Another Perfect Day which is really weird considering the awesome run of albums they had just put out (Overkill, Bomber, Ace Of Spades, Iron Fist).  It was like, what the hell is this?  But then Orgasmatron came out, and they're back baaybe!!!

I wouldn't necessarilly put this band into the category of "Screamo", but you could try:
The Bloody Hollies.  They're just an intense swamp-rock blues band, but the voice is chilling and emotional.  It'll probably be better than any band other people will suggest to this question.

There has already been so much of it released already.  Each and every video that he does is released on the internet.  The line up of songs is already out there.  Just like "Evolver" by John Legend was out on the internet long before it was even released I think that 808's is going to be at least a few days before too.
I'm excited.  I know that it is getting a lot of "mixed" reaction but I think that Kayne really took a gamble but I think he rolled a good pair of dice.  I like the sound and the lyrics.  It refreshing and different!!I



I honestly think he's trying to keep as much of a "cap" on the album as possible but "piracy" today with the internet is out there and there is nothing anyone can do.  He's either going to let it be released in a good way or bad way.  I think it will be out there just a day or so before release, not much before, at least, officially.
Peace & Love  :)

Electric Guitar whammy bar, help?



I'm gonna be picking up a right handed guitar with a whammy bar on it, but i'm left handed, or at least I prefer to play left handed.



Is there anyway I can use the whammy bar whilst playing left handed? Can I not just move the bar around? Doubt it, but, do I need to buy a left handed bar, if so, is fitting that easy?



There's a similar question been answered, I was wondering if anyone can go more in depth? I'll be buying a Schecter Damien FR guitar, if that matters.



Thanks.

It's possible Hendrix played with one and was able to pull it off when he used his. Try one in the store see if it gets in your way of strumming etc. see if its comfortable. Even then it may just be something you have to get used to. Also don't know much about the Damien by I own a Schecter S/H body, I love it. They are great guitars, very well built and great price. Duncan designed pickups are lacking though... upgrade.

What should I look for when purchasing a Microphone?  (Music Production)?



Hello,



I am looking into buying a decent microphone for laying vocals over my tracks. I currently use "Reason" to produce my tracks and use Adobe Audition 3.0 to multitrack. My system consists of a Windows OS with a X-Fi Xtreme Gamer Sound Card.



I am aware that under most circumstances I will need a Pre-Amp, Spit-Gaurd and of course a Microphone. I know some microphones are crazy expensive but I'd like to keep my budget around $2000 for everything.



Do you guys have any suggestions and why? I really do not know much about microphones so please feel free to enlighten me. Thanks for you're time and info!

How does my voice sound?



This is the first time I've ever let the public listen to me sing. I'm always embarassed because I tend to be a little flat. I did a quick 45 second recording of Howie Day's Collide and put it on myspace just to host it. Tell me what you think of my voice, and don't be too harsh.

I like it. It takes guts to put your stuff out there and you should put more out there... I do think if you got with a vocal coach and worked on some breathing techniques you might benefit (just because it sounded like you were running out of breath a time or two there), you have good tone and pretty good pitch, you're the idea kind of student for a vocal coach because with just a few techniques they could probably help you take your natural abilities to the next level.



I bookmarked your page, I'll be checking back to listen to stuff you post in the future.



Good job.

Thanks. I wish I had time for a vocal coach. Anyway I was inspired to put up one more recording. This time it's John Mayer-Body is a Wonderland. Again it's not complete and I had a little trouble controlling the volume of my voice, but its there if you want to hear it.

you do a really great job. a lot better than i had expected after reading your description. Normally, newer singers find it difficult in finding their own "style of singing" and it seems like you have already succeeded here so basically, kudos chum! keep up the good work, and don't, by all means, be embarrassed.

That was super good, man.  Like I sing way worse and I'd never have the courage to post my voice on this internet.  Who knows wat others would think of me.  Like even my friends said u were good.  U should go on Canadian Idol or American Idol depending on where u live.  That's the truth tho I'm not sure a lot of ppl would agree with me and my friends.  LOL

To me, it sound like you're right in the middle
your voice will get better just takes practice and sing a little louder
i know you may not think it's the best but just think about all the stuff they use to add to a person's voice when recording
check out th elibrary or internet for advice or watch a video

Okay hun, so hears the deal.
I'm in musical theatre and the first thing they tell you to do is to SING LOUD. cause if no one can hear you, they don't know what's going on. So that's tip number one.



Number two : Your voice is good for an ammature i guss, but you need singing lessons, so they can show you how to use your voice in the proper ways. But you're not too bad.



It also depends on like how old you are and your vocal chords, older girls and boys tend to have stronger voices, so i think it also comes with alot of practice.



But over i think the first one is the best because your voice is stronger and there's a little more emotion.



But overall, you're good, but singing lessons will do you NO wrong!



♥ Hope it helps hun :)

It would have to be confined to gothic rock just because of the band itself--it's a mellow song, but it definitely doesn't stray too far from Evanescence's style, so it can't be considered anything unique.

Screamo is arguably not a real genre and most if not all modern day "emo" bands suck.  Heh. :&gt;

What is the hardest song/album title or band name for you to spell?



What ones do you always end up misspelling? You don't have to give an example for all three...one would be just fine.



I always misspell Pink Floyd's Ummagumma and George Clinton's Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop). I'm on the computer now, though, so I can make sure they are spelled correctly :-)



Luckily, I'm not asked to spell those words on a regular basis....

Thanks to some of the R&P users, I've recently gotten into Sigur Ros.  But I have to triple check my spelling of the song titles when adding them to a comment.  To this day, I still have the urge to spell 'Hoppipolla' as "Hiphopolla."  Always.  Like--I even did it just now, and had to backspace...



I also like to try to leave the 'h' out of Pete TownsHend.

Do you think the new Rammstein album will be better tahn Rosenrot?



I've always been a rammstein fan for about 10 years but when Rosenrot came out I was totally disappointed, it didn't grow on me, infact I could listened to it about 4 times and I am a huge rammstein fan. Do you think the new album will be more like their older stuff - especially mutter or even reise reise?



Does anyone else think rosenrot sucked?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Rosenrot did indeed suck; I'm not looking forward to any new material from Rammstein, but if a new album does come out I'll get it anyway to see what it's like.

Oh I had alot to say
Was thinking on my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same
'Cause everything inside it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me wanna die.



I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go 'round
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.



This time I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
We get older and blame turns to shame
'Cause everything inside it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me wanna die.



I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you

I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go 'round
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry.



Every single day I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah sorry



I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds

Enjoy The Show:



Don't even know
Why or what you hate
False negativity I know
I can't relate
Clench your fists in anger
at those who will oppose your hate
is just a label
an image that you chose
open your mind and you will see
You don't prove a ******* thing to me
[repeat first verse]
We're just here to enjoy the show
Break down the walls of hatred
Do us all a favor and let it go



--------------------------------------...
I got two artists for Let Me Be Me



Let Me Be Me by Pressure Drop:



There's no turning back just ahead,
No reason at all you once said,



I need time and space to clear my head,
Can't breathe life into what is dead.



The more you pull me in,
The more I pull away,
That's the only time,
You hear what I say,
I've come to realise for me you made some disguise,
And you know that I'm not playing.



There's no way you can hurt me,



There's no way you can hold me,



You can't control me just let me be me



I don't need no pick-a-me-up,



No putting me down,



Treating me nice,



When you feel like being around
Making promises you'll never keep
No restless sorrow,



No timeless sleep.



There's no way you can hurt me,



There's no way you can hold me,



X5



There's no way you can hurt me,
You can't control me just let me be me

Put your arms around me girl cause I don’t know what to do
I'm spinning on a sixpence cause I’m still in love with you
We were vagabond souls put together sniffing glue
Your radio songs were all I really knew



Did you think I had a wind up heart?
You must have had plastic head
Did you think I had to play the part
when you copied everything I said?



I’m sorry sorry sorry if your getting me wrong
but you’re half a world away with only one sock on
Now your getting too much so I want to play along
cause all I really wanted was a radio song



What is there to say
In a world so grey
Why oh why oh why are we singing it anyway



Ahoooo



Did you think I had a wind up heart you?
You must have had plastic head
Did you think I had to play the part
when you copied everything I said?



When the tide of love is out and the rust begins to show
You’re crying in your sleep scared of your shadow
If you thought this was forever dear I’m keeping you in mind
I don’t want to let you have whatever you are mine

In a world so grey
Why oh why oh why are we singing it anyway?

Hallo bonnie. :) - The amount of people in london wearing obama t-shirts is crazy. Its good he got elected..the US was beat about by republicanism and bush's low IQ. Maybe obama can spark change.



I'd like to see him go conceptual/recurring theme...Art,Literature,Cult aspects of the media.



But he does only have two levels. Politics and violent metaphors regarding people who disagree with his politics.

I know the track.. I have it on my iPod :) .To be honest, The beat is what got me first time round. Its a typical UK HH beat.



Jehst is a beast...I rate him with Klashnekoff,Roots Manuva, Kyza, Akala and Ghetto (when he's hip hop),Chain of Command etc. as some of my favourite UK HH acts...



His flow is slow but its always been there since he first landed on channel U..The lyrics are always deep.

Its called a rumour. Rumours are baseless, If we could isolate who starts rumous on a more consistent basis, They wouldn't really be rumours. They wish he was dead because his music is killing the soul of hip hop yet its commercially successful.



Anyway.



Why do you keep doing this? Every damn day. "Why do you hate lil wayne(insert homo erotic pet name for him here?"



If you are from france, The HH scene in paris is crazy like few other places in europe. Why are you endorsing such garbage?



The only thing i give the guy credit for is getting people to readily eat shite from his hands. How you can have songs like "lollipop" in your discography and call yourself the best rapper alive is beyond my understanding.



No one's hating. To be honest, Most people hear hate his fanboys at least 10x more than they hate the dude personally. After taking a look at your fetish for the guy, You my friend, are a victim of flat-*** theory.



If i tell a girl with a flat *** her *** is enormous every day for a week, She'll believe it. Even if it isn't true. It will slowly creep through her subconscious until its a part of her regular thought. You're a victim of flat *** theory.



If Lil Wayne didn't physically say he was "the best rapper alive". None of you would be kicking that gobshite my way.

<question>



RHH: Is HH as accomodating/open minded as some of its fans make out?



Basically, One of the answers i ever gave in this section was on "why i love hip hop?" And i said that hip hop embraces other genres in the context of THE MUSIC. I was thinking about how true that is outside of the music.



Strangely Enough, I was talking to a friend of mine who's only into classical/avant garde kinda music and she basically said, Hip Hop promotes racial discrimination and serious cases of superiority complexes amongst its fans. She went a little deeper/louder but i'll give you the gist.



Thoughts?

As a white girl from Scotland whose favourite rapper is Chuck D, I do think hip hop is open minded.



How does hip hop promote racial discrimination? I've never experienced that. Hip hop talks on issues of race, yes, and I think to a non-HH fan who doesn't listen properly, it may seem discriminatory, but it really isn't on closer inspection.



I'm not just blindly supporting hip hop by saying that - most of my favourite hip hop is the stuff that gets accused of racism, so it's not like I'm not aware of what's said, but you have to listen to it in context and understand WHY it's being said - and why it needs to be said.



As for the superiority complex. Hmm. Confidence and bragging are a part of hip hop, always have been. That's like saying boxing promotes the same.



Hip hop is such a hugely varied genre that for every guy talking about his chain, there's another one talking about how much he hates that stuff. So Hip Hop doesn't really "promote" anything and isn't responsible for what individual rappers choose to talk about.



In short, I disagree with your friend.

Hip hop is an entire culture...to varied and too wide to be "racist" or promote "racial discrimination.  You've got extremists and then you've got "peace keepers".  You've got NWA and you've got Pharcyde, De La Soul & Common.  The scale tips both ways and evens itself out.  Saying that everyone fits into one basket or stereotype is wrong.  The person you were talking to clearly is talking about "gangsta" rap, not all types of rap.



There are so many sub-generes of rap that this clearly is an untrue statement.
Peace & Love :)

since listening to hip hop, i've become a more acceptable person, regarding ethnicity and religion (especially those of the muslim faith), I think hip hop unifies those residents of the world willing to contribute. One of my favorite compilation albums is the Unbound Project, which is dedicated to Mumia Abu Jamal, a black individual, but even though it's dedicated to him, I can relate, I've seen not only my people being opressed but i've seen this world's residents die for "freedom", die for "money", die for "religion" and die for each other all to be remembered by God during resurrection. And that is what hip hop has taught me. We're all in this together

I think hip-hop is wide open to whatever you want to say... I always thought of hip-hop culture as more artistic and varied, and rap culture is what you see on BET and hear on the radio, the stuff that everyone hates and loves at the same time.

The most prominent figures in hip hop are minorities who use the medium as a means of discussing the things that they feel, think and experience.  It just so happens that for many minorities, the issues we face are racial or societal.  Using your platform to discuss thoughts or opinions you have doesn't mean that you are promoting them, you are simply venting.  It is always amazing to me that Hip Hop takes so many punches, when there are Rock songs that talk about rape, murder, prostitution, devil worshipping, etc. and some of these songs have been out for decades, yet we constantly have to justify our genre.

Hey, these questions have never been asked before!



Allow me to copy and paste from the other times I've answered these three questions.



I like Dream Theater because their song structure is typically very complex. I think the four musicians are virtuosos of their respective instruments, and James is a great singer. I like their songs, and I like that the songs aren't always about typical rock and metal topics.



I was introduced to Dream Theater when I saw the video for "Pull Me Under".



My favorite song by Dream Theater changes constantly, but right now, I would have to say it's "Dark Eternal Night".

Well, since I always answer with Soilwork, I am going to do my other favorite band, Scar Symmetry



As a girl, who is incredibly picky about what she listens to, Scar Symmetry is the definition of musical perfection to me.....I love Melodic Death Metal.....plus, the amazing combination of vocalist...well former vocalist....Christian Alvestam's clean singing and brutal growling....defines how I like vocals.....his voice is amazing and when it was combined by the rest of the extremely talented muscians....they created amazing music......sadly Christian, who is one of my alltime favorite vocalists has left the band recently and is being replaced by TWO vocalists...one to do his clean singing and one to do his growling.....yeah, that's right it takes two guys to replace someone as talented as Christian....if you can't tell I personally think Christian made Scar Symmetry what it was.....and I highly doubt the band will continue to be as amazing and I have a feeling that their cred on my list of favorite bands will stop at this point and just include their first 3 cds with Chrisitan....lol



A while back, Roxel posted a question.....I believe it was something like "Scar Symmetry or Into Eternity" and thats when I first heard them.....ever since I've been addicted....Roxel, already knows I credit him for being my music man...lol :)



Favorite song~ "The Illusionist" the song has the perfect combination of clean singing and growling and is by far one of the best songs I have heard in my life.....

Why is the official Ohio Rock n Roll song about Prostitution?



If you don't know the song, it is "Hang on Sloopy"



Yes, "Hang on Sloopy", is about protistution.



the question is,



s it r e e a l y about prostitution?



The song lyrics seem to paint that picture



"sloopy lives in a very bad part of town" could mean that she may not be all that good either and maybe had a rough life



"I don't care what your daddy do" the word daddy could easily be interpreted as a pimp



"Sloopy wears a red dress" is a key line to associate the song with prostitution.  In many cultures the color red is used to identify prostitutes, sometimes refering them to "lady in a red dress"
of the Netherlands "Red Light district.  In the 17trh century prostitues normally wore red shoes.



Could this song that many people dance to and sign along at parties be about prostitution?

Despite your(?) hypothesis, there is no reason to believe the song is about prostitution. Based on the information I have come across, the name "Sloopy" most likely came from Dorothy Sloop, who was a Jazz singer from Steubenville, Ohio. She performed in the New Orleans area using the name "Sloopy."

Ah...this one alluded me as well til I finally placed it. I thought it was James Horner as well, but it's actually from the movie "Remember the Titans". The original score(where the music is from) is composed by Trevor Rabin. Hope that helps!

Well that's a hard choice to make because there are plenty of bands out there that are very influential. There are many genres that have influence on a certain genre which makes the genres become more popular.
In my opinion I would have to say KoRn.
Korn came into the public ears back in 1994 when they released their first album self titled "KoRn". During this time hard rock or Metal was near its down fall and was slowly fading away.During that era of music Kurt Cobain killed himself which devastated the word of grunge and hard rock. His death left no future for Nirvana and Hard Rock was dying. Metallica stopped making good music after the Black album and decided to cut their hair and claimed themselves that Metal was officially dead. When all hoped seemed lost, Korn came in to the music world with the new genre of "Nu Metal". The new genre became very popular and influenced bands such as Slipknot,which is also a very influential band of today. Korn became a multi platinum band and changed the music industry for ever in a ways people could not imagine. To make things short. In the end if it wasn't for Korn, Metal and Hard rock would not be as big as it is today. There are many bands that were influenced by Korn. Korn may not be important to other genres but they are important to the genre of Metal.

I totally remember liking this song i heard and none of the music i remember or its lyrics obviously or i would be able to find it somewhere but it was this pop rock band that had 1 mainstream song. the band had this black singer and the video took place in like an empty city where they sang on top of roofs and stuff. this was between 99-02 no other years kinda like a buzz song so to speak if you figure it out it will be a miracle! in the song they say god in the chorus

Hellogoodbye BBQ Tour 11/11/08 The Middle East Cambridge?



I'm going to see Hellgoodbye  with Never Shout Never, Play Radio Play, and Ace Enders at The Middle East in Cambridge on Tuesday. It is a venue I am not farmilar with. I would like to be up front and hopefully have the barricade, so I plan on waiting in line earlier. How early do you think people will start lining up? [It is sold out, though I hear it is a small venue]
[[I also know I could wait and and push through, but I'm not really the type of person to do that if I don't absolutely have to]]



Also, it is called a BBQ tour because the band intended on having a bbq in the parking lot beforehand. For anyone who gone to the previous shows on the tour, have they? If so, what time did they start, and how many people were around then?



And to people who know the middle east, what parking lot would it be in?



Thanks for any help! =]

They look exactly like Gibsons but they're cheaper. Is that because of the quality or name brand? (p.s. I'm using it to play bands like Paramore, The Academy Is..., Fall Out Boy, Good Charlotte, Brand New, etc.)

It's really had to tell when there are no sound samples to play.... I suggest going to a guitar or instrument shop and test them out there because while somebody else may like how they sound, you might hate it.

Wll I will say chances are it's not going to sound like a Gibson. The craftsmenship will not be at the same level. However you don't have to buy the most expensive guitars out there to get a great sound, or the sound that YOU want. Try one out if you can and look for samples like someone else said. But, most of all definately if you can try it yourself. You'll know if it sounds right, feels right, etc.

I've come across that brand before, "Grassroots". You won't find it in an America/Canadian store I'm afraid. It is an exclusively Japanese company, that's why you probably won't recognize the name. They don't sell them in shops outside there so...



Being Japanese I expect the quality to be really good but to be sure, I'd try looking for some review sites first but I don't think you'd have anything to worry about regarding the company. And the fact that they are cheaper than Gibson is no surprise because Gibson really is full of themselves. Sorry to say, good as they are they should not cost that much (Gibsons I mean). If you want a Gibson but don't have the cash, go for Epiphone (basically the cheaper version, but owned by the Gibson company).

Question about my left thumb behind the fretboard when playing guitar?



Whenever I run down scales or just pick individual notes, my left thumb is directly behind the fretboard and is straight. But whenever I play a chord (not including barre chords), my thumb completely wraps around. Is this a normal style of playing?

As it has already been said, it is all about comfortability. I always for some reason thought it was like a bad habit, and not very professional, but hell I do the same thing all the time. I actually prefer the thumb wrapped around, cause it doesn't put so much pressure on your thumb's knuckle, haha.



But whatever is good for you dude!

Doesn't matter if it is normal, as long as you are comfortable.



As far as your thumb wrapping around, that is common.  Some guitarists use their thumb to fret the low E string.

honestly It can mean a few things.
1. smoking weed obviously. Or high on some other kind of drug.
2. I think its about a female who gets a 'high' from money(paper) and she tends to bounce from relationship to relationship(fly like planes)
Hence the whole, " All I want to do is (Bang bang, cocking noise, CaChing!) and take your money!" To me this is about a female who uses and abuses people for money.



3. it really means whatever you want it to!



Hope I helped.

"I fly like paper, get high like planes"



are the lyrics. It's M.I.A. -Paper Planes



meaning your cool if your "fly.



high like planes meaning "getting high"..



However I think the song has some underlying cultural tones seeing that MIA is originally from Sri Lanka.



I think its just regarding the way people or children live in third world countries. They do whatever to make a living, selling visas... i also think "bang bang bang bang" and "kaaa ching".. basically is having sex (bang), and getting money for it. "kaa ching" prostitution

What is this song please?!?



I've been hearing this song on the radio lately and keep missing who it's performed by I can't even remember the lyrics but they're something like:



I've never met a girl like her (something along those lines)



and I think it mentions breaking up? But it's by a band (kind of sounds like Taking Back Sunday) not a solo artist.



And I'm positive it's fairly new.



Sorry so vague! Definite 10 points

Whos better klashnekoff or lil wayne? decide?



klashnekoff who is from london in the uk has only sold around a hundred thousand or maybe less in his career. but has delivery flow and lyrics on his side which he always spits over uncompromising and clever beats.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0CKHGgxr...
i could never say lil wayne is the best rapper alive because his name and those words just dont go together in a sentance.despite this he has sold 1.4 million in a week.he tends to spit over candy *** beats which if you break down are extremely simple. his simple lyrics and simple metaphors and similies are easy to decifer and his word play is at best average.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SePRNJtJQ...
i have made this commparison to show what hip hop still just about  is 'klashnekoff' and what it is becoming 'lil wayne'. and for the record im not saying in any way that klashnekoff is an amazing rapper hes good, im trying to make the point he clearly has more abilty but record sales are not backing this up
record sales doesn't mean quality
i was also going to compare immortal technique to little wayne instead
but it really doesnt matter who i line him up against unless its souldga boy

Why wait for when a rapper to disappoint you to all of a sudden to develop good listening skills. Now I'm curious to know what that particular rhyme meant before you felt he lost respect. Think hard now.

"Satellite in Outer Space,



Whirling round with ease and grace,



One day soon you'll fall to earth,



But till that time my satellite,



Spins the world,



Once a day comes your way..."



Does anyone know this song or know somewhere i could find a version of it coz i just think it'll be a laugh to hear it again...

Hey it sounds like a good name. Probably something i would listen to.



:D. Ignore all the haters that are going to look at the question and be
like no emo is dumb, or emo is something that is over rated. and stuff like that. Its just that people dont get that if emo was over rated people wouldnt be dressing emo. instead we would be dressing like nasty disgusting preps.

What Is The Woman Who Sings This Song Called "I Fall Apart"?



I am including some lyrics which i can make out from the song.



Oh when I'm waiting
Anticipating



I feel you hesitating
To give me your heart and ....??
I fall apart



I fall apart



My words don't get through to you it seems



And when I hurt
Your barely even noticing



(chorus) Oh when I'm waiting,



Anticipating
I feel you hesitating



To give me your heart and ...??
I fall apart
I fall apart



(bridge)



And I don't know how much longer I can do this anymore



If I don't get all of you



Than I'm tempted to walk right through your door
But I just can't let go



Cause I need you so
And you can give me so much more

Just open your mind and listen to everything.  Try all different types of music, you may find something completely different to listen to.  Try country, jazz, blues, and anything else  you can find.

Yeah, I'm getting a bit bored of the scene too. I've been looking at some of the unsigned bands on MySpace to get a taste of something different and many are pretty awful but I love this band:

I think the music is brilliant and they actually have something to say and the lyrics are really motivating and inspirational.

Matters what kind of punk you want. I like the old-school punk, the first punk bands. Like Bad Brains, Dead Kennedys, Iggy & the Stooges, and the Suicidal Tendancies. All are good, try them out.

Help Writing Song Lyrics?



I want to write song lyrics, and I have some topics, the thing is I can't find a way of writing them. My genre is rock, heavy metal etc. I like Avenged Sevenfold and Slipknot lyrics, and I admire the way they can write lyrics with alot of subliminal meaning in it, and the language being amazing without being flowery.



Any tips on how to write lyrics?

A way of writing song lyrics is too write your life in a song and over exaggerate emotions, this has been done many times. Over all you can rhyme lyrics like this.



Another way to write lyrics is too look around you and start with a particular topic which you can focus on which can give you help.



Hope it helps and good luck

Any little thing that pops into your head, write it down.



It just might eventually be the key to A song. Most of the time, a whole song isn't going to pop into your head. However if you use the little pieces and put them together the best way you feel fit. You'll do fine.

Question about Dr. Dre's "Chronic 2001"?



I've always wondered why Dre chose Lord Finesse to be the only outside producer on his album. I haven't heard of them having any form of relationship prior to the album, so the choice seems more odd. Have you guys heard either them talk about this? I couldn't find anything about this.

So, this idiot woman writes "I'm pregnant and I fell down the stairs", and I told her, "Congratulations!  Take all the money you're gonna save not having a kid over the next 18 years and go time-share your own island!"



And those hormonal preggers flagged my comments and got like 34 of my points taken away yesterday - wtf???  I know I've said worse than that, how is it a "violation" of an answer, it's my own legit answer...

Sorry Mechanical, you lose.. again.



...To answer your question:



Obama winning has not eradicated racism in America...  there will always be racism in America but Obama’s victory is proof that race relations have begun to improve. America is finally begun to reconcile its differences with people of color and live up to its creed. Obama alone cannot save the world, He's not God, he's not the Messiah.. That is not his job. His job is to Govern our nation.



To people who say Obama's Victory will not change the Dynamics in Hip Hop You're wrong...  people have forgotten that Hip Hop is deeply rooted in social perception and that perception is indeed reflected in Hip Hop... Yesterday People of color and an entire generation were granted a new reality thus Hip hop was granted a new reality because Art  imitates life....

Dillinger - Miss Machine and Irony is a Dead Scene feat Mike Patton and Ire Works



BTBAM - Colors (prog) and Alaska (metalcore with prog. influences). If you want a more Deathcore sound, listen to The Silent Circus



PTH- Kezia and Fortress are about the same. If you want a more Hardcore Punk sound check out "A Calculated use of Sound"

The dilinger escape plan - ire works
Protest the hero - fortress
the human abstract - nocturne

Good Bands Like Nickelback & Escape the fate?



Hey, just wanting something different to listen too, love the sound of Nickelback stuff and Escape the Fate.

Any ideas?
Thanks :)

They are good bands, if you actually stopped for a second and listened to the lyrics than you'd think so too **** wit :)



Seriously honestly who cares if you don't like them, why bother even coming into this question, i didn't ask whether you liked them or not, if i did then it would clearly say that right? So come on, just rack off :)



Jonas brothers are completely ****, along with all that new stuff. You guys are all dick heads, honestly grow the **** up.

If we change the word "Jams" to "tenants," I believe we end up with the same result either way:



"Kick out the tenants," or
"Kick the tenants out."



It would appear that the Jams end up homeless no matter what.



Be a darling and let them rent some space in a jar in your fridge or cupboard, or on the airwaves in your home. But do be diligent about collecting the rent--the Jams are tricky and will try to get out of paying what they owe.

Should I take it back?



I bought a cd today at Big W, it was only $19. Which isn't bad for a compilation(2 CDs). But when I opened the Cd, inside, the CDs had fallen off their holder because a couple of the little clips on both sides had broken off. Also when I turned over the divider (the clear thing in the middle that the CDs are held onto) the top corner of that was totally snapped off, so it doesn't stay in the cd case. It was a cheap Cd, but I wasn't expecting this.

Yeah burn it first - they will probably give you another copy anyway but just in case :-) also, for future reference - you can expect broken covers with starting out bands that are on tour (like if u buy their cd for $5 or $10) so dont take it back then cuz chances are most of them are like that (i should know - its my job to go and sell the stuff for them) but if you buy it from a store you should expect better quality than that.

i go from my fender 50's reissue strat into a digitech xp-100 whammy wah, use the wah settings on the pedal then straight into my fender front man 100 watt. I use the distortion from the amp. Ive always used this setup at gigs and shows, and its never failed me.



I own a boss dd-3 delay pedal and a eh small clone pedal, but never use them live.



It all depends on what soudn you need, if your playing metal then you need good disotrtion, psychedelic rock then you need vibrato/phaser etc.



A good guitarist can make his sound interesting without effects, and running your guitar through heaps of pedals will dampen the overall tone and is a pain to control on stage!

Era - Don't You Forget...



Lyrics:



Mom's sick, she say she cant get up.
My little brother is getting hungry.
I must go to the village and ask for some food, would you help me?
-Sure Connie, I'll help ya.
-I always feel good when you're with me.
-You're my friend Connie.
-Are you always gonna be there when I grow up, are you?
-Cross my heart.



Don't you forget about me, don't you forget about me.
We were soft and young, in a world of innocence.
Don't you forget about me, don't you forget all of our dreams.
Now you've gone away, only emptiness remains.



-I always feel good when you're with me.
-You're my friend Connie.
-Are you always gonna be there when I grow up, are you?



Don't you forget about me, don't you forget about me.
We were soft and young, in a world of innocence.
Don't you forget about me, don't you forget all of our dreams.
Now you've gone away, only emptiness remains.
Don't you forget about me, don't you forget about me.
Don't you forget about me, don't you forget about me.
We were soft and young, in a world of innocence.
Don't you forget about me, don't you forget all of our dreams.
Now you've gone away, only emptiness remains.
Don't you forget about me.
We were soft and young, in a world of innocence.
Don't you forget about me.
Don't you forget about me.

Don't be talking bad about 1963 ...... People like me were born then too and yes parties were the place to be with the best music. Remember ELO, Foghat and Dr Hook & the Medicine Show ? But THE BEST party tunes were cranking from PINK FLOYD !!!!! WOW!!! Talk about "flashbacks"..... I think I need to go get "Comfortably Numb" now.

Most of those aren't mainstream bands. Just go on youtube and search for them. They are mostly hard rock bands.



Sad to see most of those bands don't get the recognition they deserve despite their musical skill level.

I'm looking for some different music. I'm getting tired of the popular stuff on the radio and the bands I've been listening to for so long now. Anybody know any good rock, punk, or metal bands? Anything underground or that maybe I just haven't heard of. Oh, and if you know of any Japanese rock bands, that would be super! Thanks . . .

Has anyone heard a song that has a bunch of "yeah yeah yeah"s in it? I think it's new, it's a dance song (well you can easily dance to it), a woman sings it, and it's just really upbeat. Maybe a dance/pop song. Any help on what song this might be would be so great!

How about this song: "Space-Dye Vest" by Dream Theater... it might have the mood and theme you're looking for... one of the lines is "I'll never be open again." Very profound. Here, check it out:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-Dye_V...



You should really listen to it though... don't let the description through you off, it's not metal at all.



Buy it on iTunes or something. Now. Go. Please.

But if people give you lyrics, it won't truly be your song. Writing a song is



special. You need to make it up because it is the way you feel not other people. Sorry I can't help, but I think you need to do it on your own.

Life can be hard no matter what you do.
My life is a burden and it's so true.
I'm in a prison cell locked away forever with you.
I am good at heart



Though I have given up
What have you done



What were you thinking
What have I done
I am a burden and it's so true.
What I'm I to do
Always causing trouble
Looking for some help I always stumble
Burden me Burden you
We all have burdens



We are all locked down
And have nothing to do
I must escape



And so must you



The burden that holds me and you
Is this the best I can do?



Hey It was just a suggestion frrrraaagggooootttt.  Your lucky I even gave you a few lines because you probably listen to new crapy music and I hardly ever go on the computer.  It's all about Iron Maiden,  Megadeth and Metallica.  And why would your song be for a friend.  When I write songs I acually USE them for my band.

Aside from that there's too many to name. I love anything by Nat king Cole, though my favorite song of his is "Nature Boy". Billie Holiday, Rolling Stones, Luther Vandross, Queen, Al Green, Michael Jackson, man don't even get me started.

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out

Obama's been politically "patiently waiting" for quite a while...



Its not a premonition.



All it does is show that Common is extremely politically aware. Furthermore, Obama was a senator in Illinois, Isn't common from the Chi too?

here are the lyrics..i couldnt find the verse



[Jadakiss]
Aha
Its dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if they're part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' niggas CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine?
Why my niggas ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That didn't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Cris'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why



[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that Ive been givin'
Is this pain that I've been living
They got me in the system
So why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why, oh why
Why they gotta do me like that



[Jadakiss]
Why do niggas push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my ***** D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggas get degrees in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggas lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a ***** always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggas can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest **** but be sellin' the least



[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that Ive been givin'
Is this pain that I've been living
They got me in the system
So why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why, oh why
Why they gotta do me like that



[Jadakiss]
Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get an Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a "why lie I need a beer" sign
Why all the young niggas is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for AIDS
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why are you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice?
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all the old ones
That's why



[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
All that Ive been givin'
Is this pain that I've been living
They got me in the system
So why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent on up the highway
Why, oh why
Why they gotta do me like that

Where can I find this sweatshirt/hoody/hoodie?



I was watching a television show with music videos like mtv u or mtv 2 or bet or something like that. I was doing my homework and I turned on the tv there was a 13 year old rapper with Chris brown, or James brown. But anyways one of the people on set had a white Obama sweatshirt that had the word "hope" printed on the bottom left in a different array of bright colors and sketched Obama's face (on the back side of the hoodie). The colors changed from pink and and bright green, it was so sick! Does any one know the rapper or the show I was watching? Or, where I could find the hoodie? Mad props to anyone that can find it.

Do Women have Falsettos?



it's been bugging me for a while now. My professional chior director says there's singing with your diaphargm and singing with your throat for girls but we do not have a falsetto. the notes just get too high for us.



Now, my school choir director agrees with this guy who claims he can't read music and seems a little bit too full of his decent singing which is often overpraised that women can have a falsetto.



so which is it?
Need 2 Know! Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



falsetto is a vocal register, so yes, women can have it too. it's almost like a head voice, what sets them apart is that while a properly trained head voice is clear and firm, falsetto is airy, and, like the name says, sounds 'fake'.



by the way, DON'T EVER SING WITH YOUR THROAT! there isn't such thing. chest, middle and head voices are not about using either diaphragm or throat but where the sound is ressonating. for example, if you hold your hand to you chest while you sing in chest voice, you'll feel a slight vibration!

What should I look for when purchasing a Microphone?  (Music Production)?



Hello,



I am looking into buying a decent microphone for laying vocals over my tracks. I currently use "Reason" to produce my tracks and use Adobe Audition 3.0 to multitrack. My system consists of a Windows OS with a X-Fi Xtreme Gamer Sound Card.



I am aware that under most circumstances I will need a Pre-Amp, Spit-Gaurd and of course a Microphone. I know some microphones are crazy expensive but I'd like to keep my budget around $2000 for everything.



Do you guys have any suggestions and why? I really do not know much about microphones so please feel free to enlighten me. Thanks for you're time and info!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Most studios use a condenser microphone for vocals and acoustic instruments. Condenser microphones are rarely used for vocals on stage because (a good one) can pick up a pen drop across the room. They are also fairly delicate. If you drop one it's not uncommon for it be damaged perminately.



Cardioid (aka Dynamic) microphones such as the Sennheiser e835 or Sure SM58 work better on the road and  on a stage. You can toss these around and not have to worry at all. The good ones (such as the models mentioned) do an excellent job at picking up what's right in front of them, but they lack the warmth and clarity of a good condenser microphone.



Condenser microphones require a pre-amp that supports phantom power and a spit-guard/pop filter, Cardiod microphones do not.



My favorite budget end condensers are those made by Audio-Technica. I have their AT2020 ($100.00) and AT4050 ($540.00) and both of these microphone do an amazing job on vocals and acoustic guitar for the price.



I have a SURE SM58 that I use for live vocals and if I plug it into my setup (M-Audio interface into PC) and lay vocal tracks even the AT2020 blows it away.The AT4050 has aged-gold components, dual-diaphragm and other features that I couldn't exactly tell you what they do, but the sound is  a bit clearer. I like using the AT4050 for vocals and the AT2020 for my guitar, but I've switched them around before and the difference is very nominal considering the price gap. If you're working on building a pro-studio I'd recommend the AT4050 because it has really high-end condenser features at a very good price (some competitors want $1000+ for the same features), if you're just building a home studio, the AT2020 or AT4040 will do just fine.



One other thing, if you're going to record a style of music where the vocalist has to scream a lot (rock, metal) you may consider sticking with the good dynamic mic like the Sure SM58. A lot of vocalist in these genres still perfer a dynamic microphone in the studio because it's more tolerant to their style (screams will force your peaks into the red pretty quick with a condenser, you can try getting the vocalist to back up a bit, but sometimes it's just best to use a dynamic mic).



Also in situations where the whole band is performing togeather in an open area the vocalist has to use a dynamic microphone. A lot of bands still record this way, U2's last album How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb was recorded this way and Bono used a SM58 on most of the studio tracks.

If you talked to a style coach they would tell you to work out breaks/cracks, pitch problems, support/breath control, etc.. first. In other words they would say come and see me when you get done with the vocal coach.



But assuming you have all that under control. The first thing is your voice type has to match up. James is a Baritone, he hits a few sweet high notes, but he also hits his share of low notes. If you're voice sits naturally in the higher register (Tenor) then you could trash your voice trying to sing like him. If you have that out of the way then the thing to do is to just take a few of his songs, break them down into 30 second intervals and try to mimic everything he's doing. Every moan, growl, scream, etc... Record your! Listen to the playback, then listen to james. Make notes of what you hear differently then try to correct those things. If you're hearing James do things with his voice you're not able to do, then you need to identify why that is. Is he going outside your range? Is he holding a note longer than you can comfortably? If you're having those sort of issues, you need to work on techniques with your voice coach to correct support and to try and extend range (sounds like you're already doing this trying to work out your cracks).



Metallica has enough live material on CD that you need not go to the studio recording for comparison. Quality live recordings are always better to work with as studio takes can consist of many vocal takes cut & pasted togeather... A quality live recording provides a good reference for what the singer can really do when you strip away all the studio toys and give him basic EQ, compression, etc...



Sorry, I know this isn't a great answer, hopefully I've given some perspective.

I can't 'belt out' songs?



Well at the moment, I'm trying to teach myself how to sing properly.
I'm doing well so far, I can sing in tune and with my diaphragm etc etc
But when I try and sing powerfully (like belting out songs etc) I can not do it.



I'm guessing there's just different muscles involved, and if I practice 'belting' out enough, I'll be able to do it eventually?



I can sing quite powerfully when I do it in an 'opera' voice actually, but I don't really want to use that singing style.

if you sing with a pointed tone, you can belt out any song.
a pointed tone is when you have 50% of air coming from you mouth and 50% from your nostril. it's not singing through your nose either.
this is called the pointed tone method. I taught it for years. it gives you a good solid tone and gives you the effect of singing with authority.
too much air from the mouth and you sound mushy. too much from the nostril and you sound sharp. it takes a lot of work. but it does work
also try running the scales several times a day.

In my oppinion you should get your butt in a studio!
I think that sounded very well and should look to further your singing as a career.



Although there is always room for improvement atop a spectacular talent. Celine Dion always has to be improved, right? Yes, so I suggest listening to yourself a couple times through that video and see what you personally would like to improve on, not what others say but what you think, then you'll have a work of art.

You've got a very beautiful tone to ur voice. However, I would advice u not to constrict ur voice too much. As the 1st answerer said, u went a bit off at some points. I feel that's because of the height of those pitches. I noticed u were constricting a lot, and I'ld like to tell u u're allowed to breathe! Let the voice not come from ur throat (lot's of ppl do that), but from ur insides (lungs and stomach) (will take u to the next level).
Really nice voice though. Sing with ur throat released, and u'll blow minds away.

Trevor Strnad's vocal style?



I have just really begun to listen to The Black Dahlia Murder and i was wondering if anyone has a similar sound to Trevor and what technique they use. I can definitely pick out a fry sound on his high vocals but they dont sound like the typical fry to me being that theres a bit more punch. And his lows are obviously some type of death metal technique but they don't have that vibrating sound you can here in bands like Job For A Cowboy, Deicide etc(which are amazing btw). Trevor's growls sound smoother and clearer than alot of death metal growls.

Summer of '69 because that is when my wife was born, Or "Your still the one" which was our song ten years ago when we got married (and still going strong).  Especially as many people did not think we would last!



Others I like include Summertime, because I love it.  (As well as Paradise City.)



But for this summer, Katy Perry and "I Kissed a Girl."  Sorry, sad I know, but a great song.

There has to be a combination of a great choice of song (NOT necessarily a great song), a great artist and the song should be covered in a way that makes the new version a good recording in its own right.  It's pointless covering a song if you're bringing nothing new to the table.



A great cover version is very rarely better than the original, and neither should they often be considered to be, but it may compare and enjoyment of the original should not be hindered by the existance of a cover.



Deciding how to cover a song and making a good job of it should follow similar principles to writing and recording an original song.  The effort levels often compare and often need to for the cover to be a success.



To sum up, for a cover to be great the artist must be great, the choice of song must be great and the cover should be created and not carried out.



A carbon copy will never a great cover make.



Greatest cover ever?  Well it's a pointless argument because everyone knows that if Nirvana had actually CREATED a fully-mixed and mastered studio-recorded version of My Sharona nothing else would've come close.

By making the song feel fresh, even it's been there for decades. Giving it a different meaning and giving new life to it. Bands do better covers that popstars, simply because they try to sound different, while popstars copy and imitate every single chords and tones.

i think to do a good cover version you should have a general interest of the band whose song u are covering...ie not just to find out how much money a hit 20years ago made and decide to do that song..it ..on doing a cover version you should have some background knowledge on the original band and understand what made them do the tune and their inspiration for it..then make it your own! bit of orignality too is good cant be same ors no point in cover version.. A good one i think is bono's and greendays house of rising sun!! maybe im gabbling but its what i think...id also like to win the tickets pls!?

For anyone who says that "a cover is never better than the original" is WAY off base!



*Sarah McLachlan's version of XTC's 'DEAR GOD' was amazing...even Andy Partridge has said it was the way the should have been done!*



*Sinead O'Connor's cover of Prince's 'NOTHING COMPARE 2 U' was superior to his version because she let the emotions take the song, not the over production of the music.*



*Check out Whiskeytown's take on 'A SONG FOR YOU' by Gram Parsons.  Raw in it's simplistic beauty.*



Covering some songs are needless and pointless...but if any cover song turns you on the the music of the original artist, then that can never be a bad thing.

A truly great cover version may change the mood, the theme, the perception of the original meaning, or may even cross-over musical boundaries. However, a truly great cover version may also serve as a timely reminder of how tastes change (sometimes old songs only become classics in later generations when covered). Either way creating a truly great cover version has to be about seeing it from a new point of view, and with inspiration.

a good cover happens when the cover artist sings a clear interpretation of the original with their own sound. a great cover happens when the cover artist takes the song and makes it their own tastefully and musically. it's hard to make a good cover out of a bad song though, so i think it's all about which song and what the final product makes the audience feel.

A really great cover version has to be a really classic song, but with the band's own flair. It should make people go,



"Wow! I know that song! ___ sang that first but this version is so much better!".
Though it definitely shouldn't make people shout,

Honestly, I don't like covers. They usually piss me off.



However, If you really want to do one avoid doing anything by the Beatles. No one can top the Beatles.



Also, doing a really loud, fast-paced song in a slow, accustic way would be good. Like a Nirvana song or something (not that I don't like Nirvana, I just think their songs sound great accustic)



Someone said that doing a song that's unexpected is good, and that's true. For example when Johnny Cash did "Personal Jesus" or Bowling for Soup did "Baby One More Time" or Sly and the Family Stone's version of "Que Sera, Sera". That's always kinda cool.



Or maybe if you do a song that everyone's forgotten about, like Nirvana did a version of Leadbelly's "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" (originally from the '30's) on that MTV Unplugged CD-thingy.



Anyway, if you're going to do a cover, don't make it a single, only make original songs singles.



Well, that's my opinion. :)

If you listen to Murray Head's "Say It Ain't So Joe" and then Roger Daltrey's version, the mood's totally different and Roger's not really understood the song.



But listen to Johnny Cash singing "Hurt", and he tackles the song from a completely different angle than NIN did, yet it works, almost better than the original.



Some favourites:
Cheap Trick: "Ain't That a Shame"
Bryan Ferry: "These Foolish Things"
Cowboy Junkies: "Sweet Jane"
Hooters: "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"
Icicle Works: "Needle & the Damage Done"
Icehouse: "Love Like Blood"
Manic Street Preachers: "Rock n Roll Music"
Shawn Colvin: "Tenderness on the Block"
Stevie Ray Vaughan: "Superstition"

I think it is difficult to produce a really good cover, especially if the original was a huge hit. It is important to stick to the lyrics and music arrangement, whilst making the song your own at the same time.



Anyway Keane don't need to do covers their songs are fantastic.



My nine year old daughter Megan helped with this answer as she  is as big a Keane fan as me. Her favourite track is "Bedshaped".

Good question, first of all it has to be a great song to start with, (worth covering), secondly the band have to put a new twist on the song (no point recording exactly the same sound again) and lastly, there has to be sufficient time between the two different artists recording it.



The best example of a cover version that covers the points above is Stevie Wonder's version of "We can work it out" by the Beatles. The harmonica is amazing !!!

Sometimes cover versions are done for all the wrong reasons, it seems some artists just cant be bothered to come up with an original song, so in order to keep in the public eye they just do a cover version.
In my opinion the best cover versions are those songs that the artists really admire and truly want to improve on.
Also some songs are just too well done to be covered and any attempt to do so is almost an insult to some of the great artists.

Can you put your original stamp on the song without having to betray the integrity of the original? (Jerry Lee Lewis' new cd has some good examples) Is there any good/appropriate/timely reason to sing the song in the first place? (ex: War, what is it good for?)



I have heard some great covers  - check out some of Springsteen & the E Street Band in their earliest shows, or consider a very, very young, upcoming band Comic Book Heroes - they do a cover of Purple People Eaters - geared for young (teen) listeners- yet with an original stamp on it to make it their own.  They make that song worth listening to -- and isn't that the heart of the matter?



In the end, it has to be the combination of a very talented singer paired with an honest, original arrangement of the song.



In other words, don't sing Roy Orbison's 'Crying' if you are not KD Lang.  And, please, do not ever listen to that songbook by Rod Stewart - it is the antithesis to good song covering.



Finally, if you are covering another artist's stuff, you better be bringing your best game -- if you are a guitar band, let's hear it; if you have the pipes, show off with an acoustic version; if you are known for a certain style, put your stamp on it (See: Pearl Jam's cover of 'Leaving Here')

A really great cover version is to make it original, not make it sound the same and basically add a bit of spice to it but dont try to make it better than the original because you will ruin it and people will get bored.

Well the thing that would be top of my list would be that you have respect for the artist that your covering, i hate when i hear a cover of a great song by some dancey group and they just totally miss the point of the band and the song in favour for crappy beats. also you need to put your own mark on it but i dont think it should be unrecognisable from the original. but this is just my opinion, good luck, its hard to pull off a truly great cover version!!

In my opinion, a great cover version has to have the same, if not better, spirit in the song. Someone took time to write and sing that song, so show the same emotions and respect to the song, after all the song will sell you as a band, and if you have the same drive as the person who wrote it in the first place surely it will sell. You must also add a few spicy ingredients giving it a bit more edge and style than the original.

Think of something that appeals to everyone emotionally... something that everybody can relate to. Like maybe something or someone who inspires you, or something you're obsessed with.



Now variety. Switching speeds is one way to go. Half of the reason why people get sick of a song is because it's the same speed... over and over again. Changing speeds throughout the song will have people sitting on the edge of their seat, anticipating what will come next. Also, you could try changing beats and tones. I suggest combining all three approaches.



And finally, be original. As corny as it sounds, don't sing something unless you really mean it. People can see, and hear, if you don't agree with what you're singing/saying. If you are making it you're own, I swear to bob, it makes it so much better.



Good luck!

I think overall I am a 7 or 8 maybe...
I am very eclectic and know about all sorts of music, from Classical and Opera to Pop and Jazz, Dance/Trance and Disco , new age chill out, soundtracks and many rock genres also.
I thought I knew a lot until I came here and met a YA user ( Smiley ) and since then I have learned so much about bands I never even heard of, so now I know more, but still there is so much out there. But I think it is all very relative and depends who you are taking as the parameter. Compared to most persons I know a lot but there are some persons who are extremely knowledgeable.

The Jam's classic "Down in the Tube Station at Midnight...



Distant echo --
On board votes in far distant trains
If you want them to the home
Those who love and who love forever
Glazed, dirty steps - repeat my own, and reflects my thoughts
Cold and forbidding, semi-naked
In addition to caramel wrapers, in the morning, paper
Mr. Jones received the stake
Headlines of death and mourning - say tomorrow
Crazy to rage
Them down in a tube station midnight
I fumble for change - and pull out the queen
Smile, sultry
I am put in money and pull out a plum
For me
Whispers in the shadows - gruff voice candescent
Hating, waiting
Hey boy, that cry out - you have some money?
And I said - lve little money and take away curry,
Hi, on my way home to my wife.
Shell is lining up to the plate
You know, shes expecting me
Polishing the glasses and the raising of cork
Them down in a tube station midnight



The first time I felt as a fist, and then kick
I can now smell their breath
Atlantic are from the tavern and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It will look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It is mixed with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldnt see, hear, speak more
Them down in a tube station midnight
I told you in a tube station midnight



The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Jesus saves painted by the atheist zombie
A British Rail poster read have a long day - a cheap holiday --
Do it now!
I trblietala back on his life
And taking my wife
cause they took the keys - and I think his shell me
Them down in a tube station midnight
Wines will be a curry is gone cold
Provides them in a tube station midnight
Dont want to go down the tube station midnight

I love the theme song from the current season of the unit! I know the song is called Walk the Fire.



The problem is that I only download legal music that I purchase off sites such as Itunes and Napster. But, both of those sites don't have that song.

Scott McKenzie was a one-hit wonder, and the San Francisco song was his big moment.  FYI, Scott was in a folk group (The Journeymen) with John Phillips, later of the Mamas and Papas.  Originally named Phil Blondheim, Scott changed his name, taking the middle name of John's daughter Laura McKenzie Phillips (later famous for her role on One Day at a Time - and her drug problems).

i've been wondering why you have asked such questions all evening, and give us the actual name of probably the only song that the artist is known for. Are you bored or what, and your questions are mostly aimed at a certain age group, and defo not anyone born in the last 20 years!

"Lead Sails (And A Paper Anchor)".



It's by Atreyu.



Dunno if it's romantic, but it's rock, and it's slow, and it's cool. Ticks all the right boxes.

Could someone provide me with a translation of the lyrics for Redemption by Conjure One?



ever since I heard this song, both the melody, the beat and composition of the song have hypnotized and allured me. sadly enough, the songwriter for the song, Chemda; never did release translations for the song, saying she'd rather have the song speak for its self. i don't have a problem with that, but I'd like to know specifics, because if I can understand the meaning behind the lyrics myself, I could connect to it on a further level. since I don't speak Arabic myself(which she said the song lyrics were written in), I couldn't translate it myself, so i was wondering if there is anyone out there who would know what the lyrics are, and would be willing to share them. much thanks.

Lyrics to Walk Away :
Vocalizing: Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.



I guess I should've known better,
to believe I'm a lucky chain, Oh.
I lent my heart out forever,
and finally learned each other's names.



I tell myself, "this time it's different."
No goodbyes, cause eyes can't bear to say it.
"I'll never survive on one that's coming",
If I stay, Ooh!



Just Walk Away! Ooh, and don't look back.
Cause if my heart breaks, It's gonna hurt so bad.
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that.
Before It's too late. Oh, just Walk Away!
(Walk, Walk, Walk Away) Ooh, just Walk Away!
(Walk, Walk, Walk) Away-aye-aye, yeah.



I really wish I could blame you, but I know
That it's no one's fault. No, No. No, No
Cinderella with no shoe, and
the prince that doesn't know he's lost.
He says that her face is so familiar, and
Goodbye with just the same old song.
But this time I will not surrender!
'Cause I'm gone, Ooh, yeah!



Just Walk Away! Ooh, and don't look back.
Cause if my heart breaks, It's gonna hurt so bad.
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that.
Before It's too late. Oh, just Walk Away!
(Walk, Walk, Walk Away) Ooh, just Walk Away!
(Walk, Walk, Walk) Away-aye-aye, yeah.



Ooh, I've got to let it go.
Start protecting my heart and soul.
Cause I don't think I'll survive a goodbye again.
Not again!



Just Walk Away! Ooh, and don't look back.
Cause if my heart breaks, It's gonna hurt so bad.
You know I'm strong, but I can't take that.
Before It's too late. (Before It's Too Late!)
Oh, just Walk Away!
(Walk, Walk, Walk Away) Walk Away, Walk Away, yeah!
(Walk, Walk, Walk Away!) Walk Away, Walk Away, All right!
(Walk Away, Walk Away, Yeah, Walk Away!) Walk Away, Walk Away.

Of course I have! Its a wonderful first (first known)  recorded demo of that song, very bleak and well like the original title says, sad. Sappy is probably my favorite Nirvana song and it would be interesting to hear the numerous other unsurfaced versions.

Yes, I've heard it before.  I love it (I love all Nirvana songs actually =D) For me, it carries a lot of emotional impact.  You can feel Kurt's depression. Honestly, I think I like the official "With The Lights Out" version better though...twas still emotionally powerful, and more of Kurt's vocal range came out.



wtf was I talking about...I need to get some sleep! Come as you are?  I meant With the Lights out obviously

Do Women have Falsettos?



it's been bugging me for a while now. My professional chior director says there's singing with your diaphargm and singing with your throat for girls but we do not have a falsetto. the notes just get too high for us.



Now, my school choir director agrees with this guy who claims he can't read music and seems a little bit too full of his decent singing which is often overpraised that women can have a falsetto.



so which is it?

Where can I find a copy online of the song In The Dropull Plain - Në Fushën E Dropullit ?



I first became reacquainted with this particular track when I heard it was used as a a sampler for the Conjure One song "Pandora". I had heard the track years before I had heard of Conjure One, and I never did find out what the name of the song, till I heard Pandora, and ever since then, I've been trying to find a copy of the song, online; but to no success. can anyone recommend where I can listen to this song its entirety and then download it?  much thanks

You'll probably hate my suggestion, like the majority of the world now, but Start All Over by Miley Cyrus is a really good one. Or maybe See You Again by said artist. I also really like Simple Song by previously mentioned artist.

:"BENNY AND THE JETS" ~ Elton John...
I need to explain myself here before you say "WTF MAZZY!!??"
Its not the song as such, its more the way I can sing it very loudly at work in a really amusing way that makes even the old prudes break out into a laugh!!  It's a great song to rip out and make a right d.i.c.k out of yourself!!

"Safety Dance" by Men Without Hats.  I couldn't change the station fast enough when that was a hit in the 80s, but now that I don't have to hide from it 400 times a day, I actually like it.



Another example is "I'll Be Good to You" by the Brothers Johnson.  I hated that song when it was a hit, but I heard it the other day on the 70s station and found myself singing along.

Good q!



I usually skipped "Phantom" when I would listen to Justice's Cross album...But then I went back and realized it was the best song.



With In Rainbows from Radiohead - I always started listening to the album by the second track, "Bodysnatchers".  But then I finally listened to "15 Steps" on shuffle one day, and that was it for me.  I gave it all my attention for weeks.  "15 Steps" is just amazing, the beats are incredibly captivating, and the song is at its best when the song gets all its instruments in.



Same for Spoon's Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga.  I always flew past "Don't Make Me A Target."  Never thought I'd like it.



The one time I regretted this overlooking thing the most, was with A Ghost Is Born from Wilco.  I didn't like the album at all the first time I listened to it, and when I did like it, I never liked "Hell Is Chrome" or any of the first four songs.  It took me the longest time imaginable to like "Hell Is Chrome".  But now it is definitely a favorite.



Another one is "Place To Be" from Nick Drake.  Never liked the dang Pink Moon album.  But then I gave his so-called "popular" songs a listen, and still didn't like it.  After a several tries I gave up, only to try again, and find that I liked only one song from the whole album - which is "Place To Be".



And I've always missed out on "Jet" by Paul McCartney.  For the longest time I hated that song so much.  Now I have no reason to.



Sorry for having such a long answer!

Hey what do you think of my lyrics?!?



The first song is about someone who really hurt me.
The second one is about God.
The third one is me goofing around.



Please dont write realy nasty comments!



Open your eyes and look around
Your life really isn’t that bad
Screw your vanity and screw your ego
You don’t need to be sad



Theres nothing wrong with your life
So why have a cry
Yor bringing down others around
each word you speak is just a lie



I use to love you



I put my trust in your hands
Did your fingers slip away
Or was it one of your plans



Im sorry if I don’t care about it



Its just what I don’t need
Im trying to be happy
And live the life I dreamed.



Im sick of this old life, I want to be free
I want to see life how its meant to be.
God, please help me, you’ll know what to do
It’s hard to trust but I can always trust you
Lord, help me on this helpless day



To get free and get away
Im trapped inside a tiny box with no key and no one else can help me



But I know you will love me for who I am and who I am I don’t understand
Im yet to figure out my purpose at this time
But you will help me to cross the line



Cross the line to be free and see who im meant to be.



I sit here on this rock hard bed



All these thoughts running through my head
I don’t know what to do without you here
Sitting alone shivering with fear



You weren’t there when I needed you
You think you know what im going through



But its different cause your not here to help me



You hurt me just to see me bleed
You used to love me or was that all lies?
Are you happy when you strangle me



As my eyes fill with tears



They arent all finnished but ay!

The third one scared me a bit, but the lyrics still mean something. And that's more than I can say about most of today's music.

Beautiful :) You have too many verses in some parts hun, and in the first song, I think "did it slip from your hands" would make it flow better. In song writing you want fluidity, a common syllable count between measures. I think the lyrics are very nicely written though :) Keep on keepin on! &lt;3

Rap/Hip Hop is formed from uttering rhymes over repetitive beats making it impossible for it to evolve and advance forward, the only reason it was so well received during the 1980's was because those artists were original.

I think the hip hop underground is going strong. There's a lot of insanely good rap out there, but the general public made rap sooooooooo shitty. Everything on the radio, at clubs, etc just sucks. I think hip hop has potential. It's relatively new, so there are lots of possibilities for the future. I mean if rock is still alive for as long as its been, rap will make it.

While anything is possible, I doubt it.
Back in the late 80s, there still was a balance of small labels and big labels putting out rap music, helping to result in a variety of rap styles, including bohemian, pop, rock-rap, gangsta, Afrocentric, jazzy, romantic, great DJ and MC pairings, etc., etc. There was a style for almost any taste. The rap was coming from a real place. While rap was gaining more mainstream popularity at the time, again the small/independent labels was keeping it grounded, and mainstream labels had yet to take over the industry through mega-mergers.



Sure, hip-hop does have a future, but it comes through the underground, not through the mega-labels that control the stores, the radio and TV.



The Internet is largely a wasted resource because today's youth are more concerned with instant gratification and ringtones, not substance. Everything (that includes rock) seems to be about having an instant, catchy hit.

Could it be "give the girl" instead of "give the world"?



I found two possibilities: New York Dolls - Great Big Kiss ('92) and Bruce Springsteen - Give the Girl a Kiss (released late 90s). NYD doesn't sound at all like the Black Crowes though, and the Springsteen song wasn't that well-known.

Makes me think at the Sun path.Starts the day with singing birds and chill air,then the Sun rise warming the earth .There is a part that sounds like the image of the Sun floating over the water.Then the sound starts to get more active and then the night comes with low sounds. I like it.Tho' in it's deep structure seems unfinished.

What Chords r these please ?



Hello helpful people of yahoo answers!!
I have this guitar chord I heard when messing around on a friend's computer and I've been trying to crack it but I'm positive I'm missing something, it just doesn't sound right, I know the guitarist probably has different equipment and all but I'm sure its a couple of notes I have wrong as well.
please if there's anyone who could help me, I'm at the point of hearing it in my head at work and in the morning when I wake up.



well here it is:

Trying to figure out what song I heard on the radio............?



The music genre is rock. I don't remember the station but it was a rock song that had violins or some kind of instrument you don't usually hear in a rock song. Its suppose to be either a new single or from an album released since it was on the radio and it souned like Trapt / 3 days grace. But I can't figure out what song it is.



</question>



<additional details>



- I know its a 2008 song.
- Its a group that is Trapt or 3 days grace or sounds like them.
- and it isn't basic instruments.

Which version of the song 'Dead Souls' do you prefer?



Joy Division's original

Biased? I doubt it, nobody can sing that song like Ian Curtis. One of the greatest songs ever recorded in my mind.

Exactly...Peter and Bernard deserve alot of credit for the great bass and guitar lines they came up with. Trent Reznor has had hundreds of talented musicians play in his band, and not one of them has come up with something as awesome as Peter and Bernard did.

JOY DIVISION.
My opinion is biased though.



edit:
I'm biased because I don't like NIN much and Joy Division is one of my favorite bands.

The first version I heard was NIN's version,which is not bad at all compared to what it could be...actually quite good IMO...



But I prefer Joy Division's by a mile,it's a different song...and the longer intro works,building up the emotion...

Why the sudden revival of Lil Wayne?



He was performing with HotBoyz, alright but nothing great. Tha Carter I and II had about three good songs between the two of them. Then comes Tha Carter III, and it's filled with hits. Not my opinion only, but the charts don't lie my friends! What do you think is the reasoning behind this?

Jim Morrison
I guess I like him more for his performance and the way he presents himself rather than his vocal capabilities. But he is still my all time favorite, and a great singer. He puts so much emotion into his songs, and has such charisma. The Doors wouldn't have been as memorable as they are without Jim.

Patti LaBelle & Joss Stone- Stir it up



Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
Stir it up
I can't sit here while I go nowhere
Chase my dreams through the polluted air
Walking on a wire, running out of time
There's no room in this ol' heart of mine
Bill collectors waiting down the hall
Neighbors scream and crack the bedroom wall
Nerves jump off the pavement, passion hits the street
Angels cookin' in the city heat
World's too crazy, I can't take no more
I won't stay here locked behind the door
Baby, stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Hungry minds do stare you in the eyes
Spread it thick and lay the biggest lies
Don't say what you feel, must play hard to get
All those time bombs tickin' in your head
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
I've got to stir it up, got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, ooh, I can't wait to
Stir it, got to shake it up now
If I have to beg or borrow, I'm not gonna take it anymore, mmm, mmm
Can't find love because it's trapped inside
Can't find freedom flirting with line
Make some room in this ol' heart of mine
So much pressure to keep holdin' on
Pack my clothes up, baby, I'll be gone
Stir it up, I've got to break it up now
When I think about tomorrow, I can't wait to

Not just another "recommend me some Black Metal bands" question.?



This is a challenge.



I've asked for people to list some Black Metal bands that I havn't heard of before but all people seem to come up with is the obvious ones (Emperor, Mayhem, ect.), or they just post links to a ready-made list.



So here's how it's going to be.



You list as many Black Metal bands that you don't think I've heard of (and I've heard of quite a few), along with what they sound like (you can just compare them to other bands here for convenience's sake), one song that you think deserves a mention and the album it's on.



I'm not looking for obvious ones to get me started off here, I've been listening to metal for years and I want to see what you can come up with, so the more obscure, the better.



As you know, there's 10 points going for the best answer.

When the band started in the early 70s, he actually was still at school, and came to gigs without changing. He couldn't drink at the bars AC/DC played in because he was underage.



He doesn't strictly adhere to the uniform code in all clips and performances, but the cap is usually there.

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me



Chorus:
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me



Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be



Chorus



Bridge:
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you are comin' from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.



Chorus



Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
(Repeat to fade)

I think i know the name of this song but who sings it? I only know some of the lyrics...?



I think it might be called Summertime but i looked it up on youtube and the wrong song came up so i may be wrong....



It starts of something like: " Summer time and the living is easy...."



and then a bit later on i think it says : " Your daddies rich...and your mamas good looking...so hush, little baby, dont you cry..."
I think leona lewis might have sung it on the x factor as well?
Artist and song name please =]

Summertime

"Summertime,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high



Your daddy's rich
And your mamma's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry



One of these mornings
You're going to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky



But till that morning
There's a'nothing can harm you
With daddy and mamma standing by

Loads of people have sung it including Ella Fitzgerald.

Mantronix Fans???  --- do you know this tune?



the track starts with the robotic voice slowing down as it says "mantronix" repeatedly.... then kicks in with the track. I think it was on the music madness album or maybe a 12" or megamix. I burnt a few versions off Limewire but no luck.



Any ideas???

The music and lyrics combined, can sometimes reach right in to your heart and really pull you, and make you feel that the song was written specifically for you, even though the song was written about something the writer was feeling at the time. Thats the mark of a good songwriter, they will have some kind of empathy with the audience. It doesn't have to be a well known well loved song. It's easy to answer this question by stating a well known song, as some have, but that doesn't really explain the why.



One that does it for me is 'Is it any wonder' by the Chamelons, who you probably won't have heard of, yet the song might have been written about a situation I faced some yeard ago. Beautiful song.

what makes a tune special to me is if it carries you away in your mind.



It can be thread bare and rambunctious like Missy Elliot's White Horse or have beautifully crafted and delicate production like Madonna's Ray of Light.

Hi Emma!
Well,to be honest with you,I don't have a particular favourite song,but several that remind me of people and places.
(e.g."Miss you like crazy" by Natalie Cole reminded me of my stint in The Falkland Islands when I was in the Forces.
"Jeans on" by David Dundas,released in April 1976,brought back memories of when I first went out to Germany)
....I guess I'm giving my age away!!!!
"Gonna make you a Star" by David Essex reminds me of the Train journey I made when I first joined up.

'Faith of the Heart' by Rod Stewart or Russell Watson.  (I like both versions)



Simply because when I thought I was gonna give up on life I listened to this and realised how wrong I was.  For me it's the most inspirational song ever and really drives me to do whatever my heart desires, so it at least deserves a mention on here.

For me it is the feel of the song, and how it comes across. My favourite song is a 1971 live version of Stagnation by the band Genesis. This has much clearer lyrics than the original studio version on Trespass (1970), and is more atmospheric.



Also, In My Own Dream by The Butterfield Blues Band. Maybe that sums things up. But another favourite is I Used To Be A King by Graham Nash.



But another firm favourite is A Fantasia on Christmas Carols, by Ralph Vaughan Williams.

Hello!
My favorite song of all time is 'Mandy' by Barry Manilow.I remember in 1974,as a young girl of 9,I would sit on my front porch steps singing that special,melancholy song over and over again.
I saw Mr. Manilow in concert here in Cleveland,Ohio,USA last week...and he is still an amazing singer and showman at the age of 64.When he sang ' Mandy' it transported me right back to my childhood...and brought a tear of joy to my eye:-)
Thanks for the question,and best wishes.



Here is 'Mandy' performed live,Barry Manilow,in the year 2000:

The song is called "Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters" by Elton John. Here are the lyrics -



And now I know
Spanish harlem are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow in new york city



Until youve seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the lord theres people out there like you
I thank the lord theres people out there like you



While mona lisas and mad hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they cant and that is why
They know not if its dark outside or light



This broadways got
Its got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes I might join in
Ill go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in new york city



Subways no way for a good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo he can drown
And I thank the lord for the people I have found
I thank the lord for the people I have found

I never get that crap they call rap



Think 50 lacks common cents and not a fan of snoop



This man hates him cause they shot her and stole from him



Makes the listeners feelin outta the loop



Those rappers cant handle the fame they dont need that money



They got white boys here in Wisconsin rollin on dubs



But say something to there face and they say it wont be so funny



Theyll take u 2 the candy shop then ask 21 questions in the club



Now all this talk about rap makes me whip on that walkman



Throw in Nysnc and support that boy band pride



Then you and 36 mafia can be leanin from side to side



While me and Timerlake be singin  "bye bye bye"

It doesn't turn to rock until towards the end when the drums kick in and then it could be described as rock for the rest of the song after that. I dunno what genre you could put on that song. "Romantic-Rock" perhaps?? lol

The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments.



"In the Air Tonight" by Phil Collins is classifiable as Soft Rock and also a  Ballad because it has a slower tempo.

It could, if it falls on your from a great height. Or, if you plug it in and play it in a paddling pool (but then I suppose it's the electricty that'll get you, rather than the guitar.)

I guess it could if someone were to hit you with it. It would probably have to be hit by the body because the neck would probably break in half with the required impact to kill a person.

if one of the strings snap and it cuts off your finger, you can lose a lot of blood and die. but then you try to save it by putting it in salt. and then you die better

Sure you can - you just have to be very very good at it.



You can play for an orchestra, or do session music and earn money that way.  Consider having a back up plan, or something you can fall back on, as saxophonist work might not always be that steady.



Good luck!

yes you can however i dont know if it would make enough money to be regarded a full time profession.  you can become a member of an orchestra however you have to be extremely good at it.  you could become a band and perform at weddings and events.  this earns some money however an additional part time job may be needed.

Here are some I found.  See the source links for some of the lyrics, information, etc.

"Carrot Juice is Murder" by The Arrogant Worms

"In This World (Murder)" by Good Charlotte

"Meat is Murder" by The Smiths

"Be Healthy" by Dead Prez

The "Veggie Boards" link below has some other ideas as well, and would be an excellent source for further information.

All of these are about being vegetarian, but note that the Arrogant Worms one is a joking attack of vegetarianism.

EDIT: THERE IS one more I should mention.  It's not really about being vegetarian, but about the revenge of the animals.  It's called "Cows With Guns" and can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQMbXvn2R...

I didn't ask to be broken

but my skin is thick 
and my mind is strong 
I am built like my father was 
I've done nothing wrong



so free me 
I just wanna feel what life should be 
I just want enough space 
to turn around 
and face the truth 
so free me



when are you gonna realize 
you're just wrong 
you can't even think for yourself 
you can't even make up your minds 
so my mind's a jail 
I hate the whole goddamn human race 
what the hell do you want from me 
kill me if you just don't know



or free me 
I just wanna feel what life should be 
I just want enough space to turn around 
'cause you're all fucked

How about Meat is murder, that's at least the anti-meat song

Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is MURDER

And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is MURDER



And the calf that you carve with a smile
Is MURDER
And the turkey you festively slice
Is MURDER
Do you know how animals die ?



Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not "comforting", cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
Of MURDER



It's not "natural", "normal" or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour
Of MURDER



NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER
Oh ... and who hears when animals cry ?

My first song was Wild Thing, by the Troggs.
I then made a big jump and learned to play American Pie, by Don Mclean.



This is the video that helped me alot on that song:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uTvDp9Fa...

Then once you get all the chords down, to learn how to pick I suggest:
"House of the Rising Sun" by the Animals
and "Simple Man" by Lynyrd Skynyrd

Hope that helps!! =]

The future of live classical music performance...what are your thoughts?



The availability of DVDs and other "home entertainment" devices have effectively sent the old "drive-in" cinemas into oblivion...the internet is pushing secondhand bookshops/antique shops towards extinction...

What about live classical music performance? With the dizzying rate at which technology keeps evolving, what do you think the future holds here? Will people ultimately prefer to stay home with their DVDs, home-cinemas and YouTube for their "virtual" classical music experiences? What effect would decreasing concert attendances have on the world of live classical performance?

And of course, on top of this, there's the worsening oil crisis...this will surely affect the mobility of both performers and concert-goers...

Will live concerts eventually become a thing of the past? Or will there be some kind of technological meltdown, and we'll ultimately be forced to abandon our hi-tech existences and seek our musical pleasures elsewhere?

I'm curious to hear your thoughts here...

You know, the same issues were raised about 100 years ago with the advent of recording. Who would see a live performance when they could listen in the comfort of their own home?

Of course, no such thing happened. Similarly, attendance at sporting events remains strong, even though most games can be watched on television.

Ours is, after all, a "live" art form. To truly experience great music, one needs to experience it live. Recordings are great, obviously, but with "acoustic" (unamplified) music, you just can't beat the "live" experience. There is something visceral about hearing a trained singer, a brilliant pianist, or a fine symphony orchestra live and in person.

I think the future is bright!

I don't think being @ home on youtube can beat a true concert experience.
For me it is the excitement and suspense (and nerves if you are performing) that make live concerts awesome.
When I go to a concert I immerse myself in all the sounds, I don't think you can truly do that at home.
But some theater systems come pretty darn close. lol
I don't think live concerts will ever become a thing of the past, I think there will always be people who appreciate real music, who are eager to perform and eager to attend.

Wherever we go on vacation, my husband seeks two things - good concerts and museums, and live baseball.  I recently saw "live" a famous painting that I had known for years from many high-quality prints.  I was stunned at what I had been missing - at that is only 2 dimensions!  We attend MANY live concerts, and make a great deal of live music ourselves.  Now, I hate baseball.  I go with him - because I do.  We could sit home and see EVERYTHING up close, on our big TV, sitting in AC comfort on a leather couch, drinking a Scotch.  Instead, we sit in teeny seats in the broiling sun, with the players the size of Barbie dolls, and always somebody spills beer on us.  You just can't get that at home . . .  Nothing beats the live experience, even if you do not AGREE with, or enjoy the live experience.  People will seek live performance, not only because of the performance ITSELF, but because of our inherently gregarious nature.  Sometimes I listen to a Tanglewood performance, or a Met performance, and then drive there a day or so later to hear it live.  It's NEVER the same -that is why it is ART.

No, I don't think it will become a thing of the past.
Fads come and, but classic anything will always be a stable.
The thing is, it would be bigger in this country if it was more accessible and if music appreciation was a requirement in the school curriculum.

I think there will always be a place for live performances of music. Nothing else comes close. I was skeptical when Fantom Events broadcast (narrowcast) live performances from the Met to movie theaters nationwide last summer.



I was pleasantly surprised that those concerts, at least out here, were capacity crowds ... and that the one-time events actually went into repeat performances. Okay, it's not live music but it was 100% affirmation that there is a public that wants to see live music, opera, symphony concerts. (I don't think those would fly so well.)



If its a relief: when I shop for music CDs I want to handle them, I want to hold the package in my hand, read the jacket, listen to cuts on listening stations. I don't do that on the internet ... I go to the store.

My wife does the same with books ... and she reads a lot of them.



Instruments: same thing, I go to the store I handle them, decide if what is available is better than what I have and work a deal (always seems to be in their favor) to take my old gear in trade.



Sheet music, on the other hand, I get by one of three means.



1. Download from the Internet. Both purchased and free public domain just because stores just don't sell sheet music any more.



2. Transcribe by ear ... time consuming, but often the only means available to get out of print titles.



3. Get it from the morgue ... friends with filing cabinets of unused, ready to discard music. Latest acquisition was from Canada.

---
Getting on your movie kick ... that I see being a problem for two very sound reasons. Ticket and concession prices and the crack cleaning crews they have at the theater. I don't want to spend $50 for a family of three to see a film and sit in the lap of sticky popcorn encrusted luxury. (Oops, last weekend we saw two films)

... but I didn't like it. :-)

The days of Music, Art Music, as an evolving and contemporary Art form, where recent, genuinely 'new' compositions are performed before a vast audience comprising all strata of society, who are eager for these 'new' sounds; these halycon days are long gone.



Today, perforners tend to 'specialise' in Music that is becoming older and older with every passing day.



Don't blame them, though.



They need to eat as much as Insurance Salespersons do!

Two hundred years ago, music composed much over 20 years previously was heard, but was mostly heard as a curiosity.



Today's situation cannot auger well for the continuity of live performance.



Unlike other cultures, the West has a prescription for all of its Arts that demands continuous evolutionary [and even occasionally revolutionary] change!



Today, live performance is merely a 'museum' format.



There are, sadly, no signs that this is about to change.



It means that, as a relevant aspect of our society, Music that is being composed and performed today in a style notably different to that of the past, a style responding to today's situation; this Western style of creative music has 'virtually disappeared'.

If a significant group in our society says, e.g., "I prefer the 18th (or 17th, or 19th, or, damn it, 20th!) century to the 21st." when referring to Music, this is evidence that I am correct.



Many. many people, people who are passionate about music (!), will say this, if asked!



How I wish that I was wrong!

I realise that your question is slightly different.



You ask if the situation as we find it today will continue.



I claim that, because the sitruation today is as it is, the seeds of its demise are already present, and are growing!



Because concert goers only admit 'new' music that is reminiscent of  older styles of music, the future is, I'm afraid, exactly as I say.



(I speak only of the European strata of music, a strata that thrives on continuous change, continuous evolution!)



Your points (fuel prices, youtube, DVD's, CD's, new technologies, etc.) are all most valid, and, added to the very nature of what concert goers regard as 'Classical"  Music (the very word 'classical' is very significant, surely?), the situation seems to spell the effective death, in 'Western' terms, of all but Commercial Music.

If there is little or no demand for 'evolution' of style, the very nature of European creative music has been, perhaps accidentally, thwarted.



(The search for easy money [ - U.S.A., Japan, etc. -] will be blamed, but I am not sure that this is the complete story.)



In this altered form, I cannot envisage it surviving.



Already, many people regard those who passionately adore 'classical' music as "Old Fogeys".



(It says something peculiarly spectacular about the people saying this, of course!)



The truth is, however, that Music Lovers don't support 'new' music.



Even the progressive genius of last century is largely unappreciated!



It is only quirky, oddball types that have even heard of Stravinsky, or Webern, or Bartok, e.g., let alone are familiar with their (now quite old) music.

Apart from the Church (it rarely requires anything but 'extinct' styles of music), cinema (hardly a major supporter of genuinely contemporary music), and an occasional federal government subsidy for composers, there is no way for composers of today, with an interest in music of today(!), to earn a living.

Unless a composer of today is content to write symphonic music for (the 19th Century's)  orchestra,  revert to diatonic harmony, etc., etc., who is there willing to listen to the composers' music?



So-called  'music lovers' are not likely to change their reactionary attitude to music of today, surely?

We are left with 'museum' music.  Old music, or music written now, but in a style acceptable to the type of person that claims to love European creative music.



A sad situation, a situation for which it is hard to point a finger of blame.

Something like this, but less extreme, exists for the visual arts, I guess. .



Our 'classical' audiences now are aging, their tastes are notably reactionary, (i.e., more extreme than merely 'conservative'!), and their demands upon performers are increasingly onerous (due to the spread of technologies, as you have outlined!), and these performers are rapidly following composers toward extinction.

Who is to blame?



Nobody, probably.

What a gloomy creature I have become.



How I wish someone could point out that I am wrong!



(Vent your anger by supplying lots of thumbs down, perhaps?)

I'm not as pessimistic as some of your responders.  All performers need audiences; money provides nutrition for our bodies, but sustenance for the soul needs affirmation.



Julliard and Curtis are still with us; and harder than ever to gain admittance to.  One avid classical music buff, rather opera-lover in particular, tells me that the Met. performances are usually sold out.



If one watches or listens to "From the Top", which provides an opportunity for outstanding young musicians to be heard in front of a live audience, one is assured that there are many fine young performers, readily and willing to take up the mantle of the reigning big name instrumentalist and vocalist when they retire.



The hedonistic fungi of "pop" culture, has not infected everyone in our modern, western culture; there are still a sizable portion of the populace whose minds are not yet utterly controlled by the mass media.



As long as there are those amongst us who care about the truly beautiful, the uplifting experience of  witnessing great works of art, be they visual, sound or the written word, there is still hope for our species; and by extrapolation, live classical music performances.

Being a classical pianist, I hope to keep the performing tradition alive!  Nothing beats a live performance of great music, and every person I've ever dragged along to their first live performance has loved it.  It's not a question of its worth...there is no doubt that a live concert is better than youtube, recordings, etc.  It is a question of reaching an audience.  People are sometimes indimidated by classical music, but don't realize how easy it is to enjoy.  One one hand we need to educate the public...at least a little.  Just enough for your average Joe to understand how to listen to the piece.  On the other hand, we have to entertain them and keep them from being bored with the music.  There is a healthy balance.  I feel that every program I put together should be appealing to both the layman and the professor.  I'm currently giving a concert of all Rachmaninoff preludes (not all 24).  Highly demanding and musical, virtuosic, fun, singable, impressive, emotional, and lots of varitey.  (Really, I just love playing it, but I think it meets the criteria also.)  Anyway, it will be my job to ensure that live performance doesn't die!

This may be a silly way to put it, but compare going to a concert to going out for a meal.

Sure, cooking your own meal can nice (as is sticking in a CD by your favourite band/artist), but you can't beat going out and being treated to a meal cooked by a professional there and then, and not having to do then washing up.  We can cook like it,but it's not quite the same, is it.

Same principle applies to live music.  Sure it sounds good, all edited, mastered, re-mastered etc, but listening to raw live music gives you atmosphere, and it feels more personal, more alive!

I think until humans (or computers for that matter), become perfect, I don't think there's much to worry about.  Besides, robots can't replicate human emotion like humans, yet!

Hello Hafwen,  I hope you are wrong, but I find the quality has dropped unbelievably over the last 6 or 7 years. Once upon a time,one could go to an outdoor performance on a summer evening and hear pieces by Walton, Butterworth, etc., with other pieces by Smetana or Dvorak (not the Largo or something that has been used to advertise toilet paper on hte T.V!), and fireworks finish.  I was at a concert organised by the National Trust a few weeks ago - it was a farce.  Over popular pieces just to put bums on seats.  Even the guest tenor said to the audience that he had never before seen, " A conductor in red lame tails wearing a pink cowboy hat, bare his backside to the audience during a performance of,"The Hall of the Mountain King". I will be keeping indoors in future. Chester Cathedral has some very good concerts for the early summer.  Try there.

One cannot beat the exuberance of the outdoor concert.  Everyone out there with their picnic baskets, Champagne and strawberries etc. having a good time.  The Fireworks displays at the end of the evening - so fantastic!



On Saturday 5 July I saw Katherine Jenkins at Victoria Park, Haywards Heath.  The show was fantastic and the evening ended with the 1812 overture to fireworks.  Most recently I went to see Paul Potts at Stanstead Park (House) near Portsmouth - Sat 19th July.  On the 20th July I returned to see the 'Here and Now' Concert featuring an amazing line up of original artists performing their hits from the 80s: Kid Creole & The Coconuts, Curiosity Killed The Cat, Limahl, Nick Heyward, Toyah, T’Pau, Midge Ure.



The audience was of mixed ages: from tots to OAP's.  There is not anything that can come close to the exciting feeling of being there.  Course you can watch it on TV, listen to it on your iplayer, ipod, the radio etc, etc but it is not the same experience as been at a live concert!



I am going to an ultimate experience on the 19th September - Music on Fire at Sandhurst - I cannot wait.

Just recently back from holiday in Norfolk. My grandson who is a rock/blues/jazz guitarist came with us and as always so did his guitar. Technology allowed us to do a web search of music venues in the area and led us to a pub on the broads with a live band. they actively encourage audience participation. My grandson jammed with them and during the course of the evening we had rock, blues, country and a bit of jazz. Live music is still around and always will be, you just have to look around  for it. Oh don't worry too much about running out of oil, as I remember my history lessons the original travelling minstrels got around quite well on horseback. Now theres a thought, Glastonbury with no car parks , just stables.

With live performances being neccessary to record music in the first place, I don't see that technology will make them completely extinct.

For sure a heck of a lot of samples and electronically synthesized sound effects are used more now than ever, but that just makes live music performances such as Classical more desirable, also there seems to be a rise in real guitar music being played live, and the latest technology only wants to compliment that and encourage this generation of 'audience' let alone would be musicians to embrace the live performance experience with the likes of 'Guitar Hero' interactive computer games.

I can see that musicians that master Classical music will demand more money for live performances though, and so that will always set a trend for home entertainment to cater for those that are on a budget...

Ampitheatres to entertain the ancients are still as popular now and will be in the future I feel, and the exciting technology that is being used to project dead stars as holograms utilise live orchestras, such as Frank Sinatra, so that could be a competitive force for the future as more and more artists demand high prices for the privelege...

Live music is always going to be 'in' though, trust me.
As for the oil crisis, there are advances in engineering that don't rely on fossil fuels that are waiting on the patent shelves, when the world oil corporations finally collapse they'll just have to sponsor the greener technologies and stop being greedy.

Hard to define what pop is. You can put Kate Nash, Lily Allen, and  Scouting For Girls in pop though.

Duffy is pop/soul. You can't really just call her pop. Amy Winehouse is neither pop nor alternative. You could, however, put her in the playlist if it's called "mainstream".

Never heard of Reverend and the Makers, sorry.

Alternative is a very wooly genre which usually means guitar groups with suits / t shirts and sylised hair , a sort of pop punk

Yamaha's a more popular brand. Usually the popular brands are the good ones. I mean, if yamaha's weren't that great, then people would talk about how bad they were and nobody would buy them. 
Basically everyone uses them, and I think they have a great sound. If your really not sure though even after this, then ask your band director. Most band directors have a lot of knowledge about this kinda stuff. Like even if they play the flute, they still know how to fix a problem with a basoon or some other non-popular instrument. It's like they're magical, almost.



Oh, and a great place to get alto sheet music is 8notes.com
It's free too. so... well most of its free. Some pieces you have to buy, but anyway, most is free. You should check it out. They have sheet music for almost every instrument. Well, good luck making the right decision and all :)

Don't just settle on those two just because they are low in price. Try others as well. I have an Antigua SX392 Alto saxophone and have been successful with it ever since Beginning Band. I have 3 years of experience and already have the skill of a college student. Try both out and see which one suits you better. Don't settle on price, but settle on sound.

Hope I helped! =)

Ooh, this is a hard one. I couldn't ever pick an abosolute best, or favorite song by Evanescence. They are just so amazing it's impossible. Their lyrics are haunting, chilling and refreshing. Amy's voice is so beautiful and with metal it sounds awesome. Evanescence is very unique, I've never heard another band just like them. I know several that kind of resemble them, like Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil and Nightwish, but they are all in another genre. No band is as good as Evanescence in their own way. Yes, their are better musicians out there than the ones in Ev. (with an exception of Amy) but Evanescence is one of a kind and how the music works together is what sets them aside from all those other bands. Sorry this is so freaking long, I'm obsessed with Evanescence. =]

I am 17 and I want to learn an instrument, is the piano a hard thing to learn and if I was to learn it would I have to learn to read music or do plenty of people learn without knowing how to read music? Do you play the piano? If so how hard did you find it was to pick it up? And how long does it usually take to get pretty good at it? Any other info would be useful! Thanks for your answers.

basically anyone can learn to play the piano. just practice practice practice. normal people would learn to read music. Talented people would learn to play by ear. I play the piano - somewhat. I started when I was 8. unless you are a musical genius, it takes months or even years to be good at it. you can go to a local music store to pick up some starter stuff.

Anyone can learn the piano. Anyone could become very good at it. BUT those who aren't children find it much harder to learn than younger people. Past about 14 if you have no training in music it becomes a lot more difficult to learn an instrument - or to learn anything at all.



I've played the piano for 16 years, since I was 4 years old. Because I've been playing it about as long as I've been able to read I didn't find it hard at all, I found it was just one of those things that you learnt to do as a child. Learning at 17 will be challenging, and you will have to put in more work than a younger person would, but it is far from being impossible. Invest in a good teacher and you will definately be on the right track.

Piano isn't difficult but maybe a good idea would be to start with a keyboard with the one key chord function so you get used to the sound of the melody and chords being played together. Also it'll help you practice playing with two hands. I've always wanted to play the guitar and started 2 years ago. Now I'm starting to record my own stuff and I'm 35. All it takes in inspiration, dedication and practice. Good Luck!

The vaguest 'what's this song question ever'...?



Ok, it's a chill-out song, roughly 5-8 years old. Not really got a beat to it, sounds quite haunting. Has sounds effects like high-pitched raindrops intermittently through it and a woman's voice just saying 'oooooh' every now and then. I heard it today when a car passed me and it's driving me crackers...

Well I think Greta Salpeter (the lead singer from The Hush Sound) has an amazing voice. Also, Lacey Mosley too (lead singer from Flyleaf). Both of these woman have quite high voices but also Hayley Williams (Paramore) has a lower voice but I think her voice is awesome. Oooh and Amy Lee (Evanescene) and Laura Marling. These are my recommendations. ^^

<question>



Is that tune Mozartian, Mozartesque or Mozartic? The art of creating adjectives out of composers' names...?



As both musician and wordsmith, I'm intrigued by the peculiar practice of transforming composers' nouns into adjectives - and the apparent lack of rules surrounding this practice.



It seems that all one needs to do is stick a suffix like "-esque," "-ian" or "-ish" onto the end of a famous name - and abracadabra - you have a colourful new adjective!

I've come across an incredible kaleidoscope of examples...for example, I've seen Beethoven's music described in six different ways - "Beethovenian," "Beethovenesque," "Beethovenish," "Beethovenic," "Beethovenistic" - even "Beethovenese!"

Some trip off the tongue more easily than others - don't you think "Purcellian" and "Haydnesque" sound more graceful than the somewhat cumbersome "Rimsky-Korsakovesque" or "Khachaturianesque?" (and yes, I've seen these written!)

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this subject...please, share some of your theories, or some weird and wonderful examples you've read somewhere, or even some you've created yourself!



Hafwen



</question>



<additional details>



EDIT:

Maybe you can take a favourite composer (or two) and see how many adjectives you can create with his/her name...be as crazy and imaginative as you like!

Mozartian exists in dictionary.com and the other two don't, so I guess it is the only proper form. However none of them are in the Yahoo spell checker!



The great thing about language is that people are inventing new words all the time.

This question made me laugh. I was just talking to a friend about this. For years I have noticed that we have started using proper names with a slapped on suffix to describe something (think Kafkaesque) as the norm. It appears that in our ever evolving vocabulary we have become overly generalistic and lazy. Imagine a writer once said "the piece was remniscent of Beethoven" now shortens it to "the piece is Beethovenesque" 
I personally blame Joss Whedon's writing and the pervasive desire of the American psyche to glob onto perversions of the English language. Besides it's more fun to say these descriptors. It has the unusual ability to make you sound both pretensious (hell, just knowing who Rimsky-Korsakov is seems impressive) while at the same time making yourself seem modern by bastardizing an artist's name for the purpose of description.

Maybe I am putting to much thought into this. ; ) But funny question.

Hafwen, your questions are always so creative and an absolute pleasure to read the answers!  So fun!

When I'm writing a more serious work, I usually use the "ian" ending, unless I'm talking about a French piece, and then any composer mentioned gets the française ending "esque."  If a piece of music is a hybrid, I usually describe its qualities as "ish." For a lighter tone, I'd use "istic."  Funny, but I've never thought about it before now.

Now you have my head whirling!  :)

I've never heard those words before.
However, when I took English lit class, I noticed that James Joyce was so popular with literary critics that brought his name up, no matter what topic they were writing about.
I never could figure out what the word "Joycean" meant, even though I saw that word frequently.

Fasctinating question Hafwen! When I read it I pulled my Chambers off the shelf to see what it has to say. There is no entry for the -ian suffix, althought there is for the -esque 'in the style of manner of, similiar to, as in Kiplinesque'.  )Comment. You wouldn't say Kiplingian because it sounds too ugly.)

So I then looked up 'Victorian'  'adjective of, contemporary with, typical of, the reign of Queen Victoria....'.



I then looked up a architectural description - 'Romanesque' 'adjective of the transition from Roman to Gothic architecture...'



So I have the following thought. Both '-ian' and '-esque' can be correctly used as suffixes when converting a noun to an adjective - for that is what is being done. My personal view is that -ian is used when speaking of persons - as another example historians refer to the reforms of the Anglican Church liturgy under Charles I as 'Laudian', making an adjective out of the name of Archbishop Laud who promulgated them. Similarly, an inhabitant of Latvia is a Latvian. However, if you are talking of abstract concepts you use the -esque suffix - for example ladies of a certain type used to be called 'statuesque' But here my theory falls down as such ladies are also described as 'Rubenesque'. And see my comments above concerning Kipling. So I draw the conclusion that it depends on how the adjectivised noun sounds. 'Elgarian' is perfectly acceptable, but 'Vaughan Williamian'? No! In fact in that case, and that of the Russians you refer to my personal view is that the adjective becomes so clumsy that it should be avoided and if one wanted  to compare you would say something like 'music that sounds like V-W, R-K, etc' A little more circumlocutory, but sounding so much better!

As for 'ese' I (again personally) think that is wrong applied to an individual. It does appear in Chambers as 'denoting a relationship with a country or region as in Japanese, Maltese, or the literary style, jargon etc. of a particular group, as in journalese, officialese'



'-ish' can be used (although, again it can sounds clumsy when attached to the wrong noun) and, again from Chambers 'adjective suffix signifying somewhat, as brownish, like or similar to, sometimes implying deprecation, as outlandish, childish, or roughly, approximately, as in sixish'. So Beethovenish could be used, although it is very ugly.

'ist' is defined  as 'suffix denoting the person who holds a doctrine or practises an art, as Calvanist, chemist, novelist. artist, royalist'  So I would argue 'Mr X, the pianist is an excellent Beethovenist' (meaning he is a great interpreter of Beethoven)  is wrong, whereas 'Mr Y is an brilliant violinist' is right. And 'Smetana was a Czech Nationalist composer' is right but 'his music is Smetanaist' is totally wrong.. But you could say 'Smetana wrote music that is nationalistic in feeling',



To sum up '-ian' and -esque' are interchangeable, and their use depends entirely on how the the adjective sounds. Thus 'Chopinesque' is fine, but 'Chopinian' sounds wrong. 'Lisztian' sounds fine, but not 'Lisztesque'. Once a name gets beyond a couple of syllables, then don't use a suffix at all, but 'in the style of'.....Rachmaninov, Shostakovich' etc.

Here are what I, and many others, consider the top shelf in jazz singing...

Sheila Jordan
The Try her album called Portrait of Sheila. Its an absolute classic vocal jazz recording of the 1960's. Great band on that album too.

Sarah Vaughan
Try her self titled album (aka: Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown). Another huge classic vocal album.

Carmen McRae
Try her album called Sings the American Song Book. Features the great Joe Pass on guitar.

Billie Holiday
Anything by her is great. I suggest the early stuff (1930's), with Lester Young, Roy Eldridge, Teddy Wilson. These people created singing jazz, for the most part. Get anything and everything you can by Billie.

The instrumental players that you listed are of such a wide variety that its really hard for me to narrow my answer down to just a few that you might enjoy. 
If it is funk you are looking for, I can't help you much. The answer that I gave regarding JAZZ singers is from lots of experience, and I can confidently suggest what I have suggested.

My Happy song would be Guns N Roses too, but for me it is "Sweet Child of Mine" that always makes me smile

As for what makes me sad, Johnny Cash - "Hurt". Its such a moving song and the video... everytime I hear the song now, I see him sitting on that porch and just so soon before he died

The blog below has a link to the song. It's not quite the same version as what's on the trailer but it's still great :)

Sorry about your dad! I'm pretty sure it is 'You're Beautiful' by James Blunt. It may not b the right artist, but it is called You're Beautiful. I think its like 'I saw her on the subway, she was with another man... something like that if we are thinking of the same song! Hope this helps!

Ciao! Io ho sentito la canzona, e ho capito quasi tutti i parole in inglese....
I want You
I need you
I give my freedom just to be with you
Together(poi no lo so- c'e una ragazza parlando sopra)
Song I want to hear again
Know that I belong here by your side
Love is something you cannot hide
Come to me, set me free
Love can last an eternity
Play your part, reveal your heart
Let your love show (yeah)
Love can change everything
Turn you into(poi non lo so)
Spero che questo e sufficiente (e mi dispiace per il mio Italiano..sono Inglese, e traslocavo in Ingleterra an'altra volta in 2004 dopo tre anni a Roma..Ho dimenticato un sacco...)
Edit- Prego! Sono stato un Insegnante di Inglese, allora se vuoi aiuto, mi scrivi. Buona serata

I saw them at Ozzfest. They have a lot of stage energy and chemistry, and they bust their asses to put on a show, which is why I respect them although I don't consider them a real metal band. However, as far as their music goes, they can't put on as good of a show musically as true metal bands.

What a wonderful way to bring both sides of the Middle-East divide into unison!

What has happened to music these days?



We had the innovative, genius bands of the 60's and 70's then the slide off in the 80's and 90's and now we get piss poor.

Where are the new talent that live on for decades in the future? We have one hit wonders and prancy boy bands that the Beatles tear apart even today.

Why are we allowing the music industry to let us go down this road of talentless crap? Youngsters of today only buy it because they don't know any different.

We don't buy it because we don't know any different, some of us like old as well as modern music. And who are you to judge todays bands as 'talentless crap'? Admittedly some people in the charts today don't have much talent but some do, you just need to give it a chance, rather than limiting yourself to old stuff.

I completely disagree with you here. There are many talented singers out there these days. Yeah I think some songs aren't very good, but the majority of them are brilliant. For example, Mariah Carey, have you not heard her voice or something, and also Leona Lewis. If all these artists and bands were 'talentless crap' as you call it, they wouldn't be signed in the first place.

First of all everyone loves to trump the Beatles. They're not good because they're old. Sorry it doesn't work that way. I like quite of bit of 60's music but the Beatles are the boy band of their day up until they started dropping acid. They started even with the boy band stereotypes in their videos calling one the intelligent one, one the cute one, etc,... The songs we're just written in a happier non-dance style with "rock" style instruments. Much of it written or co-written by a producer until the LSD days, just like the major bands of today.

1 and 1 and 1 is 3. He has feet down below his knees? These are the great intelligent wonderful lyrics you are speaking of maybe? You only bought it because it was thrown at you the same way it happens today. The 70's weren't all that great. A few good bands, but most are forgettable. Same with the 60's a few big names the rest are forgetable. People don't want to realize that the music of their era isn't that good. The reason it gets so much credit is because people of that era are now old enough to be the bosses.

J.S. Bach was hated in his time for his out of the norm writting style and was only heralded as the genious he was in the later years. This is also proof that just because someone "got signed" or sold a lot of records doesn't make them goood artists, it just makes them marketable. People like you are the reason for things like that happening. You want to hear the same crap you remember from your teens and 20's.

The middle agers and later yeared people said the same bull as this to their kids back in the 60's too. People not much older than myself (I am 22) are already starting to tear apart the music of today and still only listen to Nirvana's Nevermind. There is good music from every decade, and if you want the REAL good music you have to turn off your radio.

Its the same crap, different era. If you want good music, you have to look for it. the 60's was the start of the fall of good music because of the spread of Payola. Payola is illegal, its the act of paying the radio stations to play what they want that is not a commercial for their product.

Popular music will never be were it was during Led Zeppelin or the like.  There are still tons of great bands - you just aren't going to find them on popular radio.  You obviously have an internet connection.  If you look in the right places, you'll find a lot of great music.



Depending on the type of music you like, I recommend finding a forum or community site where other music listeners recommend good music.  You are not the only one online who likes the Beatles and thinks all current music sucks.

It's a good question, but I don't think the answer is that simple.  I grew up in the 50's/60's and many of my friends will only listen to music from that era.  Over the decades there have always been good new performers, but other factors have come into play.  Once live music gave way to disco's, the era of "dance music" arrived.  Basically music split between stuff that was good to dance to, and stuff that was worth listening to.  Add to that the need by some "insiders" to create artificial labels to different types of music and you just get more confusion.  In the end there is just good and bad music, so why the need for all these labels?  It's partly the fault of US radio, who seem to play only one type of music rather than a broad spread as in the UK.
In the end a good musician will stand the test of time no matter what, but I do wonder how many of current "stars" will achieve long-term success - it's all about "now".  And the sad thing is no-one seems to care whether these "stars" are the real thing or not.  If one of them passed away tomorrow, would they be remembered?  The Buddy Holly/Jimi Hendrix type is a rare thing.

I agree with the first two answerers - it depends on what your musical ambitions are. If you're aiming to play professionally, you'll definitely need to put more hours in each day.

It's important to consider the WAY you practice, too. If you're spending 1.5 - 2.5 hours a day working in a focused, structured way, then that's far more valuable than just "noodling" about.



A good, solid practice session (whether it's 1.5 hours or 5 hours long) should also incorporate some technical work - scales, arpeggios and other exercises. I'd do these at the beginning, then follow with studies - they help limber up mind and body, and prepare you for the work you'll then do on your pieces.

Just remember - 1.5 hours of focused, analytical practice achieves far more than 5 hours of "mucking around."



Good luck, and happy playing!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



There has to be a combination of a great choice of song (NOT necessarily a great song), a great artist and the song should be covered in a way that makes the new version a good recording in its own right.  It's pointless covering a song if you're bringing nothing new to the table.

A great cover version is very rarely better than the original, and neither should they often be considered to be, but it may compare and enjoyment of the original should not be hindered by the existance of a cover.

Deciding how to cover a song and making a good job of it should follow similar principles to writing and recording an original song.  The effort levels often compare and often need to for the cover to be a success.

To sum up, for a cover to be great the artist must be great, the choice of song must be great and the cover should be created and not carried out.



A carbon copy will never a great cover make.

Greatest cover ever?  Well it's a pointless argument because everyone knows that if Nirvana had actually CREATED a fully-mixed and mastered studio-recorded version of My Sharona nothing else would've come close.

Hiya Keane -



1.



I think the original song has to be great, but its no good if the song was played to death the first time round, like Kylie - Can't Get You Out Of My Head.

2.



It should be a song that spans the years, im waiting for a good cover version of "say hello, wave goodbye! by soft cell, (sad I know), sorry David Gray fans but I wasn't keen on it with the guitars.

3.



When you do a cover version you take on a little bit of the original singers identity, i.e, you really wouldn't want to cover a Gary Glitter song. Hehe. So if you pick a song, try to pick a song by a really cool band, or a neutral band.

Here is a list of my favourite cover versions, afterwards I will try to analyse whether there is a determining factor;

a) Mariah Carey - Without You 
b) Cher - Walkin' In Memphis 
c) Skin/Skunk Anansie - Teenage Kicks
d) Will Young - Light My Fire
e) Wet Wet Wet - Love Is All Around
f) Comfortably Numb - The Scissor Sistors
g) Housemartins - Caravan of Love 
h) Soft Cell - Tainted Love
I) Pet Shop Boys - Always On My Mind



These songs are all not my favourite songs but I give them credit because they are all artistic and have individual stamps - if someone says the title of the song - if I think of the cover version first - I know it's successful.

Also this list shows that a song with a huge reputation - like Always On My Mind - can be taken and turned into a new classic. It also shows how songs which aren't that well know can be made well known by a good covers.

You have to cover something that no one would expect - something that will sound totally different - but still good - in your style.

Here is a list of my least favourite cover versions;



a) Ronan Keating - Iris
b) Westlife - The Rose
c) Westlife - Mandy
d) Atomic Kitten - Ladies Night
e) Atomic Kitten - The Tide Is High
f) Sheryl Crow - Sweet Child Of Mine
g) M People - Itchycoo Park
h) David Gray - Say Hello Wave Goodbye
i) Sam And Mark - With A Little Help From My Friends



These covers depress me because they are thoughtless. Ronans version of the Goo Goo Dolls is awful, anyone who loved the original could not possibly like this version. None of these covers have been changed much when they have been recorded - it's simply like hearing them sing kareoke versions of their favourite songs.



Never pick a song that is treasured, like The Rose, unless you are going to completely rearrange it, people just get angry.

.........................................



But y'know something, Keane, darlings, I think, the most important thing if you do a cover version you have to put your own stamp on it and I dont think you would have any problem doing that with your unique and wonderful voice,just please please please dont do Mandy or Unchained Melody!!!!!!!

Look forward to your next gig,



love ya's loads

PS.... I been trying to think of some fab and funky songs you could do.... Del Shannon - Run Around Sue (always gets me dancing and I think you would sound F&gt;A&gt;B singing it) , Erasure - Love To Hate You, (it has such a catchy tune that would lend itself to any genre and I'd love to hear you sing it) or Phil Collins - Invisible Touch, (a song I love but I don't think Sir Phil nailed it properly).

Well the thing that would be top of my list would be that you have respect for the artist that your covering, i hate when i hear a cover of a great song by some dancey group and they just totally miss the point of the band and the song in favour for crappy beats. also you need to put your own mark on it but i dont think it should be unrecognisable from the original. but this is just my opinion, good luck, its hard to pull off a truly great cover version!!

To me the joy of a great cover version is when bands or producers take a track and just take it somewhere else. Just completely change the mood, the feeling, the sounds and the vibe in a way that totally works.



When that happens it's like meeting a long lost old friend again and finding they've grown into an even better person.

Its only a good cover version if the artist does something different with the song or adds something special or defies convention. e.g. Otis Redding's version of the Rolling Stone's Satisfaction, or even Bill Shatner's fairly recent Common People by Pulp (sheer genius)

It must be very different and the singers must be passionate about the song.  I think everlasting love by U2 is a good example.  Bono screams the words but it works, the instruments are fantastic, the tempo has changed.  At the end of the song U2 own it and you forget the original.  I'm not that fond of U2 but I love their cover

Yes I agree with what has already been written.  You have to make the song your own while still respecting the original artist.  I think it's great a band can do a cover version and fool some people into thinking that it's their song.  One of my favourite cover versions is Vanessa Carlton's cover of The Rolling Stone's Paint It Black.  Fantastic!  It's the biggest compliment an artist can give to one of their peers.

Got to agree with the others. It's about taking a song and adding to it. It's not enough just to re-do it as was.



This is where, in my opinion, Robbie Williams went wrong with his swing album. Exactly the same music which might have been okay, but he can't "swing" which just led to a flat performance. Fine if your a Robbie fanatic, but musically very poor.

Production can sometimes make a big difference. Leaving aside Whitney Houstons showboating, listening to her version of "I will always love you" against the original fills the song out more.

One of the best cover versions I've ever heard, although it's only part way a cover as the original artist is on there, is the duet Ray Charles did with Elton John of "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word". He blows Elton away. He's sounds like he's actually living the song and Elton manages to sound like a pub singer.

The aim to is to capture the essence, of the song, get the riff or underlying beat then out your own stamp on the song. Take for example Gun's and Roses doing "Knocking on heavens door" lots of axel's "a-a-ahhhs"  and inflections, also Live and let die I think a faithfull reworking and more edge than Paul McCartney.



Rappers do well in sampling for example, kanye west using "diamonds are forever", or p-diddy (I personally dont like the guy at all - he goes to business school and could be a role model for disenfranchised africans but ends up hnaging roung gangsta rappers pretending he from the street) 
with "missing you" using the police/stings "watching you".



Its about finding a song thats believeable, take Prince - Tom Jones does "kiss" which was great but say he had done "Thieves in the temple" would be carnage, Sinead o'connor does "nothing compares to you", but again if she did say "raspberry beret" it would be a crime.

Recent example: Goo Goo Dolls "Iris" - Ronan Keating did such a good cover, you'd swear it was the original. You've got to keep it as near to the original as possible, yet still stamp your own style on it. P.S. if you are the real Keane, your recent music is great ("Is it any wonder" & "Crystal ball").

I am not usually a fan of cover versions, especially of well loved songs, and those are the ones that artists cover . From time to time I am pleasantly surpirsed.

If a song was done with a powerful voice ,it seems wrong to have some naff voice trying to recreate it. I am all for making it your own , but the aim should be to make the song better , otherwise what is the point.

Adding a bit of dance music, may fool some people for a short while, but in the end the song is short lived.

To make a great cover version , you need excellent vocals and to have won the public's admiration already, before trying to honour someone else's music. When newbies come on the scene and do lifeless covers , I lose interest in them quickly, thinking they lack originality.

I agree with the person above who said that Fine Young Cannibals have done great covers. I also love Simply Red's covers. He has enough talent to make his own music , but now and again improves an old song, some of them less well known.

Bringing your own unique voice and style to a song while respecting how and why it was created - perhaps in a way that make people see it in a new light, or even gives a whole new meaning to the lyrics without changing a word.

Simply singing it the same is at best a tribute, at worst karaoke.

Examples:
Gary Jules "Mad World" - took a fairly obscure piece of electronica and let the lyrics ring out, both literally and metaphorically... beautiful and melancholy.

Fugees "Killing Me Softly" - stripped back and laid back, again this brings a piece of classic Motown back to life, making it slinkier and emphasising the sexiness...

Art Of Noise / Tom Jones - "Kiss" - introduced the Great Voice Of The Valleys to a whole new generation of fans - and making him a thoroughly modern artist  to boot with all new songs - but also gave the song itself a brasher, brassier twist that's instantly memorable and embarrassingly danceable. There's lovely for you!

Sometimes cover versions are done for all the wrong reasons, it seems some artists just cant be bothered to come up with an original song, so in order to keep in the public eye they just do a cover version.
In my opinion the best cover versions are those songs that the artists really admire and truly want to improve on.
Also some songs are just too well done to be covered and any attempt to do so is almost an insult to some of the great artists.

You need the band doing the cover to put their own spin on it, so it's like a mix of the two. i do recall the Pet Shop Boys doing a cover medley single years ago of Where The Streets Have No Name/Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You which was terrible. I think mainly because those two songs did not lend themselves to the electro-pop nature of the Pettoes. So also the song needs to be in a style that is the same as the band.
I think if Keane are looking at doing a cover, stay clear of electro!! No 2 Unlimited covers please!!

Definitely a great cover is one that includes some dramatic variation from the original version of the music, and brings out a mix of unique style from the band that's covering the song.  In the end, a great cover is one that takes the original tune, but generates a new & unique piece of music from it.



I think that mash-ups of different instrumentation & vocalalisation can really bring out great things in an old tune (and I don't mean just putting distortion on a guitar track).  When a band puts their own style into an older song it brings out something that you would not have heard from the original musical source.

Best two examples I can think of are Hendrix definitive 'cover' of Dyan 's original, All Along the Watchtower.  Also, a cover sticks in my mind of The Walrus by the Beatles, which I saw covered by Frank Zappa and his band on Frank's last tour in 1988.  Splendid renditions of already great music.  In those cases, even though the 'cover' barely resembles the original, it bring out things in the music that are so innovative as to create a new piece of music that's original in and of itself.

The best cover versions are ones which are not direct copies of the originals.  It also helps if the cover is of a little known but genius song which may have been overlooked or underrated in the past.  It's about seeing past who may have sung it before.  I find the best ones are taking songs from other genres such as folk, country or rock and changing them to pop songs.  Parent's LP's are a great source of such music from forgotten artists of the 60s or 70's.

Cover versions eh?  There's gotta be a certain amount of respect shown to the original, but there's gotta be something extra added (or possibly taken away) to it to make the song your own.  Personally, I think your own version of The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore is good, but not a truly great (no disrespect intended).

I think that lesser known tracks often make better cover versions than mainstream tracks for the reason that people aren't constantly comparing it to the original.  Sometimes that's a good thing, it's gets the song noticed and people talk about it, but it doesn't make the song any better.  You've also gotta choose tracks that suit the voice of the person singing.

My own personal favourite cover versions:

Hallelujah - Jeff Buckley
Frontin' - Jamie Cullum
Comfortably Numb - Scissor Sisters
(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - Devo
Mad World - Gary Jules
All Along The Watchtower - Jimi Hendrix

Make it your own, dont make it sound like the original version, jazz it up a bit, make it colourful and something to remember for years to come. 
Take time to come up with different ways of singing it, maybe add a little to it, make it the best song ever to be re-released.

I would pick a song that was a top ten hit years ago, and bring it up to date.

Please ID this song - possibly 90s r'n'b; female vocalist; ~100bpm; "you got me" repeated?



I briefly caught a tune that I hadn't heard in many years but can't identify it!

I'm guessing it is early 90s r'n'b and it was sung by a female vocalist (possibly African-Amercian or UK Afro-Caribbean). It was relatively upbeat and about 100bpm.

The key phrase was something like "oh, you got me, you got me, you got me".

I can just about remember a verse had the phrases "too much to comprehend" and "magic spell".

What's the song and who's the artist? [It's *NOT* Roots, Kaci, Eddie Grant].

Thanks!

if you're still in school ask the band director.  If not, just go to a music store that sells instruments like West Music, and ask them.  They will know.

There is no proof that Bobby Shaftoe actually went to sea, it was probably a rumour put round, so that he could marry Anne Duncombe, instead of Bridgette Belasyse.

The song is said to relate the story of how he broke the heart of Bridget Belasyse of Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, where his brother Thomas was rector, when he married Anne Duncombe of Duncombe Park in Yorkshire instead. Bridget Belasyse is said to have died two weeks after hearing the news, although other sources claim that she died a fortnight before the wedding of pulmonary tuberculosis.

He married Anne Duncombe on 18 April 1774, and is said to have spent her personal fortune. In Baron Feversham's opinion the countless young ladies whom he jilted on his return from his travels enjoyed "a lucky escape".

Well - he was probably a Geordie, so he would have gone to sea in a collier ship.  The silver buckles on his knee tell us he wasn't an ordinary seaman.  So maybe he was an apprentice, or a shipowner's son (he could have been both, of course).

And I hope he did come back and marry his girl.

If you live in a city, have you tried your central library? Usually they have sheet music for loan. Otherwise, you can try this site and Nimrod is around £2.

For those who've seen the play Monkey: Journey to the West - do you agree with the statement below?



The song  'Heavenly Peach banquet' (No idea of its Mandarin name) sounds a lot like the song "Loving you is easy cause you're beautiful".

Hopefully, you know what I mean by the latter one!!

What are some good oldie love songs?



I'm trying to find some oldie love songs that I don't know that I would probably like. For example, some songs similar to  Hello It's Me, Have You Seen Her, Groovin', These Eyes, My Girl, Unchained Melody etc.



60's or 70's (Maybe even some late 50's) Try not to give me some well known groups like The Beatles, or any Zeppelin love song, Four Tops, Spinners, etc.



The songs I'm asking you to list for me are usually slower and more relaxing. I'd actually like to find some love songs about a break up or someone losing their lover.

Sounds funny but I also listen to old songs ( I even sing it with my older sister). Sometimes we need to take a break from those ear-crapping noisy new songs. haha^^

there doesn't have to be a title of "lead" or rhythm player in a band.  You could play lead parts in one song and the other guy play lead parts in the next song.  In my band we usually go by who can make the part sound the best or who wants to play the lead part on any particular song, as long as it's not the drummer.

Our Song - Georgie Brennan

http://cdbaby.com/cd/georgiebrennan

Track # 12

** I choose "Our Song" because it is uplifting with a great feel good beat and it was so original compared to anything else that came out this past summer. The lyrics are great, the music is great, and it had "hit" written all over it. It is the kind of song that made you drive a little faster and play over and over again so you can sing along with it!

What is the name of a beautiful piece of background music - often used for poignant sporting moments?



The music is orchestral, and most recently it was played in the background, after the 2 British guys who won Gold for rowing had collected their medals (bbc olympic coverage about 15 minutes ago).  Mostly violins/strings, it is the type of music that grabs your heart!

Any 1920's music enthusiasts, looking for something more in the "Mooche" style?



I've been studying the 1920's for a book I'm working on, and like to listen to period tunes to capture the mood.  I recently ran across Duke Ellington's "The Mooche" from 1928 and really fell in love with it.  It is quite different from other songs of the period that I've found.  Kind of dark, melancholy, and sophisticated.

I'd like to listen to more tunes of that type, but obviously I can't sample every song put out between 1920 and 1935.  So I'm hoping for some pointers from those of you (if there are any of you) who know about music of this era.  I'm  regular I-Tunes buyer, so if the song is available there, so much the better.

Thanks!

You need a little Bubber Miley in your life - he was the trumpet player on the best-known cut of The Mooche.  www.redhotjazz.com/bubber.html should get you some good clips.

Also - Cab Calloway - most anything, but the obvious is Minnie the 
Moocher.  Even the soundtracks of the OLD Betty Boop cartoons would be evocative.  There's more - but this should be enough fun for you tonite.

Perfect.  I just purchased Black and Tan Fantasy, Doin' the Voom Voom and East Saint Louis Toodle-oo.  These are exactly what I was looking for.  A shame Bubber Miley died so young!  Thanks for your help!!

Rate my song please, I wrote it and want honest opinions on it



How does this song I wrote sound?..I want honest opinions on it and ways to improve it...Rate it on a scale of 1-10 1 being lame 10 being completley awsome. Here is:

Song: Wait and break



Cold, Im awake but asleep
the thought of you scare’s me but calm’s me
I tell myself that I will be ok and the thoughts will fade
But they keep coming back to me

I see you everyday hoping for a sign that will never come
I continue to Wait and break until I fade away
You showed me once, but I never realilzed

In my dream I see you and me, when I wake up I see you and him
And I don’t know what I can do 
I tried to show you that I cared but you never saw until it was too late
The thought of failure continues to haunt me



I see you everyday hoping for a sign that will never come
I continue to Wait and break until I fade away
You showed me once, but I never realilzed

It’s far too late for me now, you have moved on
The thought of me has faded from you
I try to lie to myself and think there is something there
But I realilize there is nothing no more

I see you everyday hoping for a sign that will never come
I continue to Wait and break until I fade away
You showed me once, but I never realilzed

Entymological Expositions...Music about Insects?



Recently, I chanced across a wonderful Renaissance chanson by Josquin des Prez, entitled "El Grillo" - "The Grasshopper!" What a fantastic, colourful little song - a perfect musical painting of a grasshopper. All those leaps and jumps - and even the insect's relentless chirping was depicted in this 16th century gem.

What other pieces of music have you encountered, inspired by the insect world?

Oh - and other invertebrates are welcome - maybe even the Arachnids have inspired a few, er, brave composers...

</question>



<additional details>



"The Italian" - thanks for that.

But there are two accepted ways of spelling this word - "entymological" and "entomological" (BTW the second version contains 3 o's, not 2.)



To "The italian" - if you care to Google both spellings of "entymological" you'll find that you really have to accept that your argument is not waterproof. Language is a mutable thing.



And take note, there is no word that's spelt "entomilogical." The correct spelling (of that version) is actually "entomological." THREE o's, not 2.

Cheers :o)



And I thought that Yahoo Answers was actually about ANSWERING, not being argumentative for the sake of it.

The most obvious would be "Flight of the Bumblebee" by Rimsky-Korsakov. Also "The Spider's Feast" by Roussel and "The Wasps" suite by Ralph Vaughn Williams.

Tchaikovsky composed a piece titled "Chorus of Insects" for a projected opera which was never completed.

Would the opera "Moses in Egypt" by G. Rossini, qualify?  I've never heard/seen it, but it would surely have some of the plagues(one of Locust) mentioned in this story, referred to some place in it.



In the Levine, Met. DVD(s) of Wagner's "Ring", in Act II when the "dragon(?)", that comes out of its cave to see who's(Siegfried's)horn call has awakened him, he looks like a gargantuan "spider" to me, rather than what a dragon is usually depicted as looking like.



Would this qualify?  Thought not.  Boy, this is a hard question to answer.



Sorry, but I'm stumped.

The first answer comes into my mind is...Bartok
From his piano suite, Out of Doors..
"The Night's Music" from this suite is a beautiful music of mimicking different creatures' sound at night...birds, frogs, insects.....



as for contemporary composers, I bet there must be many examples..

Scriabin's Tenth Sonata, also known as the "Insect" sonata due to its trills. I believe there is a "Cockroach" sonata which is composed by Franz Liszt. And of course, there's the "Flight of the Bumblebee" by Rimsky-Korsakov. There may be others though.

The saxophone is rather sexy. Gold and black lacquer finish on a sax is nice, and silver plate is elegant. You go girl!

Song with "maybe, maybe, maybe" in chorus and girl taking pictures?



Ok, well I'm looking for that song. The girl has red hair or something like that in the video and she's sitting on her bed and playing the guitar for some of the video. Then, at the end she drops off a box of pictures of her and her ex at his doorstep and takes one last picture of him and then the video is over. I remember something in the chorus like "maybe maybe maybe" or something along those lines. I tried to look it up...but  so many songs are like that.

Which album is "Badge" track no. 5?



Okay, this might be stupid...  I don't have any Cream albums; all I have is Clapton CDs.  Is there a Clapton CD or compilation where "Badge" is Track no. 5?

How much does a bass guitar cost



How much does a decent 4 string electric bass cost?

Does the cost go up with the amount of strings?

My friend's band need a bass player and I usually pick up instruments well so if I learn how to play he will let me join.



Please if possible have the price in dollars and not euros.

Sorry to say this, but prices of any instrument vary according to which country you are in. Expect to pay between  £60 to £500 depending on how much you are prepared to spend on quality. Look for makes like Squire or Fender, Ibanez or Steinberger. Hohner, Aria. The names are many multitudinous and varied. The choice is yours ENJOY!!!!

A very comfortable and versatile bass is the Ibanez Soundgear. They range from 250-1200 dollars, but they all sound pretty good. I would suggest the SR500 series, which are about 500 dollars. They have Bartolini Pickups and active preamps as well as comfortable necks and good fret work. If you want to be in a very traditional jazz band, you might want to consider an upright bass, which is at least 750 dollars for a beginner/student one.

Inexpensive decent basses are squiers, you can get them for about 180-300. Ibanez also has some good cheap basses too but most cheap basses have a really boring tone and frankly alot of string buzz. I can't say im a big fan of the standard mexican made fenders either try getting something from fender a little more expensive like 600+ those are good.

How can I perform for my school's jazz band with bass guitar?



I'm just entering my junior year and I've been playing bass guitar for about 2 years. I'm not that good since I can't read music and I'm not good at improvising. Jazz Band is a second semester class, so I might be able to change to it but it would require alot of work....

If I ask my bass teacher about this and start learning music theory and other stuff, will I be able to make the audition for jazz band? I don't even know what to expect...

Go for it. Jazz is a great genre of music (for bass and just in general) that will really help you get a better grasp of music and build on your improv skills.

You can do this. When I started highschool I couldn't read music at all. The bass player had been a senior the year before and when the try-outs came I was the only one so I entered as a freshmen in a band full of seniors who had just won a nation Jazz band competition the year before. By the Christmas concert I was ready to go.

Work with you private instructor and talk to the Band director about getting some of the charts to practice now, if anything he/she will be impressed by your effort.

Don't stress out over improvising because most highschool jazz charts don't require a lot of it. You'll learn to make up jazz bass line by learning ones other people have written.

Good luck!

Depending on the type of jazz your school band plays it can be easy or difficult. If it is more of big band jazz the bass player usually reads a written out bass line from the chart and can improvise from there when you feel comfortable. So for that all you have to do is learn how to read music which your bass teacher can teach you in a short amount of time. 
If it more of a dixieland band you will be doing more improvising than anything because usually all you get is a lead sheet with chords and you have to make up a bassline to fit the chords. For this you need to know your therory like the back of your hand...ive been playing bass for 4 years and still have a hard time with theory but it just comes to certain people better.
The last thing i suggest is listening to the style of jazz that ur school plays and get to know the different sound the bass has in jazz and maybe find a professional player that you like and try to mimic their style at frst.
Jazz is so much fun to play, but you also need great dedication to make the audition by next semester! Good Luck!

Its exactly as Ryell stated, we are friends and we both played in jazz bands at our school. For me, I learned theory in sixth grade and it just came easy and for others its really hard to understand.  A personal tip from me would be to take the circle of fifths and learn all the keys, learn their chords(major,minor, diminished,etc..) and just learn it and become very familiar with it. This plays a great deal in all styles of jazz u play. Also, it would be a good thing to go out into your community and find a local jazz society and get involved. This is how i have learned everything and its great practice for your playing. Good luck with your jazz band! Its a great thing to get into, and it will lead you to a lot of things! Im gonna be a jazz major cuz it was soo much fun! Just remember, stay calm and just be your self and show it in your playing.

As a classical pianist many years ago I identify with this. Think of yourself as an ice skater doing figures and imagine how focused you'  have to be as you do these fundamental exercises. Remember, no matter how boring they are for you, someone else is hearing it for the first time. I used to mentally put lyrics to pieces that didn't hold my interest. Or imagine someone dancing to it.  Something else you might do is reward yourself with a fun piece you really enjoy after practicing a boring piece. Try to remember that the "boring" pieces have a skill that might turn up in other pieces down the road.
 I remember when I was given Shostakovich's piano concerto to learn as a high school student. It was so hard to get into at first, very modern and dissonant. Today it's my favorite concerto, by far.
 Hope this was helpful. Best of luck in your musical pursuits.

yea grade pieces are rather boring and i won't say stick with it cause u want the grades...i think that although the piece is boring but consider ur audience or examiner...they may not have heard the piece and would be eager to see wat kind of magic can u produce from it...Just let the music flow into u and get into the music...Try not to think of them as a simple everyday boring piece but something that u can share with other ppl...

On concert band instruments, it means there are two parts of the music that cant be played. Like a first and second part.



On piano, you are supposed to play both notes.

So what IS Michael Phelps listening to before his big races?



Let's imagine it's something classical...

So what piece of adrenalin-pumping music do you imagine it is? Is Phelps inspired by one of Beethoven's works? Something by Mahler, perchance? Monterverdi? Or something calming, maybe by Vaughan Williams or Palestrina?

What musical work(s) would psyche YOU into winning seven gold medals?

Unfortunately, I did read that he listens to hip hop before the races... BUT I'd like to imagine that he's listening to the final movement of Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, or Prokofiev's Scythian Suite; yes, I can picture it...

Anything Beethoven would psyche me into winning. I know it's a little cliché, but the 3rd symphony or the 5th (that ending is pretty inspiring!), or maybe the 8th - it always makes me happy. I would definitely NOT listen to anything calming: high adrenaline all the way! Maybe some high-charged Verdi, or selections from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake...  :)



</answer>



<asker's comment>



An excellent mix of "high adrenalin" music! Beethoven's symphonies would certainly get me pumped, too...a good selection, Antelope!

I think im hearing some E lydian or lydian dominant in the beginning...and a lot of augmented tonalities throughout but can you pinpoint perhaps the exact mode(s) in particular sections? the actual song begins at about 2:17. im really curious and it's really difficult to hear. at any rate i think it's a really neat tune! please let me know when you think of it too! thanks. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrVzN5-Sq...

What's this song, anyone know?



It was on Premiere Christian Radio last night. The words were something like: "I didn't know how you could save me", "victory", "he saved me" with a choir and a man singing with a woman doing guest vocals. It was very upbeat and kind of had a jazz feel to it. Does anyone know what it is called?

Cheers. ^^

AndoKid, no its not Royal Bliss but thanks for that. Just checked it out, cool song but not the one I was originally looking for. ^^



Ok, let me try and give you more info. The first verse was definitely something like: "I never knew him before" and finding God/Jesus. There was a middle bit with guest vocals of a female but the main vocals were by a man and a choir. The choir kept singing: "victory" and "saved me" in the final chorus at the end of the song. It was very uptempo and had lots of complex instrumental bits that sounded very jazz.

How we discover, buy, listen to and enjoy new music has been changing rapidly over the last decade. The rise of MP3s, music blogs and forums, virtual bands, music-focused social networking sites – all of these advances have made a massive difference. But nothing stands still, so what the next seismic shift in music culture will be is a hot topic. Where do you think we’re headed?

i think it would be somthing like abelton, somthing with a very easy interface which can perform live editing on the fly, or mabe the innovation could be somthing that is used with abelton like a touch screen system which could make live editing much quicker. personaly i love using vinyl and i think you cant beat the feel of mixing in that way and with all this new technology it might get forgotten. i hope not though!



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Firsty, thanks to everyone for their responses as they made for a very interesting read.  I have chosen this answer as my favourite as Ableton is one of the best technological innnovations in the DJ world at the moment and I like the idea of a hi-tech touch screen system.

wow i cant belive you chose mine lol ive been using abelton for about a year now and i belive the freedom a producer can have is amazing but i think its still important to incorperate the whole idea with live turntable mixing for the best live shows!

You seriously think that the most important addition to music in the future could be a new type of computer screen? This is really beyond parody.



markp



Yeah... computer sequencing has been around about 25 years, in modern form about 20... touch screens are nothing new.

The best bands I know at the moment still mainly make music in the standard fashion, if they use electronics other than synths it's only as tools rather than for MAKING music.



markp



(fairlights and other such items, then atari st (birth of affordable midi sequencing) and amiga (affordable sampling/sample sequencing)... and anything that's used a touch screen - since about 1990 - has just emulated mice)
Also, get out are you Pete Tong. Could be anyone. Prove it.



Quester



Let's face facts. Mr Tong chose this answer because it mentioned vinyl. If anyone had mentioned the the phonograph cylinder, they would have won.



arter.m



Over the next decade no one will buy music,  it will all be free to promote the artists, like ads now.  The artists will go on tour and it will be these live performances that fans will pay to see.

The direct publishing, marketing and selling of recorded and written down music by the composer/performer via the Internet, cutting out the big music businesses.  This may be a more democratic way of producing music. It will mean that a great deal more poorly produced or performed music will be available as well as giving a chance to performers and composers who deserve a hearing but never get past the A+R man.



I wonder if this will be an entirely good thing.  Consumers of music may find that sorting their way through the greatly enlarged choice is bewildering, time-consuming and tiring.  In the past, much of the choosing has been done for us by record companies and radio and TV producers.



In the not so distant future we will have to have our own media filters in order to sort out the dross from the danceable, the trite from the tuneful and harpies from the harmonies (or something).

Maybe we need the established media more than we think.  Or maybe we will need to accept a world where the very best is no longer picked out for us (according to a record company's view of public taste) and instead we will have to listen to hours of the mediocre in order to come across the truly sublime.

hehehe, goodness me dont some people get heated about a certain style of music?!?!

I think DJ's could change the face of music, they are the ones that have the intelligence to use the technology of the 'naughties'.....you only have to watch xfactor to see the bunch of hopeless, talentless morons that will be selling way over priced tickets to their concerts in a few months time where they will sing out of tune & have thousands of those people that really  have a good ear for music right there jumping up & down screaming for them, oh thats after they have waited in a que for a whole week !

Give me a good DJ anytime ! :-)

......its not about drugs, its about listening !

I had to add that to all the people that think sampling already made music into something different & then playing it on decks is talentless then go & try it ? Its just as bloody hard if not harder than learning to play an instrument.



Jeeeez when will some people hear the cleverness behind a good tune. You dont have to like something to appreciate the amount of work & talent that goes into it !!

A secure method of making people pay for downloads, and a way to encrypt Cd's so they themselves can't be copied otherwise record companies will not pay artists advances for future records.I know everybody hates the idea of fat cat record bosses but most bands/artist's  want to make money themselves they need to pay rent too

Most of it is already happening.

The move away from the need for a publisher and hard format media. The rise of user content creation sites on the internet.

All that is needed now is for affordable composer software or hardware devices that hand-hold the musical novice through the process of creating original music (rather than expensive studio grade sequencing/mixing/sampling kit or mickey mouse amateur, stitch-it-together dance loop software).

With musically 'intelligent' software that we can all afford and use, anybody with a tune in their head or a lyric on their lips can compose, publish and distribute new music.

There will be those who will see this as being the death of real music but that's what everybody said back in the 90's with the rise of electronica & dance music. The fact is that there will always be a discernable difference between the mediocre and genius, ergo; the cream will always rise to the top.

Let us firstly examine what constitutes as music. Without entering into the realms of a Thesis, I feel it can be taken as reasonably accurate that music, of whatever genre, is constructed from melody, harmony and rhythm.

Innovations in music are nothing new. Mozart intoduced the clarinet in to the Classical orchestra, Beethoven introduced the Trombone in to the Symphony, Wagner extended the ideas of Liszt that chords should not resolve with immediacy, and thus created a musical debate that continues to this day. Schoenberg dispensed with tonality completely, whilst his pupils, primariliy Berg and Webern, sought ways of getting tonality back into music without it being too obvious. Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Luigi Dallapiccola developed the idea of Schoenberg to the extent of creating excellent music out of nuances of indeterminate chordal and linear equations, that can, however, be deciphered by the aware cognoscenti.
 Currently, Harrison Birtwistle is completing this process, to great effect. The use of electronic media was pioneered by these avant-garde artists - the fades, electronic repetitions, and the programmed juxtaposition of the three elements of melody, harmony and counterpoint by electronic means, well predates the atrocities of drum and bass.

The innovation that could most radically change the face of music in the next ten years would be the uttermost rejection by the consumer of the so-called 'pop' (vide popular) sub-culture. This sub-culture, aimed and targeted in particular, to those who do not have the maturity to judge anything,including their own immaturity, by marketeers who purposively pander to adolescent angst by producing material that appeals only to the most primitive instincts, is currently causing serious rifts in society between those who value tranquility and those who, in pursuance of their own immaturity, seek to destroy peace. Posit it as you will, excuse it as you want, the marketing of music destroys both musicianship and musical appreciation, and its exploitation as a marketable commodity derides the Art in totum. The destruction of industry-led 'pop' musical 'culture' could be the best innovation since Milton Babbitt used the computer to generate sound, long before either of us were born.

"A Night at the Opera". 
Not only was it my very first Queen album, but it also contains what I consider some of their most unique music. It's so different yet classic. 
A lot of personality and evidence of life's struggles show through in most of the songs.
I also like the fact that I am the only person I know who can literally sing that entire album through verbatim without tiring. I am a dork!

Becuase its one of their most Underrated records IMO, it had some of the “Deepest” lyrics on it such as the title track which is my favorite song from by the way, there were musically some the darkest elements than any Queen record, I mean it also had its positive elements like all Queen but IDK with regard to Freddie’s decline in health I just feel something bizarre about it just something more dark I just cant explain it, and last it was Queens LAST record of Composed original material before Freddie’s death, oh and also I was in my FIRST band at the time and we were really doing good and I had the privilege of opening a show at the Mason Jar (my band that is) for my favorite band Fates Warning in that same time frame, so OVERALL it just has a personal sentimental value

Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.  I like the song "Paper Planes" by M.I.A, but ever since she's been getting more publicity I feel like I lost the "soul" of the song or at least lost the feeling that it was exclusive to a small group of people that included me.  Maybe it's silly but I like to have songs that no one else listens to; it makes me feel like I have a secret or something hehe.
Maybe that's how you feel too!

I don't think it's ever completely lost its appeal, but sometimes I start to not like it as much. I get what you mean, it's not like you don't want to share other people's interests, it's just that sometimes it's nice to feel like you have a song/band all to yourself. Radio/television play can turn my favorite song into something that I only listen to a couple times now and then. It's unfortunate.

What do you think of the made in mexico fender basses?



I'm using a squier affinity p bass right now and it sounds ok but i wanted to get something better. I can't decide if i want to put better pickups in them or go for something like a standard mexican p bass and put better pickups in them. Overall do you think the quality of the standard basses are good? Like no fret buzz, smoother playing, and stuff. I was also considering buying an american vintage reissue J or P bass what do you think of their quality?

What I do is in a way complicated, but this is what my friends and i do....We get on Windows Movie Maker. Then get on Youtube (or any music playing website.) and search for the song. Don't play the song yet, but pause it about a second before the song starts (that is if it has a long begining before the song) Then pull WMM (windows movie maker) back up and add any picture as if you were making a movie...only add one and make it 5 seconds longer then the song (timeline) Then click on the narrate button...on mine it is a little mic. right above the timeline. Then make sure that the audio input source is set on either wave out mix or stereo mix. then click record...then press play on the youtube song. You'll have to listen to the whole song. But once the song finishes...click...stop narration. Then save it to your music! There ya go!

All the rest of the songs on the album are by 80s metal/rock bands so i figured it would follow trend with this song.

Okay, this may seem like an ad, but its not.  I'm seriously recommending that you check out the website Pandora Radio.  You put in music you like and it will suggest songs.  Then you go through the songs it suggests and say whether you like them or not.  As you refine your search, it gets closer and closer to what you like.

You can check my history, I don't normally do stuff like this, but I strongly recommend Pandora to everyone.

Oh ya, and its free =)

Say Anything & The Spill Canvas : bands that are similar?



I love the poetic metaphor's and lyrics of groups such as Say Anything and The Spill Canvas.. but unfortunately i haven't found many other good creative indie/rock groups with such powerful written songs as in these 2 groups. If anyone can name any other bands/songs possibly with the same vibe, access able on myspace to hear preferably that would be sweet. Doesn't matter if its just one song from a band. Also anything good with some punk like The Ataris, their pretty good. Thanks

There are several CDs available by Elgar, Walton, Holst, Vaughan Williams.
Walton composed the Battle of Britain film music, as well as music for the Henry V film.

EMI Classics is a good label to look at, and they have a British Composers series dedicated to British music.

She was the lead singer of Scottish band Stone the Crows.
The band was founded by Les Harvey {brother of Alex Harvey}.



She has been described as 'the Scottish / British Janis Joplin', because of her vocal style.



She is probably best known here in Britain for singing 'No Mean City', the theme song to our longest-running TV detective series "Taggart" {she also appeared in an episode "Evil Eye", playing a gypsy}.

Actually, Maggie Bell has never worked with Mike Oldfield.

You're thinking of the other Scots singer Maggie Reilly, who sang a majority of his songs from 1980+, most notably  'Moonlight Shadow' and 'Family Man'.

The music and lyrics combined, can sometimes reach right in to your heart and really pull you, and make you feel that the song was written specifically for you, even though the song was written about something the writer was feeling at the time. Thats the mark of a good songwriter, they will have some kind of empathy with the audience. It doesn't have to be a well known well loved song. It's easy to answer this question by stating a well known song, as some have, but that doesn't really explain the why.

One that does it for me is 'Is it any wonder' by the Chamelons, who you probably won't have heard of, yet the song might have been written about a situation I faced some yeard ago. Beautiful song.

There's something so incredible about music. Even though we all enjoy it, explaining exactly why we love our favourite song is hard to do. Music seems to bypass cognitive thoughts and go straight to our emotions.



Each of our favourite songs does this to the max, reminding us of moments of love, heartbreak, anger or joy. That's what makes it so special.

Hard to say when there are so many to choose from.

In a bad mood with my wife, it would be Gn'R's I used to Love her!

I guess altogether, it would be Big Area by Then Jerico.  The lyrics do describe my wife, who I think is amazing.

You have to be able to relate the lyrics of the song to something that has happened in your life.

My wife and I have 'our' song which is 'A Groovy Kind of Love' by Phil Collins, which is a great song to chill to in the arms of that special someone.

"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle" ("Love is a rebellious bird" in English) i.e., Habenera, from the opera Carmen by Bizet.  Most English speakers don't know the name of the song, but anyone would recognize the melody.  It's been said to be the first song with a tango beat.  I usually don't like opera, but Carmen combines the rhythms of traditional Spanish music with classical music brilliantly, to produce something utterly memorable.  This piece may be parodied all the time, but that's only a reflection of its genius; it's sophisticated, yet anyone can enjoy it.  In addition, the song has not become one bit less seductive over more than a century - it gives many modern pop songs more than a run for their money.

Excerpt from the great movie version of the opera:

Hi Emma

My favourite song? Do I only get 1 song. I love ELO and Mr Blue Sky (although all of ELO i can quite happily sing along too)

I also love Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty, modern music, song I am liking at the moment - hmmmm any Amy Winehouse track or Timberland/One Republic, loving that song.

What makes them special to me? As a 70's child all the guitar intros electric synthesiser's - just takes me back to my childhood.

The modern music is not really that special to me as it is all just noise, prefer good strong vocals though.

I love 3dg and bb so here are some others that i like:
Atreyu (their old stuff is better, new stuff is still good though)
Avenged Sevenfold
Bullet for my Valentine
Disturbed 
Linkin Park (new stuff is really mellow except for a few songs, older is better)
Papa Roach
Seether
Trivium (new stuff is softer, older is harder)
10 years (mellow, but not bad)
Theres a ton of lesser known bands that are really good too like Alexisonfire, The Black Maria, Black Tide, The Butterfly Effect, Dark New Day, Earshot, The Human Abstract, Oh Sleeper, Red, Trust Company, Under The Flood.
And for even less known bands check out www.garageband.com
Sometimes the best ones are the least known.
But anyway, even if you don't like all of these, hopefully you'll like atleast one. Hope I helped!

I can't believe it I would be way too shy, even if I could do what she does.

Wow! cool kid!
I used to know someone who could sing, they were really quiet, and unassuming, but when she opened her mouth to sing it was incredible, and her whole personality changed too. needless to say she went onto have a career in the theatre and I used to be blown away by how she could do it, I guess that was a gift.

May I say congratulations to you, on having a child with "Such Natural Talent". Have you ever stopped to think where "All This Cool" came from?.
You might believe It?, there again You had Better believe It.  After all, you brought her Into the world. So, go figure you and her dad gave her this wonderful gift. I agree, not everybody can do what she and many kids like her with talent can do.
You are very lucky.
Best wishes to you.

Crazy For You lyrics



Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

[Chorus:]

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

[chorus]

It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you

Go to download.com, search for Ares, make sure that your computer can support it and download it. When that is done, install it on your computer. Than search for it there. When you find it, download it. (you can also download movies)

What's the title and artist of a rock song which starts with the words/sung sounds "doo wa, ba ba doo wa..."?



The "doo wa, ba ba doo wa..." part repeats about 4 times. The lead singer is mail. The title could be "oblivion" or another 4 syllable word but I'm not sure.



</question>

lol.....the lead singer is "male" not mail......



I can assure you all that it's not a Hanson song. The song was done by a rock band, not some pop band.

I used to be into them when I was going through my numetal phase,but I think I grew out of them eventually.

I don't listen to them anymore,but I think it's a little bit unfair to throw them in the nu-metal bin with other horribe bands like Hoobastank.Their drummer can pull off some amazing stuff IMO.

edit:He certainly is overrated,but it's all relative really,if you compare him to his peers in other contemporary alternative metal bands,he's pretty high in the list I think.

Their a good band.  Its not easy having 9 guys in one band and to be sucessful at it.

I used to love them and I used to think they were the heaviest thing ever, but I have progressed since then, and now I listen to proper metal, much heavier metal, so I'm not so keen on them any more. There's nothing wrong with them, I just prefer heavier stuff now.

The Jam - Paul Weller = Not worth it really. I men Foxton and Buckler are all fine and dandy, but it's not really ideal with a meager replacement instead of THE frontman.

If you want to see The Jam nowdays, it's probably your best bet to look for a Paul Weller concert.

Yr right it's not the same, apart from the odd Bruce Foxton song News of The World, David Watts it just lacks Paul Weller. How can you go on tour without the guitarist and vocalist it's just wrong, sorry but from the Jam can only ever be a tribute band, harsh but true ;)

i must disagree
i saw from the jam and they're very good.after all,how much of your fave jam stuff does weller play these days ?
bruce and rick are merely keeping the music alive on the road and i'd not deny them the chance to earn a living.

i'm afraid mr weller does nothing for me these days,his silly bitchy comments about ftj are really depressing.

Of course you should go! It'll be all your favourite tunes and it's not like it's a tribute band. It goes without saying that it'd be better if Paul Weller was there but I'm sure you'll kick yourself if you don't go : )

Originally it meant music on independent record labels or bands that weren't on major record labels.. these days it has come to mean something else... there are major "indie" radio stations with major sponsors...  and "indie" bands on major labels..

its more a type of generic music then being independent... the most popular "indie" bands are probablly the killers, the kooks, the white stripes, the vines, the strokes..the hives... the "the" bands

I've always liked Hillsong... There's a lot of great christian music out there that gets ignored simply 'cause it's christian... pisses me off.

*edit*
saul, I did not say that I recognize Hillsong as great songwriters or musicians, I simply said I enjoy their music. There are, however, some good songwriters and musicians who get ignored because they're labeled "christian musicians." Same way that some people ignore black metal because it's "satan's music" or whatever. I think you're the one being shallow and narrow minded here.

You mean the "Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour", etc part in the second verse didn't give it away?

It's crap. No dynamics, no story, simple musical parts + melodies, etc.

Like a lot of christian praise music, it has a simple, slow beat that encourages its listeners to shut down and veg out to the music. They called it "blissing out" when it was done in the counterculture, but really its the same concept - it really is a form of brainwashing. You could be more diplomatic and call it a way to help you affirm your faith, but it's the same thing.

Look at all those people in the audience praying like pagans, I said to myself.... for after all, that's how pagans prayed in those days. The christians just copied the pagans. Good times.

I doubt that you aren't a christian. I don't think a non-christian would use the phrase "trying to save souls". But, hey, whatever... you got me to watch 30 seconds of christian drivel about how much God loves me, at least how he would if I was a christian and said that Jesus was my lord and savior and all that daddy-complex bullsh.

EDIT: "There's a lot of great music out there that get's ignored simply because its christian"

Seriously? You think Hillsong writes great music? Your taste in music is shallow, biased, and woefully ignorant. If christians would bother to write fewer songs that *have* to revolve around God, and praise God, and talk about God (and/or Jesus), and how they feel like poo and don't deserve God, blah blah blah, and actually wrote some songs that other people could relate to, then MAYBE they'd have a shot.

Every christian artist that has become popular with the mainstream has done so by not being so g.d. jesus-centric, loosening up, and either writing about God in a very vague way, or writing about stuff that the rest of the population might actually give a crap about.

Some people hate to be preached at, and I get bored really fast by songs about something that I have no reason to conclude (ie, a complete lack of factual, literal, objective truth) that could possibly exist. Maybe it's good for them to day-dream, maybe they need to put down the bibles and come back to reality.

After his appearance in court for setting fire to a bailiffs car and being sentenced to 11 months jail Wayne Fontana (Glyn Geoffrey Ellis) was allowed to walk free from court immediately after already serving the equivalent of his term while held under the Mental Heath Act.
Speaking earlier in 2007, before his "Lady of Justice" appearance, he said: "I'm selling up and pushing off as soon as I've dealt with this issue.
"I've had enough of the ruling classes, even though I love England. It's making us ill. My family and I can't take any more of this government."

He now lives in Spain.

1. Winger
2.Vinnie Vincent Invasion
3. Ynvgie Malmsteen in Alcatraz , Vivian Cambell in Whitesnake. David Lee Roth went Solo and hired Vai but I really wouldnt consider that being a replacement.
4..5 Counting their live release
5.John Norum and Billy White



</answer>

Very good, except there were only 2 Van Halen albums in the 80s with Sammy Hagar.  I was actually thinking about Jason Becker also for #3, but you provided a makeup answer with Yngwie.

Disco. The beat is at 120 beats per minutes which is the same as your heart when it's excited. Get some funky tunes on and your frown will turn to a smile!

Easily the best, most consistent album of theirs - the other albums get a bit samey after a while

This is really hard.

Oh Inverted World feels like a little universe within itself and it's easy to get lost in. Chutes Too Narrow is also a solid album, and I think it edges ahead just because it has my favourite Shins song, Mine's Not A High Horse. Wincing The Night Away has more standout tracks (Red Rabbits, Phantom Limb, Sea Legs) and weird moments (Pam Berry) but is probably less coherent as an album. So I guess Chutes Too Narrow is my favourite. But if you're asking this because you don't know much about them, I'd get Wincing The Night away - it's easier to get into - and then work backwards.

no way

i think they pioneered a lot of the pop-rock that we still hear today... and the straight up weirdness they combined with gratifying sounds was groundbreaking.  they wrote some truly classic songs that can be enjoyed on a purely pleasurable musical leve, especially through the seventies.  and they have loads of influential history behind them including the pap surrounding beatlemania,  you should be happy with the beatles tho.  they're great

i think that you should actually listen to some of their music, some of it is amazing.
the latest panic at the disco album has been inspired by some of the beatles work.
just because the beatles arent the jonas brothers doesnt mean theyre awful

Nope! They wrote one of the first 'metal' songs 'Helter Skelter' (unfortunately influencing Charles Manson at the same time :s) And influenced probably a lot more bands you listen to than you think.
So no, they are not at all!

I think many people consider albums by Metallica, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, U2 and Queen to be among the best.

Though for me, they're by:

The Cure
Blink- 182 - Enema Of The State (I think that album moved so many mountains in so many lives)
The Ramones - just about every album they released
Sex Pistols - Never Mind The Bollocks

Bought a very old guitar from a friend in America......?



Hi, today i bought a mid 70s fender strat, i bought it from a friend and its cost me about 3 years of savings.



I have played it before and its a wonderful guitar but im extremely worried about it getting delivered.



i dont know what to do 2 get it delivered safely with no damage or it getting lost/stolen.



do i get a expensive private courier or do i try fly out to get it myself? would i be able to just to fly out to America for a few days without any restrictions?



please help, its really tearing me up thinking about it

To fly over there and bring it back yourself, you'd still have to leave it in someone else's hands (eg. luggage handlers at the airport, with the big "Fragile" stickers on it).

Though I understand how you feel - if you think the guitar will be safer if you fly over there, then go for it (if it doesn't cost too much more than having it sent to you). Sometimes people prefer to see their items along most of the journey.

All the best.

You can take a chance and take it on the aeroplane as hand luggage. Security being as it is you may not be allowed or your guitar would get slung in the hold (Brrr - a very cold place for a guitar to live) - not a good idea unless the guitar in its case is properly packaged within a well packed and strong box. I would suggest that you have your guitar packed and sent via a courier. Make sure you get it insured in transit and be prepared to pay import taxes when it turns up at your home. Leave your guitar in its box and allow it to acclimatize to room temperature before opening it as it'll surely still be cold from the journey. The finish can crack if subject to a sudden temperature change... xx

Well if you are really worried, go and fly in to get it. Plus you will get it sooner, although getting it through customs might be an issue, so take all recipts with you in hand. And not to mention, the guitar will arrive quicker.

But most major courier firms should make sure it gets their safely, unless you live in a warzone or somewhere like that. And if you do go that route, make sure it is all packaged very securely in a good quality HARDSHELL case. I use capitals to emphasis that point as they have saved my guitar on a few occassions.

Fed-ex will get it to you safely - they have always been excellent for me. You can have it fully insured too of course through them. 
or
You can carry it through hand luggage on a plane  - I have done that myself with a 12 string without any trouble.

Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you....."RADIO FRIENDLY UNIT SHIFTER" off In Utero.... most people have heard that Album and if you have just started listening to them that's my best guess....and by the way i am not quoting any part of the song at the beginning of my answer.....it's from Territorial pissings !

Hmmmm NOT a guitar......could be "Tourettes" off In Utero

Sorry i must apologise for mistakeningly writing not only the worng name of the song but also the album :(  just been drinking with me mates sorry again :(

But at least it jogged your memory lol unit friendly unit shifter....sounded like a fecking tribute tune!

How can I acquire a voice like Nickleback--Female stye?



I'm a singer with a taste for extraordinary voices. How can I perfect a voice like Nickleback's? Can anyone give a detailed lesson?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



As a singer who loves to attempt to replicate (while maintaining my own style) I advise to avoid this.  Once you attempt to sound like someone else, you will automatically be assigning yourself a position below them.  I hate to say it, but it is true.  Something new and fresh is necessary.  If I were a famous singer, I would be completely unimpressed by people who could sing just like me.  I would be impressed by fan originality and bringing their own voice/ideas to music.



As for replicating for any other reason, you won't.  You can develop your voice to have similar characteristics within your range, ability, vocal durability and such.  Check out www.singingsuccess.com for information.  It is absolutely legitimate and works miracles.



This helps you have a more powerful, yet much more healthy voice with no strain.  Better range and resonance with much more release.



As for the grungy, rock distorted style, you will have to develop it on your own.  Just don't let your vocal chords do the distortion.  You WILL destroy your voice if you do.  Learn to use the auxiliary, or "false" chords. www.melissacross.com should help with that.  She is a world renowned teacher of lounge singers, rock belters, and death metal screechers.

What language is the girl from the new Audi A4 commercial singing in?



FYI, the song isn't called Templeboy. It's called Seperation and was made by EliasArts soley for the Audi company.



I can't tell what language it's in, but it reminds me of made up languages, like those JRR Tolkien and Yoko Kanno created.



If it's Arabic (someone claimed so), what is she saying?

Question for Speech Level Singing affiliated singers, teachers, etc.?



First of all, thank you for reading my question.  As a huge fan of Brett Manning and former student of Jesse Nemitz (of Singing Success), I am very familiar with the SLS methodology/ideology.



My question - I have been working on this method for over 3 years now.  Due to minor physical dilemmas (90% blocked nasal airway and sinus cavities nowhere to be found from facial trauma at youth)  I am unable to reap the great rewards.  It seems as if my voice is always held back.  I have an alright range and mix.  My problem is hard to describe, it seems as if the subtle sounds of my mouth are louder than the "meat" of my voice, if you will.  Any takers?

What are your top five rock/metal songs of the moment?



Mine are:



#1 Gojira - "Toxic Garbage Island" (this song shifts continents!!!)



#2 Straight Line Stitch - "Taste of Ashes" (love the chorus!)



#3 Metallica - "The Judas Kiss" (great choice for a single)



#4 Walls of Jericho - "The American Dream" (they redeemed themselves with this one)



#5 Five Finger Death Punch - "Never Enough" (many people can relate to the lyrics)



What about y'all?

Nice list, Art Vandelay! I like all of the bands in your top five and High on Fire destroyed on Gigantour!



good lists so far (except the first one, haha)! keep 'em coming!



Thank you for sticking to recent songs, Chris. "The Evil Has Landed" just missed the cut for me... still a great song by a legendary band!

there is no hardest style to play on any musical instrument. If you like jazz, learning jazz guitar is easy but funk can be hard for you or the other way around. but technically, funk is not the hardest, it's actually the easiest, you just strum along keeping with the beat....technically, classical guitar is hardest but personally, I find classical guitar easy to play because I dig classical music and Heavy Metal shred guitar which might be difficult for other people....



About funk and reggae, no, they're not that similar just close enough...if you want to play guitar, the good songs that are good to play are the songs that you love...

I did it when I was 12or 13. But, I did some of those things mentioned & talked about in the songs. That's why I didn't want my children to listen to it,for if it effected me that way back then & it's more violent now than before, I was afraid for her safety. Sorry, but we care about you & do it for your own protection. If we didn't care,we'd let you do anything,even watch drastic things on the videos. Be careful. God Bless xxxx

My parents, put together at least, have a pretty diverse soundtrack for life, as I'd put it. I remember having songs stuck in my head that I didn't know the names of because my parents played them on Sundays, and I'd only find out what the songs were many years later (Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a good example). So, essentially, I've always liked rock, funk, Latin, etc. music.
My own musical taste, however, is even more spread-out nowadays than my parents'. Haha!

I guess generally speaking parents don't expect their kids to change from the mainstream pop music in a hurry for pure rock. Most kids might get into pop-rock but as soon as they stray to having a larger taste for purely rock [or subgenres like metal/punk/hardcore] parents usually get anxious. Especially if their kids are really into it. I think it's just a fear of not understanding the music enough and not knowing what effect it might have on their kid. The general perception of 'rockers' [or 'punks' any other typecast] is that they are 'dark' and wear black. Of course that's just the stereotype but a lot of the time parents want to protect their kids from getting involved with that kind of thing. Then again some encourage it, or are more leniant. I guess it depends on the actual parent and their experience with rock music.

I started listening to rock music when I was 12 when I heard Stariway To Heaven, Hotel California and Always Somewhere (Scorpions) and ever since, I'm a metalhead. I'm now 40 years old. i don't have problems with my parents when i listen to this kind of music. My dad even bought some of my tapes when I was in high school. he was the one who bought me a Ted Nugent cassette tape, a Savoy Brown tape, an Alice Cooper tape and a Deep Purple 8-track and all The Beatles...Now, I gave my 10 year old son a KISS CD "Psycho Circus" and Black Sabbath's "I Sold My Soul To Rock n Roll" and he likes it! Nice, eh?

Does anybody know of a good bass serenade?



I'm trying to find a good stand alone song for an electric bass.  I would like to be able to play this song for a particular person; something of a serenade.



I can't read a music scale.  I can read chords (i.e. "G C D") and tabs.



If you could include a link to the chords/tabs with your responses, that would be great.

Yes, of course you can teach yourself how to sing. But to be a pop singer you will need a good vocal range so you can really hit the high notes-well. So it would be a good idea if you did but you can buy these CDs that give you vocal exercises that help you improve your pop singing.

He is about a medium tenor. He has a flexible range. I can hit some pretty low notes and some pretty high ones and I'm a tenor. If he was baritone, we wouldn't be able to hit some of the notes he hits. Hope this answers your question.

Buy and use an upright acoustic bass..it's good to practice your fingers with it. If your playing has not improved, slam it right between the eyes of your little sister, it should make a huge "wow" sound---CRACK!!!!

I believe Robert Plant rejected the offer of a world tour with Led Zeppelin.  However, I'm not so sure about Robert Plant going on a world tour as a single artist.  But yes, If there were a Zeppelin concert, it would be freaking amazing as always.  Hope it was helpful.

Sorry to disappoint, but he backed out earlier this week.



EDIT:  Loverboy--Plant is touring with Alison Krauss at the moment, but then plans to take a two year hiatus.  There's still the slim (VERY slim) possibility that Zeppelin -will- reunite for a final tour, but I really doubt it.



RE-EDIT:  The band reunited for a single gig--a fundraiser for a charity organization a while ago.  This got people talking of an 'expected reunion/tour', one thing led to another, and eventually developed into "Robert Plant's already signed the contract and everything!"  Which is entirely untrue.  Sadly.

What does it mean to have a big singing voice? I'm looking for a definition, not examples (Etta James). Thx!?



I've been told I have a "big" voice but I'm not exactly sure what that means. I can identify singers I would consider to have big voices but I can't exactly pinpoint why. Is it the volume? Color of the voice? Thanks for any clarification you can give!

hi, im a record producer so im naturally the best person to answer this. a "big" voice means that you have a lot of vibrato (vibrato: a slightly tremulous effect imparted to vocal or instrumental tone for added warmth and expressiveness by slight and rapid variations in pitch .) Usually broadway singers of old fasioned singers have big voices. you said not to give examples so i wont.  but it can also limit you. there are certain songs that people with big voices just simply cant pull off. but technically, having a big voice is a huge plus in the world of professional music.

Hello everyone. can anyone please tell me whats wrong with my voice!?!?



Im learning to sing and have just started in january this year. Ever since two weeks ago my throat has started feeling tight and it feels like there a golf ball stuck in my eusophogus. i havent sung very much and ive tried resting my voice to help it heal but it hasnt been working. Ive also started gurgling water with a pinch of salt. Its so bad that even my speaking voice is strained. Please help me! i want to be able to sing again. i can still reach some high notes but its always strained!

Well, you're probably pushing yourself too much and straining your voice. You should not involve your neck and throat in your singing. Let the support come from further down in your body around your abdomen and when you breath in try not to make your chest and shoulders move much, because if they move that means your not taking breaths properly. Before you sing you should relax your neck muscles to remind you that you wont be using them to sing. For the time being you should take a break from singing and even some taking if you can, and don't go around yelling a lot or screaming because that can hurt your voice.

You probably strained the muscles in your throat. Don't sing at all for a while (hard, i know) but rest your voice. Anything you do will make it worse, and the voice is one instrument you can't replace. Whisper for a while, drink a lot of hot drinks and eat healthily. When you do that, you have sung too hard, or too high for your chords. You will be fine, it will come back, just rest. I have done it too, and it sucks, but you need to rest up. :) You will be fine. Take care, and then when you are well, try humming and then work up from there. Good luck, dude. :) And do take care. :) Oh, and you may have a throat infection, so try antibiotics, or go to the doc if it doesn't get better. :)

www.justinguitar.com is a great site with lots of free info. On the left of the page select chords. All open/basic chords, Dom7th open chords and power chords. Just learning those and practicing changing between them is a great way to start. He is a great teacher and has several youtube videos too. User names "justinsandercoe"  & "justinsandercoesongs".



When you get some practice and knowledge check out my youtube site, I have covers there with tabs / chords to help you learn the songs. My username is jtodd900.

What is the name of a choral song...?



You've seen this in movies and cartoons:  The clouds open, a ray of sunlight falls over the main character and one onomatopoeic choir is heard.



Like "uuuaaaaaaa", you know, the classic for a celestial atmosphere.
Does anyone knows the name of that song? Or from where it comes from?
Thank you!

It's called What You Got by Colby O Donis. Here are the lyrics:
Konvict, konvict



Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh



(verse 1:) colby o'donis



I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And notice that that pinky ring is bright enough baby
I know you're not alone
But i could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up baby
And i like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see, and i know your game girl
But i don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, i see it so you don't have to say a word
Yeah those guys wanna come treat ya right



(hook)
Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin' hot
Girl you know that you need to stop

Girl i can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl and i can't lie
And i can tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized
The way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, and i know your game girl
But i don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much

I cant keep my eyes away from you girl when you get on the floor and do what you do
And errbody wanna come back to that body and kind of remind myself i'm like you
Cus your that type drive a man crazy and snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back he'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do once you expose that thang you do
Ya had him crawlin' on hands and knees and ya find a way to get him out that cheese
And why ya thinkin' that you the only dude she off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' errbody know she got you but now you feel like a fool

I can only think of Original Sin by INXS.



"Original Sin"



You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love - yeah
You thought what a pity



Dream on white boy
Dream on black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away



There was a time when I did not care
And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream and it's held by many
Well I'm sure you had to see
It's open arms



Dream on white boy
Dream on black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away



You might know of the original sin

The White Stripes' "Little Room" sounds like...?



I heard a song recently that sounded very similar to the White Stripes "Little Room" ( here it is if you haven't heard it -it's less than a minute: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlFKxA4N3...  The song that I heard was a tad more folky and definitely had guitar in it.



The end of "Little Room" when Jack is singing the nonsense words is what sounds especially borrowed from this other song.



No, I don't know any of the lyrics from this mystery song!



Just curious to know if "Little Room" sounds similar to anyone else or if anyone has any info.



THANKS.

Try Angus and Julia Stone, or Alexi Murdoch- they are both really relaxing and such sweet songs (try Orange Sky by Alexi Murdoch... great song..) It is good, calm music.
Hope it helps... :)

Apparently lyrics tend to demand attention, even if you aren't consciously trying to listen to them. So some instrumental music might be a good idea. Anything by Mike Oldfield is great for 'listening without listening', especially the albums 'Tubular Bells', 'Hergest Ridge', and 'Music of the Spheres'.

Well, they were relatively unknown when I found them, but they're getting bigger now--Kings of Leon.



Along with The Black Keys, they are one of the best bands out there today.  Both bands can be called Blues-Rock, The Black Keys more so than Kings of Leon.

OK, I agree with the other poster on Kings of Leon.  They are bigger now, but still a lot of people don't know how much they rule.



I myself just looked up a Black Keys song ("I Got Mine") which is pretty sweet, so I think I'm gonna check them out some more.



As for my suggestions:
Broken Social Scene - You Forgot It in People (album) Cause = Time (song)



***RXBANDITS*** = great band.



1. The lyrics and music are just above and beyond what good music should be. Actually thought provoking and gets you moving.
2. Talk about nice guys.  I've met a few of the band members on different occasions and they are down-to-earth and sweet cool guys.
3. They play smaller venues to keep ticket prices low (i've never paid more than $25. I think the cheapest was $12).
4. Started their own record label to control their music. It's purely their sound, unfiltered. They could have gone mainstream, but they are in it for the music. Truly.  I mean, these guys look HUNGRY.



Obviously you can tell I am a huuuge fan.  I have nothing but respect for these guys and have seen them 7 times. I swear they are always touring. And they kill their live show!

You could say any very respected bands are overrated if they're not your personal taste. On YA, people have said it about Led Zep, Pink Floyd and The beatles (really!).



My answer - they deserve the respect, and they were already massive before Kurt died. He was already an icon. Kurt was a brilliant song writer, they deserve  the respect. Their sound might not be for you, but you should respect that they were talented.

Oh ya !! Toughie ! I do think they were a little over rated, though Nevermind was a superb album and still sounds as fresh and vital as it ever did, and the Unplugged album proved that they weren't just volume merchants ! The other albums, In Utero, Incesticide and Bleach were for most part great albums and he was a great songwriter but like many other greats he had problems with depression and drugs !!!



When first using Heroin, he was escaping his mental torment because that's what it does, it's the ultimate anaesthetic ! He'd be chasing the dragon and feeling ecstatic, but like most users he moved onto the needle and from then on it's a fast spiral downwards and you're no longer using it to escape, you're using it to try and feel "normal" !!! And unless you've experienced it or know someone who has, to a lesser extent, then you really have no idea just how hellish it is !!!  If he had lived on, there was a massive chance of him never writing anything half decent ever again unless he got totally clean and there was little chance of that partly because he was rich and could afford it very easily, partly his addictive personality and partly because of his depression !!! I believe that's exactly why he killed himself with a bullet in the brain, because there's no chance of being discovered and saved !!! Drugs and Depression can take anyone regardless of fame, fortune, class or creed, they're truly wicked !
If he had lived i think he might've been sectioned and we would probably talking about him being a wasted talent !!!
He was a great, i think, but a young death tends to make people almost mythical !!!
Still love them though and i was lucky enough to see them 3 times, the best one being an unannounced gig in a wee pub in Edinburgh after their main tour date was over .....brilliant !!!
At least his pain is over, that's the main thing...bless him x

I believe they would still be a notable band if Kurt was still alive and recording with Dave and Krist, but I'm not convinced they would be as legendary. MTV would have mostly abandoned them by now, but their albums would still sell and their singles would wind up charting on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Tracks (instead of the the Hot 100). The kind of popularity bands/artists like Radiohead, Beck, and Oasis now have.

I mean, they ushered in a new revolution of music and gave a voice to a generation!!! So, yes we would still be talking about them if Kurt hadn't died.  Maybe they wouldn't have so many "fans" because emo kids wouldn't be getting into them for the suicide aspect, but all their true fans, the ones into them for their music, would still be with them!

it is such a sweet album, as soon as i saw this question i was :)
yeah i reckon their best song is probably diamonds aren't forever, BUT i have been listening to this album for the past 2 hours and it is all soooo good. i love bmth, and oli sykes is a f*cking genius!!



EDIT: i like that particular song because of the lyrics and his scream in it is powerful... and also i think his vocals are generally a step up from count your blessings.

Listening to the song suicide season while writing this. I don't think his voice is any weaker than in their last album, it does seem like a bit of a more low key album so far. but theres nothing wrong with that. We all have out own opinions i love BMTH. always will.

Good rock/indie/metal love songs?



I've had a look at other similar questions, btw, but they say songs like "lips of an angel" by hinder and I hate that stuff.



So whats a good rock/indie/metal/alternate love song (stuff thats in first person - as in "I love you" not "I love her" lol)?



I like The Kooks, Klaxons, Arctic Monkeys, Tool, Incubus, stuff like that. It can be slow or fast but I prefer a slow lovey-dovey one!

They DO have feelings - itt's a myth that they don't feel pain.  A scientific study proved that they do, when they injected mild acid into the lips of fish and found that they avoided the sides of the tank so as not to feel any pain.

Well personally i hate her guts, but i can't deny she has s huge fan base of teenage girls and guys in Australia. Her best songs are "See You Again" went to #6 on the AUS charts, "Start All Over", and " and "7 things" went to #10 on the AUS charts. She is so popular that most of the girl in my class talk about her. I wouldn't say she's Australia's favorite pop star but she is pretty famous.

Spanish song from the movie Under the Same Moon?



I listened to the soundtrack but it wasn't on there. I think it came out in the part where the lil boy is going to work picking tomatoes. Its in spanish and it goes something like this:
he came from the sky but is not a plane...he is blue eyed (or something like that) and I am dark fat and short.



Any idea what the name of this song is & who sings it?

Earth - Dylan Carlson was a drug dealer (Kurt Cobain's dealer, too)
Nirvana - See above band
Hole - According to Dylan Carlson in the documentary Kurt and Courtney, he also sold to Courtney Love
Megadeth/Metallica - Dave Mustaine had a pretty bad rough patch in his life, Cliff Burton also did cocaine somewhat often.
Lou Reed-See his song "Heroin" (actually by the Velvet Underground, but written by him)
Eric Clapton-His song Cocaine is about his drug use
Jimi Hendrix
The Beatles-Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds (LitSwD), they did LSD
David Bowie-Space Oddity and Ashes To Ashes (I think there's another one) are about "Major Tom", aka Bowie himself.
The Stooges-I read the liner notes to "Fun House" and they described the process of recording LA Blues as "we all got high... then recorded it", or something along those lines.
Grateful Dead-I heard that they also sold drugs
Neil Young-His song "The Needle And The Damage Done"
Janis Joplin
Jim Morrison of The Doors
The Rolling Stones-Brian Jones died from a drug overdose I think, and I'm pretty sure Keith and Mick have both admitted to using something.
The Who-Especially Keith Moon
Sex Pistols-As well as, I'm sure, many other punk bands



Why do I get a thumbs down?  I'm sure of every single accusation on this list, except where noted as "I think"

Electric Wizard's fifth member is probably cannabis. Black Sabbath (particularly Ozzy) was huge on the sweet leaf too, and cocaine I think. David Bowie is well known for being a huge cocaine addict at one time. The Beatles famously took LSD. Jim Morrison was on everything and then some. I forgot what Jimi Hendrix preferred. My list is extremely far from complete.

The Clash - Topper Headon got fired for his addiction, his rehab bill was supposedly picked up by Pete Townshend



Cream - Supposedly the only gigs they never did sober were the reunion ones.



The Pretenders - Both Pete Farndon (heroin overdose) and James Honeyman-Scott (Cocaine induced heart-attack) had drug related deaths.



The Ramones - Dee Dee Ramone died of a Heroin overdose in 2002

Spanish song from the movie Under the Same Moon?



I listened to the soundtrack but it wasn't on there. I think it came out in the part where the lil boy is going to work picking tomatoes. Its in spanish and it goes something like this:
he came from the sky but is not a plane...he is blue eyed (or something like that) and I am dark fat and short.



Any idea what the name of this song is & who sings it?

Who Else Thinks Pink's New Single is Just AWFUL?



The versus sound like a children's nursery rhyme! The tune and melody on the versus is just awful.
I can't believe Pink has made this song

Julian C: You are quoting the Chorus!



Pink is WAY older than Britney and Christina. Either that, or she just looks a hell of a lot older than she ought to. Also, they are such different artists, there is no comparison.



Just to add - Although I'm not a Pink fan or CD buyer, I'm certainly not a Pink-hater. I thought "U + UR Hand" was superb and her latest songs have all been quite OK by me - just this latest one grates me whn I hear that silly tune/melody.

I totally disagree with you on this one. I think the song is brilliant. It shows that Pink is completely different from other singers around her age (Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera). It explores new territory and still manages to be catchy...



EDIT: Altough Pink is the oldest (September 8, 1979), the difference with Christina (December 18, 1980) and Britney (December 3, 1981) isn't that big...



Thanks for the thumbs down just for disagreeing with me. Should I thumb down everyone who thinks the song stinks?

To be perfectly honest, I can't stand her music.



I haven't even heard her latest "offering" but I am quite sure that I will dislike that as much as the rest of her wailing, screeching rubbish.
And surely she IS older than Britney and Christina, if not, she has had a very hard paper round!

Are you agree that My Chemical Romance saves people's lives?



I agree. They actually saves my live but I didn't notice that until I read about in the internet.Why do they save my live? bcoz mcr songs such as helena-realising me about death(it's sad n we should respect the departed) n cancer n also welcome 2 da black parade, the songs give me spirit to continue to live though I always lonely, sad and depressed.I have not many friends and since I know them, I feel a little happy and find some new friends.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I do hope this isn't a sarcastic question.



Music can save lives, and it can ruin them. For me, My Chemical Romance didn't literally save my life, in fact I wasn't actually on the brink of suicide when I started listening to them. I was however, really insecure about myself and I'll grant that My Chem did help me to change my value within myself in order to be who I am today.



Songs like "I'm Not Okay [I promise]" "Famous Last Words" and "Our Lady Of Sorrows" would have to be the one's with the clearest messages. One, that it's okay not to be 'okay', or not to fit in all the time. Two, everyone should believe in themselves and 'stand up ******* tall' [as Gerard says in OLOS], that's something I find very important- self-belief. And three, to be unafraid to keep on living your life regardless of the obstacles you may face in it. [the major theme in FLW.] Without my listening to those songs in particular I feel that I would not have the faith and confidence I do hold within myself at current.
So to answer your question, My Chemical Romance do not literally save lives. They don't grab the noose from around your kneck, take the blade from your wrists. No. But through their lyrics they proivde their fans with an understanding that can help them change their lives in order to become better people and to believe in themselves. So essentially they are helping kids 'save their lives' through giving them a way to change them. That's the way it works. They can believe in us and we can believe in them. The core MCRmy would agree with me.



My Chemical Romance changes lives, their true fans would acknowledge that. As for the emo crap, none of that matters. All that matters is that the fans 'Keep The Faith' through believing in MCR's lyrics and My Chem can then believe in their fans.

I do agree that some lives are saved by My Chemical Romance.  If you actually listen to the songs and what they say during interviews, their lyrics actually are very hopeful.  Also, they are good musicians and having an interest in common is a good way to meet people.  And they really aren't 'emo' as the haters say.  If they were, they wouldn't be leaving messages on their website saying not to commit suicide.

I totally agree. There was this documentary about "Emo/Scene" kids, [not like I'm calling you that] but a girl in the documentary said that "Famous Last Words" by MCR really makes her want to live and not just that but live it to the fullest.



It's important that some bands out there don't promote cutting, suicide, depression but instead, influence a more positive outlook on life for today's youth :]

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



oooooo I had the same problem as you a while ago where I didn't have long to learn a rather fast piece.  What I did was really just PRACTICE!  Honestly, I had about two weeks to perfect a song which would usually take me about six weeks due to other commitments and such, and so I spent about 5 hours on each weekend day and about 1.5 - 2 hours on weekdays just practising.



What you should do is break the piece into smaller sections, and practice them very slowly until you feel confident in picking up the tempo, and when you do, only do it very gradually so that you barely hear any difference in the speed.  Then when you feel confident in putting the whole piece together, do it.  That's what I did and I finally got it great :)



You might not be willing to spend as long as I did on your piece, but you should also break up your practice when you start to get frusterated (because you probably will) and go and find something relaxing to do.



If you're after perfection, remember it takes patience, dedication and practice :)

Well, it depends how good or capable you are now, but it takes time! Don't force it, and just stick with what sounds good for you. It will take about 1 to 2 years to get into it, to develop good vibrato and technique, and then go from then on. just remember, some of the best singers and songwriters never had singing lessons, or developed their voices. it is goodd, because you get vocal range, strength, tone quality and more, but the most important thing is heart and soul- if you have this, you will be great no matter what. Just work on breathing techniques, hum a lot to gain strength and have confidence! be happy with the gifts you have, and work from there. You will rock!! :) Good luck, dude.

I actually like to wake up slow........



So my first alarm of 3 is one that is Mellow and starts slow...so that if I wake up fast it doesnt blast me (Nemo, by Nightwish)



2nd one is Currently "My Apocolypse" by Arch Enemy..... in case I DO sleep through #1.



The third....oh don't go there.  I keep THAT one across the room...so I HAVE to get up..... and It has Fergie on it...because there is NO WAY IN HELL I am gonna lay there and listen to Fergie.  It absolutely guarantees I am gonna wake up.... (usually in a bad mood if I have to let that play)

first of all, 'don't wanna miss a thing' is a great song.  Totally agree with you there.  Listen to a bit of blink 182, their album 'take off your pants and jacket' is a good mood setter, even if they're talking about relationships going wrong or that.

I'm not pretty sure that I have heard of a rumor about a "healing song" but actually song are like novels that are being told to us ( do you get it?) that's why we always feel something when we hear a song



for me there is no best song for any illness or being dumped, but there is a "perfect song" for it that will be depending on the person who will need it.



for my personal experience i like "making love out of nothing at all" by air supply and "superman" by fiove for figthing

I tend to go another way to what alot of people said here are listen to techno or trance. DJ Tiesto's Elements of Life is likely one of my favorite CDs... All the songs flow together so its like one big song instead of individual songs.. I find it very calming.. Break my Fall is one of my favorite songs on the CD. The video is also one of my favorites --&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BQBeM758...
Either that or Ne-yo's "in my own words" cd. But those are more like love songs.
DJ's are usually my favorite because you kind of lay back and not think about anything.  Music like what you listen to would only make me dwell on the bad parts of my life.



That, or I'll try to listen to more upbeat things, which make my mood HAPPIER rather than just adding to the sad.



Another of my favorites (that I just discovered from a coworker a couple days ago) is Armin Van Buuren's "in and out of love" -&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxvpctgU_... ... It might fit your situation alot better.... also a neat video.. TRY ITTTTTTTT

Im sure its not only my guitar because i have heard and seen this on other peoples guitars. But why does the G string always seem to loose its correct tuning more quicker than other strings? I hate mine, to the point where its become personal now!!! Is there some scientific reason for this to happen? something to do with wave frenquencies etc???  Does anyone else suffer from this problem and is there any kind of tweaking that can be done??

Must just be you. Make sure you stretch your strings good. Also make sure that they are properly installed at the tuning keys. Check your bridge and make sure that it is smooth in the grooves.

I'm not familiar with this problem.  I would check your strings and you might need a minor neck adjustment.  I would talk it in and have it looked at by a pro.  That would drive me NUTS and is definately something that I would have to get taken care of.  Good luck.

I liked A Little Bit Longer (nick Jonas/Jonas Brothers). It actually made me cry. I guess because I've been through a lot of crap the past few years, and it reminds me that I'm not the only person going through the same stuff. It really got me motivated to volunteer for charities such as the Breast Cancer and Diabetes walks. I just really feel a lot better.

no offense but if you are just singing over a track no one will be impressed and you wont win, you wll just be a boring performance that parents that came just to watch there own kid will have to sit through think of a real talent that you have, or learn guitar real quick!

If you are alone, singing by yourself..
I would suggest "What Dreams Are Made Of" by Hilary Duff (make sure you get the ballad version) with just the piano backing on it. If you want I can send you the ballad with vocals removed... This will show off the suppleness off your voice (being a young female).
If you're REALLY wanting upbeat, then try "Piece Of Heaven" by Cascada, or "Shine" By Vanessa Amorosi.
Good Luck!

Well, that was interesting. but you can really improve your voice by totally getting a singing lesson. or if you dont want a music teacher, set your own goal everyday just play a song and practice the notes and pitches. if you do that you should make another video and look at your first one and see how much you improved. hope this helps =]

For all those who hold rock music dear: what feelings do you get when listening to "Stairway to Heaven"?



For me, it transports me to about 40 years before, where people could rebel all that we wanted, dress up in 'trash' and look cool: didn't care about where their lives were headed. The LZ concerts were the best part of my life, I had their posters plastered over my room when i was a kid; had all their records; wore their t-shirts with pride. Its unfortunate that there aren't any cool rockers left in the world today. Not even rockers, generally people. I miss the days where girls used to wear their one zip jeans, guys had long hair; we used to smoke and actually had a life.



</question>



<additional details>



i am feeling very nostalgic, and listening to today's music and talking to people makes me want to go back to the good old days. Someone please reminiscing something about the good days, the 70s, the best days of their lives. Share some interesting experiences from back then.



* sorry for the typos, typing very quickly.



Edit:



An interesting excerpt from a rock fan from Birmingham, UK.



"---Of course, I was one of those boys and that was the moment when I fell properly in love with Led Zeppelin. I knew about them already: my elder brother had a couple of their albums, which I'd listened to, and their music was in the ether. But this was when I realised just how good they were, how exciting, how alive.



Theirs was physical music, music that made you want to move, shake, break free, fly, and that's what we were trying to do in that musty brown front room in 1971.---"

Also, I dont see any really exciting girls these days. Many girls today dress up as sl**s (no offense), the girls from the '70s were rad as ever. They would dress up like trash, and look sumptuous. They had the most amazing hairstyles. They wore the best jackets, and torn,tight jeans. They were most of all rebellious, protesting against everything wrong in the society; having the best experiences in their lives. The girls today dont have any of that, and certainly none of the spunk that their elders had in their primes.

its nice to hear from someone who lived through the 70's and the led zeppelin days. wow you actually got to go and experience those great led zeppelin concerts!! i heard stairway the first time when i was 15 and at first didn't like it much. but as i listened to more and more of it it just got better and better. and now i just can;t get enough of it. somehow every time i hear it it sounds so new. and i never get bored of it.  during the solo and outro part i would jump around playing air guitar pretending to be playing next to a great live audience.  the song also helped me to chill out and relax a bit and was one of the songs which made me take up the guitar(although its wrong to say that the guitar is the best thing in the song)



anyways sorry for the long answer and i'm sure it doesnt help answering your question but this really got me back to my good days(not to long.. just about 1 year ago).

makes me feel relaxed because it has a chill guitar
when the singing happens i feel a little sad though because to me it just gives that feel to me.(probably because of the emotion robert plant puts in it when he sings it).when the clean electric guitar come in it makes me feel of back in the day before i was born. wondering about how life was when my dad was a kid. I love when the drums come in.
robert plant's rhythm in 4:20 i really like how he sang it. led zeppelin truly is a classic that's what i feel when i here this song

I'm sorry to say that the classic radio station has made me seriously burned out on Stairway. I really hate that, because its such an excellent song. I love your reminiscence about it.



I do get very sentimental about Freebird though. I guess that is my Stairway to Heaven. LOL! It makes me emotional because it makes me think of the plane crash, even though I was too young to know about it back then. It also takes me back to my high school days .



We used to sit in the parking lot before school in our super tight jeans , and our horrible  aquanetted hair and blast Skynard until the bell rang. I will never spend that much time on a hair style again!!!!

Does anybody know any of the musical techniques that were used in the Miles Davis recording Porgy and Bess?



I am an A level music student currently in the middle of an essay of which I have to compare the techniques that Miles Davis uses in the pieces "So What" and "Porgy and Bess album". I'm really stuck because I've been able not note the majority of the techniques of "So What" but because I am the only student at my school taking AS level music, I can't ask anybody else. Any help here would be much appreciated. Thanks x

To hold it? Just between your thumb, and the side of your index finger... pick each string with as little movement as possible! Moving your wrist and NOT your elbow / arm, or fingers.... it helps alot with speed!

hold a pick properly...partly slanted and you can use your pinky (place it below the e string)  as a guide by leaving it up and all the other fingers down except for the pinky and 1st 2 fingers holding the pick so when you pluck..you will have a less tendency to pluck wrong strings..this can help because the pinky will serve as your guide because as you pluck a certain string you will feel them getting lower or higher other strings when it is close to the pinky

Electric bass help please?



Hello, Ive ben playing on an electric bass, and about every 1/4 time I hit the low E string, the string hits the pickup and makes a popping noise. Is there a fix to this, am I just hitting the string to hard, and is it bad for the bass



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I wonder if the neck could be warped a bit backward and need adjusting, but then you'd probably notice trouble tuning.  Or whether you could replace the bridge to raise the strings, but then that would throw off tuning a tiny bit.  I don't know if the string hitting the pickup is going to do any damage or not.

It's a bit different to their other songs so it's good :) and it's slower so it's more easy to listen to if you just want to listen to music chilling out.



All the Ting Tings songs have a good sound and a great beat but i wouldn't recommend them live.

1. That Jazz musicians are born with talent instead of having earned from countless years of practice.
2. That Jazz is "made up". If a jazzer doesn't know what he is about to play he is "fakin' it" jazz is just memorized melodies sung on an instrument.
3. That Jazz sucks, which it doesn't.

Many of the responses can be simplified to the notion known as the "noble savage" which I've heard Wynton Marsalis use in rants decrying the accusations of moral depravity as contrasted with cultural achievements among jazz musicians.



Speaking of cultural achievements, I find it ironic that Swing-era musicians such as Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman were among the vanguard of integration in the United States, yet the adverse bi-lateral racism that Jazzriff references is sadly true. Why must some musicians taint the art form which is a buffet for the ears with such ultimately meaningless observations based in the sense of sight? For me one of the most beautiful things in musician culture is acceptance based on one's musical output rather than on one's age, gender, race, politics, or even personality (for example, I have nothing but reverence for the music of Stan Getz in spite of the fact that he thumped on all three of his wives; read the Donald Maggin book "Stan Getz: My Life in Jazz" for corroboration).

A common stereotype is that you need to be hooked up in some heavy substance to be a good jazz musician.



A large number of pot heads in jazz were mediocre to lousy musicians. While Duke Ellington -my all time favorite- was clean, and not only that. he had to deal with a bunch of druggies in his orchestra and managed to make them sound as the tightest unit ever.

What is this 70's Song - HELP!?



Here at work , a coworker and I have a song stuck in our heads - and do not know the name of who sings it or what the name of the song is.  It's possibly a 70's song - disco-ish.  The other thing is that we do not know the exact words.  It goes something like mid way through the chorus - 'And I remember!, it was a quarter past three, In September!'



I realize these are not these are probably not at all the words - but this is what is sounds like to us. The remember and september are said short and fast.



Another clue as to helping us find out what it is - is that in the middle of every verse there is  high pitch ooo-ing and aah-ing. 'Ahhhh eeeeh ahhh..da da da remember..ahh eeh ahh.. da da da remember'.



Please help, you will make this song go away from our minds and settle this week long wondering. Thanks

R&HH: T.I's "paper Trail ". Have you heard the whole album..? Opinions on Tracks..?



First i must say, in my opinion, one of T.I's best so far.
Been a fan since " Urban Legend ". and upon listening to his whole album via: imeem.com , I actaully admire him much more.
His creativity has expanded and feel he actaully took his time with this album. and it's a bit more in-depth with more feeling to it.



"No Matter what "
" Whatever you like "
" Swagger like us " - Great Collaboration.
" Live your Life " Ft. Rihanna
" I'm Illy  "



... Are the Top picks of mine, so far.



Question being:
Opinion on album?
and What you think about T.I. in general ?



haters & lovers are always open to answer.

Teena Marie ?
"365"  ?
I've got a head rush, hush
You're heaven's dial, a crush
I prayed for you forever
And he sent you last November-Finally



You better hold tight flight
Two shadows, one at night
Each instant lasting so long
The spirit in this very song-Reminding me



That life has taught me lessons
Like don't dare to question fate
For God will do the gifting
All we've got to do is wait



So if anybody asks you if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to 365



365
365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear



I got a love jones in my bones
I hear a saxaphone
A melody so haunting
It leaves my heart never wanting
More than you



You really fit the bill
The first day of April
And now I know that deep inside my heart
You're gonna play the biggest part in my love debut



For with you comes the passion
Like springtime I fathom grand
I cherish every blessing I get
When you kiss and hold my hand



So if anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five



365
365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear



Do you remember last November, baby
That's when I met you
When heaven sent you baby, ah
Sometimes I stop and throw my hands up in the air
You make me holler, hey
Tee Tee won't go away
It's more than just a feeling-It's destiny
I'm gonna testify about the long you're giving to me
I'm gonna break it down for you
Gonna break down
Break it down
Break it on down-I love you



If anybody asks if your love is alive
Tell them all to count up to three hundred and sixty-five



365
365 days a year
Three hundred and sixty-five
That's how much I love you dear

I believe it is state radio.  If it isn't State Radio then it is Dispatch.  I don't think it is Dispatch because I have been listening to them for a while and I doubt there is a song I haven't heard at least once.

The first link is Medeski, Martin & Wood (MMW).  They don't have a guitar but the organ player (Medeski) is renowned as one of the best in the world.  They are a much more modern jazz.  Great stuff.  The second link is MMW with John Scofield.  Scofield used to play with Miles Davis.  He has since put out many great solo albums.  The third link is a band called Soulive.  I'm not sure of the guitarists name, but they're an awesome band.  The fourth link is Greyboy Allstars.  They are more of a groove based jazz, but damn, those guys are good.  If you like these bands send me an email and I can recommend many more great jazz bands.  Enjoy!

What do you think of this song no.2?



So as I said in my first question, I've been writing songs since I was young and am 13 now...some constructive comments please!



I wrote this when a friend I fancied asked me to help her with a horror film project:



Lets make a horror film, about love,
I'l be Dracula, you be Juliet,
A romcom filled to the brim,
With fear,



Each line you cast into my web,
Fills me with dread, I relish you dread,
All the fake blood that you spill,
Breaks my heart,



So why cant I directmy horror film, about love,
No lives would be taken, no frankensteins awakened,
Only the hearts of two lost souls, like me and you,
Meeting on a moonlit balcony...
In my horror film of love!



Thats all so far, some comments please :D
thanks.

What is the name of this song ?



Does anyone know the name of the song that has a chorus that goes: Falling, falling turning when



I'm pretty certain it is an early 90's song. It is sung by a guy. The chorus goes on to talking about how all his friends are gone. Sorry to be so vague but when I heard the song there was a ton of noise.

Bass and treble are the tonal extremes, but if you're referrring to the bass line or instrument, the opposite will depend on which instruments are used. It could be a picolo or a synthesiser. A Guitar harmonic or a crash cymbal.

Lol.
It's hard to tell because they are both good but sooo different.
I used to be such a massive Paramore fan but I don't know, I kind of went off them.
I'd love to say All We Know Is Falling because they were less commercialised then, but I actually can't decide because I think half of the records off Riot! were awesome but then again half from AWKIF are amazing too.



They are both different stages of Paramore's development so I can't chose. XD

They're both amazing. Personally I think Hayley's voice has a lot more emotion to it in All We Know Is Falling, and it's more of a helpless edge to the album, like All We Know Is Falling really captures the genesis of the band, like when their bassist left and they didn't know how to deal with that, they didn't know if they were gonna make it as a band. It really captures the youthful stage of the band and makes you realise they were just a group of teenagers who made it big, and how much that scared them. It starts with "All We Know" being the first track on the album, how scared they were, and ends with "My Heart", which I think is a song about putting their trust in God and Fate and letting the chips fall where they may, it's a great album with a lot of emotion behind it.



Riot! is exactly that. It's Paramore standing up, and saying they know they're gonna make it now. Riot! is aptly named. It's an explosion of the colour and power and strength that Paramore held back in the helplessness of the first album. While All We Know Is Falling is about questions, Riot! is about having the answers and having confidence, enough so to scream the word RIOT! and know, in their hearts, that they are gonna make it. It's a great album.



The very best of luck to you

Does Type O Negative being a "joke" band change your opinion of their music?



When I first heard from Peter Steele that he's just joking around with his voice and music choices, I had to stop listening to TON for months.  I almost burned my cds, or threw them out.  But eventually I started to say, I don't care what Peter Steele says, I disagree with him.  I like his music cuz it is hardcore metal and it's true.

What Pink Floyd was better?



Not many people notice this but there is considered to be three different stages of Pink Floyd.



They are:



Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason (1965-1968) Albums: The Piper at the gates of Dawn,A Saucerful of Secrets&lt;3



Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason (1971-1983)
Albums: Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, The Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals&lt;3, The Wall&lt;33, The Final Cut (OH G&lt;3D)



David Gilmour, Nick Mason,Richard Wright (1987-1994) Albums:
A Momentary Lapse of Reason&lt;31/2, The Division Bell&lt;3



Out of those eras which one do you like the most? What albums out of that era do you like the most? Whats your favorite songs on them?

Actually Rick Wright wasn't on The Final Cut



This version of Floyd, all together, all contributing was the best to me. And made almost all their best albums.

I would be really hard-pressed to narrow it down to only one, but I think the era of 71-83 would have to be my favorite.  Dark Side of The Moon is so incredible.  But then again, so is The Wall.  I don't think anyone has every made better music than Pink Floyd.

I am biased here...  Always liked Syd, and what the band did to him (not picking him up for a gig and then firing him during a mental break down) was low and lame.  Syd's Floyd was more playful musically - and not as depressing as Water's or Gilmours version.



I do like Water's - Dark Side, Wish You Were Here and The Wall are classics - but due to radio - they have been oevr played!



Gilmour's floyd was ok - liked Division Bell - though most critics didn't like it.  But those who can't play are critics.



So, for me,  give me Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd.  Or his solo work is also nice, weird, and catchy!

Billy Joel - unreleased songs?



I found this link on the web:
http://talk.livedaily.com/archive/index....
It's a couple of years old, and at the bottom is another link to http://www.egroups.com/group/BillyJoelNe...
does anybody know this Dan from Long Island, and whether or not he managed to make a compilation of those unreleased songs. I'm a huge billy joel fan, and would like to get hold of those songs!

You can try iTunes for some karaoke version or instrumental versions of popular songs. You can also try a local music store. But it can't be just any one though. Maybe a music store that you know sells karaoke or instrumental versions of songs.



BTW, cover songs are songs that are sung by another person other than the original artist who sung it. For example, Joss Stone did a cover version of The White Stripes "Fell in Love with a Girl" but is Joss's case "Fell in love with a Boy" The White Stripes is the original singer of the song...

Trying to find a song...? ?



Don't know many details but it was a "metal" ballad, approximately mid 80's.



Title was "This Time". May have been an American band.



Album was on vinal and track was towards the end of a or b side.



Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

What is the main theme song in "MotoGP 06"?



This question has actually been asked on alot of other forums when I typed it in Google seach, so I am just going to copy what someone else wrote!



"""I've been searching myself for the entire soundtrack to MotoGP via the songs listed in the credits on the Internet
, and have found over half of them but have hit a glass ceiling. Taking an educated guess, I'd say the menu theme and the one featured on the credits are both by Thrumm, but that notion's based purely on the fact that I found a single damn thing about them anywhere. Here's a list of songs it could be (Ones I've failed to find):



Chad Jackson - Scum Dogs
Teruishi Nagatomi - Confusion
Nathan Cross - 10 Dollar
Andy Brookes - Sucker Punch
Richard Alter - Feel
James Dexter (a.k.a. DJ Dex) - Move With It
Mark Crew - Pump
??? - New Formula (Forgotten the artist, sorry)
Thrumm - Grind Control
Thrumm - Humanic



One of the songs I'm looking for is amongst them. It's got a banging saw-cut bassline, driving beat and has a female vocal in the last half. There is a deep male vocal that speaks but I can't make out what he says except for at the end of the song, when he says "on and on and on..." followed by two bleeps. If anyone can give me the title, or even figure out what he's saying it would be a big help.""""

Could someone help me with this song title/artist?



I'm sorry but this probably won't make much sense. I am trying to find the song title/artist name of a scratchy voiced reggae singer. All I can get from the song is the hook, and I'm sure my cadence will be off, but it is something similar to Bom Bom ba Bom Bom (repeated multiple times). Any help would be great, thanks

How can you possibly enjoy "good music" of the Beatles or any other genuine classic rock?



All the songs I hear from the beatles are in such a shitty audio quality that I would rather listen to a mainstream song today that everybody says is tasteless, just for the sake of good audio quality. How can people still enjoy such sh*t recording quality in the 60s? (i'm talking about the studio recording, not the quality of the music itself)

Please help name this 1970's song.?



I can't remeber the words but have the tune stuck in my head. It's from the 70's, a disco/funk song, sort of Earth, Wind and Fire-ish. The male singer has a high voice and there are party sounds in the background. I know it's not much to go on.

I've asked this before but since there's new people on here since then...?



Since rap and poetry are so closely related, how many of you read poetry?



And do you have a favourite poem? If so, post it (or a link to it) here.



If anyone has any poets they'd like to recommend please do.



(I know technically I should put this in the poetry section, but rap and poetry are closely related and I got some really interesting answering when I asked this a while back)

As I am a poet, I will take that as a compliment. As I am also a rap lover, I will assume that my being knowledgable and intelligent (as you so kindly said yourself) makes my love of rap perfectly valid.



And I'm perfectly aware of Owen's work thanks. I find it a little staid for my tastes, but I can see the attraction for some people.

If you can keep your head when all about you

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,



But make allowance for their doubting too;



If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,



Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,



Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,



And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;



If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;



If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;



If you can meet with triumph and disaster



And treat those two imposters just the same;



If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken



Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,



Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,



And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;



If you can make one heap of all your winnings



And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,



And lose, and start again at your beginnings



And never breath a word about your loss;



If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew



To serve your turn long after they are gone,



And so hold on when there is nothing in you



Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on";



If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,



Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch;



If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;



If all men count with you, but none too much;



If you can fill the unforgiving minute



With sixty seconds' worth of distance run -



Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,



And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!

I read poetry sometimes..I like Edgar Allan Poe's poems..



But this poem is my favourite:



Walter de la Mare
"The Listeners"



‘IS there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,
Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champ’d the grasses



Of the forest’s ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,



Above the Traveller’s head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;



‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;



No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Lean’d over and look’d into his grey eyes,



Where he stood perplex’d and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners



That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight



To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,



That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirr’d and shaken



By the lonely Traveller’s call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,



Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,



’Neath the starr’d and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even



Louder, and lifted his head:—
’Tell them I came, and no one answer’d,



’That I kept my word,’ he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,



Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house



From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,



And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,



When the plunging hoofs were gone.

I love poetry.  I'm learning a lot about poetics in a class right now, and it's blowing my mind.  Good poetry is extremely difficult to write, and most folks are not very adept at reading it.  I'm finding out how poor a reader I am.  But I love language, and the best way to read a poem is out loud, to really get the music of it.  It's a lot more subtle than what's usually in rap, and more complicated in meaning.



So count me in as a major poetry fan.  My personal favorite is Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."  And there's a brilliant one by e.e. cummings that reminds me of presidential campaigns, called "next to of course god america i."

My favorite poem...
If You Forget Me by Pablo Neruda



want you to know
one thing.



You know how this is:
if I look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if I touch
near the fire
the impalpable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.



Well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you little by little.



If suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you.



If you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where I have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land.



But
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms
without leaving mine

rap, that is well constructed and delivered is really cool.. sry, i dont do poetry becauce i have to read it, and i usually dont get it all when i do that.. whereas rap is delivered to me, packaged like, and by the writer who spends lots of time on emphasis and timing.



a well placed rap tune can do wonders for me.. it goes in and makes a difference...



its not all retards attempting poetry... and mostly done by kids with serious things to say about life... who are commited to what they do.



we run a mobile stage and rapfactor.co.uk where we give an outlet to young rappers.. and we constantly get people who think they dont like rap saying things like ''actually its really good''.... some rap is bad coz of the content and that can spoil it for the rest of the bois out there..



we find that once we have a stage up and running, and its flowing then rap is a real powerful tool for putting a message across.. we just think somtimes that the major pumpers of rap dont do it the justice it deserves and will pump negative out because it sells...



there are some really good,young commited poets out there.



check out cstrikez on myspace..  his rap is clean. and he can also do a serious street poetry set, which has the audience hanging on to his every word...



we will be doing more with rapfactor next year.. look out for us..

To be in love



Is to touch with a lighter hand.

You look at things



Through his eyes.



A cardinal is red.

Suddenly you know he knows too.



He is not there but



You know you are tasting together



The winter, or a light spring weather.



His hand to take your hand is overmuch.



Too much to bear.



You cannot look in his eyes



Because your pulse must not say



What must not be said.



When he



Shuts a door-



Is not there_



Your arms are water.



And you are free



With a ghastly freedom.



You are the beautiful half



Of a golden hurt.



You remember and covet his mouth



To touch, to whisper on.



Oh when to declare

Oh when to apprize

Yeah I love poetry I even have a few original pieces to my name. Some of my favourite poets are Seamus Heaney, John Keats, Shakespeare, John Argard, Chinua Achebe and many others. My favourite poem is Footprints in the sand by Mary Stevenson. (see below)



One night a man had a dream. He dreamed



he was walking along the beach with the LORD.



Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.
For each scene he noticed two sets of
footprints in the sand: one belonging
to him, and the other to the LORD.



When the last scene of his life flashed before him,
he looked back at the footprints in the sand.



He noticed that many times along the path of
his life there was only one set of footprints.



He also noticed that it happened at the very
lowest and saddest times in his life.



This really bothered him and he
questioned the LORD about it:



"LORD, you said that once I decided to follow
you, you'd walk with me all the way.
But I have noticed that during the most
troublesome times in my life,
there is only one set of footprints.
I don't understand why when
I needed you most you would leave me."



The LORD replied:



"My son, my precious child,
I love you and I would never leave you.
During your times of trial and suffering,
when you see only one set of footprints,
it was then that I carried you."

I don't really read both...and i enjoy rap more but there is one poem I really like:



-----------0-------------



Say Cheese



Gorgonzola
Cambazola
Happy snappers
Sandwich wrappers
Parmesan
Vacherin
Week old socks
Unwashed cocks
All these
Say cheese



-----------0------------



Also, here are the lyrics to my favourite rap song



Its 'The Real Slim Shady' by Eminem



May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here..



Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her *** worse than before
they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture (Ahh!)
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement! (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
[*vocal turntable: chigga chigga chigga*]
"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes



[Chorus: Eminem (repeat 2X)]



'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up?



[Eminem]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;
well I do, so **** him and **** you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
****, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
You little *****, put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"
I should download her audio on MP3
and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [AHHH!]
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
so I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]
And there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me; who just don't give a **** like me
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!



[Chorus]



[Eminem]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just **** it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings
[*HACH*] Or in the parkin lot, circling
Screaming "I don't give a ****!"
with his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?



[Chorus 4X]



[Eminem]
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
**** it, let's all stand up

If you go to ~&gt; playlist.com &lt;~ you can make your own "Pink Floyd" music by creating your own social music experiment with "have a cigar" song and lots more with that same group you like (and/or others) and by using the graphic art in other areas such as ~&gt; Coolchaser.com  ...you will be surprised how creative you can get, making your own Pink Floyd-myspace.  Good Luck!

Lyrics, Title, or Artist...Any Details on a Song?



A couple of years ago I heard a song in a commercial that I fell in love with, and I've been searching for it since then.  In the commercial there was a little girl whose father promised he'd call her, or keep in touch, or come back, or something along those lines.  It showed him traveling by plane and then keeping his promise.  The song had some variation of "No matter where you are, I will be with you."  Those lyrics might be wrong, though, because I haven't been able to find the song yet.  If anybody has any ideas, please let me know!  Thanks!

To all my Musician R&Pers!! Have you experienced this?



Mainly guitar players for the most part.  Have you ever stumbled into Guitar Center or your local music shop to make that purchase?  You know when you decide it's time for a new amp or guitar or anything.



You enter and soon find that there is a young tween who has discovered the greatness of guitar.  In my book thats great... everyone should learn to play.  The only problem is this!



Have you been in there and soon realized that this "person" has learned one riff!  Possibly a blink 182 song or nirvana or whatever else these young kids listen to now a days, and they have the amp turned to "11" and have the worst tone in the world?



It may just be me, but when i go in to try an instrument out, i keep it at a personal volume.  I dont want others to hear me.  I have been playing since eight and cant stand going in there and blasting music... it may just be me..  have an opinion R&Pers?



MQ:Best guitar in your opinion?



</question>



<additional details>



Shredder: I agree. In my opinion there is always more to learn on guitar.  I am extremely humble and not cocky at all.  I go into the store sometimes and learn new things.  I have been into fusion jazz lately and my hands have been basically cramping.. haha  but this old man taught me a cool trick.. so i am always ready to learn and teach!

lol i know what you mean, i go to guitar center with my friends to mess around on keyboard equipment but i always like to mess with the guitars and basses and play the one song i know (the beginning of iron man) and sometimes i do have the tendency to turn the amp onto insane mode and blast the volume.  im sure it bothers people, but im just goofing off having fun.

that's almost as bad as someone trying to play stairway to heaven. or going into a grand piano store and someone is playing that wretched kc and jojo song.
my opinion is that they wanna let the world know just how GREAT they are..
kind of like when someone with terrible taste in music blasts it in their car with the windows rolled down.
next time this happens you should simply walk over and turn the volume down.
i think the whole visual of that is hilarious.

i have so much agreement with you-- people who play at guitar stores are almost invariably the people you don't want to hear play. i have seen a couple people with some real skill playing around but few and far between. when i go, i only plug it in if i really like the feel and the look of it, i'll play it a little unplugged to get a feel for it, rarely do i plug in and when i do, it is generally quiet and not for very long.



MA: i just love about every custom shop guitar i have every seen/played with, i love the art of it. mainstream brands i like prs and parker for electric and taylor and breedlove for acoustic. my main bass is a pre-gibson buy out valley arts.

Yeah man as the years go by Teens and youngster don't have a whole lot of common courtesy mainly dude its because so many people don't care they just flat don't care. I have been to music stores and other places and a lot of youngster these days are full of Envy I mean I will start playing to sit down and try to teach them something out of you know? pleasure and when I start doing a run or arpeggio they start turning red and get pissed and walk away and the only thing I can think of is I can do it and they cant and they cant stand that, and I am just trying to help them so they can do it too. with these youngsters today and other musicians The Fu***** Envy dude these days its SAD and pitiful. now I know cocky shredders Loomis can be very very cocky sometimes and stingy and greedy about his tricks John 5 has a Super Ego now dudes like that I can see why people get pissed because of the ego trip but I am trying to help people learn so Whatever.



But there are youngsters that appreciate people taking the time to show them and yeah its awesome to see the birth of a young new guitarist that has some friggin integrity.



Also some of them youngsters are just starting out and they want to Blast the amp because they are excited



Best guitar? I like Ibanez, ESP, and Jackson guitars I own and chose Ibanez.

Yes, just about every time that I've been to Guitar Center it's like that.  Of course you have to play with the amp settings and guitar settings, or even pedal settings to get a good tone--and that usually takes a little time.  PLEASE, take the time!  Good tone is worth it.



I went into a Guitar Center a few months ago and went CRAZY with a Deluxe Memory Man plugged into two amps.  I played with it for about half an hour and had a blast.  I think the workers were getting tired of it though.



That same day I walked back into the room where they have the keyboards and synths and saw some (obviously stoned) dude playing the same stupid riff on the keyboard over and over for about 15 minutes--NO EXAGERATING!  It was hilarious.



My fave guitar is either a Jaguar or a Jazzmaster.

Ah, they're just trying to imitate their heroes, disregarding everyone else. A lot of guitarists today just want to learn a few power chords and solos and thats that.



MA: ESP guitars. Gibson (especially the Les Paul) and Fender are blown up name brands. ESP makes high-quality guitars from Japan. My next guitar is going to be an ESP, as soon as I get enough money. Maybe the Kirk Hammentt signature model if you're going for metal.

I'd have to agree. I'm a Keyboardist, not a Guitarist, but nobody likes a Showboat IMO. And if You feel the need to go into You local Music Shop and blast all 5 riffs You know at top volume imagining Yourself to be Marty Friedman in You mind, you're both a showboat, and pretty damn lame to boot.

I think it's kind of annoying. I still have loads to learn about the guitar but I'm not obnoxious about the stuff that I do know because there are way more experienced musicians that come in and are so willing to sit down and teach a couple things. I always feel really humbled.



And if I have to hear Stairway played at crazy volume one more time, I'm gonna lose it lol



But whatever, I understand that some people just want to have fun, I just wish there was more respect involved..

I just won't go into that store without having a clear and specific gameplan anymore. I used to go in, browze around for deals, maybe respectfully (like you've laid out, at a personal volume is a great way to put it) try out a pedal or something. Now, no way. I will just buy and take advantage of their return policy (although generally I just know what I want to get anyways). That place is maddening for that exact reason. 10 different guitars playing totally their own thing all being played too loud. The only place where I disagree with you is that it doesn't matter what their skill level is. The sound of 10 independnt douche bags shredding at 8 is honestly just as frustrating as 10 independent kids who have no idea what they're doing. It's usually some combination. I can't even think in guitar center. I have a couple friends who worked there for a while and I don't see how they did it. They say that you tune it out after a while, but I don't think I could.

They decided to quit separately. Tony Meehan  (drummer) left in 1961, planning to become an A & R guy with Decca. Jet Harris left in 1962, encouraged by the success of Duane Eddy as a solo guitarist.
He had a couple of minor hits on his own, but found the tramnsition from playing bass with The Shadows to playing lead on his own quite tricky, so when a partnership with Tony was suggested, he was all in favour.
After three major hits, Harris was involved in a serious car accident which left him unable to play, so Meehan formed the Tony Meehan Combo, and continued in that direction for a while before going back to A & R. Sadly he died in an accident at home three years ago.
Harris did go back to playing eventually, but the whole scene had changed, and he never re-captured that early success. He can still be found on some of the 60s nostalgia tours.
If you're interested in 60s music, check out www.thevinylfrontier.net and tune in on line on Sunday evenings.

<asker's comment>



Very knowlegeable Mister.  I could never quite understand why Jet thought going solo as a bass player was a good idea.
I believe he had a fear of flying (may have read somewhere) which didnt help with touring.  Was dating Billie Davis at the time of his accident.



Jet still has his own website.

Im not sure with out reading up about it but i think they were together
for about 20 years i could be wrong, most of that time they were the backing band for Cliff Richard
You will find that after 20 years of playing they probably decide there was more to life and got fed up with it&gt; i dont think there were ever any major fall outs with one another.
Hank ? i forgotten his surname the lead guitarist now lives here in Australia he has done for many a year

Who is looking for a drummer? (Chicago)?



I live on the East Side of Chicago, on the boarder of Indiana. I havent been in a band for a little while now, and I wanna start writing music again. I can play pretty much any style of music and dig most styles of music. I perfer hardcore or any other style of hard music, but grindcore and death metal arent really my thing. But I wouldnt turn down someone that would want to do something other than that. If you have a band or you want to start a band and you are looking for a squeeky clean, tight drummer I am your guy.

What are some good songs of the GazettE?



Recently I just started listening to the GazettE, which is a visual kei group. I randomly selected few of their songs in Imeem.com, but I couldn't take interest to their music.



Do you know any songs that could convince me to give this band a second chance? Suggestions are highly appreciated.



Thanks a lot. &lt;3

Well, i'm a big Gazette fan myself xD
But i only discovered them on their 2007-2008 album: STACKED RUBBISH.



So.. i'll give you the old ones for now which are from 2006, i'm guessing?~
-Sugar Pain 5/5
-Kare Uta 5/5
-Miseinen 3.5/5
-Tokyo Shinjuu 3.5/5
-Nausea & Shudder 3/5
-Silly God Disco 6/5 xD~ it's so good.
-Cassis 4/5



Here are the ones from STACKED RUBBISH:
-AGONY 5/5
-CALM ENVY 4/5
-Flith in the Beauty 3.5/5
-Regret 2.5/5
-GENTLE LIE 3/5
(their are more)



Here are the ones from the Guren single (which are also in the STACKED RUBBISH album):
-Guren 6/5! I loving this song like no tomorrow.
-Kugutsu-e 5/5
-Kyomu no Owari Hakozume no Mokuji 5/5



Here are the ones from their new single (Released in November) LEECH:
-LEECH 5/5 (Pv & Song is on YouTube)
-Distorted Daytime 5/5 (You can find Distorted Daytime on my imeem. Just search it up with the Music tab)
-HOLE (haven't listened to it yet)



^The ones listed are all my favourites. The GazettE has very powerful and meaningful songs because Ruki (vocalist and my most beloved person haha) is a master at writing lyrics. I suggest you give them a second chance. But, sometimes, we don't end up liking them, so switch to another group :)



EDIT: I'll rate it out of 5 so, you'll probably might listen to them first haha.

A Static Lullaby
From First to Last



that's it



Underoath is post-hardcore i think, Atreyu is metalcore, never heard of Four Letter Lie, Aiden I guess could be screamo, The Almost is just alt rock, RJA is alt rock, Machinemade God and Opeth are far from screamo.



Source(s):



Yeah FFAF I used to listen to a lot of these bands back before I started into metal. From First to Last was one of my favorite bands actually, and my AIM sn had FFTL in it a long while ago. I think I called them post-hardcore back in the day as well, though their first album Aesthetic basically was screamo.

Well, I never noticed any Marley before I changed mine. Since then I've seen about 3 or 4 pop up.



I'd say do something for Sublime. I give you permission to use my old avatar, if you want http://i254.photobucket.com/albums/hh97/...

Dragonette: Check out their their first single "I Get Around". If you like Katy Perry then you'd probably enjoy this. Its pop with a bit of an "electro" edge. Very catchy, and you will become obsessed with it :)



Annie: She's a pop singer from the UK and has made some of the best/catchiest pop songs ever, in my opinion. Her single "Chewing Gum" should give you a good indication of wat she's about.



The Veronicas: Again a pop band, but with a punkish edge. Check out their recent song "Hook Me Up". It's very good.



Hope you like these songs :)

I consider "Stairway to Heaven" to be the defining song of classic rock. As the absolute best, I don't know. It's pretty good... but I think it's overated.



"Smells like Teen Spirit" is the definitive grunge song. You can argue all you want about how commercialized Nirvana is for a grunge band, but I think that song is by far the most popular and still has a lot of the grunge spirit in it.

Fairly recent hard rock song?



The singer has a gravely voice. It's a recent (within the last 3 years mabye) hard rock or alternative song.



The chorus is some combination of the following:



"nice to meet you.. .. ..good to know me"



-OR-



"good to mee tyou.. .. ..nice to know me"



There are about six guitar riffs in between the two sets of lyrics. Each set of two riffs is seperate by a quick pause. I tried to show it with the



periods above.



Hope someone can make sense of what I'm trying to say!

To all my dear R&P buds who feel they were born a generation too late : )?



(and I know there are a lot of you) My friend just played this song for me while on the way back from school. I'm not sure if I like the song yet, but the lyrics really hit me, although I do not get the flower part, because a punk back in the 70's would have been beat up for that... ah, well, anyway, have a listen if you like, or just read if you want : )

Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair
In 77 and 69 revolution was in the air
I was born too late into a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair



When the head of state didn't play guitar,
Not everybody drove a car,
When music really mattered and when radio was king,
When accountants didn't have control
And the media couldn't buy your soul
And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything



When pop-stars still remained a myth
And ignorance could still be bliss
And when God Saved the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale
When my mom and dad were in their teens
And anarchy was still a dream
And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail



When record shops were still on top
And vinyl was all that they stocked
And the super info highway was still drifting out in space
Kids were wearing hand me downs,
And playing games meant kick around
And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face



I was born too late to a world that doesn't care
Oh I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair

Are you in the US or the UK?



Because that was a big hit over here in the UK last year {Sandi's from Scotland}, along with the accompanying album. Her new album, from this year, wasn't quite as good.

Searching for video/song. it starts with a girl with tatoo on her arm/boyfriends name. ends with name x-out ?



male singer/band. Kinda sounds like Rob Thomas, but it's not him.  Saw the video when i was overseas..was the only english station. Been trying to find out who does this song for two years now.  In the video, the girl had long dark hair. And the guy singing..was in several scenes, once on the roof of her house. Girl see's her guy with another, goes home and breaks his picture with her black converse sneaker.  She ends up happy, and had her X's name tatoo covered with flowers.  I remember one part of the lyrics contained "wave". also showed the young blond male singer, singing outside his tour bus or equiptment van.  Please help with name of singer or group/band...Thanks

Dont waste your time looking for it in webpages! Download it directly from Ares or Limewire or mIRC. Download any of these programs and just search for the song. If you get mIRC, make sure to connect onto the "undernet" server and go into #mp3passion there you will find any song.

Help me with a song that i dont know! please?



I cant seem to find a song i have been searching for for about a year now! I hear it and i dont know the name of it because i only know the beat and nobody is singing in the song (at least the part that i hear). I heard it in the background of the 2008 womans beach volleyball olympics against cuba and then i heard it again today on "i love the 80's 3d". It was i love 1989 and playing in the background during the "Parenthood" section. I heard the beat and it came on after they played the clip of "take on me" and i got frustrated because there ae no words to the song but i like the beat!
Please, if anyone knows the song i am talking about, please help me.

Appetite...it kicked the music world in the balls the day it was spewed from the LA underground. I gotta give credit to Dimebag and the boys though - they did a helluva job with Cowboys. Now if Chinese Democracy can come out next month..that'd be awesome.

Cover: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ojJkhOc...



Original: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3yOnFbyC...



I usually don't listen to covers, but when I read that Fall Out Boy did a cover of Love Will Tear Us Apart, I couldn't resist myself...
The only cover of this song that's alright is The Cure's. And well of course New Order...

I have a lot of favorite songs with numbers in them.



AFI - 6 to 8
AFI - Prelude 12/21
AFI - 37mm
AFI - 3 1/2
AFI - Three Reasons
AFI - Third Season (does this count? probably not but I want to mention it)
AFI - Three Seconds Notice
AFI - Triple Zero
AFI - The Leaving Song Pt. 2
AFI - Rabbits Are Roadkill on Route 37
AFI - File 13
AFI - Two of a Kind



Some fans think all the numbers are clues of some sort. Even some of their covers have numbers in them like Seven Nation Army and Song 2.



(by the way, to answer your question, I go with 6 to 8).

What's the best song for...?



So I made a funny montage video of a bunch of my friends. I caught all of them saying the f-word, so it's this long montage, "f-this, f-that."



Anyway, I need a good song to put with it. Obviously, the volume of the song will be rather low, because you'll want to hear the people, but I can't think of what to pair it with.

First select all the songs and right click. Go to get info.
Make sure they are all the same artist, album, and you can even add the image and other information.
Then individually right click each song and go to get info.  Fill in the track numbers and it should show up in order from now on.

This can be kind of tricky, okay?



Double click on each song, and click the tabs on the top of that box until you see one with the album name and song name and track number (it's usually what you see first, but just in case).



Clear out all the info. I'm not kidding, because if you downloaded them from different places even if you put all the tracks in order they could still be out of order if one has disk number and one doesn't, or any other additional information.



Then just put in the song, artist, and album, and put ___ out of ___ in the track number part. Do this for each of the songs, making sure the second number is the same in each of them. Add additional information if you want but make sure it's the exact same on all the songs or they'll go out of order again!

It's really not complicated at all. You dont have to clear anything, you dont have to change anything.



1) right click on the song



2)go to "get info", (on the right near



the middle it should say "track number _ of _ ")



3) make it the track number you want



4) hit "ok".



do that with the rest of them. It should save it for you.



see? i told you it was simple.

I dont know if you listen to country, but I thought that Whiskey Lullaby by Brad Paisley and Allison Krauss was sad.. go watch the video too, I highly recommend it. Nickelbacks "Far Away" was pretty sad,  and their other song "Someday" was too. Another one, recently, is Carrie Underwoods "Just A Dream". Personally I think this song is great but just plain sad. Go read the lyrics or watch the vid.. it made me cry.

String breaking - help?



I have a problem - i use 10-46 strings on my ibanez electric guitar (its a GRG), and i seem to break the low E string again and again - I tune it down to C# or C very often, and palm mute often as well, and each time ive broken the string, i was palm muting. I dont apply much pressure but still... a with a life of just one week, its getting costly... thanks in advance.

NO, DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!



The BEST way to get a song out of your head is to LISTEN TO IT!



The reason it gets stuck in your head is because there's a part that repeats.  You're not getting past it in your head, you're just repeating it.



If you go and actually listen to the song, it will finish, on your player AND in your head!



THEN listen to something else.  Seriously, this works better than anything else.

if you have an electric guitar you will need to have 2 wires. hook up the wire that is plugged in to your guitar to the input. get the other wire and plug it in to output on your tuner and also plug it in to your amp.
the red lights means it's too deep or too high of a pitch so if it goes to the left it's too high and if it goes to the right it's too deep so just keep trying to get it on the green light. GOOD LUCK

We are not to criticize what they do.however i don't like bands doing side projects.side projects are wastage of time and the band members are not so dedicated to their own band,it also shows their insecureness because having a side project makes others think that the band members are not having into a solid relationship and that they could break up anytime

I agree.My favourite band is Pantera & one of the reasons they broke up was the fact that all Phil Anselmo's side projects (Down, Superjoint Ritual) was creating tension between himself and the rest of Pantera.
Doing a solo album is still okay, but having a side project band is a definite no in my book.

So Far Away...is there anyone you miss?



I heard this while I was getting a coffee on my way to school, and I began to think of some of my friends who are no longer with me. I for one second was sitting and thinking while the beauty of Carole King's voice nearly brought me to tears



Has this ever happened to you? Has a song triggered a memory so strong you got overwhelmed with emotion?



Here is the song

It's a crappy song, but that one song, The Great Escape by Boys Like Girls, makes me remember this party I was at.  I had moved away from the town years before and I was there with a friend.  Everyone was nice enough to me, but it was a little weird to be the only "outsider."  Anyway when that song came on the stereo I just felt really alienated, and the whole party sucked after that :(
Now any time I hear that song I think of my friend, who tried really hard to show me around, and how much I miss him.

I really miss my sisters back there in the Philippines. It'll be 6 more months before I get to see them again and this is the longest I have ever been separated from them.



I was just in dance class thinking and minding my own business when suddenly a sad song came on from  the stereo. I'm not really sure what that song was called but it just moved me and i felt overcome with emotions. I cried just a little.

emil bulls - smells like rock n roll

What your looking for isn't what I would call metal, and Disturbed and Slipknot's sound is found in a multitude of bands out there. Quite frankly, there are bands, not force-fed to us by the media at large, that have done this type of music before, and far better. ****, I'd even suggest just browsing your local CD shop for a local band that you like. But if your looking for some metal, I suggest Death, Autopsy, Cannibal Corpse on a good day, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Exodus and anything else you can find.

Are blacks encouraging other blacks to commit crimes in music?



My neighbors are black. They play their music so loud that I can hear the lyrics. Today, they were playing a song by a black female singer that talked about busting the windows of a car to teach her man a lesson.  Whether it is going into their subconscious, I feel that this song is encouraging people to be violent and to commit crimes if they are not getting their way.  What do you think?

Not only african american people listen to music like that, alot of caucasian, and other races listen to different types of music that support discrimination, fighting, whatever. I think that when people see it on tv, or listen to it over and over in a song, they begin to think that 'Hey, if this is good enough for famous people, it should be good enough for me, right?' I don't konw. It's pretty messed up how it works. Songs brainwash people.

Its being played at most of the clubs in the West Coast.. I'm not really sure but it sounds like the Yingyangtwins/lilwayne or somebody from the south type of music



the tempo of the beat is not really fast... its kinda slow



i think its pretty new, it might go something like this.... jaga jaga jaga jaga (stomping noise x2),,



then it repeats itself, i dont really know, i can't really hear what the artist was saying...



haha it probably wasnt Jaga and probably it's something esle

How bout you don't download them cos if you like them enough you will buy them. Try going to one of their shows cos they will have them there and you will feel better if you buy them as you don't rip off the music industry.

An album you can try & which I highly recommend is "Cowboys From Hell" by Pantera
The sound of that album fits the description of what you're looking for.
Their sound changed a little bit after that album.

I can tell you that easily. I'm sitting here in my computer class with five other girls and two boys and one of the guys plays death metal during computer class, and the rest of the class HATES it.



It isn't mainstream because people aren't fond of the screaming. I guess.

Mainstream is a subjective term.  Where the line exists can be argued but death metal isn't mainstream because it has a relatively low listener base.



Also there are a number of people who enjoy listening to anything that isn't mainstream.  Bands know this, so to label themselves as mainstream would be to loose those fans.

Much of the subject material found on the lyrics of death metal isn't for the likes of offices, waiting rooms, most department stores, etc. You'd have to convince an older, more subdued crowd that it is okay.



Also, many people like to understand the lyrics without taking time to look them up, such as if they are screamed. That, to me, is why most people don't prefer it in the pop circles. Pop tends to prefer easier to digest lyrics.



Finally, you are discounting the urban influence on pop and mainstream music. Though rap and hip-hop does look faddish to the rock mindset, it is running its course.

Not enough people listen to it for it to be mainstream...and would you really want it to be? I think the best music out there is definitely NOT mainstream!

Reasons why i cannot play artificial (pinch) harmonics?



After watching numerous videos on how to pull off these harmonics, they still cannot be heard.  I'm not sure if the quality of my guitar could be a reason.  I play on an Epiphone SG-Special showed here



http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-SG-...



I know it is a low end guitar but could it really be the reason why I can't hit these harmonics?  I am using a Boss DS-1 Distortion pedal along with a PylePro amp shown here



http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Pyl...



I was also thinking that it could be the way my equalizer is set up or maybe the controls on my pedal but I am not sure after playing with them for a while.



I'm pretty sure I have the pick held correctly in coordination with my thumb hitting right after the pick.  And I have been trying to get it to come out by picking up and down the string to find a sweet spot.  I am currently playing with Ernie Ball "Not even slinky" that are about 3 weeks old.



Any solutions or tips to point me in the right direction would be great!

So before you die
Baby dance baby dance baby dance
Baby move like you move like you move
Stay the simple sway of my heart

Rollie Pollie comes the sun again



To tuck me to sleep next to my best friend



It was a warm summer night we filled with memories
And your loving wings wrapped all around me
Won’t go nowhere
Lying down here



So before we die
Baby dance baby dance baby dance
Baby move like you move like you move
Stay the simple sway of my heart

Sitting up above the world

he's been around for a really long time, and he can rhyme using words that have a unique style. he's had a few songs that people outside of hip hop would know. for example, when he did "crazy in love" with beyonce. and when he did "hard knock life". and "'03 bonnie & clyde". and "numb/encore" with linkin park. and "H to the Izzo". and "umbrella" with rihanna

I think his only number one was "Crazy in love" with beyonce..But i might be wrong..



Its got nothing to do with metaphors...If you knew what a metaphor was, You'd know Jay-Z is arguably the least metaphorical rapper on the planet. His WORDPLAY however is pretty distinct. And a lot of rappers have ripped it off...although some might argue that they got it from say Big L or KRS one or Big Daddy Kane.



But his selling point is that he OPENLY drew the focus away from lyricism as the ONLY WAY to get money in the rap game. He even references it a few times when he says "They don't understand the flow, But they understand da dough". And Reasonable Doubt (his solo album) embraced getting rich through the hustle, Which was like the opposite direction rappers like NaS were going in...



He was like a lyricist that was an anti-lyricist. He knew he could spit, But he concentrated on his swag.



I dunno what circles you run in bud, but Jay-Z headlined glastonbury...Em, Snoop or Dre couldn't do that in their wildest dreams. The guy had fans singing wonderwall AS WELL as his own material...Em,Snoop and Dre don't have that kinda status as rappers.

In hip-hop, billboard charts mean absolutely nothing.  If you have a good flow, and good metaphors, you're going to get noticed by a good company. There's tons of great rappers out there that aren't on the billboard charts.



Read one of Jay-Z's lines



"Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes
Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes

Jay-Z is more famous than Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre and alot more talented than them. Jay-Z gets his dues, and everyone I know has heard of him, Plus that stuff you listed isn't what makes an MC a good MC, quality is what makes a good MC. Whether their recognized for it or not, which he is.

R&P Can you help me with this "musical" problem?



Ok so my mom gave me another week to find a job and I have put out like 10 applications so far and I haven't gotten any calls back since then and I've even called them back asking about the status of my hiring. So do you think she's being un fair and impatient when it comes to this subject. Also she has been threatening me with "I'm gonna kick you out if you don't have a job, cause I can't support you anymore" which is complete bull $h!+ cause she looked for 6+ months and came up empty handed and is now screwing the state out of money to file disablity. Can you come up with any ideas on how not to get kicked out by Friday. Also I am 19 and have been actively looking for 5 months after I graduated H.S

Wow, sorry to hear that! Yeah, I would say that's being unfair. Sometimes parents are...silly. I'll just use that word, lol.  Where are you applying for jobs at? Even if you had to apply for a job at a restaurant I would, just so you can start getting some cash in while you look for a better job. You could also try the department of employment services. If it's a desperate situation, I'd go with any job until you can find a better one. This totally unfair for you, I'm really sorry.



Also, do you go to college? You will probably be eligible for financial aid and scholarships enough to go to a CC to start with. I would seriously give that a thought as a college education is really needed in today's job market...
Good luck! :)

*edit: Also most colleges have a work-study programs where they hire you to work and it goes toward your tuition. Or, there are a lot of jobs available for students and only students so you would probably be eligible for a lot of those and the money doesn't necessarily have to go towards tuition.

This is Bullsh** what your mom is doing. Number One, the economy is Sh** right now if in fact you are in the US and there are not a lot of Jobs right now, so when you put in an app to any employer right now there's another some Hundred maybe thousands in front of yours.



let me type I will be back with the rest.



EDIT:



plus your 19 and just starting out in the world you have no job experience which makes it even harder for you right now.



At the least your mom should give you a while to find a job with the economy situation right now not to mention your lack of experience, she should give you some time to get set up with a job and some money so you can get a place. As long as you would be trying to get out there and get started I don't see what the big friggin deal is.



your not out partying all night are you? your quite and courteous at home you don't cause any problems? if not I don't understand why she isn't being supportive after all your family.



Why is she in such a hurry to kick you out? I don't understand



EDIT: Your welcome no prob. Is there anyone in your family you can turn to, maybe uncle aunt someone? someone that would understand your position? Friends? dude this sucks I feel bad and I dont know what to do =(

That's horse sh*t!
I cannot believe your mother is threatening to kick you out of the house at a time like this!  And you're only 19.  It's not as if you were 35 or something...Jeez.



I guess, the only thing you can do is to try and get a job.  Look up job listings as hard as you can.  Otherwise, I don't really know what to say to help you.  Do you have anywhere else to go if she kicks you out?  Man, oh man, this must be a really shitty situation for you.



I wish you the best of luck, and hopefully a job opportunity will open up for you.



(Unfortunately, I can't think of any songs that will actually make the situation feel better...I apologize.)

Now, Kurt is getting itchy to join a new band.  Hendrix keeps eating his cookies and using up all his smack.



Who would Kurt go best w/?
a)Amy Winehouse
b)Jonas Brothers
c)an emo suck sh-t band
d)Foo Fighters
e)form a super group w/ Slash

e) Nah, wouldn't last too long, like other "supergroups" that involve Guns N Roses members and/or Slash
f) Chinese Democracy anyone?? An album with Axl Rose would take 20 years to finish.



SO MY VOTE IS...
he and Tupac make an album together. Now THAT would be awesome! Two reps for Gen X on the same album, with similar pains/struggles, pulling in both Pac and Nirvana fans. Now THAT would be a supergroup.

I feel like my world is crashing down without you. I know that I never could go on without you. Where did your wings take you this time? So far away from me. You...Runaway to escape but Ive been dying to tell you that? When you come home, I'll be waiting for you with open arms. I'd do anything to wake up in your arms. I don't seem to understand why every time that you are near. I keep feeling like I'm farther from you.I'll take your wings so that you'll come back down to me.

DISCLAIMER - I am putting this in R&P, because this is where my Peeps are :)



Mine was when I was about 10 yrs old ?? - and I had all the Right Friends with me and we would Run & Squeal from House to House... Running across Front Lawns and not using the Street.



Eventually (because it was so Dark), we forgot that some Yards have HILLS !!



We ALL (to our complete surprise) went FLYING !! ....Suspended in Mid-Air for Moments, that seemed like Forever -- and then came Crashing-Down the Other Side !!



We were SO GIDDY, that even though we were all Banged-Up -- We just laid there, Laughing like Crazy !!



This was REAL LIFE !!

We were walking down a street, eggs in hand.. (About three years ago) (( we went to a egg farm/factory managed tog et 200 eggs for free))



while walking down, i noticed a guy outside his house, stood there.  I nudged my friend who was talking to the rest of the guys, about egging an house.  We all clocked on to this guy, except our friend 'Lee' who, without hesitation said "LETS EGG THIS HOUSE" .. He ran past us and threw the eg straight at the window and ran down the hill around the corner, confused as to why we we're all stood there in shock.



The window who lee threw the egg at belonged to the guy stood outside the house, the man shouted "LEE I KNOW YOUR DAD"

Mine's similar to your's.  Me and my buds always ran from lawn to lawn, laughing like maniacs.  In fact, I think we smushed quite a few flowers.  Since it was so dark outside, I didn't realize that some houses at steps to get up to their door.  I was 12, and me and my friends were racing to get to the house first.  I thought I was gonna be first to this really big scary house on our street, but instead I tripped over the step and went flying into their garden with all my candy pouring out of my bag.  I was laughing so hard, I didn't even realize that I scraped my knee.  I recovered most of my candy, but 2 years later I ended going to that house and finding a piece of my candy still in their garden.



I guess Halloween is never really about candy, more just about fun.  That was cheesy.

I think Halloween in the US is rather different to hear in Britain, or maybe it's just lack of those sorts of 'group of friends' experiences. Anyway, the only memory I really have is this one from when I was 3 :~



My aunt made a Halloween cake, which had 3 orange marzipan pumpkins on top {different sizes}, and 8 black marzipan cats around the sides.



This cake was beautiful ~ I still have a photo of it!



So, I very happily enjoyed 3 cats and the smallest pumpkin, but it seems all that food colouring is not good when mixed with an over-excited 3-year-old!



But, despite being sick, I still loved that cake!

Well, I, personally prefered old Panic! At The Disco.
I know lots of people like the new ones but they lost tons of their old fans when they brought out Pretty. Odd.
Bands are always accused of being sell outs.
I don't know if I'd say PATD did that.
They changed so much, they are unrecognisable.
And I suppose they made more money with Pretty.Odd than their debut album.
But "sell out" is pretty strong, and I don't like to accuse bands of doing that.
All I'll say is I don't like the direction they've gone/are going in. xD

Why is Oasis regarded as such a great band?



They've been ripping off Lennon and McCartney (John in particular) for their entire career.  Don't get me wrong, I loved "Wonderwall" and "Morning Glory".  I thought they were brilliant...still do.  But after that, seriously, is there any reason to listen to any other record?  Will they just continue to do the same thing?



</question>



<additional details>



Sabrina, you just kind of confirmed my point.  No disrespect..."Don't Look Back In Anger" is my favorite Oasis song, but wouldn't you agree their musical range is bordering on ridiculous?  I mean they say how great they are...but Radiohead has developed...R.E.M. developed...Zeppelin and the Who developed....but are Oasis?  Here's an interesting side note.  Just think about The Fab Four and the space between "She Loves You" and "Come Together."  We're talking six years...'63 to '69.  Oasis have done nothing in that regard.  That's my point.

It's a matter of opinion.Yes, there hasn't been a drastic change to their sound.That could be because the Gallaghers still believe in true Rock 'n Roll, meaning no unneccesary studio gimmicks or electronic elements being implemented in their songs.They have put out two great albums in a row now & a lot of people still enjoy them.Their not as big as they once were but they'll still sell out shows all over Europe.
Noel Gallagher's comments should be taken with a pinch of salt.It's just his tongue in cheek sense of humour.He likes taking the piss, only nobody realises he's doing it.

Actually I love Oasis and it's all a matter of opinion plus all though Noel and Liam have crappy attitudes or whatever.  They still are  a brilliant band.  The Gallagher brothers have a reputation for being jerks but their music and talent makes up for it.  A lot of people love them and a lot of people hate them or dislike them but once again it's all a matter of opinion. I happent to love them. Especially because of their song "Don't Look Back In Anger".  That song si amazing and they are a wonderful band. This is just my opinion but I know some people who would agree with me.

True, and it's unusual to like a band and still say "all their songs sound the same". But i kind of know what you mean with Oasis. They should have disappeared after just the two albums in my opinion. It's ridiculous how much recognition they still get (although someone said not in the U.S. i think. But I can tell you everyone in England gets ridiculously excited when a new single comes out and says it's the best thing ever all over again). I can't see them doing anything different now. I think the only time they really "developed" was between Definitely Maybe and What's The Story, and even then the songs were just kinda catchier. I guess Whatever was different, but even that was just Oasis with some strings chucked over it (which is how I usually describe the Verve). So I guess my main point is I agree with you. For the record I loved She's Electric though. The only song I really like that's not on the first two albums is probably The Hindu Times, from Heathen Chemistry. Not a deviation in any way, just another good song.

Oasis suck man, the fact they have to resort to bashing talented bands is just pathetic.....Dom posted a question hours ago and Noel Gallagher was quoted as saying "Radiohead have been making the same music for the past 5 years".



Which is quite stupid seeing as Radiohead have only made one album in the past 5 years. Oasis have made the same album since 1994!

Evidently, they aren't regarded that way in the US. So far, they have had only one Top-10 hit and that was in 1996. They haven't been on the charts since.

Their not a great band! All their songs sound the same

P.S. Oasis has evolved. No, they haven't completely changed their sound, but they HAVE evolved. Show me a person who says Standing on the Shoulder of Giants sounds exactly the same as Definitely Maybe and I'll show you a dirty ******* liar.

My Song please tell me if good!?



I wrote a song that's similar to Taylor Swift's Love Story. Same tune, but shortened. It is based on a real life experience.
(first verse)
We were at school when I first saw you
I closed my eyes and the flashback started
I'm sitting there, in the courtyard thru autumn air
See that girl see her hair and her ball gown
You look at her then she leaves
Your sitting all alone, little did I know
That you were Romeo you were hanging on
But your crush said "Stay away from Juliet"
And now I'm crying on my stair case begging you please don't go
And I said
(chorus before key change)
"Romeo, love me. I've been feeling so alone.
I'll be waiting. All that's left to do is run"
You ignored me, you didn't show me any love
I walked away, feeling good, feeling good cuz
(key change)
I had the right feeling that you wanted her instead
I thought of us but that was all in my head
How could I know if it was really worth it?
It's a love story, pretty please say
Yes
Please, say yes
And don't go, no, no
Once I loved you
But now I can't stand
You



What do you think? Be honest.

"It's in the way you..." song title?



Hey there,



I'm looking for the title of a song I heard over the PA at work. It's a female singer and the song is pretty mellow... slow and dim. I couldn't quite catch the lyrics as the PA system is pretty fuzzy at best, but the chorus goes a little something like "It's in the waaaaaay you...." something or other... I think one time she sings "It's in the way you come undone", but I couldn't find those lyrics online. I think she says 'endless slumber' at one point too... but that's basically all I remember of it.



I've no idea how old it is, but I've got the feeling it was only released in the last couple years.



If you can help that'd be great, I know I've been vague but I'd appreciate any suggestions. Cheers.

Heya I've just had a look through various song finder websites but know luck.  The problem is that there are lots of songs about the weekend and a lot of songs sung by men!  Any additional details would be welcome as there is very little to go on. What I would advise is that you listen out for it again and if you do hear it then try and find out th name but if that is not possible then try and get some more information or lryics.  Once you've done that I recommend that you ask this question giving more details.  Sorry I couldn't be of more use to you - I understand how frustrating it is when you hear a good song and you don't know what it is called.



Oh yeh, if you have a Sony Ericsson then you should had a feature called TrackID on your phone.  It is under the entertainment menu on my phone. Next time you hear the song I would really recommend you use that as it works really well. If, however you don't have a Sony Ericsson then sorry.

How bad are my seats at the Grand Ole Opry?



I am seeing The Killers at the Grand Ole Opry next January.  My seat is in section 10, row T.  I know this is at the back of the main floor and I've heard the balcony hangs over my section and the view is limited.  How bad is the view?  Will I be able to see?  It doesn't make sense that they would sell seats that don't allow you to see the stage.  Thanks for your help!

Diablo(original) by Counterstrike feat mantra & Phyke, Phantasm by Counterstrike, White light by Counterstrike, Cut you into little pieces by Counterstrike, The Lycan by AK1200, Dom & Roland, these are all drum & bass and if you prefer something more on the classical soundtrack side then I recommend Night of the wolf by Nox Arcana.  These are all available on Itunes.

I'm just starting to get in to her music, and I really like the songs Taboo and Come With Me. Can you recommend any other music of hers that's similar to either of these songs??

Does anyone think the "grunge" label was missused for most Seattle scene bands?



How could bands like Nirvana, Mother Love Bone, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden etc have been thrown in the same boat? No wonder Kurt took such offense at Pearl Jam being labeled grunge....because they wern't. Bleach had shades of grunge, but would anyone call Nevermind grunge? It sounds like pop punk with heavy metal influences to me.



Kurt himself said of Nirvana "All in all, I think we sound like The Knack and the Bay City Rollers being molested by Black Flag and Black Sabbath"

That's my point....Alice In Chains played metal. No seattle band I have heard that was labeled "grunge" sounds similar to me.



Don't ask me what grunge was....listen to Kurt in this interview. He explains it.



http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TwOBGZ3g...



I think ALL seattle bands from that era were unique, not just Nirvana. Mother Love Bone is my personal favourite from that era...they mixed glam rock Queen, T. Rex with metal and early grunge.



How could Nirvana invent "grunge" when Green River were playing it in 1984? It just didn't become commercial until 1991.

I agree. The majority of bands labeled "grunge" were far from it.



and I agree with Kurt. That's basically what they sound like. XD

Any band with influences like Black Flag is obviously amazing.

Agreed my friend, they just threw a whole bunch of bands into the same label because they all came from the same scene, so they assumed they played the same music? It's like Fallout Boy being labeled with MCR etc, because Pete Wentz wears eyeliner that means they make the same music???? Jesus.

I can't disagree with you on that. The Seattle based bands were commonly refered to that out of sheer ignorance. Nirvana started a fuore which put Seattle on the map (people had obviously never heard of Jimi) and needed to group it. I was never really a fan of those bands. I like Nevermind but I agree, is that really grunge?



Early 1990's were my college days and the UK Indie scene was in full swing. I was still rocking out to 'tallica's Black and the new Pantera sound but I was also chilling to The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and digging it with The Mock Turtles.



Sorry I can't add more.



PS. I actually heard R.E.M. refered to as Grunge in '91 *That was in regard to the Out Of Time album ie.Losing My Religion, Maybe that's what inspired them to totally reinvent with Monster in '94.



Just thought I'd share that.

Then, what exactly WAS grunge right?
I think it was just a label for the style of that era, not really the music. They probably just said everything was grunge. just how people called everything punk.
EDIT: I totally agree with how Amy said Nirvana was different. It was totally unique. I don't think it really fit a label and Kurt kind of got that too.

In my opinion "grunge" is just a name given to good music so they can push it in magazines then pull it off the shelves later for the next new thing.

Good Thoughts Michael



I think a lot of different bands are mis-genred especially in Metal, yeah it seems if there is a Booming Genre in a certain time and new bands are coming out in that same time they sometimes get unfairly Genred or Categorized in that certain booming genre. I agree about PJ I mean they had maybe a couple of "Grunge" overtones but they certainly deviated from the average "Grunge" Norm so did a another "Grunge" band in that time called The Gits and Mia Zapata who was unfortunately Murdered they were labeled as Grunge and they were a long the lines of Pear Jam but she died before coming up from the Seattle Underground.



EDIT:



Nirvana was a new sound and I read a few times where Kirt called it POST-PUNK, yep a few times he called the movement POST PUNK

I agree! I don't think any of them really sound alike! I especially think Nirvana's sound was way different from the others, but they were all pretty different from each other!



edit: I also think they were all unique.  I think, though, that as far as if you were to sit down and listen to all of them, Nirvana sounded the least like the others, for one thing, I think that Nirvana seemed to have more punk influences, whereas the in the others I heard more heavy metal influences.  But, no doubt, they were all very unique and I'm a fan of all of them, (Pearl Jam less than the others, but they are ok)



and your right Nirvana definitely did NOT invent grunge! They just brought it to the mainstream...anyone should know that, especially someone claiming to be a Nirvana fan!

There is a song called Say This Sooner by the Christian rock group The Almost.  Here are the lyrics:



Oh Oh Oh
I can't believe I didn't say this sooner
I'll just believe that I was all displaced
I'll get to speaking, let you know how I feel
I'll get to judging, make you see my appeal
Oh Oh Oh



No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not



This makes me feel that I'll never be quite normal
This makes me act like I'll never get out alive
I'll get to acting, make you all believe me
I'll get to faking, show you all how to grieve
Oh Oh Oh



No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not



In and out is where it gets back to the place
It does make me feel like I just wanna be
Just like it's touch



No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All your friends think that you're gone
But you swear, I swear I'm not



No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not

Although digital pianos are getting better and better at replicating the action and sound of an acoustic piano, most would agree that nothing beats the quality of tone, projection and touch of a real piano.  Lacking vibrations, they can feel quite 'dead'.



However, these instruments do certainly have advantages; they can be played using headphones, never need tuning and are much more portable. You can also connect them to your computer and use sequencing and notation software.



It is also imposrtant to note that digital pianos can hard hard to sell on at a later date because when technology advances, they go out of date, so they are not a good investment.



In conclusions, if you want to learn the piano properly  definately go for an acoustic, nothing beats it.  (Try to get a good one and avoid buy on the internet)



Digital pianos are a great option if it is not possible to have the 'real thing'.

Depends on what you want to contact them about. If it's about general stuff (questions, comments, job inquiries, etc.) then they should have  a contact link somewhere in their website (maybe on a cd itself somewhere) where you can send an e-mail, maybe a mailing address or a phone number.



Although, if you're inquiring about getting signed, most larger labels have a no solicitation policy unless you go through one of their scouts or through an agent or some representative.

Hi Master. Hows it goin buddy?
I have a friend who used to play in a Misfits cover band every Halloween. It was one of his favorite projects, but that was when he was up north. Actually this year he ended up in a Devo cover band.



Anyhoo. For the occasion my selection will be my favorite Misfits track, London Dungeon. Good call, I think I'll probably give the Misfits some air time today.

What do you think of the new Linkin Park in comparison to the old Linkin Park?



In my opinion, their older music wipes clean their newer music, hands down.



But that's just me. Some of their new stuff is pretty good but not pretty good to my LP standards; pretty good to today's standards in general. And for me, that doesn't cut it. And aside from "Shadow of the Day", none of their songs have really reached out to me.

Okay I'd have to say their older music is the best. Totally so and its what I first heard of them so when I think LP I think of that era in their life. I totally understand why they changed. They've been playing that sort of music for like 10 years, thats enough to bore anyone so they wanted change.



In the end I will always hope they try resurrect some of their older sounds in any upcoming albums but I do respect some of the new songs (Shadow, In Pieces, Valentine's Day). I don't hate their new stuff (I just don't like it too much), its just a really different sound and I think that upset a lot of us fans. If they could make less angry songs but with rhythm and more melody (like Easier To Run), then I'd be totally happy.

I think that he is brilliant. There are people that criticize his playing as being sloppy or muddled and I just don't by that. I say that he is passionate and rooted in the blues... I will take players like Jimmy Page and Neil Young over the clean and sterile notes of Eric Clapton or Joe Satriani any day. Before Zeppelin, Before the Yardbirds, Jimmy was the busiest and most sought after studio musician in London... trust me, Jimmy Page could play it however you wanted him too. Sure his studio prowess is acknowledged but I can't think of anyone that is responsible for more classic riffs, grooves, and solos than JImmy Page... The world is full of great players and Jimmy Page takes a back seat to no one in my opinion. From the Rain Song to Ten Years Gone, from Stairway to Heaven to Achilles Last Stand... from Kashmir to Since I've Been Loving You, from Dazed and Confused to The Battle of Evermore..... and so many countless others... breathtakingly prolific... as Jimmy would say "The Light and the Shade".

Jimmy Page is extremely creative.  His melodies triads and chord structures are extremely advanced.  From a theory standpoint, even Zepps simple song "Kashmir" is so far ahead of it's time it makes him one of the truly unique guitarists of our time........however, live, he was often so sloppy in his playing, it's sometimes un listenable.  He often tried to play too fast and slurred his notes.



Page was a genious creatively, but when you compare him to a Mark Portnoy, or Robert Fripp, even an Ed Van Halen, he just didn't take his Genius on stage with him.



He is a bit of a dichotomy.  A genious, but a dichotomy.

I'm not going to pretend he was perfect. I'm certainly no expert at guitars, but I know and admit he was not the most technically profficient guitarist of all time (not saying he was bad, though... at all). However, I think he makes up for this in several ways. Like you said, he was a great producer and could write some pretty amazing riffs. But those things aside, the reason he is my favorite guitarist is not necessarily his skill but the way he makes me feel... it's all the feeling and emotion in the blues mixed with even more power and mystery, and I can't get enough of it. You can play cleaner than Jimmy Page and still not sound as good to me because of what he puts into the music, and I think this is even more noticeable live. So although he didn't play everything perfectly, that was never the point... he had a passion I can hear and relate to (which you can't always get with perfection), and that is what I love about his playing.

he wrote some good songs back in his day and an average lead player at tops

I think he's a damn good guitarist. Not the best, but definitely in the top 5. I mean, how can anyone listen to Led Zeppelin and tell me he's not a great guitarist? I personally think Since I've Been Loving You, Dazed and Confused, Heartbreaker, and You Shook Me (Live) are some of his best pieces of work. And of course we can't forget Stairway to Heaven.
I definitely think Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton knew what they were doing when they recruited Jimmy to be in the Yardbirds.

I like him as a guitarist. I would never say that he is .. how do I say this, uhm ... recognizable. As for an example, when you hear Carlos Santana or Hendrix playing a riff, you automatically know it's them. I don't know if I can say that for Page.



Though, he is incredible. I love Zeppelin live! I like him live better than studio. More blues and much more of a feeling. He was also fantastic in The Yardbirds.

Echoing what some have already said- among long time guitar players, it's common knowledge he's a fairly sloppy player. Page's real strength, though is his *creativity*. THAT'S where he  excelled over many of his peers. I mean, like Zepp or not, you have to've been living under a ROCK to Not have heard the main riffs from "Black Dog", "Kashmir" & or course, "Stairway" itself. The man helped write some of The Most memorable & durable rock songs ever made.

One of the best guitar players to ever live.  Jimmy Page is amazing and incredibly talented.  I rate his skill and him as a musician a 10+.  Page is a genius and brilliant.  He has immense talent and is a God at the guitar.

He was good both electric and acoustic. Always very melodic in what he played. I really like his use of alternate tunings. He has more skills than I'll ever have, and is easily my biggest influence...

There was a song, I believe by monster magnet with a lot of numbers in the lyrics.  Mostly ones and zeroes, I believe.  I can't find a reference to it online, andI tried searching lyrics, but all I get are web URL's with postings numbered 11011011 and such.  Can anyone help me identify the song?

Do you ever like to pretend to Rap  ?



Sometimes when I am at home alone or with my young child are start just rapping simple things.  Its really silly.  It usually happens when I feel motivated about something.  I pretend to either be rapping like Bone Thugs N Harmony or even Eminem.  I think its kind of funny and people would be surprised I think that I do this.



Is this normal for a guy who lives in the country?



Do you ever start just saying things or rapping when you have a good feeling about something?  Thanks.

"Human" by Human League -- they did that song "Don't You Want Me" too.



I'm almost 100% sure that's it. They sound a bit like Spadau Ballet, and I'm guessing that when you heard "I need a new love" it was actually "I'm only human", but as you said the sound was probably bad.



Also, when you heard "more than make mistakes" it was actually "Born to make mistakes". I've heard that song many times and it's catchy, when I read your lines it just clicked in my mind.

YES!. Thanks, now my mind can rest in peace. Like i said earlier it was so hard to tell what they were saying but it was a good enough hook to my ears.

Well, depends on what style of rock, but generally if you are going for pure classic rock chords I, IV and V are sufficient, as well as their sevenths. For instance you could have the following progression:



I - IV7 - I - IV7 - V- IV - I



Using guitar chords for example:



A - D7 - A - D7 - E - D7 - A

The Christmas Song.... John Lennon did it and then Celine Dion did it again a few years ago.  Starts out "So this is Christmas...



"



Ave Maria is always awesome.



But, my favorite song ever is "The Prayer" sung by Andres Bocelli, and it could be a Christmas song.  (Celine Dion did it on that same Christmas album that The Christmas Song is on.



Bocelli's version is much better.)



Any of those three would be fabulous with an ice dance.

Jason Michael Carroll



Baby when I look at you with your hair fallin' down and your baby blues



Standing there across the room I get so lost in the way you move



It makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like this



Teary eyed as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man



So many have come so many things have gone



one thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong



{Chorus}



Baby just look at us all this time and we're still in love



Something like this just don't exist



Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess



People said it would never work out



Living our dreams has shattered all doubts



It feels good to prove 'em wrong



Living our love song



Oh darling would you look at me



With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees

You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars



Girl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are



I just want to lay you down



Say I love you without a sound



I think you know what I'm talking about

Shred I expect a long answer from you.



Yeah but you guys are just talking about speed...since when does speed make a guitarist better?



Great answer Chris....i could never get into Malmsteens playing, maybe it's because i'm not a guitar player myself and can't appreciate his techincal abilities....I prefer listening to a guitarist play interesting riffs, melodies and guitar lines.

I have to go with Ritchie Blackmore. Malmsteen is technically proficient and fast as all get out but to me at least, listening to him gets old really quickly. I find his playing to be limited and he has almost tunnel vision in terms of playing the same things over and over in search of perfection... Blackmore gave us Deep Purple, Rainbow, and even in Blackmore's Night he is expanding on his gift... I just don't find Yngwie's music inviting... I think I still have a copy of Rising Force around here somewhere.....

Well Blackmore is one of the innovators of "Shred" guitar along with Uli Roth in Rock music and Blackmore a huge inspiration and influence on Malmsteen so I have to pay respects to the Innovator



Blackmore is my choice



EDIT: you know M? I really enjoy listening to both players music just about the same too. I mean Yngwie is far more technical for sure but Blackmore is also epic in his own way

When it comes to memorable riffs, not just diarrhea of the fingers, Blackmore is king.
Yes, Malmsteen is fast, but I like a tasteful player as well.
Riffs:  My Woman from Tokyo; Smoke on the Water; Burn; Stormbringer; Space Truckin; Highway Star; Hush; High Ball Shooter: Man on the Silver Mountain, the list goes on.
Ok, now name a great riff song from Malmsteen.



Both players are undeniably superior, but I just like Blackmore's style more.  When you have two players of this caliber, it comes down to preference.



Cheers!

Well, Malmsteen seems to build ALL of his songs on speed.  When you do that, it seems to get boring and, in fact, Malmsteen's newer stuff really bores me, though I like his older stuff quite a bit (what I've heard of it).  I mean, sure--speed is impressive, but, in rock especially, it gets boring.  I find it more interesting to hear guys like Brad Paisley play with a lot of speed (he's country, in case you don't know--check him out though...he's an outstanding guitarist).



Ritchie Blackmore, with Rainbow, was great.  The only album I have with Blackmore on it is a compilation of songs by Rainbow and he was a great guitarist.



Honestly, I'd have to say that Blackmore is better.  Of course, Malmsteen is faster and drunker.  In fact, I once heard that his crew that would set stuff up (maybe even other band members) would urinate in Malmsteen's drinks because he was a scumbag.  I've also heard that he didn't realize that because he was always drunk.

Love the question Michael. It makes such a change to see something championing Richie Blackmore. He always seems to be the nearly man in these polls so kudos for bringing him into the limelight.



I think you can tell by now, I'm a fan of Richie's. I particularly like his DP eras but Rainbow are pretty good. I've only got the Jeff Scott Soto Rainbow albums which 1980 to the split in '84. Richie plays phenomenally well though.



Jeff Scott Soto is a nice transition to bring us back to Yngwie J. Malmsteen. I'm afraid, the rather dull thing is, although I recognise Yngwie's contribution and playing expertise (no one can deny him that) I'm just not into that whole Classical Metal structure of the Rock genre. I do have one of his Greatest Hits albums but it very rarely gets a play.



The answer - Richie all the way.

This question is pretty interesting, the comparison is weird, and will mostly be opinion.
Yngwie clearly has more skill. He has done so many great things that make him so much better than Richie.



Comparing the bands tho... Rainbow, Deep Purple vs. Alcatrazz and an Amazing Solo Career.
Yngwie is at a level so far above Richie, his skills kill anything Deep Purple or Rainbow have done, the only thing Richie has is original songs with Dio

I love both but I gotta give it up to Yngwie. I've tried playing a guitar with scalloped frets before and it kicked my ***. The sheer speed he can play one and not make his notes go sharp is just phenomenal.



Well, it's hard to have a Q about Yngwie and not talk about speed.. It's what he's known for. Also, I don't think Ritchie could play a scalloped guitar as proficiently as Yngwie, which is my reason Yngwie is better.

Wow I missed this question.



its alternate picking that's it simple as that if you can play the rest the song you should surely know this with all do respect. in fact watch him do it. he uses a series of up and down strokes in 8th and 16th notes.

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace ?



i got a question for the ladies.



do you listen to any female rap artists? cause i know of  a lot but i just haven't heard much of their music. i think the only female artists i have on my MP3 player are Shawnna "Gettin' Some" and Foxy Brown feat. Jay-Z "I'll Be". so i want to know if you can reccomend me some good female artists. and post a link or two to some of your favorite songs by them.



</question>



<additional details>



i directed this question more towards the ladies cause as a guy, i find myself listening to mostly male artists. but if some of the guys out there know some good female artists feel free to answer

Best band??????????do u agree with me????



ok i will name a couple of bands and try to describe them.



guns n roses- obnoxious lead singer, cocky guitar player, good lyrics and ok music



metallica- very aggressive and talented, know how to play instruments, lyrics have never been that different or unique, too many solos, but overall from 1 to 100 i give them a 90.



black sabbath- pretty much created metal so metal bands better kiss their *** e s, lyrics were incredible, very talented band, but got a little boring sometimes, way too many albums



led zeppelin- the reason why axl rose sounds the way he does, jimmy page was just a little overrated, they have one of the best drummers ever, lead singer was good, they created a cool sound, lyrics were brilliant and sometimes not half bad, from 1 to 100 talentwise i have to give them a 98



motley crue- they are very talented, i never liked their singer and think he is annoying, never were able to finish a great song well, from 1 to 100 i give them a 77.



pearl jam- they got too soft as a grunge band with keyboard and piano's, lyrics were ok, singer was really good, but overall a 86.



stone temple pilots- lead singer was great, i think that they might be on top for one of the best grunge bands, their music just resembled grunge so well, 92.



Nirvana- well the lead singer was a great singer who wrote in my opinion the greatest lyrics ever! for a 3 man band to sound the way they did i'm sorry but hands down i think they have a 100



alice in chains- probablly the most talented singer from the grunge era layne staley, the band was very very talented, they have many great hits and they get a 95 from the gunge era



soundgarden- oh my this could be one of the greatest singers ever too, chris cornell and the lyrics were fantastic! the songs were mostly classics and i give them a 100! with Nirvana



rolling stones- very very talented but their hit songs were mainly the great ones. overall a 99. really great band



kiss- different in looks obviously. lyrics weren't ever so great they were mostly about partying. really just classic rock stuff. maybe we need a song sometimes that is deep. but overall i mean it's kiss! 98.



the beatles- kiss the ground they walk on the masters and creators of rock. their riffs actually were talented and the lyrics were pretty cool because they were sometimes deep and sometimes the i don't care feeling. 100!



the doors- talented men and a great band. lyrics weren't half bad, 96.



the ramones- the singer never did it for me. but they are in a way creators of punk



greenday- one of the most unique punk bands, very great and probablly the closest any band of the new age has come to a modern day nirvana. one day they will definetly be in the hall of fame



aerosmith- ok the lyrics weren't ever so deep except in sing for the moment. he made many songs that could be remembered forever and one of the gods in rock n roll. 99.



queen- one of their two songs are known all over the world and they are magnificent. 99



marilyn manson- always stuck out of the crowd, wasn't afraid to write his real feelings on paper. talented band, inspired by black sabbath and very cool band. 98



AC DC- angus young probablly the best guitar god in the world! lyrics were NEVER deep feelings just partying so that's why i thought it was ok with the lyrics. not out of this world. unique singer, overall i have to do this, 100



pink floyd- unique spacy band with one of the best lyrcs of all time. i definetly give them a 99. always loved them and they are gods



jimmie hendrix- GOD!!!!!!!!!! lyrics insane! best guitarist maybe!!!!!!!!!!100!



iron maiden- cool metal band but never loved the singer. i thought in a way a black sabbath impersonator of a band. but 97



zz top- oh man very talented guitarist. lyrics were like country lyrics and you gotta love the beards. 97



van halen- one of the gods with awesome lyrics and they just motivate you. very talented too. 98



the who- one of the other creators, very great sound and so deep sometimes with talent! 99.



bon jovi- oh well one of the most talented rock star like men ever! classic songs and so awesome with lyrics. great man.



lynard skynard- cool lyrics and great vibe and one of the most talented bands around ever



U2- VERY unique and deep and the lyrics were always so awesome. i love this band



so in your opinion  who is the best of all time????????

Well I love this question and the time you took on it really good in depth ratings of some great bands. Although you are missing some great musicians I love the ALLMAN BROTHERS-100, Eric Clapton, and one of the best guitar players of all time STEVIE RAY VAUGHN.  As for picking the best of all time, each of them are the best at certain times it just depends on when I catch them and how their music is speaking to my emotions at that time. I think you might have underestimated Eddie Vedder and Pearl JAM.  I saw them at Bonnaroo this year best live show ever.  Really talented band and Eddie is just beyond words.  Great question bud I like your style.

I completely and utterly disagree with you about your comments about Zeppelin. If Elvis is the King of rock and roll, these guys are the gods of rock and roll. Bonham, while dead, is STILL the best drummer, EVER. And Jimmy Page is NOT over rated. Just about all heavy metal rock bands can trace their roots back to Zeppelin.

Could someone help me with this song title/artist?



I'm sorry but this probably won't make much sense. I am trying to find the song title/artist name of a scratchy voiced reggae singer. All I can get from the song is the hook, and I'm sure my cadence will be off, but it is something similar to Bom Bom ba Bom Bom (repeated multiple times). Any help would be great, thanks

String breaking - help?



I have a problem - i use 10-46 strings on my ibanez electric guitar (its a GRG), and i seem to break the low E string again and again - I tune it down to C# or C very often, and palm mute often as well, and each time ive broken the string, i was palm muting. I dont apply much pressure but still... a with a life of just one week, its getting costly... thanks in advance.

Where is it breaking? That will tell you whther the problem is at the nut or the bridge. May just need a little graphite lubrication.

When you tune it down it makes the string looser, so there's a good chance it's rubbing against something, perhaps the nut, which eventually causes it to break. You might also need to adjust the bridge.



Hope you can solve it! I hate breaking strings . . . :-)

Is the band Rehab made by the same two guys as ICP?



After listening to the song "Sitting at a bar"  by the band Rehab I'm wondering if they were previously Insane Clown Posse??  Can anyone tell me?  or show me a link to a web site that proves it?



</question>



<additional details>



Listen to the voices tho.  Both the guys in sitting at a bar sound exactly like Insane Clown Posse.  If it's not them then it's a strange coincidence.

Slipknot basically fits under the same genre as Nightwish and all of those other nu-metal bands I don't care to learn the names of. It has metal elements to it, but it's definitely nothing like traditional metal.

They are Nu Metal... so I guess they are metal in a way, but they're not because http://www.metal-archives.com does not include them, that is the metal Bible! If some band is not on there they are either underground or not real metal. Since Slipknot is mainstream and not on MA, that means they are not really metal.

No.  They are Nieu-metal or cartoon metal or bubblegum metal or faux-metal or suck metal.  Plain and simple, they are watered down enough for the mainstream and that's not even close to what metal's all about.  Costumes and masks are pretty gay too.

As i am more into extreme elements of metal.  I believe that there S/T and Iowa had some thrash and death elements to their sound.  Joey toured with Satyricon and Mick  plays in death metal side bands. But Vol 3 was stone sour part 2 and All Hope is a bland and generic cd.  So at one time they were somewhat of a metal band but now there is need for them to call it a day.

I'm pretty certain it is an early 90's song. It is sung by a guy. The chorus goes on to talking about how all his friends are gone. Sorry to be so vague but when I heard the song there was a ton of noise.

Looking for a song. Easy 10 points!!!?



I'm looking for this song but I don't have much to work with. It's a ballad by a girl, a slow and beautiful song, and sounds like it's probably a 90s song. The only lyrics I remember is part of  the last two lines of the chorus. The first line starts out I want a man something something, or I need a man something something, or I just need a man, or I just want a man. Then the second starts out Baby and that's when she gets real high. I remember one of the lines ends with want to understand or want you to understand. I can't remember. But if you can give me the name or singer of this song I will be your best friend!!!

Err- Is this a love song or a complaint about some-one wearing dirty clothes? I have been writing songs since I was 8- and many of them have been used. Good luck with writing- but I think maybe you should start with a basic poem so you get the idea of songs first.  Then- If you're wanting to write a love song. Let your emotions write. Make them fly across the page. If you want the song to be sad- then make us cry. If you want it to be happy- make us laugh. Over exaggerate things and give it all your emotions.

What is the name of this song?



its a pop ballad sung in french in the 1950s/60s/70s basically sometime not in this or the past decade i think
there's a man singing or rather yet, talking in a rather monotonous way "Monaco.. je sius" blah blah in the song
then it cuts to a bunch of women going ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhh in a soothing slow "romantic" type way (not in the yelling way that is) and then the woman sings something in french after
and it cuts back between those two back and forth
the only lyrics i know is "Monaco" and that it is sung in french
can anybody help?
cheers!

sorry
as i said, the only lyrics i ever hear is the man saying "monaco" in a rather "manly" monotonous way

Monaco [ˈmɑnəkoʊ] (help·info), officially the Principality of Monaco (French: Principauté de Monaco; Monégasque: Principatu de Múnegu; Italian: Principato di Monaco; Occitan: Principat de Mónegue) is a small sovereign city-state located in Western Europe. The territory lies on the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and is completely enclosed by France. Monaco is often regarded as a tax haven, and many of its inhabitants are wealthy and from foreign countries, making up a majority of 84%.[3]
Monaco is a Constitutional Monarchy and Principality with Prince Albert II as head of state. The Grimaldi family has ruled over Monaco since 1297 and the state's sovereignty was officially recognized by the Franco-Monegasque Treaty of 1861. Despite being independent, Monaco’s defense is still the responsibility of France.
Monaco is the world’s most densely populated sovereign country, and the world's smallest French-speaking country.

Without more information it's kind of hard to figure it out... why don't you try to replace the "blah blah" with more lyrics? I'll try if you can give me more lyrics (what it sounds like will work fine!)

Rap first emerged like in 1984. So when people refer to old school it means a song from back in the old days of rap. I think the best period for rap music was the 1988-1996 era. Here are some of my favorite old school artists:



Public Enemy
Run DMC
KRS One
NWA
Naughty by Nature
Wu-Tang Clan
A Tribe Called Quest

Why would rappers have to compete in something like this? West vs East. There are and were many talented western rappers and there are and were many good eastern rappers. But western rap and eastern rap differ so much from each other. Hard to say which one has been better.

Turn off the Ipod,Turn off the radio,and Turn off the videos.Get your *** out to concerts and generally the smaller the venue the better.I've seen awesome new bands and older bands at concerts that would blow you away.Especially over 21 bars and clubs.That is where the REAL music is.Example?...These guys have been around but at the last Dwarves concert I went to when the band came onstage the audience threw beer bottles and drinks at them and they just threw them right back.It was crowd interaction and is normal when they play.When the security gal came onstage to move a fan away the singer picked her up by her thong underwear and pushed her off the stage."He who cannot be named"(their guitarist) plays naked and was laying in a pool of beer.The music was AWESOME and when I left the concert the building was surrounded by police expecting a riot.I could name more examples of other concerts but I've used up enough space already and I hope you get the point anyway.

No - You are very wrong!



You class "modern rock" as what you hear in the charts. When you think that the charts are arranged in order of single sales it changes things!



Biggest age group to buy singles in about 12 and 13 year old girls, that means our charts is just full of pish!



Good rock bands are out there - Its just that you are not looking for them! Actually try and you might find music you will enjoy - i knwo i do!

Oh my gosh, you are so right. I keep saying that the bands of the last 10 years are agonizing to my ears. Unfortunately I have to listen to some of these bands, because people I hang out with are nit-wits that think they are cool (and these people aren't even young; I know I need to look for a new crowd lol). We need a generation of quality and hard work in music, not this crap that is weak and sick.

I don't think that this can be true across the board. Unfortunately though there's an element of truth to your opinion. As I have said before, it seems the entire world is destined to sell out. It just depends on whether or not we have the courage to get off Y!A and change this around, start the music revoloution we're crying out for.

FM radio stations have a very small range, so unless that station is in your city/town, it's doubtful that you'll be able to hear it.
That's why so many stations have an online presence - no limitation on range!
If you know that this station IS in your town, try tuning your radio to 99.9, 100.1, 100.3 or 100.5 fm.

I can't tell you baby what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago
I let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heart aches come and go and
All that's left are the words
I can't let go
If we take some time, think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really wanna go
Don't know what you got til it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back takes so long
I can't feel the things that cause you pain
I can't clear my heart of your love it falls like rain
Ain't the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul
I just can't take another day
Who's to blame
If we take some time, think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really wanna go
Don't know what you got til it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back takes so long
Do you wanna see me beggin' baby
Can't you give me just one more day
Can't you see my heart's been draggin' lately
I've been looking for the words to say
Ooooh
Don't know what you got til it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong, wrong, wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back takes so long
Don't know what you got til it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong, wrong, wrong
Now I know what I got
It's just this song

<answer>



You don't loosen the strings with the truss rod,
you loosen the strings with the tuning pegs.



the truss rod is meant to adjust the tension on the neck, and it can be VERY dangerous doing your own neck adjusting, without the proper training and tools.



I'm not saying you can't figure it out, but I have seen more people ruin their equipment, by trying to fix things they don't know how to fix.



Different basses adjust differently.



It's not hard to show you, but very difficult to explain it in an eMail



on MOST, (not all) basses, turning the rod clockwise, will tighten the neck, the question is just how far, and that we can't explain here.
It's something that you learn.



First, you have to determine what the problem is, and it's NOT always the neck that needs the work.



If your string are too low, and buzz on the fretboard,



it might the nut is cut wrong,



the bridge may need raising,



the pickups might be too high,



you may have a couple of high frets
or the neck may have a backbow.



If the strings are too high, most of the above is still true,
the nut may not be cut correctly (need special files)
the bridge may need lowering.
The may have a bow in it, and need tightening.



No way of knowing which, without seeing it.



Some adjust at the top of the headstock
some adjust at the bottom of the neck
some use a screwdriver,



some use a special wrench,



Some use an allen wrench
Firt you have to determine where the problem is, then you have to figure out how to fix it,



too many things can go wrong,



bring it in to a guitar tech, most will adjust a neck for $10-20,
which is better than ruining your own bass



Have him explain it for you

The good olde Shure 58 is a standard for a reason...it's rugged, relatively difficult to feedback, has a response curve that helps the human voice cut through the other instruments, and won't break the bank.



I you are recording vocals or doing TV work, there are a raft of choices, but for your use, that's my recommendation.

Ok, somethings you have to consider first. Unless you just want to spend 300 dollars for a good mic you don't have to. You need to figure out what kind of mic you want. Meaning dynamic or condenser are usually live stage mics, dynamic more so than condenser but that is changing. A dynamic mic requires no power. A condenser mic requires power from your PA board. Its called phantom power its 48v (volts). Just about every PA board manufactured has it built in, so it shouldn't be a problem. A dynamic mic will be less sensitive than the condenser, but stage condensers are not as sensitive as studio condensers. The most common/standard dynamic stage mic thats been around forever in a Shure SM58 or SM57. They run about 100 dollars and do the job nicely and are just about indestructible. There are so many mics to choose from it can be overwhelming. Try going to www.musiciansfriend.com and look at the vocal mics. read the reviews of what people are saying, that will help you decide also. You can even specify your price range.

Probably either 'Love Is Dead' or maybe their German single 'Sex'. It's a soft song, but there are drums near the middle of the song.

Why don't bands change their names when a member  leaves/dies?



Hello.  Let me start - I love Queen.  They just put out an album - The Cosmos rock.  Taking over for Freddie is Paul Rodgers.  Zepplin are reforming w/ (rumoured) Steve Tyler.  Axl Rose calls his band, w/ no orignal members but him, Guns N Roses.



So Question time folks, or your opion,  Should bands keep their origanl names when a band member leaves/dies/gives up (thinking of Pink Floyd and poor ol' Syd Barrett)?



For a band like Queen - couldn't they call themselves Smile - since Taylor and May formed that band before Queen - and since they are the only two members from the Queen line up?



Whatcha think?

i agree i think they shoudl change there name when that happens
but so many people like them



if they keep the name they keep all the good stuff that goes with it
and they still have all the fans of there older stuff even if theydidn't like there new stuff.. whereas if they didnt like there new stuff.. they wouldnt listen to them and the band wouldnt be as well known.. if you get what i mean.

Yep-understood.  I agree w/ most of ya - they have to keep the name so the fans will flock to their shows and buy their releases.

I agree...especially with Queen, GnR and Led Zeppelin. I guess the reason they dont do it is



1.They plan on performing their past material and thay want the band name to still be associated with those songs
2.Name recognition People will buy tickets and cds if its from a band they have known, regardless of who the members are.It eliminates a lot of marketing to promote the new band and to get their new name out there

I think if one, maybe even two, members leave it's fine to keep the same name. The band still has a good amount of original members. For example, Jefferson Airplane could have stayed Jefferson Airplane after the first two left, in my opinion. And Pink Floyd was also fine staying Pink Floyd. But the new Guns N Roses and Queen should have different names.

I agree with the Queen and Guns n roses ones because in my opinion the Lead singer is the most important member, because when you hear that voice, you know what band it is. That's the case with Queen.
But GNR has only one original member, so they should change their name.

Well i think it is respectful if someone dies to change the band name, for instance my Brother died, he was the guitarist in a band called Sore Eyes for Sight. After he died they changed the name to As it withers away..they broke up anyway..but i do think it is misleadin to keep the original name!

Kind of like AIC with no Layne Staley. Kiss without Peter and Ace.  And Zepplin without  Plant in which i think Robert lost his damn mind that he keeps wanting to tour with Allison Krauss.  It makes no sense and i agree they should change their names.

It would confuse the hell out of the fans if bands did that. Take Iron Maiden for example. It took them four albums to get a stable line-up together. That would mean four different band names just for the first four albums.

oh and don't forget Jerry Cantrell reforming Alice In Chains and Journey w/ the Filipino guy



part of it (I believe) is that people recognize the name, so they will be recognizeable and can/will sell records.........as long as there are some of the major components to the band remaining (i.e. a distinctive sound, important member) people will see the band



May was a big contributer to Queen, besides Freddie he was the most recognizeable member



The same thing with The Who.....the voice (Daltrey) and the creativity (Townsend) are still there so people will do see them

some do...when Jerry Garcia (one of two people for whom a Ben & Jerry's flavour named) died, The Grateful Dead dropped "Grateful" from the name and now perform (occasionally) as The Dead....also, Bob Weir has a separate band called "Rat Dog"



also, over the years, "Jefferson Airplane" became "Jefferson Starship" and then just "Starship"



but if the band is substantially the same and plays the same kind of music, then why can't they keep the name....since, by your argument, The Beatles would have had to change their name when Pete Best died and Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr) became their drummer.
(incidentally, The Beatles is at least the third name they went by, having previously been "The Quarrymen" and "The Silver Beetles" before they really took off and became well known as The Beatles

I feel like my world is crashing down without you. I know that I never could go on without you. Where did your wings take you this time? So far away from me. You...Runaway to escape but Ive been dying to tell you that? When you come home, I'll be waiting for you with open arms. I'd do anything to wake up in your arms. I don't seem to understand why every time that you are near. I keep feeling like I'm farther from you.I'll take your wings so that you'll come back down to me.

Inspired by Snickerz, Let's compare the East Coast and West Coast artists?



Anyone can make a statement, like "East Coast over West Coast" or "West Coast over East Coast", but the only way to logically compare is to compare artists



KRS-One vs Tupac
50 Cent vs Eazy-E
Slick Rick vs Dr Dre
Nas vs Ice Cube
Kool G Rap vs Warren G
Jay-Z vs Xzibit
AZ vs The Game
Big L vs Too Short
Puff Daddy vs Ice-T
Biggie vs Coolio
Big Pun vs Snoop Dogg
De La Soul vs N.W.A



I think it's obvious who's better



</question>



<additional details>



Tahir: Are you implying that I said something along those lines?



Can people stop making their own ones up and answer the original question. I didn't state any of them were similar, they do have different styles. But who has the best style?

All is fair in love and hip hop...and to be honest with you the Dre/Slick Rick comparison didn't work for me as Slick Rick hasn't produced and Dre isn't really an emcee...Kool G. Rap would murk Warren G in the way of rhyming but wouldn't know what to do on the boards and Coolio is no match for Biggie...what you done was't clear or correct IMO...



Edit: but to answer your question... KRS would tear Pac a new one (and don't get me wrong I dig Pac but he's no GOd emcee)
50 would kill Eazy as (I guess people forget this well know fact) Eazy didn't and couldn't write ryhmes...
Slick would weave words around Dre for tha same reason (he's a PRODUCER people! when are we gonna learn that)



Nas is a better emcee that Cube
Kool G would redrum Warren G
Jay -Z would do the same to the X man
AZ would end The Game
Big L and Short Dawg = no contest...for short that is
Ice over Puff every day
Big over Coolio...everyday
Pun over Snoop



and I would consider it a draw between N.W.A and De La so to do the tally for you...Can I get a drum roll please....

Even though I'm East Coast all the way, you kinda cheated with how you set these up so that you could systematically knock out certain west coasters to make the east coast's superior skills be obvious. That said, East Coast is way better...hahaha and if your this east coast biased check out Tim Dog he has a song called F*** Compton thats a diss on NWA thats hilarious...actually go for the video its even better he has a high top fade

And how did you come up with this "logical" way to pair up these artists with each other? In Hip Hop, it's not about which region is better or not. It's about the INDIVIDUAL ARTIST. Each region has their good artists and sh*tty artists.



I'm a Left-Coaster that enjoys Nas, Cool Breeze, Paul Wall, Common, Mac Dre and any other artist that sounds good to my ears.

I don't know why people get caught up comparing everything all the time.



West Coast hip-hop and East Coast hip-hop have different styles and that's why you shouldn't compare them..They are basically different genres to me, that's why you can have an album like The Chronic up there with Ready to Die..they are extremely different albums but it's about their reception by their respective audiences at the end of the day.



It's unfair to say "That West Coast album has sh*tty lyrics, that's not worthy of the lyricism the East Coast has".. because the styles are different..



EDIT: No, I'm just wondering why people compare music from these two places where styles are very different.

Ok You want to compare artists but why group them as you do maybe you need to rearrange them a bit:



KRS-One vs Tupac Maybe it should be Pac Vs. Nas or Pac Vs. Jay) Eitherway Pac is one of the greatest ever while KRS-One is a pioneer he is not as appealing to the same broad audience as Pac. Pac could legitimatley take down Jay or Nas.



50 Cent vs Eazy-E (This is a good pairing but Eazy is better then 50. His songs were about real issues and contained interesting wordplay. While he didn't write them we all know 50 doesn't write all of his lyrics either. Eazy also put the West Coast on the map and founded one of the most influential hip hop groups in history with NWA and launched the careers of Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and others. These guys launched the careers of: The game, Eminem, Xzibit, Snoop, Tha Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, Lynch Mobb, W.C. and Mack 10 among others.
Slick Rick vs Snoop Dogg, is a better pairing since they are similar. I'd say it's a wash but Snoop has outsold Rick and continues to be a influential force in hip-hop.



Nas vs Ice Cube. Is this one fair? Are Nas and Cube similar? Why pair them? Cube is great but not on the same level as Nas.



Kool G Rap vs Warren G Why bring Warren G into this? He made one album that was worth listening to. He was not a Pioneer. If we are shuffling Dre crushes Kool G. Xzibit is at least similar.



Jay-Z vs Xzibit. Not at all fair. Maybe Jay goes up against Snoop or Dre. Jay probably wins though.



AZ vs The Game. Why does AZ win? The Game is new and fresh and bringing the West Back. did AZ break any ground do anything worth talking about 10 years later? NOPE.



Big L vs Too Short. NO RAPPER COMPARES TO TOO SHORT. The guy has made records like you make dinner. Always grinding and being relevant. the guy fouded the Bay Area and was influential to Spice One, Tupac, Digital Underground, E-40 and so many others. Big L is famous for what? dying? Short wins.



Puff Daddy vs Ice-T ???? Diddy Vs. Dre is about the same comparision of Diddy Vs Eazy. Diddy built a powerful East Coast label launched the careers of many artists similarly to Dre and even Eazy. Diddy musically doesn't turn the knobs or write his own S**T so he's an executive type. Ice-T at least wrote his own lyrics for that he wins. Diddy Vs. Dre is a wash.



Biggie vs Coolio ????????? How does MF Coolio compare to Big? Big is the best and beats nearly everyone. To the East he is as Pac is to the West.



Big Pun vs Snoop Dogg. Possibly an interesting face off. Snoop howeveron the West is bigger then Pun. Maybe we should send E-40 after Pun. Maybe Xzibit or Warren G or Mack 10 or who cares.



De La Soul vs N.W.A ?? NWA is far more important to hip hop then De La Soul. Wu Tang Vs. NWA makes more sense and is much more similar. De La Soul is maybe our version of West Side Connection or Digital Underground.



I'll say this overall there are far more acts coming out of NY then the West Coast. That's fine the majority of music comes out of the east. The West is a unique place where not everything translates out to the east coast. Heck our projects are flat, have palm trees and it never rains or snows. Where would you rather live?

My axes are stock Gibson Les Paul DC, Fender Am Strat and I have a Cort LP copy with Duncan JB/Jazz pickups.

He played ESP Custom Strat and Peavey Wolfgang guitars. Dunlop 535 Wah Pedal, Boss CE-2 Chorus Pedal. Peavey 5150 II Head, Peavey Ultra Head,and 5150 cabinets. That may help you some.

Can it be any style of song?  i.e. instrumental vs. something with lyrics...  I've found the easiest way for me to write is to just sit down at my piano and start tinkering with chord progressions and run with anything that sounds good.  I write down all my bits and pieces, even if I can't seem to get them to work at the time, and refer back to them from time to time.

well, keep it simple first of all. i would limit the song to about 4-5 chords max. have 2 verses, 2 choruses, and intro, maybe a pre chorus, have a bridge, outro. im assuming, your writing like a song where you would play guitar, and sing, band situation/ solo acoustic, etc.
good luck!!!

Which Guitar Should i get?



i'm going to get a new guitar for my B-day today, and i've narrowed it down to these 2

http://i482.photobucket.com/albums/rr183...



i like the worn brown because everyone i know has a black guitar, and i like how it looks, it's different, clean earthy, i really like it.



the goth les paul is also awesome, i especially like the Roman numeral 12 on the 12th fret, and the black chrome is also cool



it's between these two, which should i get.

Although both guitars are stunning, pick the one that plays best for you especially for chording and soloing. The one guitar that feels comfortable in your hands is the one. You might like thick & clubby necks or you might like thin and narrow necks. It can vary.



My dream guitar: A Fender Custom Shop '69 Stratocaster w/ Kinman Pickups, rosewood fretboard w/ a matching headstock.

What was the name of this song featuring Lil Wayne?!? I really like it.?



Well, I was listening to a cd in my car, and then switched to the radio and heard this song that sounded cool. It was like technoish with a dood kinda singing (i think a white guy) for the chorus with that popish technoish beat and then Lil Wayne started rapping and yeah. I heard every song from the Carter III and that song inst in that album. The song sounds new. Anyone know it?

Maybe your strings are fucked up.
I had a similar problem on the twelvth fret and it was caused by the 13th fret being higher than the rest. Take it to a music shop the'll let you know.

make sure your truss rod is properly tensioned, and check that your frets are level- you'll probably need to take it in if you don't know ow to do this yourself. You could also simply try a heavier string guage- the extra tension will pull on the neck slightly, resulting in higher action.

you can either 1) adjust your truss rod (not ideal), or 2) adjust your A and G string saddles on the bridge.  just raise them by a 1/4 turn of the allen key.  failing that make sure they are clearing the pickups.



replace the strings if they are old.

<question>



What is the name of this song and who sang it?



Trying to find out who sang this song and it's title.



I think it's a young boy band --late 80s, early 90s---don't think it's PC Quest, but sounded a tad like them---sorta sounded like little girls ???, but the lyrics I know are:



We're walking alone thru our favorite places
Making traces of our precious lives(?)
Reliving good times that we had
Back when those days weren't so bad
But I have to go on alone.



***that was one of the verses...then the coda(?)  was something like:



I used to, I'd waited, for each brand new day
Cause I knew you'd be there by my side
Now I wake each morning
And my whole world is grey.....
&lt;there's one more line to complete this but i can't remember it!&gt;



Can anyone help??

Need name to a song that sounds like a charity song?



I heard this song the other day and have no idea what it is. It has a huge chorus with lots of people singing and it sounds like it is from the 80's, which makes me think that perhaps it was created for a charity. But I've searched and haven't been able to come up with anything. It's not 'We Are The World', or 'Do They Know It's Christmas?', but sounds very similar to the latter.

<answer>



Hmm, the only song that comes to mind is Just Stand Up, sung by many female artists like Beyonce, Rihanna, Fergie, Carrie Underwood ...ects.



I think it was played a charity concert kind of thing for cancer. Here's the music video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr5mvNPyV...

IRON MAIDEN!!
you cant compare TS with maiden.. maiden is metal and TS is more of like guns n roses.. but still iron maiden is one of the best concerts of my life, their stage is so amazing and tjeir lyrics and music are breathtaking.. one of my favorite songs by maiden is "age of innocence" wich is in the dance of death album.. you should listen to some maiden.. i strongly recommend the albums fear of the dark, powerslave, killers and seventh son of a seventh son



maiden is my favorite band :]



oh and NEVER EVER listen to virtual XI and the X factor from iron maiden
those 2 albums suck major butt!!!
because bruce left the band and blaze bayley replaced him but he sucks

Twisted Sister? What kind of a man are you? I carried an M-16! And you carry that sick, repulsive, electric twanger. (lol) But seriously though, Twisted Sister gave us kids in the 80's a great rock anthem, so I love them for that. They just don't have enough great songs like Iron Maiden. I never was really into Maiden, but I respect them for how talented they are. And they did contribute Eddie, which a lot of kids at my school would draw. They also stirred up controversy like some other bands by singing about the devil (aka Satan).

Most definitely Iron Maiden. Twisted Sister is very repetitive and gets boring. I personally think they have one good song and that one even gets on my nerves after one or two listens(We're Not Gonna Take It).

I'm part of a system plan



Do you ever feel like
there's something missing?
things you'll never understand
little white shadows that blink in the distance
part of a system plan



When all our fears are waking up
all the space they're taking up
I said I cannot hear you, you're breaking up



Ohhhh..

How can you possibly enjoy "good music" of the Beatles or any other genuine classic rock?



All the songs I hear from the beatles are in such a shitty audio quality that I would rather listen to a mainstream song today that everybody says is tasteless, just for the sake of good audio quality. How can people still enjoy such sh*t recording quality in the 60s? (i'm talking about the studio recording, not the quality of the music itself)

Well let me put in my input,You suck. Your not a real rock n roll fan if you can't handle any of the Beatles recordings.You have to go "Mainstream". Classic rock is a real rock n rollers music not some of this bull sh*t so called Mainstream,Alternative or Progressive rock.So in Closing i would like to say....Get a better choice in music numb nuts.If you can't handle the classic studio recordings then stop listening.

I actually much prefer those old recordings that aren't hi-fi by today's standards, because you can hear the texture of each sound; I hate artificially slick recordings, where the sound-textures have all been varnished over- that fake gloss brings me to doubt the artistic quality of music it's applied to. If a song needs to be lubed up for people to want to listen to it, it must have been bloody awful in the first place!

Let me put it this way, my mother is a big Elvis Presley fan and she would always play Heartbreak Hotel (1956) on record player and it didn't have the best sound quality..but I loved it! She later on bought a cd with all of Elvis's songs remastered and all the instruments were louder and clearer, and it sounded terrible!!! It sounded way overproduced and lost that raw quality I love. Nothing beats the old authentic sound of real music.

You sound pretty close minded there!



Alot of pop music today relies on programming and beats and alot of it sounds the same.  People like Timbaland try to be original and suceed, but most of it sounds manufactured.  Also, todays albums rely on one or two singles, with the rest of the tracks being strictly "filler".



Alot of the Beatles and other classic rock was more about a band, and was raw and energenic. Albums were more well rounded and you could enjoy the whole album, not just a single.

No. lol They create generic music that is currently popular with scene/emo kids. Once those kids grow up and (hopefully) move on to better music, they'll fade away.



Their cover of What's This? from Nitemare Before Christmas is really good, but all of their original songs are awful...you can hardly understand their lead singer.

How to write a lyric?



my bf had made me a song without lyric.
he asked me to do it for him.
my questions are:
1) is writing a lyric is the same as writing a poem?



2) is there any tips in writing lyrics?



cause, i prefer to write a lyric that is not straight to the point.



thank you for your time.

Please help name this 1970's song.?



I can't remeber the words but have the tune stuck in my head. It's from the 70's, a disco/funk song, sort of Earth, Wind and Fire-ish. The male singer has a high voice and there are party sounds in the background. I know it's not much to go on.

ARGGG!!! What was the name of this song featuring Lil Wayne?!?



Well, I was listening to a cd in my car, and then switched to the radio and heard this song that sounded cool. It was like technoish with a dood kinda singing (i think a white guy) for the chorus with that popish technoish beat and then Lil Wayne started rapping and yeah. I heard every song from the Carter III and that song inst in that album. The song sounds new. Anyone know it?

But if he's doing it cuz he loves to rap then he should keep goin at it for as long as he can.

What is a good music video with a meaning?



I need one for English class. We're supposed to present it in front of everyone and then "criticize" it, like telling whether is has a historical approach/moral approach/psychological approach, etc. Also if there is any symbolism in the music video or the lyrics.



I found a couple of good ones but am still looking for more.
Preferably with a story and it has to be the official music video(on youtube).

<answer>



There could be a problem with the headphones? Change your headset & see.



Or else, go to menu&gt;music player&gt;options&gt;settings&gt;equiliser
and then make whatever changes u need to inc the bass.



if it still  doesnt help, then re-install the cell software version. press *#0000# and see the version. if its 3, then you need to change it. mine is 5.81 version. Latest is 8 or something.



if none of ir works, take your cellphone to nokia care. they will help you free of cost..under the warrenty :)



I hope i helped. Xpress Music ROCKS! :D

That's not subjective to opinions at ALL.
Hmm, let's see. One of the best bands ever, and I am not using this term loosely, is Muse. (They have quite the fitting name.) In my opinion, their best album overall is "Origin of Symmetry", but "Absolution" is very good as well.
My favorite band is My Chemical Romance; mostly for emotional reasons, but I digress.
-looks through favorites on iTunes-
Oh, and if you don't mind digging through Limewire, Porcelain and the Tramps aren't too shabby. Emilie Autumn does a gorgeous blend of industrial and classical. Marilyn Manson doesn't really have any bad songs, methinks. Nine Inch Nails have made a good bunch of my favorite songs. t.A.T.u. (or however you capitalize it)...Yeah Yeah Yeahs (extremely loud live)...Hot Chip...David Bowie...Lil Wayne...it all depends on your musical tastes, bro.

There is some contention regarding the band's genre classification, but in general the band's musical style can be described as a cross between melodic death metal and power metal.

Ticket Touts!!!!!!!!!! ?



Why don't ebay do something about people that put sold out tickets up for sale at excessive prices just minutes after tickets have went on sale/sold out!?  it's very frustrating for the fans, I wanted 3 tickets for Take That and could only get 2 this morning.  Now if I want the extra ticket I will have to pay over twice the price to get it to someone who had no intention of going in the first place.  It is shocking and something should be done.



</question>

The question is why isn't anyone doing anything about it?  Surely they can put policies in place.

Capitalism. It benefits eBay when that happens, it benefits the sellers when that happens and it doesn't hurt the band. Why should eBay create a policy that is difficult to uphold solely to help actual fans of bands over entrepreneurs when it would in fact hurt them.



This is not an anti-capitalistic rant. I have nothing wrong with the scalpers.

Lyrics, Title, or Artist...Any Details on a Song?



A couple of years ago I heard a song in a commercial that I fell in love with, and I've been searching for it since then.  In the commercial there was a little girl whose father promised he'd call her, or keep in touch, or come back, or something along those lines.  It showed him traveling by plane and then keeping his promise.  The song had some variation of "No matter where you are, I will be with you."  Those lyrics might be wrong, though, because I haven't been able to find the song yet.  If anybody has any ideas, please let me know!  Thanks!



</question>



<additional details>



It was a US commercial, and it was either for an airline or for some kind of communication, like a cell phone.  Unfortunately the details are slipping.  The vocalist was female, and it sounded late 80s or early 90s-styled.  The commercial was aired in the early 2000s.

Are we talking about a UK or US commercial? Might just help. And can you recall what type of music it was - ballad, country....
Was it a commercial for an airline?



Sorry, I've had a browse on YouTube while I was having my breakfast, but nothing showed that looked like what you're searching for. I'm in the UK, so the ad probably wasn't aired over here.

Tadka reader Asma requested the English translation of the song ‘Jaane Tu Mera Kya Hai’ from Jaane Tu Ya Jaane! Enjoy the lyrics



jaane tu mera kya hai…
(I don’t know how much you mean to me…)
jaane tu mera kya tha…
(I don’t know how much you meant so far…)
tu hi mera har pal…
(you were in my each moment…)
tu hi har lamha tha…
(you were in my each memory…)



jaane kaisi kashish hai…
(I don’t know what kinda wish is this…)
jaane kaisi khalish hai…
(I don’t know what irks me these days…)
kyun ye saansein thami hain…
(why these breaths have ceased nowadays…)
aankhon mein kyun nami hai…
(and why these eyes remain moist …)



hai ye dosti humko yaheen tha…
(I was sure that this was friendship…)
dosti aur kuch bhi nahi tha…
(friendship, and nothing more than that…)
hai ye kaisa dard nayaa sa…
(what kind of new pain is this now?…)
kyun dil lagta toota toota,
(why the heart seems so shattered these days…)



jaana, dil jaana, kaise maine na jaana…
(love, my love, I can’t know why I never knew…)
ke pyaar yahi hai…
(that this was love indeed…)
ye jaane tu, ya jaane na…
(whether you knew it or not…)



jaana, dil jaana, kaise tune na jaana…
(love, my love, hoe come you never knew it…)
ye pyaar hi hai…
(that this indeed was love…)
haan jaane tu, ya jaane .. na…
(whether you knew it or didn’t…)



jaane tu mera kya hai…
jaane tu mera kya tha…
tu hi mera har pal…
tu hi har lamha tha…



ho….
hoti thi tujhse subha har din ki…
(each day’s morning used to start with you…)
teri dopahar se shaam ki dhun thi…
(you were the tunes from the noons to the evenings…)
hoti thi raatein teri baahon mein khoye…
(and the nights were spent lying in your arms…)
tere khayaalon mein hi jaage aur soye…
(you were in my thoughts, whether in slee or  while awake…)



tu jo nahi to kya, rahaa…
(now that you aren’t there, nothing remains…)



umm mm… hmm mm…



jaane tu mera kya hai…
jaane tu mera kya tha…
tu hi mera har pal…
tu hi har lamha tha…



jaane kaisi kashish hai…
jaane kaisi khalish hai…
kyun ye saansein thami hain…
aankhon mein kyun nami hai…



jaana, dil jaana, kaise maine na jaana…
ke pyaar yahi hai…
ye jaane tu, ya jaane na…



jaana, dil jaana, kaise tune na jaana…
ye pyaar hi hai…
haan jaane tu, ya jaane .. na…
haan jaane tu, ya jaane .. na…

Does anyone know the song from Make Me A Supermodel (Aus) that they play every episode when Jen is talking about the prizes the winner gets?? It's not Fame by Lady GaGa. Its like techno kinda music and has no words that I can hear.

What rap song has a chorus that goes "I just want to make love to you"?



It sounds something like that. I heard it earlier at Circuit City but it was on the radio and it was never mentioned what the song was. It was towards the end though and it kept repeating that line and it was overlayed over some other vocal tracks.



Anyway thanks if you have any idea what I'm talking about.

Heya.. Song ideas for social netorking documentary (I know, i've changed it a little)..?



Hey guys, I few hours ago i asked a question in this section about song ideas for an internet addiction doucmentary. But after i posted it, and from the answers i was receiving, I realised that I needed to be less vague (I was getting songs for copyright infringement, porn addiction etc). These answers would have been great if i was making a doco in this area, which i am not at this present time. Thus, I would like some advice on some song selections for a social networking addiction documentary. Girl songs would be great, but any advice would be awesome!



10 points for best answer. Thanks in advance!!!

Looking for Children's Dinosaur Songs from the early/mid 90s.?



This question was previously asked but never received a correct answer.  We had a cassette tape of very catchy dinosaur songs.  Per the last person's question, here are some of the songs/lyrics that were included:



"They lived a long, long, long, long, long, long time ago, way back before us."



"Tyrannosaurus, tyrannosaurus rex! Sing it! He was the fiercest dinosaur, a mean meat eating carnivore. No (something) could stand up next to cruel tyrannosaurus rex!"



"Color me, I'm a dinosaur, I'm a dinosaur, won't you color me? If you were a dinosaur, what color would you be?"



"Saltopus, one of the first dinosaurs to live on Earth. He was smaller than most chickens, he was faster than the dickens. Saltopus, saltopus, he was small but he came first. Scurrying from bush to bush, surely must be saltopus."



"PTERANODON spells pteranadon! P, he was the pilot of the prehistoric skies. T, he looked terrific when he spread his wings to fly."



"If a brontosaurus came to lunch today..."



I would love to surprise my wife and kids by locating this music and playing it for them.  If you recognize this and can help I would be most appreciative.

I'm trying to remember a song similar to Slipknot's "Eyeless."?



This riff is playing over and over in my head.  It sounds a little like the intro to "Eyeless," with the descending chord progression.  This is a long shot, but if anyone has an idea, please help!!!  It also sounds similar to "Black Heart Queen" by The Gallows.  I have no idea and I doubt any of you out there will either.

I'm not sure about this year, but the best, most underrated albums of last year for me were Black Lives at The Golden Coast by The Icarus Line, and Venus Doom by HIM... this year, Slipknot's new album is very good, not sure if it's underrated though, it went straight to number one! I also got AC/DC's new album, and Pink's new album, they were both recieved very well though :P

I love that song as I do most of his work and when he was part of the Walker Brothers.
The Walker Brothers 1960's to 1970's
Founded by three Californians, who became most successful in the UK
They were not related, and adopted the Walker Brothers name as a show business touch.
Scott Walker.....born Noel Scott Engel 9 Jan. 1943, Hamilton, Ohio, Leadd vocalist, bassist.
Gary Walker.......born Gary Leeds, 3 Sept. 1942, Glendale, California, drummer, vocalist.
John Walker......12 Nov. 1943, New York, guitarist, vocalist.



All three continued to release solo records, with Scott being by far the



most successful. In 1976 the group unexpectedly reunited, scoring another UK top ten hit with Tom Rush's, No Regrets. However the three
albums that followed sold poorly. Scott's tracks on the final album Nite
Flights, laid the stylistic grounwork for Scott's later solo career.

Sounded right outta the 60s. That's been popular recently (eg: Amy Winehouse) I liked it. It'd be something I might put on when in the mood for it.

With hand on heart your right from the start,

No cross to bear, no reason to care, my life was all up in air,



Four to the floor, I was sure, never seeing clear,

Four to the floor I was sure, that you would by my girl,



We'd rent a little world, have a little girl.

How to write a lyric?



my bf had made me a song without lyric.
he asked me to do it for him.
my questions are:
1) is writing a lyric is the same as writing a poem?



2) is there any tips in writing lyrics?



cause, i prefer to write a lyric that is not straight to the point.



thank you for your time.

Writing a lyric is really similar to writing a poem but you have to consider what would sound good within the song.  In lyrics, you can bend some rules that you can't really bend in poetry.  You can break away from your rhyme scheme, for example, or hold out one syllable for a few beats.  The hardest part is really making it fit the music and sound good in song.

I'm so tired of hearing that word emo. It's so popular to teenagers, and everyone calls themselves emo.
I guess it's just a new trend that ruined Punk.
I hate it. I don't care what others think about me. Go ahead and give me thumbs down.

I like emo.  Alot of my friends are emo and I love them all to death.  It really annoys me when people make fun of them for being emo though, and so when I stick up for them the call me an emo.  My friends like to call me the emo hippie, which to a certain extent is right, I guess....ANYWAY! Emo kids are great ^__^

OMG i love emos! emos are my buddies i have a lot of emo friends. im not emo but i think they r so cool. i wish ppl would be a little nicer to them though. ppl always want emos to die and think they r so stupid but im like GOD JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE what did they ever do to you! they r just people. and people make fun of them and like they think they know what emo is all about but they dont. they think its all about cutting yourself, wearing emo clothes, wearing your hair a certain way, yeah thats part of it but not all emos do all that stuff. its like you cant just get along with them? i mean look at me im a punk thats way different from emo, emo is just another version of it. but people still think im emo cause of what i wear they judge me before they even know me. i mean just because im depressed sometimes that doesnt make me emo we all get depressed and maybe i wouldnt be so depressed if everyone would stop laughing at me and making fun of me. but back to emos theyre not half bad once you get to know them. But emos and youtube not a good combination cause im on youtube 24/7 and i have a lot of emo punk and goth friends up there. and people on youtube are just flat out MEAN! they go all over our pages criticising us and making us feel bad but we'll just have to get used to it. i have a whole video deddicated to emos on youtube and why ppl sshould leave them alone. its also about MCR haters to but thats another story!

Motley Crue (You wouldn't have Poison without them)
Buckethead (One of the finest guitarists around, if not the finest)
Led Zeppelin (No one on the list comes close to this band)
Pantera (Great guitarist and also a nice guy)

Metallica.......they are legends...
Ozzy.....without him, there is no Black Sabbath
Slayer...best speed metal band ever...
All that remains.....one of my favs.....
G'N'R......perhaps the best american rock band ever.... Appitite for Destruction....one of the best albums ever...
Rage ... redefined the genre..
don't care for either of MCR or the used...
Van Halen..... i love AC/DC...but hard to go against Eddie with David Lee Roth
Motley Crue..they ARE L.A. hard rock.
Dragonforce....fastest guitars I have ever seen or heard
Led Zepplin.....because they are F**Kin' Led Zepplin!!
Pantera.....in my opion, the best metal band the world has ever seen!!
In Flames....I don't really know much about BFMV...sorry
Disturbed.......they keep putting out multi-platnium records...hard to argue..
Slipknot......by far the best band out there today....the 9 are hard to vote against..
Tenacious D......I'm a Jack Black fan......



most of these are my bias opion...but hopefully you'll agree with me on some of these...

I'll recommend this:



worryaboutyou.com



Whatever you do, don't click on the ads. What you are doing by the way, is morally reprehensible and you should be ashamed. Both illegally downloading, and listening to the backstreet boys. Since the former goes to destroying the career of the latter, I guess it's excusable in this case. Just protect your rectum.



And no, I'm not that troll.

Hmm... can't be sure, but I'll take a wild stab in the dark and guess that the song was by the Dropkick Murphys.
They're an Oi band from Boston. Check out http://www.dropkickmurphys.com/



If you like them, try the O'Hooligans as well: http://www.ohooligans.com.au/

OMFG.
FAVOURITE BAND EVER.
At the beginning of the year when they got back together they played at the New Zealand Big Day Out.
BEST DAY OF MY LIFE - they put on a damn good show.



Guerilla Radio is my fav.
BECAUSE it was the first song I ever heard from them.
They're the best.

Love em.
Powerful music that makes you want to get up and stand up for your beliefs.



My favorite song is hard to say. All their songs are great, yet many seem to overlap in my mind. Renegades of Funk is one of my favorites, although it is not as highly looked upon by Rage fans as other great tracks.



Recently I saw them at Lollapalooza which was an very energetic and intense show. The crowd was getting so pumped up and crazy that Zach had to stop the set on numerous occasions to have everyone step back as to not have people get hurt. They still have energy but doesn't seem as much as when they were together the first time. I guess that's them getting older though. I'd highly recommend seeing them if you can.



I haven't heard anything about them touring or working on any new material but that would sure be awesome.



Keep rocking on man!

Yeah, Rage Against the Machine are great! Even though hip-hop is my favourite type of music, I love RATM, and they are one of the most influential rockers out there!
