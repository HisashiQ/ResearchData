As a rule - I've found in life that when you respond then the argument just heats up but when you ignore them or just walk away then it takes the wind out of their sails. You will also find that people around you start to notice that the person in question is a bully and that you are actually the "good guy". It makes their rant appear foolish and childish. Give it a try you might be surprised with the results. Good luck

To those of you who do not understand what you have done, you have done the above AND have put the country in jeopardy.

So are you saying that the country wasn't already divided into have and have-nots? Are you saying that racism didn't exist before Obama. Are you saying that previous presidents never had control over your life? Or are you just saying that the vote and freedom of elections are wrong? Or are you saying that bigotry and small-mindedness is alright?

It's very normal to be confident in general but not like public speaking. If you would like to over come this, go to something like a local area committee. These are meetings in your town where poeple talk about things they'd like to change about it. It'd be a good place to start off practising as everyone is talking aloud. I hope this helped =]

Even the most confident people get nervous before public speaking.



I'm get so nervous, but it gets better each time. If you do it often enough it becomes second nature.



The best way to go about your public speaking is - take your time. You don't have to speak fast, just clearly.



Before your sentences start with words like - Right!



Ok!



Now!



This sets your voice level right and it gets peoples attention.



Good luck!!

How much do you tip a manicurist and why?



I was just wondering why you should tip a manicurist? I went to a manicurist once and paid $45 to have my nails done, then it had like a thing for tips and I just don't get it - if they are going to charge that much to do your nails why would you need to tip them?



</question>



<additional details>



I don't think it's necessary to tip someone to do nails. The school does NOT cost that much, and considering they get a set pay rate, it's not anything like a waiter who gets $3.00 an hour and depends on tips to survive.



Also, you don't tip cab drivers, it's figured into the price.

In any sort of business where people are doing you a service, it is custom to tip. You tip the person that takes your bags, you tip a cab driver, you tip your waiter. $45.00 is in the higher priced range of nails I would say, but if they do a good job, tip something!!-Especially if you're planning on going back! They will appreciate you're tip!



I am a massage Therapist, and I have a lot of clients that don't tip. I don't expect it, but it IS nice, considering I paid a whole lot of money for school, it takes a lot to keep my business open-advertising, washing linens, studying, paying for products, my own physical exertion... I do the same good service for each of my clients, but when someone never tips, it can feel like a bummer. You feel under appreciated.



if you have money to spend getting a service, what's the big deal to show some appreciation with a tip?



It's kinda like saying, if a resteraunt is going to charge so much for this food, why would I need to leave a tip?



Tip 10-20% depending on the service, just like you would with food service....

I saw an inappropriate  picture on-line, where can I report it? (MATURE CONTENT)?



Well, little old me, gullible as ever. I was surfing the inter-net and stumbled across one of them blogs and much to my shock and horror there was a picture. Now, I'm sure you're thinking, what is wrong with a picture? Perhaps it's one of a sunset in Venice, or a pretty girl with a parasol? Ah, but 'twas not. There, right on the computer screen, was a highly pornographic image. It was of a man, with his trousers falling below his bottom crack, and the very tip of his bottom crack was VISIBLE! My virgin eyes have been scalded, and i could scarcely breathe. I shan't want  children to view such a dirty, pornographic picture. How can I report this blog owner so they can not harm the innocent children?

<answer>



a lie is anything said that isn't true to the event that happened or the feelings that someone has.



people lie because they don't want to upset someone, they don't feel comfortable in what actually happened or how they actually feel about the situation, they think you will see them as a lesser person, they want you to think more of them, they want to have a good story to tell



It depends on the situation, sometimes people avoid the truth and end up spending weeks digging a hole to cover up what they lied about, other times people tell the truth and loose a friendship, and everyday people lie and ruin relationships. Sometimes honesty makes people realize how different they are and pulls them apart, and sometimes lieing builds a wall between them.



In the end honesty is normally the best answer because no matter what at the end of the day you can say that you were true to yourself, but sometimes it can be seen as running your mouth, so in some situations biting your tongue and just keeping your mouth shut is the best answer, or a simple "it isn't my place to speak about that"

I have never understood why they complain.  Less than two percent of them claim their tips on their tax returns.  If they did, they would be making far less.

luvmytjd is a bad server if you ever earned $2.83 an hour.  Oh miss I have waited tables and now I own my restaurant and I never made $5 hour.  You suck too.  A great server makes cash and humbly puts it away to be an owner.

Because sometimes people go into an eating establishment and think that the server is their personal slave and then after taking good care of the customer, they will leave less than 15%. Servers rely on tips, and yes, the money is good, but there are days when it's not and then you are only making $2.83 an hour.Most servers don't complain because they know they are making good money, but some are greedy sob's and they complain.

<answer>



Because in the restaurant industry, most of them make their salary ONLY by the tips.  The salary they're paid by the restaurant is only couple bucks/hour.



But what many servers don't realize is that they need to DESERVE the tip.  No one likes to tip someone who is tardy, doesn't see to their needs, forgets parts of their order, and never comes back to check on them.  And then the server complains about not getting a tip?



It's called the 'service industry' for a reason.  It's just that they are the lucky ones in the service industry who are allowed to get tips as part of their job.  There are other kinds of service which the jobs don't normally accommodate tips as part of the job.



But you also have to understand the relationship of the job to the server.  I go to drive-ins a lot (like Sonic) and think nothing of giving the person a dollar tip, even tho' I only see them when they deliver the food.  I make a judgment right there, and usually give the girls the big tip because it's lots easier for young guys to get all kinds of physical jobs.  Plus, these kids have to come outside in winter, so it's ridiculous to think of them getting a quarter tip, even if the meal only comes to $4.  They deserve much more for their efforts because the job is pretty crappy work.



But it's good to reward excellent service.  If you're at a good restaurant and you get excellent service, don't just show it with the tip, let the management know who served you and that you'd come back because of their fine service.  It helps management to keep good servers which will also bring back repeat customers, who'll then spend more $$.

We complain about people that don't know how to tip, and only the servers that give EXCELLENT service would have the balls to complain about it. The good ones expect to be rewarded. The bad ones need to stfu.

Wow...those are ugly.  I'm a mom and I was all prepared to say "your mother knows best" but, well, wow.  Tell your mom that you appreciate that she wants you to be safe, but that a pair of plain flats are safe as long as you are not in gym class.  Don't yell, or get mad, just try your best to explain why you want a pair of flats.  See if she will compromise and let you have one pair of safe shoes and one pair of flats.  The problem will be in the winter, when you will get snow in the flats so the safe shoes will be the better choice then.

i had the same problem! she is probably just jealous that you got the job there or somthing.. just continue to do your job correct, and go complain about her if  it keeps happening. if your boss or office manager like you and dont seem to have a problem, they will realize that this girl is just hating on u

I would say keep the peace b/c you work with her. Also , you want to show your boss that you are the more mature one. Saying something might amount to an arguement at work. Kill her with kindness. That will make her mad . hehe But really , that is the high road that you need to take. Everwhere someone is going to judge you , form their own impressions of you no matter what. Its really hard to do , I know but practice that in your life. Woman love to gossip and love to point your faults out. So what? U made a mistake. I am sure your boss will get over it & so will she. Be on your best behavior and excel at what you go to show this girl who you are , how smart you are & how foolish she was . Please make sure you know for sure she is the one who told on you and that she is in fact the person talking about you behind your back. Dont go by hear say . When an d if you know for sure she is the one doing that then do what I said.

Tell her you overheard her conversation with your boss and that you are disappointed she couldn't come and talk it through with you.  Remind her that you have just started this job, and you are struggling to get used to it.

Ignore this first incident. Treat it as though it didn't happen and you know nothing about it.
In passing conversation, emphasize that you would be open to her assistance as you are new and will need to learn the job. Then when she helps in any way, thank her very much. It is worth a try to get her on your side. It doesn't always work, but it is the best option. If she continues her passive aggressive behaviour, then you will just have to ignore her and do your best work in spite of her. I expect this is a pattern of behaviour and I bet that the boss has seen her do this before. So don't worry too much.

Could I lie about my identity in the ER?



When I go there, can I give a fake name, address, and/or phone number? Can I pretend I don't remember my ss#? Do I have to show an id before getting treatment?
The reason I want to lie is because I have no insurance and I will never be able to pay a huge bill. I seriously need treatment soon. I'm having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, shallow and rapid breathing, get winded easily. Plus a horrible nonproductive cough that's keeping me up all night.

Can you give me a question for hospitality and grooming etiquette?



General rules:



Hospitality-
Be nice.
Thank people for coming.
Be on your most polite behavior.
Don't talk negatively about any other guests there.
Accept host/hostess gifts graciously.



Grooming-
Shower at least once a day.
Wash your hair at least every other day.
Make sure your hair always looks nice.
If you're female, a little makeup goes a long way.
Make sure your clothes look nice, don't have holes or tears in them or trashy images/logos on them.
Keep your nails clean and well-groomed.
Brush your teeth after every meal.

How do I deal with someone whose political views differ a lot from mine?



Here is the deal.  I am a moderate (Episcopalian) who voted for Obama.  My piano instructor and friend is a conservative (Southern Baptist) who voted for McCain.  Some of my friends voted for Obama and some voted for McCain.  Here is the kicker with my piano instructor:  She had been fasting for two days drinking only tomato juice in hopes that McCain would win. (I respect that, because in one instance before I fasted for 24 hours because I had to pray about something...)  She asked me yesterday during our lesson who I voted for and I was honest and told her Obama.  She then launched into this "kool-aid" rant of sorts, saying, "You know Obama is this, you know Obama said that, I don't want Communism in my country, God will let this happen because we've been so bad."  I can't believe all the rants I heard coming from her mouth yesterday afternoon.  Urban legend stuff that has since been unproven.  I told her I didn't want to talk about it anymore and she said, "If our country becomes Communist, we had it coming", then our piano lesson went on as normal and we had normal, non-political banter after that.  I don't want to drop this piano teacher because she is a very brilliant teacher, but at the same time I don't want to hear these rants week after week.  What is a polite way next time she does this to tell her I don't want to talk about it?

After he eats, he sometimes makes noises caused by phlegm in his throat... it's so gross.  I've asked him about it and he says he can't help it. Going to suggest he go to the men's room to clear his throat since it really sounds so horrible.

He acts like he's muttering to himself about government conspiracies.  He plays with everything in the toy section.  He starts random conversations with strangers.



But the reason I know I'm the right woman for him is that I love every minute of it.

He has a bad case of road rage.  If someone cuts him off he'll speed up to cut them off just to piss them off.  He's even got out of the car at red lights to confront others for driving badly and I just sit there in the car wanting to die.



When we go shopping he acts like we're in a marathon to get out of there as fast as we can.  He's always walking around the store like a speed walker and I'm tagging along behind him.  Finally I started having a talk with him like he was a small child before we went into stores saying "No I want to look and it might take a while, are you sure you're ok with that!?".
======================================...
But I have this horrible habit of chewing on the insides of my lips and he hates it!!  Now that I think about it I probably look like someone on crack, lol.

well my S.O. -  is my husband, so needless to say he does a lot. One thing that I don't like is when he has to stand so close to me when other males around to make himself look good.  Or he will grab my rear-end which I don't like it when he does it it public.  Or when we go to a restaurant he always had to visit the restroom without fail to do the #2.  Not that I want to know, why does he just not go b 4 we leave home?

He talks about World of Warcraft in public. I play with him but I like to keep it secret. I don't want the world to know I am a gamer, I'm embarrassed of it.



So when he makes WoW references that only he and I know about, it's really frustrating and he LOVES to do it because he knows I hate it!!



We'll be at a nice restaurant and he will be talking about his "Guild" UGH.. lol. It's even worse when they call for "raiding" advice. I could go on but I think you get the picture. lol

Wow, I've read the other posts, and have just been reminded what a great S.O. I have!  I can't think of anything he does in public that makes me cringe.  He does not burp, fart, scratch himself, pick his nose (or his butt) or anything else gross.  He does like to ride the grocery cart when he's pushing it, but I think that's cute.

I was invited to an engagement party - does that require a gift?



This couple both has parents with lots of money, and we are surely expecting the wedding to be a "noses up" affair.  So I wasn't surprised to be invited to an egagement party, before the bridal shower, before the wedding...



Is a gift required?



The party will be in the evening, after dinner.  Cocktails and snacks.



*By the way - we love this couple... we are really good friends.  We just don't mingle or spend money the same way they do... so it is hard for me to judge what is right or wrong... thanks!

An engagement party is to introduce the couple to family and friends. A gift is not required. If you do not want to arrive empty handed, bring a small gift or card.

Engagement parties are intended to be a celebration of the announcement of the engagement, the joy is to be shared among friends and relatives and a grand time is hoped to be had by all. No gift is required, simply your sincere congratulations. If you want to do more, bring a card or give a toast.



And no gift is EVER required or expected by ladies and gentlemen in polite society. You can bring a gift to the shower and/or wedding if you want (within your means and choosing, as registries are only to be taken as a suggestion and are a particularly tacky way of begging.)

Yes, a gift and card is required. Since this may be a budget issue for you, you may want to decline the invitation and send only a card. This will give you time to save money for the bridal shower gift and the wedding gift. And, since you are good friends, you can spend time with them at some non-gift event in the future.

A gift is never required but yes you should bring one to the engagement party, bridal shower, and wedding.  A nice bottle of wine would be nice for the party.  For the bridal shower it's usually bridal stuff for their honeymoon or whatever.  They'll probably be registered somewhere for the wedding.

It is never in poor taste to bring a gift, especially since you're close to them.  I'd rather be the only one who gives them a gift than the only one who doesn't give them a gift.  You can pick something smaller from a registry, or give them something like a bottle of champagne or wine you think they'll enjoy.

How can you politely get out of it when someone is trying to show you pictures on their phone?



Looking at pictures from a wallet is annoying enough, but at least you can flip through them at your own pace and they are easy to see...when someone gets out their phone and tells me they want to show me some pictures, I immediately panic because I know I'm going to feel trapped into waiting while they mess with their phone 5 minutes and you can't even see the pictures that well.  Is it possible to decline without snubbing them?



</question>



<additional details>



Truth is, I have never really been too enthused to see other people's pictures (unless I am in them, lol).  But the phone thing is somehow a million times worse.  I hate standing there for bored the several minutes it usually takes them to even pull the pictures up!  In my opinon, the people who make you wait on them to do this are the rude ones.

Oh my, that is tricky. I'll keep checking back in hopes of a fabulous little line to borrow. I generally just pretend to be interested in the hopes that when I get all giddy about my photos no one rolls their eyes.



Isn't there some etiquette rule about boring friends and relatives with vacation photos? I'm sure Miss Manners has addressed that at some point...

I liked this answer because you pointed out-we all like to show off pics from time to time.  So I'll try to be patient and remember I might do it sometimes too.  I might also use the "I don't have my glasses" line for people who don't know me well enough, because I don't wear glasses.

I had to laugh since I have gone through this a few times...and with a supervisor, to boot...and to show me pictures of her cat (geezus). I just kept saying 'what is that?" and 'what is she doing there?' in hopes she would get the hint that those pictures just simply suck. So I see your point, but I dont see a way to get out of it without being offensive. The only thing you can do is to feign interest.

Two ways:

If you don't like this person, don't know them, don't want to know them....take one peek at one picture, and calmly say,"Madam, that is the ugliest child/river/house/dog/cat/etc. I have EVER seen!" this should lead to a walk off, by both of you.

Start opening up more. It will take time but will be well worth it. There's nothing wrong with being a quiet person. But slowly start talking a little more each time. Every1 has boring parts to life. No1 is the life of the party every minute. Just gradually start conversations or include yourself in them even if it's just a few words. Start with 'how is your day going?', 'how was your week end?' etc. If there is something you know the person is interested in for example basketball, painting, tv show, movie etc. ask them about it. Get the ball rolling and as they tell you about it converse back with them about what they are saying. Show some interest in it and gradually throw in things you are into.

Hi, you need to come out of your shell so to speak. the most basic thing you need to try to do is talk about something that interests both you and the person you are talking to. Something like...the weather, sport,favorite tv shows, etc. And don't rush into it and tke it one step at a time because conversation flows and if you find a common topic, you are set. Good luck and hope i helped.

I don't really know. I think it's just that you haven't found someone that you click with yet. When you meet new people, just talk about random things such as th work you're doing or the place you are. And then you might just find out that you have the same interests and build it up from there.

you have to solve this on your own.... try talking to people that interest you so then you can genuinely have a conversation that is interesting to both of you.  Anytime you have to force yourself to do something, that is a sign that obviously says there isn't an interest, why even bother most often things that come and flow natural are always good signs of a connection or natural bond.

I was thinking of trying to pull one of the bosses from my work, get a payrise etc. I've pretty much decided its the best thing to do, any tips on hows best to go about it tho???

How do I deal with someone whose political views differ a lot from mine?



Here is the deal.  I am a moderate (Episcopalian) who voted for Obama.  My piano instructor and friend is a conservative (Southern Baptist) who voted for McCain.  Some of my friends voted for Obama and some voted for McCain.  Here is the kicker with my piano instructor:  She had been fasting for two days drinking only tomato juice in hopes that McCain would win. (I respect that, because in one instance before I fasted for 24 hours because I had to pray about something...)  She asked me yesterday during our lesson who I voted for and I was honest and told her Obama.  She then launched into this "kool-aid" rant of sorts, saying, "You know Obama is this, you know Obama said that, I don't want Communism in my country, God will let this happen because we've been so bad."  I can't believe all the rants I heard coming from her mouth yesterday afternoon.  Urban legend stuff that has since been unproven.  I told her I didn't want to talk about it anymore and she said, "If our country becomes Communist, we had it coming", then our piano lesson went on as normal and we had normal, non-political banter after that.  I don't want to drop this piano teacher because she is a very brilliant teacher, but at the same time I don't want to hear these rants week after week.  What is a polite way next time she does this to tell her I don't want to talk about it?

It may be effective to say something like "I respect you as a person. I also repect your personal political personal views. I would prefer not to discuss politics with you as my beliefs differ from yours and clearly get you upset at the mention of my views. Let's keep the topics of conversation to non-political items please. I do not want us to have any hard feelings against one another based on differing political views."

Tell her you will not discuss politics anymore. If she refuses, tell her you will have to find a new teacher if she continues her ranting. Then do it if necessary. I know you don't want to replace her, but if she can't respect your wishes and insists on spending your lesson time proselytizing at you, then you are not getting what you are paying for.

That you both agree to disagree and wish not to talk about such differences!

Could I lie about my identity in the ER?



When I go there, can I give a fake name, address, and/or phone number? Can I pretend I don't remember my ss#? Do I have to show an id before getting treatment?
The reason I want to lie is because I have no insurance and I will never be able to pay a huge bill. I seriously need treatment soon. I'm having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, shallow and rapid breathing, get winded easily. Plus a horrible nonproductive cough that's keeping me up all night.



</question>



<additional details>



I have absolutely NO money to pay for even a clinic visit. I guess I'm screwed and will have to sit here and die because you have to pay money in this country to get health treatment - which should be free anyways. Should be a right, not a privelage.

Don't deny yourself needed medical attention.  If you are as bad off as you claim, get medical help.



You can always lie; usually you get caught and are in worse shape.

The answer is no.  You will need to show a form of id.  Most towns have a hospital that takes people with no insurance, you should figure out which one it is.  They are not allowed to turn away people just because they have no insurance.  Instead of going to the ER and racking up a couple of thousand dollars, why not go to one of the walk in clinics to see a doctor?  They will usually see you for around $100.

You'll have to show some form of identification. Lying is never a good thing--especially about your identity. You can get into a LOT of trouble--even jail time WHEN (not if) you get caught.



That being said, there are ways to get the bill paid off. Hospitals often put people on a plan where they pay off a certain amount each month. But be careful. If you miss any payments, they can take you to court.

As a person said above, you cannot be denied emergency medical treatment on the basis of inability to pay. If you have no money and no insurance, it would seem that you could apply for and receive government assistance.
I like a system where people get paid a reasonable wage for doing their job. You would expect that much yourself. I would fear having to see an ER doctor who wasn't getting paid, or was getting a pittance to treat me.

I think you may be able to get away with it, but hospitals offer charity care which will cover the expenses for low income people. Have you tried just seeing a regular doctor. They do the same exact diagnosis for much less than a ER.

How do you deal with someone who is so negative all the time?



My mom has never been happy with her life for a long as I can remember. When I talk to her she is always complaining about work, family, friends, how she feels, etc.



Whenever I even mention anything about it, she says I have a "holier than thou" attitude and won't talk to me for days.



My sister has told her she needs to talk to someone about her depression to get help but she says no.



She lives very nearby and comes to visit regularly, but I'm sick of the negativity. I have tried finding the positve in each situation, but she gets irritated by it.



So I just try to listen and spend time with her and let her be around family, but she makes me in a negative mood.



Any ideas of what I could do to make her be a little more positive?

I COMPLETELY understand!!!!!  Sounds like you also have a emotional vampire. Sucks the positive right out of you!



I also have tried finding the positive in everything & it doesn't work. I have found success in changing the subject to something other than the usual litany of complaints. -&gt; when she complains I'll ask... Do you know how to get grape jelly stains out of a multi colored shirt? -&gt; or... Should you boil the water first for hard boiled eggs?



I might sound stupid, but it's alot like that "me or the dog" show where the trainer redirects the dogs attention to get it to stop whatever behavior is incorrect. I've found that a question will stop her & get her to focus on an answer & possibly a exciting conversation about stains or eggs... which is lot's better than listening to the screaming in my head for her to stop complaining.



I hope redirection works for you so you have nicer visits.



Edit - 1 other thing I've noticed with my own complainer... low self esteem... I try to "boost" her by complimenting random things... how did you know to match those shoes w/those earrings, it's looks so nice. Or I ask her how to do things & her showing me seems to make her feel more important. -&gt; just don't be patronizing!

You probably wont be able to change her attitude but you really need to keep yourself positive regardless if she get upset o not.  Some people are just toxic like that and will sap you of positive energy.  Keep your distance or try things like soothing background music or aromatherapy when she is visiting.  Perhaps something as simple as that will make her less anxious.  Good luck



Depending on how close you two are, maybe go with her the next time she sees her doctor.  Talk to her and see if she would consider taking medication for her depression.  I'm sure she doesn't want to be like that either but maybe doesn't realize that there is help out there.

If looking like a prostitute is the object, puckering is a great way to do it.



I love looking at the tabloids when checking out at the market.  What on EARTH have women done to their lips?  There is a new trend, which is replacing puckering.  The new look is holding lips in the shape of an "O", with teeth showing.



I'm not sure who finds this appealing, but I find it positively repulsive.  Anyway, if bared teeth are the new look, why not just bypass the celebrity drama and let horses be the new celebrities.

Well you take many chances on going home with a complete stranger.



All you can do is give your side of the story and see what happens.  You are in a very bad situation here.

While this sounds like a troll post, just get a good lawyer.  She has to prove that you didn't stop (you did... although shooting "your load" on her face may still be considered assault) and that you were having sex with her by force (she needs doctors to prove there is damage down there... they say sex victims have certain physical trauma doctors and nurses look for in their genital area).  As for a rash, that's your problem.  If you pulled out and shot the load on her face, you weren't wearing a condom.

What a charming gentleman you are.
The way you talk shows lack of respect for women, so I am not sorry that you have been charged with an offense.
If you are totally telling the whole truth then surely you have nothing to worry about.



I hope you learn a valuable lesson, but more than likely you will not.

That could be either, because sometimes there really isn't a right or wrong answer about how to deal with some things.  I think the thumbs up or down is great, and not at all insulting.  It helps poll the answers so the asker can see how people feel.



I wish they would have it to "agree" and "disagree"



</answer>



<asker's comment>



that's a good idea with the agree/disagree point.



I had 9 thumbs down on a question the other day that was completely true, and was answering the question perfectly. I guess the other poeple just didn't like my tone.

When I don't think it's very helpful, I give it a thumbs down. Me giving a thumbs down for difference in opinion only happens when it concerns Obama (Yay Barack!)but that's almost over so I'll be nice now.



I don't get too mad about receiving a thumbs down though (Bringammon!) since some of my answers were said out of randomness sometimes or if I didn't have the answer, I tried to cheer them up a bit or stoke their fires. I try not to let my answers be rude, that's all. Maybe a little "smart" but not rude.

What an excellent question~ I sincerely hope you get honest replies! My view has been often times that those who could care less simply give a thumbs down without considering the individual asking the question as well as not taking thought towards 'empathy' nor genuine concern! I would hope that many out here within the Y/A format realize that many thumbs down replicate someone not liking another [unfortunately] OR some 'so_called "TROLLS" who insist upon following certain people they have secluded amongst many'...this behavior can often times be extremely detrimental for those asking an innocent question seeking common sense guidance! I HOPE that everyone within the Y/A network will be able to recognize the troll behavior versus those who genuinely answer/reply to questions they believe will benefit another! Take care~

I only thumbs down if it's down right wrong. Like if someone states that minidv camcorders can be downloaded via USB, when we know you need a firewire connection. If it's someone's opinion, how can that be wrong? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

Would you be upset if you received this email?



My husband's aunt whom I've never met or spoken with  (have only  exchanged a few emails) keeps forwarding nasty emails about the presidential candidate she was against. She never asked me what my views were or who I was voting for she just sent them assuming we share the same views. We don't.  This entire time I just deleted them and left it alone thinking it would end along with the elections, but no luck.  I was just so disgusted this morning that I sent her this e-mail.



Hi aunt _______,



I appreciate that you include me in your emails but some of these could be interpreted as being offensive to _________ supporters.  Perhaps sharing our political views is not the best way to get to know each other.



How about this instead, your beautiful little niece is now 7 1/2 months old and is totally in love with her dad!  The moment she hears his voice she looks around to find him and when she finally does she smiles sooooo wide we can all see two teeth and gums! She's so bright and is already crawling.  Here are some pictures...



Love,



Lilly

That is the PERFECT way to resolve this situation!  Im glad you didn't rant or become angry with her!  Changing the subject is the greatest way to get someone to stop something, and I think you achieved your goal of getting her to stop with out becoming hostile.  I would not be offended in any way what so ever.  If she is then she may have some problems.

Well done.  You have put your point across without being judgmental.
Your right of course politics together with religion is not a subject to discuss over the dinner table if you get my drift.
To change the subject was a stroke of genius, if this Aunt does not understand then in truth why waste your time.
Keep your emails polite and informative regarding your family.



Sometimes if we stay silent about certain topics then people tend to think that we agree with them and this has just been proved to you.
Its best to be honest and get it out of the way, now that you have done this who knows this Aunt may look forward to you cheerful emails.

Assuming that you have discussed the rudeness & selfishness with her in person, and assuming that she's asked for help, there are several books you can recommend.



Here are some I would consider:
Emily Post's Etiquette http://www.amazon.com/Emily-Posts-Etique...
The Bible



A DVD of "how to act": http://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Age-Classic...



If you are offering her a book out of the blue, then you are being passive aggressive and rude.

What is an appropriate gift for hotel lounge staff?



I have been staying at the same hotel for 4 nights a week for the past 10 months.  I have gotten to know several of the staff in the lounge very well as they are there every night when I stop in.  I regularly tip them well for the service they provide, but they have also become friends to a degree.  They are my friends away from home that I can see and talk about something other than the office where I work.  They're good people and I really enjoy their company.



About once a month I send an e-mail to the hotel manager and/or the hotel chain headquarters letting them know how much I appreciate the service of these particular individuals, as well as others in the hotel like housekeeping and front desk staff that I meet on a weekly basis.



I will be leaving my project in the next few weeks and would like to give some sort of gift to the people in the lounge as they are my friends.  It is very unlikely that I will ever see them again after I leave, but I want to let them know that I appreciate them.



There are about 5 people that I would get gifts for, but I do not want to spend much money at all.  Gift cards to Starbucks, or a department store would be nice, but they don't seem very personal.  Do others have any ideas?  I would like to keep the cost to about $80 or so.

The man is a bully.



First off, tell him that at least ropes and pickles have a use in life, where a pile of C***p like him is only fit to be shovelled up and binned.



On a more serious note, no-one should have to put up with this sort of rubbish and any work place that allows it to prosper is in breach of employment laws.  Report the problem to your line manager.  If it's causing you grief and upset it needs to be sorted out.

He is a bully with a big mouth and that is why others agree, because they do not wnt to get picked on.



Every time he says such things he gets such a re-action from you that this will continue until you break the spell.



There is no point in trying to get one up it never works with such people.
But all companies have a duty of care to make sure that each Employee feels safe and secure and happy in their working environment.  So report the loser because this is harassment.
Your Employer has to listen to your complaints and follow this up with a warning to this person.
If you are not happy with this, then speak to the Employer until the matter is dealt with.



Don't feel stupid, name calling is not nice and if continued it will grind you down, so no wonder you feel the way you do.
He knows this but most bullies are weak people who play the game of choosing their victims, so don't let him get away with it.



Good luck, there are so many political correct policies now that bullies stand to loose their jobs if they continue with this bad behavior.

I figure if he's going to tax us to death why not get it over with and not tip servers who make $3 an hour.  In my experience most elitists tip very minimal. Yes, McCain would probably tip very little also, so I'm not being biased in asking this question.



Oops, sorry, maybe a little biased towards elitists! I encounter many people who drive up to my restaurant in high end cars and don't tip at all!

Tax US to death? Who is "us"? You weren't really paying much attention. Obama talked about tax breaks for those not in the uppper income brackets. If you work in a restaurant, then I don't think you are in the income bracket that's getting hit with taxes. It's the elitists in the high-end cars who are getting hit.
The other guy, on the other hand, might have snatched your tips right out of your hand.

First of all, do you have any kind of evidence, other than your restruant expierence, about how elitists tip?? Any statistics? Have you ever dined with a congressman or President before? Probably not. So, your assumption basically has no backbone.



Secondly, Obama is only increasing taxes for the wealthy ($250,000 and higher salary) but that's not the majority. So I wouldn't say he is "taxing us to death".



I just don't even understand your point.

Why do teachers have NO respect for students in high school?



WoW. I was just at a college fair in my university. I wanted to know what was going on. And when I was trying to leave, the teachers stood in front of me and said to me in a really mean way "You cant leave here" and i said why not and they didnt answer me. and they were just really rude and disgusting to me. And then they called security on me and wouldnt let me leave. Im 22 years old!!!!
Why do teachers treat students this way???



</question>



<additional details>



I had to show them my ID for them to leave me alone and THEN they said sorry.



I feel like if they want respect from students, they should give it!

If it was during the day it was probably a field trip.  The teachers were strict because it is their responsibility to keep the students safe.  If a student was to leave the fair it would have been on the teacher's head.  Teachers have a lot of responsibility, sometimes it can be overwhelming and make you a little cranky.  I know from personal experience that Field Trips are the most stressful time I have the whole school year.  I may get a little cranky too, knowing I am responsible for 26+ students in a non-structured environment.

So then complain to whomever was in charge.  You're making a blanket statement.  Not only that, a majority of teens these days lack a lot of respect for anyone.  They are selfish and rude.  I'm not saying ALL teachers are polite and kind but gimme a break.  One bad experience and you think the whole world is out to get you.  Move on and get over it.  If you make these kinds of generalizations about every population then you aren't living in the real world.

1) Use specific language when bringing up a complaint. You dealt with ONE teacher who made you feel harassed. If you are talking with friends, you should address the situation in the same way. "This one teacher made me feel..." In a complaint, "A male teacher approx 6'3" blocked my exit..."



2) High school & Elementary school teachers are generally legally liable for the well being of their students.  This is why he may have been blocking the door-- for supervision purposes. Unfortunately, it's the day & age we live in.



Before you file an official complaint, and before you derive an opinion of ALL high school teachers based on the actions of one, I suggest you cool down emotionally, and then write down your experience with THIS teacher on paper, so you can recall it clearly if you choose to complain officially.

Very rude. He should have said something non-descriptive, such as, "I've had an accident and need to go home now," or "It seems I have had a minor medical emergency and I'll need to go home now." In his defense, he may not have thought of how to properly phrase this politely without opening further questions that would have brought out this detail; therefore, he may have decided that the best solution was to be forthright about it.

my husbands boss on his second job is living in a toxic environment for him and his husband. yes hes gay though not the issue. the issue is his current  roommate shes doing things that are unsafe and is threatening him with violence.



we have told him hes welcome into our home anytime day or night. our problem is our current roommates dont like gay people. oh well. his safety is more important. their company doesnt care either so not an issue.



would you allow your boss to move in to your home?

ummm yes it would complicate things. The boss is "higher" than your husband at work. But if he moves in, its like you guys are family. And then your other roomates have the right to choose who they want to live with.



The boss= job
The roomates=money for rent



So you have to decide what give you more moeny in the long run. THe roomates or your husbands job. You never know, your husband might get a raise out of this and you wont need roomates anymore.

I think that is fine provided you have a contract written up regarding payments for rent and utilities... rules about food, parties, and the like... and have a written date regarding when they are expected to move out and find a new apartment.



You also need to talk to your own roommates first though.  Tell them about the contract too and let them know your friends are moving in because their life is in danger.  Gay or not, they have the right to live peacefully.



If your current roommates do not accept, then the best you can do is help your friends find a new place elsewhere.

If your current roomies don't like gay people, this could pose a problem.  You  need to go to all the people who pay rent and discuss the situation with them. If there are any who don't want to allow him to move in, then its only fair that he not move in. Each rent paying roomie has the right to live in an environment that hes comfortable in because hes paying to be there.  Good luck.

What is an appropriate gift for hotel lounge staff?



I have been staying at the same hotel for 4 nights a week for the past 10 months.  I have gotten to know several of the staff in the lounge very well as they are there every night when I stop in.  I regularly tip them well for the service they provide, but they have also become friends to a degree.  They are my friends away from home that I can see and talk about something other than the office where I work.  They're good people and I really enjoy their company.



About once a month I send an e-mail to the hotel manager and/or the hotel chain headquarters letting them know how much I appreciate the service of these particular individuals, as well as others in the hotel like housekeeping and front desk staff that I meet on a weekly basis.



I will be leaving my project in the next few weeks and would like to give some sort of gift to the people in the lounge as they are my friends.  It is very unlikely that I will ever see them again after I leave, but I want to let them know that I appreciate them.



There are about 5 people that I would get gifts for, but I do not want to spend much money at all.  Gift cards to Starbucks, or a department store would be nice, but they don't seem very personal.  Do others have any ideas?  I would like to keep the cost to about $80 or so.

I worked at a conference center where I cleaned rooms. I think the things I enjoyed the most were cards from the guests saying thank you. I know you want to do a little more than that, but please be sure to write them each individual notes.



You could add little gift baskets. Get them a few things from Bath and Body Works if they're female or for the men (my dad loves these) the ones with cheeses, crackers, and summer sausages.



I know gift cards don't seem personal, but something like Starbucks or Barnes and Noble would be awesome (I'd prefer that to Wal-Mart or a department store because it shows that they know I love coffee or books).

Is this appropriate for a high school grad write up?



It is exactly the maximum 300 characters.



"In ten years when the rest of you are still working at the mall I will be changing the world. I hope I am right so you can all tell your kids that you went to high school with someone amazing like me. On the other hand, I hope you prove me wrong. See you at the reunion if the world hasn’t ended yet!"



I have heard mixed feeling from the people I have shown it too. Do you think it is appropriate or is it too harsh?



(I am a VERY sarcastic, vain person)



</question>



<additional details>



EDIT: As someone who has, in the past, worked on many yearbooks and checked hundreds of grad write ups, I know I don't want to do the standard "I would like to thank God and my Family...".



The classmates and teachers I have shown it too have found it funny, however I have not shown it to everyone that will see the yearbook. Furthermore, my Mom thinks it is "terrible". I personally like it right now but in ten years I don't know if I will still feel that way, hence posting the question.



I look down at people who work in malls mainly because McDonalds was too many characters, and I honestly do hope that the students in my grad class amount to more than that.

The only thing correct is the 300 character maximum.



Unless your high school graduating class is very small & they all know you personally, your message will sound degrading to the majority.  The fact that you mentioned you are also a vain person signals to me that you approve of what you have written and are trying to excuse it by stating that you are  VERY sarcastic.  I think it's time for you to look in the mirror and realize the fact, "You're not all that".

I would be offended if I was working in a mall and read "In ten years when the rest of you are still working at the mall I will be changing the world." The way I see it it's as if  you are looking down at the people who are working in a mall. Maybe I misunderstood what you wrote. But are you being sarcastic when it comes to people working in a mall.

<question>



Why is it that some people don't pick up on nonverbals, and even verbal cues, that you don't want to talk?



Sometimes there are diagnoses such as Asperger's which might prevent someone from not recognizing appropriate communication boundaries.  However, I'm talking about people who supposedly have no limitations. They either don't know, or choose not to acknowledge, when a conversation is over or that one never started in the first place.



When you turn away from them to show that you don't have time or that your aren't interested in talking, they still keep having a one-sided conversation.  When you actually ask them to please stop talking, they STILL keep talking.



It's that a personality disorder of some type?  Narcissism?  Deep insecurity that drives them to keep talking?



If someone tells me that they don't want to talk, I stop talking to them.  I wonder why so many people don't understand that.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You hit the nail on the head when you said it.  There are some people who just don't know when to stop.  They are either insecure or are so desperate for attention that they won't stop.  Sometimes they do this so much that they don't know HOW to stop.  There are some people who are so desperate for companionship that they don't know that they are actually "crossing" the line and they don't mean any harm.  These are the ones who you must be careful of because you truly could hurt their feelings.  They are innocent and don't mean any harm at all.  Then you have the narcissistic and rude people who have nothing to do but talk about themselves and their lives.  They think the entire world revolves around them and will not stop until someone finally does end up hurting their feelings.  You've also got the attention seekers who don't know how else to get any other type of attention so they use rotten random and meaningless conversation as a types means of getting attention.  It too is wrong and they also will end up getting their feelings hurt and hopefully will understand that they cannot disrupt every ones life just to get attention.

Is it right to criticize people's clothes if you don't like those?I mean does it show weakness of character or etiquette or education if you criticize people's appearance or dressing sense etc.?
Isn't everyone supposed to have freedom of opinion and expression?
No dumb answers please.

criticism of any kind is rude and tactless.  That's why we have 'etiquette'.  You may share your thoughts in a kind and productive manner if you feel the need to do so, but to 'put someone down' is unnecessary.

Consider the person's feelings - it may feel good to the judger but it does a lot of damage to the receiver of the insult.  Just because you don't like something someone has, it doesn't need to be vocalized.  I worked with a young lady who told her friend (whose wedding she was bridesmaid in) that the wedding dress she picked looked horrible on her.  Who thinks they should have that right to bring someone down like that?  She could not understand why the bride-to-be was so upset.  I'm sure that's still with her today and their friendship has not been the same.  It's best to bite your tongue if it's not something that will devastate that person's life.

Hmmm I don't really have a "yes" or "no" answer.



When judging someone's apperence ask yourself why you don't like how the look: If they are wearing something that is not your taste, I wouldn't say anything. If they are wearing something innapropriate, I would.



Inappropriate, meaning that it's too tight, has holes, isn't right for the occasison, smells bad, has stains, etc. These are things that could potentially hurt this person, like preventing them from landing a job interview or get them turned down on a date. I think it's important that you let them know in a nice way that they aren't dressed appropriately.



But, if its simply a matter of your taste (i.e. "she is wearing navy and black together, that's such a fashion faux pas) I'd just keep it to yourself, because some people will not have the same views as you.

If the only reason it you just don't like them then, no you don't. We do have the freedom of expression which means that someone can tell you that you don't like you clothes.



Ever see the show "What Not to Wear"? The  hosts help the people out tell them what, why, and how they could do themselves better by dressing in a way that suits them, the jobs they have and the lives they lead.



Clothes need to suit the person wearing them, the job they have, and the life they lead.

While I understand him being upset ( I am too) he shouldnt be taking his anger out on you like that. Its difficult to deal with a person who is angry and not thinking rationaly. Ive been there and done that. Dont tell him to calm down or that you understand (because he knows you dont). They dont want to be told what to do. Sometimes they just need their own space and time to cool off. So leave him alone to cool off and he can come tell you all about it when he's calmed down a little bit. Be loving and supportive but also try to keep yourself out of the line of fire.



Sounds to me he has other emotional issues and this was just enough to set him off. He needs to come to terms with whatever is causing him emotional instability in his life. Trust me, ive been there too.



I also gotta say if he is not an abusive person and besides this issue your relationship is good then an unexpected break-up is not a good idea. He is mad because he's hurting and afraid. Walking out on someone in their time of need isnt the right thing to do. You know your boyfriend better than us. We're only here to give advice. Only you know how to best run your relationship. I hope it works out.

Just from this question, it sounds like you already have developed the pattern of thinking common among victims of domestic abuse. You complain about how he treats you badly, but when people tell you how to help yourself, you defend him.
Averybody has a good side and a bad side. You have to decide, for anybody, if their good side makes their bad side worth dealing with. If you have to keep talking about how he's "psycho", and he's saying these things to you about something you had no control over, then maybe it's time to rethink whether his good side is worth it.

I don't know what you expect from posting this if you don't want to consider leaving him. A great comeback perhaps?



You are with a loser. You know you are with a loser. I say whatever happens in the future, like him losing his job and coming home and beating you for it, you pretty much deserve what you are going to get.



You choose to stay with him you choose the vebal abuse. On some level you must like it since you refuse to do anything to change your situation.



I had a friend like you once. She always came crying to me. I told her the exact same thing i will tell you. If you refuse to change your situation don't pis-s and moan about it.

Is this typical normal behavior from a woman?



About my friend I was discussion in other quesitons. It looks like she's clear so far - however, somethiing doesn't sit right - you know? They are going out, she's not cheating nor using him. I talked to Dan about this and told him I still believe there is an exterior behavior. Dan is a great guy and I'm proud of him for obtaining his first exclusive girlfriend. She's so far what I gather a nice, friendly girl. However, I'm just concerned on her motive. I still detect anxious and nervousness. How I can tell is my knees are shaky-resulting from another person's vibrations or feelings. I can detect other's emotions and feelings - however, i can't read other's minds. True love isn't based about sex - i personally think the relationship is solidly base and deprives from sex which of course indicates unhealthy relationship if it is indeed only a sexual relationship. Sexual relationship also indicates Lust where Intimacy and Passion come into play- or just Intimacy. They have sex every night - and today she was smoking outside of our apartment complex. Tight jeans, and a black shirt. Which indicate Sexuality, Seductive. The black color meaning is Power, Protective, attracts Negativity. The way she answered her phone is a seductive manner. I was done smoking the loaded up my computer then went in the bathroom. I heard Dan's shower running, and knocking sounds. Everyone is in the apartment dismisses and thinks she's a nice person but me. Something's wrong here and I know it! It's not based upon True Love but rather Lustiful. The relationship will fail and even though I don't wnat that to happen to Dan - I might have too. I have no other choice but to let him see the truth. Men are usually blind in a state where they can think about humpy-humpy time. This is what is called P*SSY TRANCE - whereas a male can only think of a woman's gentials instead of her heart. Possibly, I'm detecting on her part selfishness and self-indulgence in what she wants. All though, people usually are selfish and indulgent, which includes so many people commit crimes.



I know in blooming of a relationship - everthing is based upon Sex. My opinion in the matter is that there should be at least a balance and if one out ways another it's not a usual sign of a healthy stable relationship.



Am I being paranoid or should I let Dan see for his own eyes?

How to you tell someone to not advise/tell you what to do?



e.g. some of my parents friends will ask me something like "how come you're always alone in your class? you have to mix with people" (yes, my parents tell everything about me, and i don't mind). The truth is i tried to mix with my classmates but i just can't get along with them (and it's not worth all the arguments I get into with them). However, i can easily make friends with people outside my class. But the way everyone sees it, is there's something wrong with me...so i get lectured "you have to try and change, you have to be nice to them etc etc."  It's all common sense, and i've done it, but it didnt change the situation.
I'm sick of getting lectured. If I tell them "I appreciate it, but please don't talk to me about this", I feel I am being rude, and my parents will be like "they're telling you for your own good".
I HATE IT.
Please help!!

Unfortunately for you this is one battle you will NOT win unless you try to get your parents on your side the correct way.



Your parents and your parents friends have the hand up in this one.  I know this is NOT the answer you want but is the truth.  They are older and have the upper hand in this one and your parents may to continue to allow their friends to give you this "advice" even though they truly shouldn't.  What you should do is go to your parents and explain to them how much this hurts you.  Ask them to please stop their friends from giving you this advice.  Explain to them that it truly does stop you from making friends and it really does hurt you.  It may or may not stop them but it is worth the effort.  I don't know them well enough to know if they will ask their friends to stop or not but hopefully they will see how much pain this is causing you and will at least try to stop it.  Good luck!!!

Honestly, the best thing to do is smile and nod and tune them out. You're not going to be able to nicely tell them to butt out. I do it with my grandmother all the time. I graduated college and wasn't married--wasn't even engaged, so apparently there's something wrong with me. So my grandmother is giving me all this advice about it. Same with my weight. She has a bigger issue with it than I do (honestly, I'm only about 20 pounds overweight and I'm working on it). I've learned to selectively listen to her.

Well, i understand your frustration. That said, at least these people care enough about you to want to help you. So think about it that way. The next time it comes up, just say "Thanks, I agree with you, it is important to socialize. However, I am very close friends with individuals outside of my classes, and I find that the individuals in my class aren't quite the type of people want to be friends with. However, I appreciate your advice and am making an effort to be sociable in class too."



Now what you have done here is 1. agreed with them. As soon as you disagree with someone, you start arguing and nothing gets anywhere with arguing. Now that you've agreed with them, they are actively listening to what you're saying. 2. You've thanked them, assured them you are a social person but simply prefer to hang out with other individuals, and that you are hearing their advice and are making an effort (even if you really don't). This should keep them quiet!

You ignore them as much as possible.  People like this can wreak havoc on your career.  They are only out for themselves and out to cause as much trouble for anyone in their pathway.  The best and only thing you can do is ignore them as much as possible and the little interaction you have to have with them has to be as professional and polite as possible.  When you do have to interact with them keep it business only and do not feed into their negativity and manipulation. Realize exactly what they are and be 100% work when you are forced to be around them and ignore them the entire other time.  They are not a credit to the workforce and it will be discovered down the road and your good work will sooner or later be appeciated.  All good things come to those who wait.  Karma does rule this world.

get dirt on them and show it to somebody with higher power than your boss. but have evidence though.



sadly these people do start getting the boss on their side and if you two get in a fight the idiot boss is gonna take theirs. i feel you as I hate these @$$ kissing bastards too, but telling the manager wont help. tell whoever is above your manager and let them know about it.



my only regret at my ex job is that I quit before letting the people above my boss know how easily he's influenced and how this imbecile is getting by without doing anything. for people saying "ignore it", bad idea because they will keep doing that and then those that truly deserve to be acknowledged will "ignore it". but if you do decide to go up to someone with more power make sure to start looking for another job first though.

Say a prayer for them not be evil. Don't stoop to their level and be evil yourself, it's not worth your time or energy. Some people are just sad and nasty. Try talking and see if you can see a reason why they are that way. Usually people have been hurt so they hurt first at times so they won't be, I guess. You can reach out a little, give it a try, but please don't seek revenge, it'll just bring you down too. Good luck.

I don't believe there are any people who are truly evil. Everyone has "good" and "bad" in them. Even "bad" people can be understood and can deserve compassion if you take the time to understand why they act the way they do.



(I put quotes around the words good and bad because I don't believe these things exist absolutely; there are behaviors that help other people, which can be called good, and there are behaviors that hurt other people, which can be called bad. But I don't believe evil is a literal presence.)



The best way to deal with people who want to hurt you is to set firm boundaries. Treat all people with respect, but don't allow others to push you.

That question seems really broad.  First you have to understand that 'evil' is relative and may have a very different connotation  for different people.  If you are referring to someone who has different moral views or relegious views that doesn't really make a person evil in my opinion.  However, I think if you do feel strongly enough about thier behavior to refer to them evil you should probably do your best to avoid them.  Also remember to respect others opinions and beliefs, but I think using such a strong word as 'evil' implies you feel a strong enough distain towards them that you should avoid them at all cost.

Well I've been asked to attend an interview by the job agency at 11.45 am tomorrow. They called me an hour ago and said they'll send me the details of where the office is and where I should meet them. Problem is I have got nothing yet. If I get nothing now I won't be able to make it there on time tomorrow. What do I do? My agency consultant has gone home. I'm afraid this is gonna look really bad if I don't turn up to the interview.

The issue of personal space has alot to do with culture and how a person was raised.  Some countries don't really have the same concept of personal space that we, as Americans, are used to.  For example in Japan it isn't uncommon for people to get within 6 inches of your face on a bus or in a public or mass-transit type envoirment.  It's just part of thier culture.  Personally I would have felt the same way that you felt in this situation.  Personal space is very important to most people in order to feel comfortable, and can make a person feel very violated, even afraid, in certain situations.  This person most likely doesn't have the same opinion of personal space that you do, and it is most likely a result of a cultural difference between the two of you.  The most polite thing to do in this situation is to move to a different chair if you feel like your personal space is being invaded.

It is indeed an invasion of personal space.  It would be considered rude and quite wrong.  I would simply politely ask the person to move.  If they refused I wouldn't make a fuss but I would move my belongings without further words.  It is a library and there is a decorum of quiet that is to be maintained.
There are a lot of weird and uncommon people in this world who do things simply for attention.  Sometimes ignoring these people is the best thing to do.  If they won't move, being the bigger person and moving so you can continue your studies is the smartest thing to do.  However, you do need to get a good look at the person because there are a lot of weird people and you want to "watch" for them in future.

First of all, did the person come and select you out or is it one of those deals where they are nose-deep in a book and just grabbed a chair, not noticing the bazillion open seats?  If that is not the case, I usually grab my things, let out a big "humph" and oooobviously move to another table.  If you are working on something and have papers spread out, ask the person if they would mind moving to another table as you know that you are going to be shuffling things around and need more space-- also that you are trying to concentrate and would appreciate a little more room.  If they refuse either move (again, making it obvious how rude they were) or start sprawling and push back into their space.

I think we live in such a closed society. Yeah it's slightly odd that someone would sit next to you if there are a ton of seats...but I would welcome it. It's nice to meet new people and socialize. I don't really have issues with a "personal bubble." He may also be trying to hit on you. But for the most part i think we take these things way to seriously, when really it's just someone who is socializing with someone else.

"My boy", though weirdly old-fashioned and inappropriately familiar, is not racist.  "Boy" without the "my", on the other hand, is racist.  So if you do take offense, it shouldn't be on the grounds of racism.

This is when things can get "tense" at work.  You mentioned that he has worked at the company 8 years prior to you but is just a "co-worker".  He is not a "supervisor" or anything else and has absolutely no right to be addressing you in such a manner.  I would wait until the two of you were alone and no one else was around and in a professional and polite manner request him not to call you "My boy" and explain to him that YOU feel it is degrading and would prefer he doesn't call you by that title.  Tell him exactly what you expect him to call you and the matter should be solved.  Requesting it professionally and politely should take care of the situation without any problems and you should be able to work together in the future without any future problems.  Good luck!!

When you're being stalked, when is the best time to take action?



I'm not talking about cyber-bullying, I'm talking about real life. When do you think is the time when the stalker finally crossed the line, as if there's a line at all for stalking.

ASAP!  Why wait for the stalker to do some physical damage?  Will you wait for him/her to key your car or make you paranoid?  No.  So report their actions to the police or get a restraining order on them!  Wish you the best of luck!

notify the police the minute you feel that you are actively being stalked- there are usually anti-stalking laws put in place to protect you- don't wait for it to get worse

I think the best time is when you feel threatened or in danger.  Many women have guys who "stalk" them (trying a little too hard for a date, not letting go after a relationship/encounter, not being able to accept rejection).  But in all honesty, when you feel like your "admirer" is coming on a bit too strong for comfort, it's time to get law enforcement involved!

Stalking is something that shouldn't be taken lightly.  Stalking is a warning sign of unstable and possibly violent behavior.  Anyone that stalks most likely suffers from mental health issues of some kind and should be viewed as dangerous.  I'm sure that some people that have do this before may have been relatively harmless, but you need to make this situation known to the police and to those around you.



A restraining order is the most likely cure for your dillema.

As soon as possible. I had a stalker once and I wished I would have taken action sooner. No worries, I'm no longer bothered by him. But he wouldn't take no for an answer. I had to lie to him to get him to leave me alone. It's working for the time being. I haven't heard from him in ages.



Stalkers don't think that what they are doing is wrong no matter how much you explain it to them. If your stalker won't leave you alone, take legal action.

The first moment you feel uncomfortable is the time to take action.  Too many times people allow stalking to drag on and it could lead to you being hurt.  Notify your family, your friends and report him or her to authorities. Carry a loud noise maker or whistle and have your cell phone ready to call 911.  Try not to be alone as long as this situation if going on.

When did being a gentleman and a romantic go out of style?



For some reason, when you are a respectful and romantic man, who treats himself and others with dignity, you are dismissed as being "undateable".



On the other hand, if you are loud and ignorant, women line up around the block to be with you.



Why is that? Does that mean that I need to start being an idiot so that women will want to date me?

Is it ok for a boss to behave in this way?



suppose you joined a new job as an intern or trainee & your boss gives you a tough assignment to do - you complete it in time, but you make a few mistakes (since you are new and don't have sufficient experience). Then your boss while going through your work, spots those small mistakes & gets very furious at you for making those errors, blasts you, then tears apart your papers & throws them at your face.



Is this acceptable behaviour for any boss towards his subordinates?

No of course it's totally inappropriate.. He should have gone through the procedure with you again.. and pointed out your mistakes.. and then should have let you try once more.. that would have been constructive criticism.. which is a good thing.. from constructive criticism you learn how to improve if you make a mistake.. what he did will only make you afraid to do anything at all. Next time your boss does this again to you tell him that you are a trainee and ask him if he never made any mistakes in his life.. nobody is perfect.. quite apart from that.. tell him also that a life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable and useful than a life spent in doing nothing and if he criticizes you that harshly you will soon do nothing anymore of your own volition because you fear his wrath..., I don't blame you,. tell him  you want to learn and he has to give you time.. tell him if he ever heard of constructive criticism.. not of destroying someones self esteem.. Everyone can make some mistakes.. that's how we learn... he should show you how to do it better or appoint someone who trains you to do it better the next time.. instead of freaking out.

Is this typical normal behavior from a woman?



About my friend I was discussion in other quesitons. It looks like she's clear so far - however, somethiing doesn't sit right - you know? They are going out, she's not cheating nor using him. I talked to Dan about this and told him I still believe there is an exterior behavior. Dan is a great guy and I'm proud of him for obtaining his first exclusive girlfriend. She's so far what I gather a nice, friendly girl. However, I'm just concerned on her motive. I still detect anxious and nervousness. How I can tell is my knees are shaky-resulting from another person's vibrations or feelings. I can detect other's emotions and feelings - however, i can't read other's minds. True love isn't based about sex - i personally think the relationship is solidly base and deprives from sex which of course indicates unhealthy relationship if it is indeed only a sexual relationship. Sexual relationship also indicates Lust where Intimacy and Passion come into play- or just Intimacy. They have sex every night - and today she was smoking outside of our apartment complex. Tight jeans, and a black shirt. Which indicate Sexuality, Seductive. The black color meaning is Power, Protective, attracts Negativity. The way she answered her phone is a seductive manner. I was done smoking the loaded up my computer then went in the bathroom. I heard Dan's shower running, and knocking sounds. Everyone is in the apartment dismisses and thinks she's a nice person but me. Something's wrong here and I know it! It's not based upon True Love but rather Lustiful. The relationship will fail and even though I don't wnat that to happen to Dan - I might have too. I have no other choice but to let him see the truth. Men are usually blind in a state where they can think about humpy-humpy time. This is what is called P*SSY TRANCE - whereas a male can only think of a woman's gentials instead of her heart. Possibly, I'm detecting on her part selfishness and self-indulgence in what she wants. All though, people usually are selfish and indulgent, which includes so many people commit crimes.



I know in blooming of a relationship - everthing is based upon Sex. My opinion in the matter is that there should be at least a balance and if one out ways another it's not a usual sign of a healthy stable relationship.



Am I being paranoid or should I let Dan see for his own eyes?

Well it's hard to answer this question because I would need to meet these people to get a sense of it. I have learned to trust my gut instinct and the vibrations I get from people. And you talked about feeling a certain vibration. Perhaps you just have a different personality type than her and don't quite understand her yet. Or perhaps there really is something going on. Either way, she has given you no reason to not like/trust her, and so it's not your place to do anything at this point.



As the relationship continues, things will unfold and your friend Dan is a big boy and will be able to see if this woman is for him. If you actually catch her doing something else, then yeah maybe it's time to say something. But until then, it's important as a friend that you get along with her and support your friend because she has done nothing to make you feel that way about her. A big part about growing as a person is being in and out of relationships. Dan will learn for himself and grow as a result of it.



I know you said this, but keep in mind when a new relationship starts, hormones are flying and passion is high. Usually the first 3 months includes a LOT of sex. I know you know this, but it's important to remember that even though there is a lot of lust, it doesn't necessarily mean there is no love. After the 3 month mark, see if anything changes or cools down.

Do you find it annoying when you text someone....?



...then they turn around and call you?



For instance, I turned on my cell phone last night after having it off for a few days. A friend sent me a text saying that she wanted to stop by (it was from a few days ago). I replied saying sorry I missed you, but next time call on my house line...this way I won't miss you. Then she calls me right after! I found this a little annoying because I already said what I needed to say, and I didn't want to talk, hence the text.



It turned into an awkward and distracted (on my part I was busy doing something else) 20 minute telephone conversation.



Is this annoying or am I being a brat lol?

it was pretty much your fault because of what you said



you implied that she should call your house phone next time so that you don't miss her call. well, obviously you just used your cell phone to text her. so its on...and so why shouldn't she call it. its not like you're going to miss the call now, since you just used it to text her.



next time actually say "call my house phone from now on, because im saving my minutes, blah blah blah (whatever excuse)"  THEN if she calls the cell phone, its rude.

There really isn't anything you can do about it, except telling them you will call them later, at the end of the text. That gives you an excuse not to pick up. You can always say you forgot to call if you don't feel like it later on.

Im at a loss as to if these people are real friends?



I was in a destructive, abusive, violent unhealthy relationship, last sunday he was giving me silent phone calls on my house phone, came to my house monday and threatened to kill me and became violent, the thing is 2 years prior he sexually assaulted me and I never reported it to the police. I went to a rape clinic 2 yrs ago 24 hrs after it, I have now involved the police as I have made 2 statements last week to them regarding both incidents.



I am really dissappointed in 2 so called friends, infact they really havent been there for me at all. I feel isolated and alone, this eve both of the girls arranged to meet each other without telling me when I introduced them (when they dont know each other and met at my b.day)



They know full well what I have been going through.However one my so called best friend was meant to be coming to see me this eve but double booked to meet my other friend who she hasnt met before! and has now cancelled due to not having the energy to come see me because she thinks I live too far! however, she has a whole week off. I think her priorities are wrong. Hasnt really been there for me. I am so upset.help!

Is it wrong to play football with a kid if his dad is nearby, but 350 pounds and unable to really move?



I was at a party with mostly women there and some boy was sitting there all bored, so I offered to toss the football around with him. He loved it and all the moms looked on in appreciation. They even commented that I should have a son. Meanwhile, the kid's dad was in and out of the party, but he's a big fat guy (due to overeating largely) and I felt a bit bad because he was way too out of shape to do anything like that with his kid. The poor little guy seemed needy.



Was it wrong to show off my manly football skills at a party like that and make a kid's day, even though the dad may have felt like a useless blob?

Not unless you're making it obvious that you're doing something the father is unable to do. He can show his love and support for his son in other ways. I think it's a very sweet thing to do to take time out to make the boy's day!

It's perfectly fine. You're a nice guy who enjoys children. Just leave it at that. As long as you're not telling others that it's because the dad is fat and you feel sorry for the kid. Just say you're hanging out with your buddy.

I think it was very nice of you to do so with the kid, but I would have asked the dad if he wants to join you, that way you take care of the father´s feelings and you won´t feel guilty of anything.
After all, you asked him! if he refused, for ANY reason, it doesn´t matter, but you let it up to him to decide if that was ok or not.

I think if it were me doing the walking.  I would always walk facing where I am going.  Walking backwards would slow me down. So, I would not have to worry about walking back down sidewards.



The only possible exception is if I am backing away from some kind of danger.  I would want to keep my eyes on whatever the danger was until I was a safe distance away.



Thinking about how to answer your question has given me a slight headache.

What do you think of people who put on posh voices to answer the phone?



I had two friends who used to put on the most ridiculous phone voice. In my opinion this is cringe-worthy. Friend one spoke in a normal voice most of the time, as soon as the phone rang she put on this posh booming voice that made me wince. The second friend did exactly the same, except she would over pronounce words, such as Opposite would become Oppo-sight and vegan would become vagan. Anyone else do this, or know anyone who does it?

JUst tell them that the one thing we should all agree with is we need to Unite as a Country and since both candidates said they wanted to do this, we should all work to support our new Commander-in-Chief and bring this country together!



If this does not work then just drop the subject because they are sore losers and there is nothing you can say to be tactful.



If you remember back to Gore's election their party told the Gore supporters to just "Get Over It"  we need to show them that we are above doing the same to them.

Maybe it is best in such a situation to not discuss politics at all as there will always be those who are of a different opinion...but if you can debate with them peacefully and this won't end in an argument just a difference of opinion and political believes which are discussed maturely.. you know your friends best.. can they discuss maturely about politics or will this lead to a bitter argument if you mention that you are glad the Democrats won...then you should discuss it.. otherwise I would only answer them if they ask my opinion.. you have a right to prefer a different political party.. that is a human right.. you can make your vote and give it to the person you believe will do a better job...if asked I would tell them..  ''I didn't want to bring this subject up but as you ask me, I voted for the oppostion, everybody has a right to have their political beliefs, I respect that you don't share mine, so please be mature enough to also respect that I am glad that the Democrats won the election.''

You may say"Mr. Jones" OR if you know the first and last name you may say both "Mr. Robert Jones". don't use just the first name. If, during your conversation, he should say "Call me Bob", do that. Next time you call, ask for Bob Jones. When you call a company, especially a large one, the operator really needs to know first and last name if you have it to help you find the person you need.

When did being a gentleman and a romantic go out of style?



For some reason, when you are a respectful and romantic man, who treats himself and others with dignity, you are dismissed as being "undateable".



On the other hand, if you are loud and ignorant, women line up around the block to be with you.



Why is that? Does that mean that I need to start being an idiot so that women will want to date me?

I don't really know many women who do that, but I am not calling you a liar.  Young women are usually the ones that do that, but that is because they still haven't grown out of the adolescent teenager mindset.  Give it a few years after they turn 18, and I bet that they won't be like what you described.  Basically, women who just graduated high school and teenager girls will be like that, but that is just the way it is; it takes awhile in the real world before a girl becomes a woman ( mentally).  It is also one thing to consider that you just might not be an attractive guy to those women you can't do nothing about that either.

Please dont think women see you as undateable. your not  at all. and we dont want jerks we want real men who'll hold us and treat us right. and in return a Good woman and i stress that lil 4 letter word will do the same in return. Give it time Youll find the right woman for u. But if u act like a jerk youll only get hurt. i understand being good to someone and getting too close and then getting burned trust me.

You will see it in younger women who go for the "jerk".  The jerk acts and seems to get all the women, so he seems like he can be selective.  This makes him more attractive because then he "chose" the girl.  Think of it in basic economics, supply and demand.



The nice guy just seems so gettable, so the girl figures she can get him anytime, but she has to be really special to be chosen by the ever wanted bad boy.



It sucks and it is only later in life and after maturing (emotionally) the girl realizes she is a moron and that way of thinking was a crock.

Romance and manners are only part of the equation. Looks, attitude, and personality are all way more important.



Don't let any past rejections put a chip on your shoulder. "chicks can smell that on a guy the way dogs smell fear."



Be confident in who you are as a person and in most of the things you do.



Being yourself is also really important. You can't please everyone, but being yourself makes you real and makes chicks feel more comfortable around you Having a good sense of humor doesn't hurt either"



Put a little time and energy into your appearance. Go to the gym a couple days a week, wash your face twice a day, get some quality clothes that are in style today, take daily vitamins etc etc..



Do all that and then add manners and romance and you'll be fine..



There's a book called The Power of Charm. Its a great book for every social situation, whether dating, business, chatting with the neighbors, etc. It kind of provides the basics in becoming charming "in a very general sense."



Women only line up to date loud and ignorant guys if they're really good looking. And these guys usually mess it up "becasue they're loud and ignorant"

Sucks, man. There's not a lot you CAN do. It's your comfort zone. What you can try to do is start with your best friend. Try to make it a point to hug that person every once in awhile. Then as you get more comfortable, increase it. I know if it's a guy, he might be uncomfortable with it, but if he's your true friend, he'll understand if you tell him what's going on.



Or come find me. I give so many hugs a day I think nothing of it. I'll hug you until you're blue, lol.

To point out, I'm a very touchy feely short 17 year old.
If you have any close friends, you could try interacting with them differently till you get used to it, but nothing drastic of course as in something that would make them jump back and say "what the hell are you doing!?".
For example I greet various friends differently varying on age, gender and how long I have known them weather that be a high five, hand shake, poke on the nose, hug or kiss.
Also when your talking to them, you could try consoling, making various movements depending on the situation, putting your hand on the persons shoulder stuff like that which generally makes you feel closer. I tend to hold hands with a lot of my friends but that's something I do subconsciously.
Hope this helps a little.

I was raised in a family that was devoid of affection. I have, and I can swear this, never seen my mother and father kiss or hug a SINGLE time.



This is no way to raise a child. It is wrong. It is stupid. It can stunt the ability of a child to love, show affection and have normal sexuality.



The best thing is to experience touch in a healing setting like Reiki or Massage and then slowly with one special person learn to hug, kiss, lick, snuggle again as you were meant to be.



It is a hard road for those raised in broken homes or those consumed with religious puritanism. Muslims are raised like this with little public show of affection among them esp. with the opposite sex, and it reflects poorly on their culture.



Yet, as in Greece, kissing on the cheeks by males is a long standing part of Middle-Eastern and Mediteranean cultures.



Hindus also have an almost total taboo, at least the old hard-liners against what is called in the US military PDA or public display of affection which is an Article 15 offense!



Whatever.



Just remember that this can be overcome, but the slow steady way is the best. It requires total trust of the other person and this is not always easy.



However, you were created to love and be loved, to show and receive affection and to experience sexuality which is a foretaste of Heaven.



Therefore, do not deprive yourself by choice of what your parents or family or fate or religion deprived you.



Know the truth.



Where love is the union is sanctified....that means gay, straight,  no difference.



Where love is absent, the union is NOT.



However, even then sex for fun only is perfectly OK, normal and a great way to relieve tension.



People sometimes imagine God is against sex and glorifies the eternal virgin and all those lies.  Total hogwash.



God or Nature if you prefer invented sex and touching and love and kissing and all that goes along with it.



So what God has called good, let nobody call evil.

You don't want to be touching just anybody!
Explain your situation to the person or people you are going to have a "touching " relationship with. (people you will be shaking hands with,  people you will be hugging, the guys at your local 'fight club, people like that.)
But a lot has to do with your ability to trust people who want a touching relationship.
Find a friend and just let them hug you until you relax. The next time it won't take so long to relax. Slowly you will get used to being hugged.
And if all else fails go to a twelve step meeting and tell them you need some hugs.
Few people understand needing hugs as do people in twelve step meetings.
Please allow this to be the first in a long line of hugs.
The best to you.
Sincerely.

your not supposed to make eye contact with dogs, it is a test of dominance; but that goes with many animals.  If you look them in the eye, your not supposed to look away until they do. Dog trainers use that as a technique to teach owners how to make their dog obedient.  However, that is the only thing you can do to make your dog obedient.

I assume that there is more to this than you are sharing. People don't simply run up to people and punch them unless THEY think they have a reason.



That said.



You have three options... the polite society way to deal with it and the teenager who wants to survive high school method or you can simply pretend it didn't happen and forget about it.



You choose.



The first is to simply report the kid. Press charges and teach him that his behaviour is unacceptable in polite society. And so it is... BUT, that will get you ostracized and tortured until you manage finally to graduate and leave high school behind you.



The second option is to hunt this kid down and kick the living daylights out of him or die trying so that he knows that the next time, you will NOT be a willing victim. Bullies tend not to go after victims who give them a hard time back. Be vicious if you have to. The worst case scenario is that you get the living daylights beat out of you, and you could find yourself suspended for a few days but, you won't become a "target" for this other kid.



Finally, you can simply ignore the whole situation and pretend it never happened. Which I don't recommend unless and until you resolve the reason the kid punched you in the first place. If you "deserved" (based on teenage rules of course) to be punched, then you accept your punishment like a man and life goes on. BUT, if this kid punched you because he is a bully, then I suggest going with one of the previous two options, because this one will simply make you a willing target of the bully.



Source(s):



I have teenage kids who teach me the "rules of the schoolyard" everytime I try to teach them how polite society lives.



I recommend that until you graduate, that you live by the "rules of the schoolyard"... Being a pariah is not fun and just makes high school miserable.

Tell your parents and the school.  Your parents may also want to call the police to file a report (which they should).  Even if you don't know who it was, you should tell your parents so they can take appropriate action (calling police, etc.)



It's good that you didn't want to get into a fight, regardless of what others are saying on here.  People are nuts these days and it's hard telling how the fight would've ended, so you did the best thing you could in your situation.  Now follow thru and make sure the incident is reported.

How many times calling in sick is too many?



I'm a student working part-time on campus. I enjoy my job okay but today I am feeling crummy and it is raining outside (I walk everywhere) and I have two BIG assignments to finish.



I've missed two shifts since starting this job at the end of September. I don't like to do it because it leaves my boss scrambling to find someone to cover me but today it is so tempting to just text/email her that I'm under the weather.



Would this third time be pushing my luck?  I'm supposed to be there in an hour... ugh :(

An hour is not enough notice, and calling in 3 times in less than 2 months is ridiculous.  If you don't want the job, quit so that your boss can find someone who DOES.  Go work at McDonald's or something.  They expect people to flake out on them.

But if you are sick you are sick.  It sounds more like you just don't feel like going in though.  You shouldn't call in unless you really are too sick to work. Its not fair to your co-workers.

Yep, third time is the max.  You don't say what kind of job it is, but you say that someone has to cover for you.  So, you are putting your boss in a bad position.  I tell my employees (restaurant) if they want their job, they better be there and be on time.  I don't put up with people calling in sick or not showing up.  An hour's notice is not sufficient to get a replacement, and it puts a strain on everybody else to have to cover for the person not there.

Depends on the job.  Sadly there are jobs where you don't expect (at least as much) good attendence or low turn-over rates from employees.



Some decent signs:  If your attendence is becoming an office joke (or regular reference) you've already gone too far.  If you're not achieving your goals you've gone too far.  If you've been pulled aside and talked to (officially or unofficially) by supervisors you've gone too far.

Take supplements that can boost immune system and mental activity; like amino acid complex and Ginko Biloba for head and immune system.
Use a large cold water fish oil capsule as well.  Eat a good sized balanced breakfast, large lunch and small dinner to keep fat down and give enough energy that you will rarely get sick or feel washed out.

If you do call in, be a man and call her. texting or emailing makes you look lazy and i would fire you (maybe be a smart *** about it and reply to your text). Besides, it's crummy out, why not save a sick day for a nice day when you can enjoy it. Since you work on campus, you might be able to ask her if you can work on your homework during the lull times (rainy days are not busy depending on what you do)



It helps if you take into consideration she will need to cover for your shift, so a two hour notice (minimum!!) is considered respectful of her and your coworkers.



You can request to leave early, if your not feeling good. Showing up earns you credit



You should allow atleast a month to go by before calling in sick again. You do not want to appear lazy, or infection prone.



The day before you call in, try not to act lively and 'full of life', as this will not help your cause the next day when you claim to be on your death bed. Do not do it a Friday or Monday, the first or last few days of the month. Sometimes you need to call in two or three days in in a row, to indicate a serious illness. The day before you come back in, make sure you did NOT get plenty of sleep so you look like your still fighting it off. A cough syrup bottle full of red colored liquid can help your story. Again, do not abuse it, but every once in a while it is ok to play hookie.
Do it too often, and you'll not have to worry about it

1 is too manny if its not true don't do it you can get fired for being unreliable, then when you do need it you can't use it. Some jobs will give you a certain amount of sick leave this don't mean you can use them all. Let your boss make the call, most times they are sensible.

Who is supposed to pay for my birthday party?



Well I always thought that someone hosting a party should provide the drinks as a matter of etiquette. But I've been getting different opinions lately. For example, my friend recently went to a Halloween party that her friends girlfriend hosted and my friend and her boyfriend had to go through the hassle of buying their own bottles of liquor to bring to the party. I'm the one planning and throwing the party for myself so it seems as though I should pay, but it's my birthday!! liquor is rlly expensive and I don't think i should have to pay for this sort of thing, along with chips and cupcakes or whatever. but then again, nobody would plan a party for me and i'm worried that if i tell people to provide their own liquor then nobody will come.



i'm really conflicted.... i also had planned to ask my roommate to chip in to pay for liquor but she's been in a funk lately thinking that she's the only one who pays for stuff in the apartment (so untrue) and idk if i should still ask her. because it's my birthday party and not a house party/joint party, i only invited my friends so idk if she is still supposed to contribute if none of her friends are coming.



PLZ HELP!!

Well, of course since you are hosting your own party--you're stuck with most of the buying as far as food or liquor goes! I suggest you tell your friends (or those coming) to bring at least one food or drink item! It's not a rude thing to say at all, besides they should get it!

<question>



Was I being rude or was this just fair?



I am a math PhD student and I was looking for an apartment. Obviously, I was searching for anything cheap and run down. After I had been shown my place, the landlord asked me  if I was a "good student". Now this landlord is some office cubicle worker and I told him in advance that I was in the final year of my math PhD at the blue blooded research university in town. From my ID he could see that I am 24.  Is it not obvious that I am a "good student"? I understand that grad students are subhuman slaves, but is it not too much for a cubicle worker to insult me thus? I get paid less than a kindergarten teacher to teach college students; if I stop taking pride in myself, then I will have nothing left.



So I shot back at him "Actually I am fairly good at algebraic geometry; but I suck at harmonic analysis; is that a problem" Do you think I was overreacting?



As I said, if I lose even the sense of pride, what will I have left except $18000 a year (without employee rights either)?

I think you may have slightly over-reacted, but your landlord probably doesn't have the greatest people skills. He may have had one too many problems with other individuals your age, so perhaps he was being cautious. Anyway, everyone should be treated with respect, so it just seems like it was misunderstandings on both parts.

Let me first start off by saying that I am not a judgmental person, knowing who someone is voting for does not change my feelings towards a person. Like some of the other people I agree that it depends who is involved in the discussion.



I will most definitely discuss politics if it is with my fellow colleagues at the same level as me. Now if my manager or CEO of the company wanted to discuss politics, I would not completely walk away because that is disrespectful. Instead I would stay involved in the conversation on a low key.... maybe just listen or talk about pros for both candidates, so that no negative feelings are displayed.

Administrator.  As you can see, I am in no position to discuss ANYTHING, as everyone in here can get quite heated over this topic and I prefer to keep my opinions to myself.  Also not to mention, throwing 7 men in a room and me.... Miss Admin with my 2 cents?  Even if my point was valid, it would get a big fat "over ride" by the guys.  :P

If it's someone trying to CONVERT me to their point of view by shouting me down, arguing, judging, and only listening enough to get another talking point, I dismiss myself from the conversation. I'm not trying to convert them, and will not allow them to do the same.

You cannot possibly change someone that doesn't mind that kind of filth. There are people out there that just really don't care about cleanliness and there is NOTHING you can do to change them. You need to move, accept the filth or find new roommates. I personally could not stand to live like that and would have to move.

And the for the boys invitations have a big gold chain- obviously not real gold but just fake only cheap ones, and on the invite say they need these to get in. For the girls put a big pair of over sized sun glasses ! This will look really cool and everyone will be really excited when you give them these. Maybe dress up whilst you give the invites out? Like Posh ? Good luck and have fun at the party ! x

What do you think of people who put on posh voices to answer the phone?



I had two friends who used to put on the most ridiculous phone voice. In my opinion this is cringe-worthy. Friend one spoke in a normal voice most of the time, as soon as the phone rang she put on this posh booming voice that made me wince. The second friend did exactly the same, except she would over pronounce words, such as Opposite would become Oppo-sight and vegan would become vagan. Anyone else do this, or know anyone who does it?

I have got to be honest and say that yes I do have a telephone voice, although I can pronounce words correctly.  My father used to say that I sounded very English and correct when I spoke on the phone and why did I not talk like that all the time.  I used to be a GPO/BT telephonist so we had to be able to talk correctly and distinctly all the time.

Think it is less common now to do this but I know years ago lots of people did.  Now usually I think it's quite the opposite as when people answer it is usually just a  H U L L O  (Hello) and it sounds awful. I do have one friend who's husband's business is conducted from home with a recorded message and I am soooooooooooooo embarrassed for her and cringe beyond belief as in her attempt to be posh it just makes her look really ignorant.  You may think if I was a true friend I would tell her but believe me I have saw her wrath on others about different things and would not dare.  What I can't believe is that she has a grown up family who must hear what a fool she is making of herself.  I too have a grown up family and I know if it was me mine would be 'down on me like a ton of bricks' rather that let me carry on like that.

If they straightened the order & + give you 25% disc I would probably take it but yes you can change it, its proper etiquette the manager should know that + the customer is always right. + they messed it up they should pay, if not just get up & leave with the order on the table.

I suppose you could do that however at least they are offering you a 25% discount for their error.  Do you know how many places wouldn't even do that?  I would say take the 25% discount since all that happened was your order was messed up.  Mistakes do happen and they are trying to make it up to you.

My uncle (I'm not real close to him) is in the hospital.  His surgery was postponed due to complications.

I was wondering if I should get a gift or something for him.

bring him something to entertain himself with. it will show that your considerate and that you are thinking about him when your not there visiting.



if you cant think of anything, you can always bring a snack he enjoys but the hospital doesn't offer in the meal options. (ie. ice cream, cookies, snack crackers)



besides-- its going to be the thought that counts and the time your spending with him is probably what means the most to him right now. Your a good nephew.

Is it possible to turn down a triple-dog dare?



I've been triple-dog-dared by my friend (he dared me, I double-dared him, and he triple-dog-dared me). The triple-dog dare is both illegal and physically improbable. To be honest with you, I have neither the ability to execute it nor the bravery to attempt it. How do I get out of this? If I back out, what will the repercussions be, if any?

You can turn it down.  Daring is just a game between 2 or more people in the end.  I think keeping your record clean is worth more than the dare.  The biggest repercussion is that you'd lose your friend.  However, a friend who would support you doing something illegal isn't exactly a good friend.

This is a very good question.



Triple-dog dares are rare and difficult to execute. One out you may have is if in your double-dare you did not propose something illegal. You can call "illegal" triple-dog dare in this case and propose a legal one.



You can also pack your belongings and move to Guam.



There is one last, but extremely rare option of the quadruple-boomerang dare, but then, of course, your friend can quintuple-Shanghai you. There is a lot of risk in life, indeed.

He is 15 and this is just strictly against our religious and family's beliefs... but I violated his privacy... hmmm what to do?  Any viable way to report anonymously to someone who can do something?

i was wondering if a guy uses my name alot when he talks to me, does he like me?
i am 17. for example, in class he sits next to me and he always says, "melissa, did you get the answer?" or ends his sentence with my name for example, "i got the answer, melissa." or he just pokes light fun at me and says stuff jokingly but begins his sentence with my name.
in the past he has stared at me alot. he uses my name so much, i have counted 7 times in the past week and i don't really notice him do this to other people much. does he like me?

sounds  like  you  are  self  conscious.



its the  sort  of  thing  people  are  taught  to  do  by  professionals  in the  field  of  interpersonal  communication.



it  is  a courtesy  to use peoples names  when  you  first  address them  at  very  least.  two  or  three  times  in  the  course  of  a conversation may  seem  a  bit  much  to  you but  it may  be  that  you  are  oversensitive  to  it  right  now.



more  than 2 or 3  times in lets say  a  twenty  minute dialogue  is excessive  and  may seem  a little  creepy but  its  your  name.
there  are  a lot  worse  things  you can  be called

He kind of likes you, and is getting your attention by using your name.  If it bothers you, maybe he is the stalker type and is harassing you, be careful.  He might be the friendly type also, so in that case, just ask him to be quiet in the class if you don't want him bothering you.

in this world, there are givers and there are takers.  I have been on the receiving end many times and so when I can, I like to give.  If I order a pizza and you bring it to me in a reasonable time, smile and are friendly when I chat with you and pay you, you will get a tip.  If you smile and say no thanks, yes it saves me money but I would rather you take it as a small reward for doing your job well and being a friendly and decent at the same time and to let you know I appreciate your efforts.  Being in the service industry is hard, especially if you end up dealing with a$$holes a lot.  I am hoping at the end of your day, you will look upon my small tip and it will make the day just a little better.  That's what the tips I've earned have done for me.

The tip offered by the customer is part of your pay.  Your employer pays you a low wage with the expectation that your tips will increase your total compensation.  Do not refuse the tip.  It is like telling your employer that you don't want a paycheck.

It depends on what she likes. Think of something she really enjoys, and give her something that compliments that. If you're a good artist paint her a picture. If you're a good poet, write her a song, or poem. It's usually something a person makes that people remember until they die.

A guy invited his girlfriend over for dinner to meet his parents for the first time. From all the nervousness, and the brocolli casserole, the girls stomach was killing her. So finally she decided to try to let one go without anyone noticing. She let out a quick dainty little fart, everyone heard the little poof. The dad looked over at the family dog which was laying by the girls lap and in a stern voice said "Skippy!". "haha, Good" the girl thought. They think it was the dog. So she let out another fart, with less hesitation this time, a little louder. Again the dad looks at the dog and says "Skippy!!". The girl was extatic that she was able to let out her poofs & not be blamed for it. Finally, she let out a long, loud, full throttle fart. The dad once again looks over at the dog and yells "Skippy! Get away from her before she sh*ts on you!".

What am I doing??????????



So I was introduced to this really nice and sweet girl. Upon the first time meeting her I couldnt help but ask for her number of course I was alittle nervous but she gave it to me.



I proceeded to text her because I didnt wanna call her late when I know she works early but she did not get the text. But I foundout I was going to see her in a couple days anyways so I didnt call her over the weekend. We finally talked and she had told me she went out to some parties at this near by college.



I told her I had texted her but she said she does not get texts on her pre paid. So we ended up talking more and I ended up asking her if she wanted to hangout this week and she said yes. So that night I called her and we talked about thursday. It was kinda late so we only talked for like 20 minutes. A couple days later I called her again to discuss the plans and where we are meeting and everythings cool. She had told me she had went out the night of the election to a rally. Maybe I was being a bit noisy but I asked if she went with alot of people or whateva and she said it was last minute and her and like 7 people went cause her friend called her up and I guess him and all them went. The conversation went on and we ended up talking for like an hour on the phone and then finally got off.,



ha after it was all said and I done I wasnt sure about it because I feel she may go out alot and im not sure about this whole "him" thing. I mean I asked her if she was seeing anyone and she said no and id assume she would be up foward. We juss started talkin so its not like I dont talk to other girls or whateva But I dunno is that kind of odd or am I looking too far into it???



Basically what im asking is also would a girl tell you if she was seeing or dating someoneelse and wanted to date u also???



I dont kno why I jumpted to the conclusion maybe cause I was drunk and high and it seemed odd she went out to some rally all at the last minute with some guy and 7 people. I mean shes not my girl but I am juss trying to know early signs to prevent bad things from happening due to my past relationships which kinda scared me!



</question>



<additional details>



ha nah I juss dont want to be "that guy" if shes not interested!!! having friends is totally fine 100%

For one, cut back on the drinking and weed so you can have a clear head when you talk with her.  You don't need to be wasted to have courage.



It looks as if you're building the beginnings of a relationship with her right now.  Have some confidence.  Don't worry about the "other guy" if there even IS one.  Make a date with her for something short and simple and just talk more in person.  It's up to her if she wants to be with you.  If she's willing to keep seeing you, you'll know when the time is right to make a commitment not to get serious with anyone else.



It sounds as if you're off to a good start.  Don't blow it by overthinking, or asking questions that make you look like you're insecure or the jealous type.  Good luck!

I don't know what to tell you, personally I have been in both situations. Just recently actually, this girl I was spending a lot of time with said she was single; nevertheless we started making out at a party. Later on, however, I realize she has a boyfriend already. I personally do not feel comfortable being "that guy" either. I think this sounds genuine though.

You are normal apart from the hard drugs.



The drugs are probably whats preventing you from getting a job. And I am almost certain you smoke pot before interviews. Do not. do that.

It's only humane and virtuous to do so. I'd even go down the middle.



First, if you didn't, that may REALLY affect your relationship with that person, and it also says a lot about you as an individual.



The guilt you may feel if you don't might come to haunt you, or make you a bitter, greedy person.



Then again, if you do, not only will the both of you be merry as heck! You'll both grow a bit closer to one another, and what either of you does with the money will forever be in your memories.



Be it investments that get you GAGILLIONS in the future, a luxurious, self-satisfying life, fulfilling your dreams, doing greater good for the world and the people in it.



The joys in being righteous are limitless. It's just how you choose to live it is what defines you.

I this an insult? Should I have stood up for myself?



I am a 24 yr old math PhD student who is graduating this year. I had known someone in the university administration (non academic) for a while and I was telling her excitedly about my first 3 yr visiting prof job from which I was taking leave for 2 yrs to work under a very famous professor in france who is a fields medalist (highest prize in math).



She asked me how much I would make and I told her it was 2500 euros a month, which works to abt $38000 a yr. Of course, I was apologetic at how little that is (in any case, visiting profs in the US get paid abt $50K and europe pays less... about $38K) She looked at me and said patronizingly... that's ok ... after paying house.... car etc... we only have that much left...you have a great salary don't worry.



Now, i don't get this: AFTER house...car payments ...she has abt $38K left. And I am getting only $38K. So... ? Don't I have a right to have a house or a car? She does not even have a PhD. Is it not an insult for her to say it to my face as though I should be lucky to earn anything at all?



Having been a PhD student for 3 1/2 yrs, I am used to insults. I smiled sadly and walked away. But now that I have a PhD, I think things should really change just a little. Someone with a Bachelors from a very ordinary university, who has worked up her way through the system by pushing files for 30 yrs, should not be able to treat me like a piece of trash. Should I have stood up for myself?



</question>



<additional details>



hello.. I have heard PhDs described as "booksmart" before, but "dimwitted"? Are you sure? I am not saying I am better than anyone, i am just saying that support staff should not think of me as trash.



and moreover, i never expected her to be my "personal handservant". In fact, I respect this specific person a lot and love her too ...and I would describe myself as "close" to her. It's just that I feel that I should be treated a little better than trash now that I have a PhD. Don't get me wrong, but I do actually have more achievements than the avg person. I don't see why I cannot get the same respect every single working person is supposed to have.

"Having been a PhD student for 3 1/2 yrs"
"pushing files for 30 yrs"



So she has been working for longer than you have been alive, and you think it was an insult that she makes more than you.



it was not an insult for her to say she makes more than you if its the truth, and you shouldn't expect a PhD to magically give you a high paying job right off the bat.  Having any kind of education just puts you at the front to get job opportunities, but it takes time and experience in the field to get the higher pay grades.

The question as to how much you were going to be earning should never have been asked never mind answered.  You should have politely told her you would prefer not to tell her your salary (that is just plain wrong of people to ask that).  Don't worry....you are just starting out and at an entry level salary but you have  a great opportunity here and great earning potential so don't let her attitude get to you.  She also said "we" only have that much left....she is talking about a combined income here not her income.  People in all walks of life come across people like this....just let it roll off your back and be proud of your own accomplishments and hard work.

First, I agree that your shouldn't have been discussing salary int he first place.  While I do think that her comment was not the most considerate, I would worry about your attitude that you have a "right to a house and a car".  Both of those a privileges, though I imagine you will have both fairly easily if that is what you care to pursue.  "Someone with a Bachelors from a very ordinary university, who has worked up her way through the system by pushing files for 30 yrs, should not be able to treat me like a piece of trash." makes it almost sound like you feel that you should be able to treat her like trash instead.  Congratulations on your opportunities and don't compare yourself to others.

Please don't take this the wrong way, as it probably was not your intention, but you really sound full of yourself, while at the same time having a lack of self confidence.



First of all, it's inappropriate to discuss your pay with anyone but your spouse, your financial consultant, your payroll department, and your advisor.



Secondly, why did you apologize for how much you were going to make?  Maybe she was genuinely trying to reassure you that you would be able to make your living expenses and NOT trying to be patronizing.



Third of all, why do you care what she makes?  Again, it's inappropriate to discuss financial matters with other than the above listed.



Fourth of all, you are not better than your University support staff, in spite of the alphabet soup behind your name.  Support staff bust their butts to provide support to all of the dimwitted, booksmart PhDs who don't know the business end of a stapler and expect everyone who doesn't have a prestigious degree from a prestigious university to be their personal handservant.  How DARE you invalidate her hard work for her Bachelor's Degree from her "ordinary" university by even bringing it up as a qualifier as to whom is allowed to treat you like trash.



By saying that about her, you just did the very same thing she accused you of.



Let me give you a life lesson right now.  Be proud of who you are and all your hard work, but do NOT look down on others who are not as privileged to be able to afford graduate school or even community college, and who do honest, hard work for a living.  Without them, you would have no job.



I have a Bachelor's Degree from a good school and I work in the community college system, not for pay, but because I like what I do, the people I work with, and I love watching the students in my department following their dreams.  Perhaps you are just jaded from being in school for so long.

I don't think she meant this as an insult; however, she probably just didn't see how rude it was. Discussions about money and salaries never seem to end well.



From your description, I believe what she was trying to say is that as it was a visiting position, and you were not purchasing a house and probably not purchasing a car for the length of your stay, then it wasn't bad. However, people fail to realize that other living expenses such as renting and transportation add up just as quickly, if not more so, and leave us with no equity in the end.

You yourself tend to put people into different piles. For ect. "Someone with a Bachelors from a very ordinary university, who has worked up her way through the system by pushing files for 30 yrs"  That is a
very snobby way of looking at it. Not everyone wants a PHD, some people want to live their life differently.  And no one owes you any certain amount of money just because you wanted to get a PHD. That is your choice, your hobby, your thing.  The money has to come from some place.  If you own a burger stand and sell a lot of them for whatever reason, maybe they are  great, maybe the location is great, it doesn't matter, and you make a lot of money more power to you. I don't care what degree that guy has or not.



You are not better than her because she has a Bachelors from a ordinary university. Just because some guy wants to get 3 PHD's does that make him better than someone with 2 . It's a personal choice. Achievements can be measured in a lot of way. Piling up on degrees is just one way. Some people arent even given the opporunity to rack up labels and credentials. Maybe someone has no degree but took care of a sick parent.  That achievment in my book is way higher than a ton of degrees.  But you wont see a piece of paper, or any award for it. But if the money isn't there, it isn't there, no one owes you just because you wanted to get a PHD. All that said.  So what.  Who is she.  If you are happy, then that's all that matters.

It is but you have to make sure that it's not a flashy suit or too fashionable (nothing is more embarrasing than a Versace suit worn a year too long). You need a good quality classic suit in a dark colour.

The Diversity Ethic
The Diversity Ethic is beyond mere tolerance, but it is not capitulation or subjugation. Even if we believe that all those of other beliefs are taking a path of ignorance or doom, we can still maintain that belief, and voice it openly, as this right is included in the Diversity Ethic.
The ethic consists of eight parts and is as follows...



1) I will be honest and open about all of my beliefs, defending my rights - even if I believe others or their beliefs to be wrong and even if others could be offended by my beliefs.



2) Without sacrificing my content, I will always phrase my statements with sincere care to be sensitive to the feelings of others - not to belittle or offend for its own sake.



3) When others attempt to be respectful to me in stating their beliefs, I will refuse to take offense, no matter how these views compare to my own. I will look only at the speaker's intent to be offensive, rather than the content of the message.



4) I will be open to working and interacting with those of other beliefs in a cordial manner. I will consider them as equals and treat them humane and friendly. I will never advocate isolationism or segregation.



5) I will not only tolerate, but support the rights of others to voice their beliefs by the same standards and rules I am allowed to voice mine - promoting freedom of speech for all.



6) I will never attempt to use the power of the state to give unequal advantage to my religious institutions and beliefs (or the lack thereof).



7) I will seek out unbiased knowledge about the religious beliefs of others, and not merely learn about them through people of my own belief system. I will try to truly understand what others believe from their own words, even if I do not share those beliefs.



8) I will hold to the Diversity Ethic even when others do not. I will not take another's disregard for these principles as a pass to do the same. My civility and standards, however, will not keep me from advocating my views or defending universal rights.

get his badge number/name and file a formal complaint, it's sexual harassment even if he's wearing a uniform. However, isn't left right generally a marching thing? It's still kind of shady though, so if you felt it was meant in that spirit and were offended by it, he'll at least get a note put in his file or something if you complain.

Halloween Party dare - I wore an costume that amounted to an extreme micro-kini?



My cousin and 2 friends went to a Halloween party. We all wore costumes.  To make a long story short, I tend to get kidded for having a kind of 'over-developed' figure and ppl think I am sensitive about it, and i accepted a dare to wear this sort of 'costume' to the party.  It amounted to a silver-colored micro-bikini, if even that Like a tenth the size i got in the pic, the top is like postage stamps with string , a gstring below. maybe some ppl wojuld think it was pushing the limit.  I  wore a robot mask that totally covered my head, face and hair, hiding my identity really.  we had a table, I even danced with my cousin a little.  I didn't speak out to anybody so my voice was hidden.
You could see ppl were like wow what is she doing like they can't believe it.  I am wondering  some know us and guesed it was me.
What do you think?  Was it a good idea?  should I say it was me if ppl bring it up sometime?



My cousin and friend were very cool about it.  But I want other opinions.

People can probably guess.  There's a lot people use to identify individuals, besides voice, face, and choice of clothes.



Of course, you've got some plausible deniability if you don't want to be that girl.  So admit it if you're proud, or ignore it if you're embarrased.

Do you tip when when the food or service doesnt measure up?



I always leave 20 percent.  I don't think it is my job to grade the server or the food with money or reward.  The servers job is to bring me food when i ask for it....and not to jump through hoops for me and make me feel presidential.  If the food is bad, then I complain to the management and not the server.  I wont pay for food if it is bad but then again, I don't go to places that have bad food typically.  Tipping is part of dining and should never be ignored.



I think people don't tip because they talk themselves out of it by saying a server was rude or not efficient.  The server is just there to bring you food when you order it and really nothing else.  In fact, I prefer them to leave me alone especially when I am in a personal conversation.  If you dont tip, I would like to know why.

I was a server for many years and understand what you mean.  I would do my best to make the food better if you let me know.  I would take it back and have the cook change it to your liking.  If the customer doesn't open their mouth, the server doesn't know something is wrong.  When I ask you "how is everything?", that's your opportunity - use it.  Don't stiff me.

I always tip- sometimes more, sometimes less, but I always leave something.  The tip is for the service aspect only- if the server never shows their face to refill my drink and just plunks the food and check down, they'll get something- just less something!  Issues re food are a management issue so I would not penalize the server for that.

I have this rule of thumb, if the service is great; I tip 20% or more; if it's mediocre, I tip 15%; and if it's poor, 10%.  If they're down right rude, I tip them $1.00.  If it's the food, I would simply say, "The service is wonderful but the food, not so good."  They will usually accommodate you.

Food problems are not the server's fault.  As long as the server tries to take care of the issue, then he'll get a tip.



For bad service, I leave 10-15%.  The service has to be pretty bad, however. For good service, 15-20%.  Sometimes more.

If the food is bad.. I always tip.. not the waiters/waitresses fault. HOWEVER, if the service is crap... I NEVER tip. And I mean I will not. That is in their control and how they talk to me, treat me, and are there if I need them is up to them.. and tips should be based on that.



If the service was okay.. meaning they were polite at times and then just mean or weird.. then a little tip.



I base tips on service never on percentages and what society tells me to tip and I answer the same way for the numerous tip questions on here.



It doesn't matter where you go.. if the food is good.. then the service might be different that day.. so going to "safe" places doesn't help.

I think the quality of the food is not the fault of the server so I would address it to the management and not not tip the server. That doesnt seem fair to me. But tips, to me, are in accordance with the type of service I get from the waiter/tress. I will always tip, but there can be some seriously rude servers who ignore you or are openly taking their bad day out on you. I dont deserve that. When I go out to eat, it is a fairly rare occasion since I dont have much money and time is limited so its a treat for me. Life hands me crap on the daily, I dont need to go to a restaurant and get crap and bad attitude from the person who is being paid to treat me at least half way decently. I dont expect serious as* kissing, but I dont need my server rolling their eyes at me either.

A tip is not an assumed part of the bill.  It is a gratuity for good service.



While I agree with what was said about poor food quality not being the server's fault, it IS their responsibility to try to make it right.  If they ask how things are and you tell them that something is not right, they should try to fix it.



As some people said, tips should be 15-20% just to bring the food out and leave you alone; then what are you tipping for?  I would expect that they refill my drink (or offer at least), check how things are 1-2 times, be punctual with the food, and be polite.  If you don't do that, your tip drops.



Waiters and waitresses are part of a service industry, their tip is based on that service, not providing a bare bones minimum.

i ALWAYS tip in restaurants. not that i'm a fan of tipping. but like you said, its just something that has to be done.



now one case that i don't tip, in when i order from a local food place here in town, and the particular driver, for one reason or another, decides he's too lazy to bring the food up to my apartment (like all the other delivery drivers do) so he calls me to come outside and meet him in the front of the complex. this pisses me off. if all the other drivers can do it why can't he. the first time this happened i was surprised, so i asked him if that was typical and he told me that it is typical and that they never bring it up to the apartments as if it were some sort of policy. (blatant lie). so i just tip that particular guy ZERO. but i tip everyone else who actually brings it up to me so i dont have to wait on the corner outside in the cold.



this is a perfect case of someone not doing something because it inconviences them a little, and they think they can make deliveries faster if they don't and save 10 seconds of time. but that tiny bit of laziness cost them a 15-20% tip.

The last time I didn't tip was when we waited 45 minutes for the waitress to come to our table fort the first time and another 2 1/2 hours for the check and to pay and her overall snotty attitude throughout which was so bad we mentioned it to the mgr who said she had to fill in at the last minute for someone who didn't come in. Now, that is not my problem and if she was going to be a b*tch about it then she should not have agreed to do it in the first place I had to work many double shifts when I waitressed and I never took it out on the customers.

I always tip. I know sometimes people do it as a rate I know one of my co-workers says he puts a $20 on the table and tells the waiter/ess that its theirs unless they don't do a good job then he starts to subtract from that $20. Which I think is wrong. Someone would have to do a really really bad job for me not to tip them. I mean its not the waiter/ess fault if the food is bad. But if they don't do their job well or have an attitude and my dining experience has been awful due to them, then I wouldn't tip. But that has only happened once & I wasn't paying so I didn't have to worry about the tip.

my husband I dont tip i would prefer to pay extra for the food honestly im not giving you 15 dollars on a 100 dollar meal b.c you were smart enough to do a job you chose.sorry people who wiat dont get paid enough but thats not my fault I would much prefer to pay extra for food and if we tip then we are paying the bill of the restaurant.so the owner  can have a new lexus. its sad that people are guilt tripped into tipping. those of us who went to college  and actually have jobs that are a bit harder than being able to refill tea and bring you a plate of food they did not make barely make 15 dollars an hour.

No, I don't remove money from the money supply by throwing it away, being that every penny is a loan that someone is going to have to pay back to the banks. The money pool is shallow enough as it is. It is rude and selfish and it's illegal.  Removing money from the supply makes it impossible for more people to pay their debts off.

<question>



The girl who takes me to school is a HORRIBLE driver!?



She is a junior, I'm a sophomore. We have 0 period so school starts for us at 6:45 (there are only two 0 period classes, so I can't carpool with anyone else). She ran at least 4 stop signs on the way to school. She drives 10 MPH when it's 25 and goes about 45 on the freeway (the speed limit is 65 and traffic is going about 70 usually). School is about a 7 minute drive from my house (2.5 miles) and it took her 25 minutes, she drives so slow! I don't know how to confront her about it because I don't want to make her mad. What can I do to get her to drive normal and safely?



</question>



<additional details>



Oh, and she also has started to take a private road to school instead of the freeway, on which the speed limit is 15, so we are ending up late to class.



Rah- Haha, that is a good one actually, it made me laugh :D



David: Yeah, I can't legally drive her until I get my license in February when I 'm 16, but sophomores can't have a parking permit at school, only juniors and seniors.

well, say "we're gonna we late if you keep driving so freaking slow!"
and then point out the stop signs that she missed so that she will stop from then on. that might help her hurry up some
or, you could ask her if you can drive when you get your learners but i think she has to be 18 for you to do that (but im not sure)
thats what i would do but i wont get mine till february : (

This behavior is unsafe and is also causing you to be late to class. You should discuss this with your parents, to see if another arrangement can be made to make certain you can get to school safely and on time in the mornings.

Tell her that she has to speed up a bit. Maybe she just doesnt know what the limit is. But try to be nice about it because she might get frightend by the fast movement of the car or she may just have a mayjor faer of crashing. just tell her shes doing great but needs to speed up a bit. That will give her some confidence so she might feel a bit more secure in the car. and if just wont speed up then just simply say when you pass a spd limit sign "hey the limits ..." this might give her the hint (i do that with my grandma allot when shes driving me to mall)

I decided one of my friends isn't invited back...am i being to sensitive?



i live alone with my cat. i have a friend who comes over from time to time and anyone who knows me knows my cat is like my daughter. when he is over he will keep shoving his finger in her face yelling stuff at her and she is hissing getting ready to attack (and she will attack if you don't back off when she tells you to). if she is playing with her toys he keeps yelling at her saying you are the worst hunter ever and you will never make it if you were outside. if i feed her and she doesn't run right away he'll yell at her are you to stupid to know what that noise means yet and if when i open the door to leave and he goes too he'll keep the door open for a minute yelling stuff at her and i have to push him out and shut the door before he lets her get outside. i have told him many times to knock it off and leave her alone but he think hes cool to keep harassing her. he is 25 so its not like he is some young kid. after the last time when he left i decided if he is going to come into her home and treat her like that he is not allowed back over. she is normally friendly to everyone comes over but starts hissing as soon as she sees him and i will not allow anyone to treat her like that. am i doing the right thing?



</question>



<additional details>



maya, incase you missed the part of i have told him to knock it off, that was talking. and when i said my cat is like my daughter, what would  you think if i came into your house talking to one of your kids like that?

Good question. I don't believe you are being too sensitive. You told him that you didn't want him to bother your cat, and he did it anyway. Most people understand that you:
1) Follow the rules people set out when visiting their home
2) Don't pick on your host's pets
You did the right thing by making a boundary. You must protect the pets in your home. Well done.

Religions of all different types have taught us to be ashamed of our bodies.



Thus, by proxy, nudity is bad.  There's nothing "wrong" with it - but if you do live with your parents, follow their rules.



When you have your own home, you're not only allowed, but encouraged to be as naked, or as clothed as you want to be (with the shades drawn) as often as you like.

Well, how old are you? Do you have siblings? I don't know about you, but when I was a teenager, I wouldn't have wanted to see my younger brother naked, or have him see me. When you aren't a kid anymore, it's just not appropriate. When you live alone, you can be naked at home all you want, when there are other people involved, you should be respectful.

Its not necessarily a bad thing if you're in your own house but if you are living in your parents house then you must respect their rules.
Try to look at it from their perspective. They probably dont wanna see your nude body any more than you want to see theirs. Especially if you're older than say 10.

Because they're superficial. What you do in your house, is your business. If they dont like it too bad. My husband and I walk around nude all the time (not for intimate purposes). There is nothing wrong with it. Its free and invigorating. Like "im the queen of my turf  and can do whatever I like"  kind of feeling. You should try walking around nude all day sometime.

Well there nothing seems to be wrong with that.
Actually it's fun and you feel free and comfortable when sleeping.
The bad side is, as other people mentioned, it could be your house rules, or in an emergency how you suppose to get out of the bed. But if it's fine with you to run naked, it doesn't really matter. But as long as you live with your parents, you have to agree with them.

Since you try to clothe yourself normally, it's obvious that folks wear clothes in your house. A home is a shared space, and the actions of each person impact the other folks. You probably wouldn't like it if you dad went stalking around the house on Saturday afternoon stark naked. There is a time and place for everything, and being naked is for your private moments. It's not the end of the world that you were naked once. They'll get over it.

If it is your house and you are the only one in it then there is nothing wrong at all. However in your parents home you really need to respect their rules. As this was a one off then just apologize and let it go. I can't imagine how you could forget to put a robe on though.

Question for men (Adults 20+ please)?



Do men prefer to do the "chasing" when they like a woman, or do they find it a turn off when a woman "chases". (I know there is a fine line between being aggressive and being needy/obsessive).



I also know this is a modern society, so it may seem odd to ask this question.



But I have heard some argue that men are "hard wired" to prefer to be the chaser or aggressor and so I thought I would go to the source themselves (men) and ask you all for your Gods honest trust on this.



Thanks guys!

When I was in my teens and twenties I did the chasing but now I'd prefer if the woman made the first move, the second move and maybe the third.  If there's nothing happening on her end, I think she's either not interested or here we go again, I have to do it.  This happened to me two Christmases ago, needles to say, the whole show only lasted six days, the shortest relationship in modern history.

Hi,



First make sure whether the company already included gratuity in the total price, if so you can add an extra 5-10% cash tip but you're not required to.



If gratuity is not included in the total bill, 20% is good.

It depends on where the service was performed, whether the driver did a good job (such as being on time, polite, a good driver, and etc.), whether the driver did anything extra, the length of the ride, and etc.  If there was nothing out of the ordinary, good or bad, I would probably tip 15-20%.

Is it wrong for someone to end a friendship over an opinion/belief you dont agree about?



to voice your opinion to someone and just because they do not agree with you they end your friendship? it makes no sense to me....arent we all entitled to our own beliefs and opinions without being persecuted and threatened an end to a friendship? any thoughts?



this has to do with prop 102 i was just having a discussion about it with one of my friends (whom is gay) he asked me why i am for the prop and i told him my reasons and he said "The fact that you religiously believe that my love is invalid is something I accept because of you have the right to feel that way but the fact that you are fighting so ferverently to write this into law disgusts me as an American and as someone who used to identifies as one of your friends." i dont think that was right for him to end a friendship when he asked me for my own reasoning.... what do you think



</question>



<additional details>



my reasoning was not offensive plus if he didnt want to know my reasoning he should not have asked. i dont think it is right to base a friendship over opinions...because if that were the case then no one would have any friends...



Jessie D: you can befriends with someone and not beleive in something they believe in im christian does that mean i cant be friends with jewish people or catholic peple? no it doesnt but religions have their own beliefs that doesnt mean we cant be nice or friends with eachother its not hypocritical at all..im not basing my choice for prop 102 solely on religion, it also has to do with taxing. which is a reason that i brough up with him and really i dont care if you wouldnt want to be my friend. cuz i dont know you.



also i didnt want to point out my beliefs because i didnt want to get attacked here from total strangers i dont even know. plus that is not the question at hand it was if it is reasonable to end a friendship because you dont agree on an opinion of another friend....



no im not one of those people that think gays just want a tax break but my reasoning has to do with different type of taxes.... i was not hateful towards him, i gave my opinion and instead of accepting my opinion he insults me, my church's beliefs, and my standards. THATS when it turned into a fight. i told him "out of respect for you i wanted to wait to tell you my reasoning until you asked me to tell you" i didnt push the issue i was not forceful or mean.....



great NOW im pissed off....he has officially crossed a line hes sending people to my email that i dont even know to bash me and attack me! this is getting too out of hand!!!

Sounds like that guy is a pretty sensitive person.  Then again, the issue is particularly sensitive to him, so maybe the friendship wouldn't work out anyway.



One of the answerers above was right - you have a religion and personality, and if people can't deal with it, it's their loss.  Especially if you're pretty set in your ways about the opinion.

It sounds like your friend, if you can call it that, is offended that you feel his relationship is not valid because you don't agree with him. Doesn't sound like your friendship was all that strong to begin with, so perhaps this was going to happen anyway. Avoid discussing politics with people who take it personally.

If it's a disagreement that's so big it would hinder you from being friendly to each other or able to enjoy each others' remaining qualities, it might be best to call the friendship off.  Sometimes the issue or topic can cool off after a while and you and your friend may be able to get back to "normal".

It is hard to be friends with someone who has a different fundamental belief system. It creates distrust and suspicion. I have had to end friendships because of the ethical decisions my ex friend made--just because I knew I would never look at her the same way and would never be able to fully trust her again.



The fact that he asked you what you felt may indicate that he wanted to know where YOU truly stand on the issue, rather than just what your party or church or whatever believes.



This person is obviously hurting and instead of articulating his views kindly, he attacked you. Maybe depending on the results of the election you two will be able to get over this.

How are you friends with him in the first place if you feel that strongly about it????  Isn't that being a hypocrite?  Anyway, religion and law are two very different things and although you believe that gay marriage is wrong you should let people live their lives any way that they want.  Gays are going to be together no matter what; what is so wrong with letting them be legally married to each other?



I don't blame him.  I wouldn't be your friend either.



======================================...
I'm just saying, gays shouldn't be punished and not have the same rights as a straight person because of religious beliefs, thats ridiculous.



======================================...
If you feel that strongly about his life choices YES I think it is right that he ended the friendship.  That's a pretty big deal.



You're asking the question "Is it okay to end a friendship over an opinion/belief you don't agree with".  You worded it so it would be in your favor.  That could mean a lot of things......like I want to buy a new car and I want a red one but my friend thought I should buy a black one.  She ended the friendship because I wouldn't buy a black car.



What you're talking about here is a lifestyle choice.  How can you be friends with him and not want what is best for him?

It seems to me that this is just another case of religion ruining lives.  Because of your beliefs, you are not able to fully accept him the way he is and he wants to know that his friends like him for him.  You are not fitting the bill, so to speak.



I had this happen to me as well.  A woman I'd been friends with for nearly 20 years decided suddenly that because I did not have the same religious beliefs she did that she could not be my friend any more.  I broke my heart.

He obviously found your reasoning very offensive.  I would too, and I'm not even gay.  I know I wouldn't be able to be friends with someone who thinks that I don't deserve the same rights as everyone else.  We do live in a secular country, so religion has no place in law anyway.



Edit:  Just because you don't think your reasoning was offensive doesn't mean you're right.  Wouldn't you think it was offensive if he said he thought you shouldn't have the right to get married because you're straight?  And before you go on a fundie rant about it not being the same, he no more chose to be gay than you chose to be straight.



The bottom line is, you chose faith over friendship.  Deal with the consequences.



Edit 2:  What about taxing?  Please tell me you're not one of those people who thinks gay people only want to get married for tax breaks.

you didn't exactly tell us what you told him and your reasons so we can't give you our full opinions...but I think he is doing a great thing. With him knowing that you are "fighting so fervently" against his beliefs would only make it awkward between the two of you. To him it more than likely seems like you don't care about him.That he doesn't deserve to be able to legally marry the person he loves and be happy. I'm not gay and I'm totally okay with people who choose that lifestyle. We are all entitled to our beliefs. From his reaction, I'm assuming that you may not of said it in the nicest way (tone, word choice etc.) If you really want this person as your friend, think about it. What did you say and how did he react to each part? Find a way to state your opinion without offending him. Remember, you have to be open to his opinions/choices/beliefs just as he needs to be open to yours. Listen to him and hopefully he will return the favor. Hope this helps.



Edit:  It is not sensible to end a friendship merely on an opinion or belief. That said, people take things differently. If I were to tell an immigrant that I wanted them to go back to where they came from(I don't, just an example), I'm fairly sure they would be upset by that. Then my tone and body language would also add to it. If I was in "fight mode", defenses up with an accusatory tone they would probably take it worse than if we were just sitting around, talking in a relaxed setting and I said something like "I don't like the way immigration is handled and I'm voting for a change", that person would probably take it nicer. They may still be offended because that decision will effect their life, but it wouldn't have as harsh of a reaction as the first scenario. I'm not trying to attack you, I promise. All I'm asking is for you to think about the conversation you had with your friend. Think about the points that offended him and try to find a way to reword those points so it will soften the blow. Then, if you really want this person as a friend, talk to him. If he won't talk to you, email/facebook/text/myspace him... so he will be sure to get your opinion, and if he sees fit, give you his own.

it is necessary.. you have to atleast talk to them once in a while, i know it gets boring to sit and talk about the same stuff almost everyday, it's routine, but you have to, otherwise they will make a big deal out of it..



so just do some small talk before you go get busy! ^__^

You don't have to make compliments if they are not sincere but politeness is important... common courtesy is the gateway at the workplace to be accepted and to make a good impression.. meaning you treat everybody with respect...which is very necessary.. if you show respect to others they will respect you too. False flattery on the contrary is definitely not good.. only make compliments if you feel that they are justified.. but always be polite to your employer and every person you interact with.. and you will gain their respect... unless they are immature and rude..

I this I made a mistake...?



Okay... I work for a temp agency and I did some type of event about parking meters (no need for details about that). I worked with this guy; in no way was I interested. After the event was over with, he gave me his number with a note that said please call me. So a week later, sent a text  because he works for a different temp agency  than I do and apparently get paid more money there. I just wanted the name of the time agency so I can look it up. He called me and I answered and told him that I couldn't talk at the time because my minutes are low during the day. In the past three days this guy called me 7 times and left two voice messages. He even called at 4:30 am. I feel he could of just text me back, but I think he is looking for more than just telling me the name of the temp agency he is with. I have a BF and definitely don't want another.



</question>



<additional details>



What should I do if he continue to keep calling? How should I go about this situation?

Tell him you appreciated working with him but that you have a BF and that you wanted to get in touch with him because you were interested to find out about the other agency... not out of personal interest in him... Say it in a tactful way.. tell him it was nice to have had him as a work colleague for a while.. but that you only wanted information about the agency he now works for.. that he should please stop texting you or phoning you.. as you are not romantically interested.. you have a BF.

Ya... That guy is hitting on you. Just text him to say you are busy with your BF and ask him to message the name of that agency. In this way he will get to know that you are not interested in him and you only talked to that guy for your info.

So... whats your question? If you are asking if you made a mistake, then, yes, I think you did.  If you have not made it clear that you only wanted the name of his temp agency, then text him again and make it clear that's all you want.  If you keeps calling you, then tell him to stop.



Just tell him to stop.  Don't try to be "nice."  Some people don't understand unless you tell them in very clear terms, "No."  His calling, especially at 4:30 A.M., is out of control.  If he won't take your "no," have your BF call him.



Do not call him back.  Just text him a clear message.

I would be respectful to the boss but he vented at me for no reason.. (other than constructive criticism where that may be justified.. I would ask him...''Please let me know what I have done today to deserve your wrath? If I have done anything wrong as you seem obviously angry at me I would like to know the reason for it.... '' then he has to give you a reason and maybe he will say ''I am sorry I didn't mean to shout at you.. it's something personal.. I wasn't aware of what I was doing... '' maybe he is under stress and vents and is not aware he is venting at the wrong person.. his day started bad or he had bad news or something in his private life went wrong ... ask him... then he either has to give a valid reason for his anger or say.. that he didn't mean it personally nor that you do a bad job.. that it's just not his day.. maybe if it happens just once in a blue moon everyone is entitled to show some weakness and that they aren't perfect... not even the boss.. he should show his employees respect as long as they show him respect.. and if he is not satisfied with a job, he should tell you or the person who has done something in a way which displeases him.. nobody can learn to improve if he says nothing...

[Fish n Chippery] Answering Calls?



Does anybody have any tips while answering phone calls for a chippery? Like: Hello, this is the Fishop......... Thanks bye at the end, It'll be approximately 10 minutes. Stuff that are easily said.



Also what's minimum wage for a casual(?) worker.... I fill in people's shifts when they're away. I'm aged 15 and live in Victoria, Australia with no experience, I got paid $8/hr for the first shift of 3 hours.



Overall, any tips in general? Answering, calculating, til, customers, cooking? I've only selected the potato cakes, etc. How do you remember the prices and abbreviations quickly? Especially under pressure, the heat. How do you quickly add and total?



Thanks

Grief is all he's entitled to, go to the local council to find out her status and any further advice they can give you.

He doesn't have to pay to keep the car, he can return it, if it was her mobility car then he has no claim to it or must pay the outstanding amount, it's common sense.

He needs to contact social service and dept of benefits to see what they can do. I have known of situations where when someone dies and the family cannot afford a funeral then social services will help you to get the money from the state.

I am sorry for his loss.
Did she leave a will? Hope she did.
If he is not disabled then I would think the mobility car would be taken away? As for the council house it depends if his Mother had his name on the rent book?
Go and speak to citizens advise too.

It is upto his mother's family to pay for the funeral, though if they are all on low incomes and his mother was too, they may get help from the DSS.

The car is on a lease purchase agreement, so it is not her car to bequeath. They either return it or buy it.

If she had no will (more than likely not, seeing she had no property) all her money and goods technically belong to her oldest child, who should divide them amicably and fairly to the family.

If she made a will, she is entitled to omit any of her children who are not financially dependent on her.

Most councils allow a transfer of tenancy from the deceased to the son, so long as he was living in the house, and is at their discrestion, not a legal right.

I presume the mobility car belonged to his mum. If he wants to take over the contract or loan then I'm afraid he has to pay.

As a relative and next of kin he has to pay the funeral expenses. Maybe other members of the family might contribute. If he has no, or little money, he can get a funeral grant from the DHSS.

chic, elegant, because the people in Italy dress very well, at least all the ones i came across did. Suggest a lovely dress, not gaudy, plain and simple but classy, match the shoes and bag where you can, but maybe have a dash of colour in both. Fabric try silk, if can't afford that try something similar.

First time to Italy, and you're going for a wedding?! You are going to have such a good time over there. It's beautiful there to start, and then to have a wedding there..I'm jealous. Dress style, doesn't really matter I think. Just go for something classy, elegant, but not overwhelming. Length, I would try for mid-calf. Or even go for a skirt. That could work too. Fabric doesn't really matter I don't think. Color, anything really. Just not a bright color, and stay away from the busy patterns. Shoes, cute little high heels. Something simple, like black (That way you can wear them again), or white to go with your dress, maybe. And finally, the bag. Try to match it to the rest of your outfit. I think a little clutch purse would work perfectly in this kind of situation. That way you have something to hold all that you need, but yet it's the perfect size, and it won't get in your way. And you will know where it is at all times. 
I know this probably wasn't much help, but it's all I got. I hope you have an amazing time though. I think you will love it over there. Most people do.

ciao!
it does depend if the wedding is during the morning or the afternoon and if it is in the church or in the town hall.
We usually are always dressy,any colour is ok but NEVER WHITE!!!!
The different between morning and afternoon is that if the wedding is in the afternoon you should dress more elegant.
Length of the skirt is the same, of course you cannot go with a mini skirt!!!
If the wedding is in a church you should cover your shoulder during the function so you can wear a top but you must have a scarf on your shoulders or something you like.
For fabric and colour just wear what you like...the concept is the bride is the most beautiful that day and you cannot wear something can make her  in a dark  corner :))

no jeans or casual in both occasions. No flip flop.

Hi coco! I'm Italian....
Well... I went to a wedding last month... I was wearing a dark satin dress, knee-lenght, with black polished sandals, and a a black little bag with paillettes. You got to be chic and elegant, but without exagerating with laces and sequins!!! Not a ankle-lenght dress, and not of course a white dress!! For your hair I recommend you a chignon, that's really chic!!
Kisses!

Search Italian summer wedding fashions @ http://www.YouTube.com

Google/yahoo too, as 'a picture is worth 1000 words'

Funny enough, I'm very much enjoying reading a kinda quasi-historical novel by an articulate Italian, set in the Sicilian port of Napoli (Naples)

& its frequent graphic word pictures of Italian temperament & attitudes would strongly suggest the typical Mediterranean merriment

Bright, cheery, colourful expressions of celebration are the creative order of the day

& joyful flamboyance stands out as the overall flavour to capture, yes?

So search 'cinema Mediterranean summer weddings'

Did ya see Walter Matthau wed Sophia Loren in Grumpier Old Men on Film4 TV a few days ago?

Latina weddings - like J-Lo in Shall We Dance?

Beyonce in The Fighting Temptations

My Big Fat Greek Wedding & West Side Story gotta be da classics

Enjoy matching what suits ya skin, hair & eyes

Enhance with fake tan, wig & coloured contact lenses if ya like

In Italian churches you are not allowed to go inside with bare arms.. You should wear a cocktail dress a nice one but wear something around your shoulders a shoulder scarf or a short jacket to cover up inside the church.. about as long as this one here.. a nice colour and fabric which doesn't crease easily, a nice hairdo updo or open... or half up half down.. and nice earrings and a necklace and matching shoes for the dress.

You already have had a great deal of advice but I will sum up as there is some confusion in previous answers.
Italian occasions such as weddings are very chic and everyone wears extremely smart clothes.
Colours: White is reserved for the bride. Black is a colour of mourning in Italy unless it is evening wear for a  particular occasion such as a grand dinner. Avoid a colour too much in your face such as plain scarlet that will detract attention from the bride. If you chosse a mixture of colours, avoid strong prints. 
Style: Anything that shows bare shoulders or a lot of cleavage such as the tiny straps prom dresses that are in fashion in UK at the moment is unsuitable unless you have a jacket or bolero to wear over it in church and during lunch.
Length: below the knee or mid-calf. Those dresses with points at the bottom of the skirt are fashionable at the moment. 
Fabric: It will be hot, even if the religious ceremony is in the morning. Usually the favoured time is at 11am and whilst it may be cool in a large church, it also may be crammed with people as often half of the town turns up for the service.  Italians love weddings and  they roll up in church even if they only have a distant acquaintance with the bride or the groom. It will be sweltering when you come out, so a light material like printed chiffon over an under dress is good. Man made materials are often uncomfortable in hot conditions and cling to you undesirably.
Celebrations often stretch for hours with dancing late into the evening so make sure you are at ease in what you wear.
Shoes: smart, heeled,  but must be comfortable as you will be on your feet for a long time. Stilettos may look elegant but are uncomfortable for long stretches and if there is dancing later in the day.
Bag: clutch bag with only necessities inside that will not cramp your style or small bag that you hang from a shoulder. Nothing big or heavy.
If the dress you have chosen has a mixture of colours, choose your accesories to match the dominant one.

Enjoy: Italian weddings are wonderful occasions, and as a foreign lady you will be féted by all the men.

You had almost all the advice you need by fellow Italians. I just resume some "absolutely don't"
Colour; as said white is for the bride only such as ivory (too close to white). Black is mainly for funerals (and, in fashion conscious Italy, never for morning); Purple/ violet can be considered unlucky if the family of the bride has people coming from the South or there is any theater actor around.

Colour and fabric: pay attention that wedding party implies a huge huge lunch, with a lot of toasts and many different kinds of foods including many, multicoloured sauces: if you fear you might spot that special silk/ bright coloured dress, don't wear it.

Length: not too short and, if your shoulders are out and you are going in a village (where old people in the church can be more conservative) just take a scarf. If it is a "civil wedding" (in the Town hall) , there is no problem, even if etiquette wants you don't steal the stage to the bride (and the best maid).

Type: it depends from your friends. If the wedding is formal, avoid jeans and T-shirt. All the other decent matches are allowed

Shoes: a nice pair of shoes is ok. Meanwhile  consider that the "after wedding" and wedding party can be long, require long walks, dancing and so on. At the end of the day you may be very tired.

I think some are due to personal habits, where they just have to make noises and well, as you said, can't cope with silence.

Others are more of 'cultural', like the Italians and Japanese, where they HAVE to say something over the table, commenting the food, expressing their likes, and/ or even singing their hearts out. :))

I agree. Too much "mmm"  is like they are having an orgasm. They should keep it to the minimum. One female food documentary host comes to mind.

Well, I for one, come from a fairly regal family, and in my own humble opinion one cannot be seen to be eating 'twixt his maid and his stable boy. As the old addage goes, "A servant in house makes a leech as well."  Or something like that. My old grandfather, Lord Whithertooth the third was often drunk when spouting "old addages."

What should I do....?



I found a phone at the weekend, and I have a vague idea of who it belongs to insofar as I think it belongs to a chap who sometimes drinks in a bar I used to work in. I have since moved about 100 miles away so I can't just drop it in.



The battery is now dead, and I can't find anyone who has a charger I can borrow so I can't contact the owner that way. I don't want to sent it back to the pub because the landlord will not pass it on.



Does anyone else know how I can go about getting this phone back to its rightful owner? Who should I contact? Should I hand it to the police? Many thanks.



</question>

Say fine thanks and then up to you whether you want to ask them how they're doing too.  Pleased to meet you and/or Hi! are fine too. If someone  says it on a first meeting, they're just using it as a greeting and don't really expect you to tell them how you've been doing.  If you know someone well, it's more likely that they're actually interested in how you are and you could say more than 'fine, thanks' if you feel like it.

If it's for the first time, it's good to say something like "I'm very good thanks - how are you"? This is a little better than "fine thanks", particularly when meeting someone for the first time, as it's a bit more upbeat.



Replying "How are you" is not wrong, just remember to say how YOU are first!

There's not much difference between "how are you" on the first meeting and when you know someone well, just that you might get a more honest response if you know them. And if you don't they will usually just be polite in their response.

I would say ''pleased to meet you'' it's strange to ask ''How are you'' to someone you meet a first time.. instead of how do you do, probably a foreigner who believes how are you means how do you do? Don't answer with how you really are just say'' Pleased to meet you whatever the other person says.. xx It is meant to mean ''Hello what the person is saying but it would not be correct to tell them how you are.. you should not say.. ''fine thanks'' you should say '' Pleased to meet you''

it depends on who you're meeting.  your boss, "fine, thanks.  pleased to meet you."
a hot guy/girl you want to flirt with "much better now."

some people who ask, truly don't care how you are.  it's the same as saying 'hello.'  so you pretty much have to gauge each situation & decide.

Could mean any of the following:

The ring was someone elses and doesn't fit their fingers.
They are a trucker
They are a pikey
They are a fashion victim.

Rings should go on either the 2nd (middle) 3rd (wedding) or 4th (pinky) only. Any more than 2 rings on one hand looks rubbish and pikeyfied.

Maybe it means they like the ring but seeing as it's either too loose or too tight to fit properly on any other digit they have to put it on their thumb?

Has this happen to you. what do you do.?



An old boyfriend emailed me.  Im on myspace and so is he.  So when he emailed me I could see his picture and him see mine.

DO not get me wrong.. I in NO WAY think I look like I did when we dated.



At first I did not know it was him until he told me, His myspace page only had his first name.. and of course pictures..

We got to talking and he ask why I did not know it was him at first, since it has only been 8 years since we last saw each other..

It is not like I can say..."well, hun, you gained about 300 pounds, thats why".

What would be the best responce in a question like this to someone you have not seen in a SHORT while when they have changed so much that you did not know it was them.. AND changed in a way you really do NOT want to say ...

What happened to telling the truth?  Can't you just say - Sorry, I didn't know it was you because you've gained weight?  He knows he has...if he's looking for a pity party - you aren't it, and what do you have to lose?  If more people would be honest about things...so much crap wouldn't be pent up.  So much energy is wasted focusing on how to "pad" the truth.  The last thing this guy needs is more padding.

Just tell him he looks really different, you don't have to say how.  Realistically speaking, he knows he's gained the weight of two good sized people, no need to be sensitive about it now!  But, I think just the "you look so different" should be enough.  Eight years isn't that short an amount of time, especially depending on how old you guys were the last time you saw him.

Weird yahoo answers anomaly ?



hello,

I was wondering why, when I ask serious questions on yahoo answers -  I get blown off with only 1 or 2 flakey answers? These normally consist of 2 words at best. Sometimes, all I've got in response are single spam links.



Alternatively, If I ask a totally daft question, I get at least 30 responses ... some people sat there typing up 300 word essays, along with complete in-depth  analysis 'of the question', as well as an additional character profile included for good measure. I’ve experienced this a total of 15 times under 3 different accounts.

Can anyone explain this mysterious yahoo answers anomaly please ?



</question>



<additional details>



So why are they taking totally daft questions 'that' seriously ? It isn’t even a misinterpretation, I MEAN totally daft questions like… ’ why are my socks blue‘.



Tyler, I believe yahoo take this resource itself pretty seriously, even to the point of discouraging chat on questions.. my fave movie of all time btw.

Because people can't be bothered to read serious questions yet feel the need to tell you their life story if you ask what their favourite jam is. I think the key is to keep your question as short as possible and unfortunately serious questions tend to be longer as you put more detail into them. I also find this annoying. Bah!

Edit
They are probably the sort of people who prefer talking to listening in real life. In my experience that seems to be nearly everyone.

People don't think they will give a good enough answer when you ask serious questions. Most people have enough sense of responsibility that they don't want to give poor advice to a serious and important question. The people that give crap answers are probably just trying to get points.

I don't know what "daft" means, but I think you mean not serious question. Most people can give a good enough answer and feel that they can contribute meaningfully to a question that isn't serious or just a matter of opinion.



Sorry if I got the meaning of "daft" wrong, but I never heard anyone say that or saw it written anywhere.

Daft questions are easier to answer, and therefore more people will be able to answer them. Serious questions usually require more thought and research, and therefore less people will be knowledgeable about the subject, resulting in less answers. I know that when I come across a question that deals with something unfamiliar, I skip it. There's no point in me answering a question when I probably know even less about the topic than the asker.

I think people see a serious question and think "oh I cant be botherd to answer that cause I will have to think hard and this person needs a good answer cause its that kind of question" where as with silly questions they are more fun to answer and seem more attractive cause some people come on here just for a bit of fun not to be agony aunts or to seriously answer questions. They treat it as a bit more like a  networking site than just an information site, hardly surprsing when you see how many people us facebook, its kind of in their way of thinking.

Do you ever call customers Sir or Madam over the phone at work and why? Do YOU like to be called Sir or Madam?



Personally if his name's Bob Jones then I call him Bob Jones. If he asks me to call him Mr Jones then I call him Mr Jones. But I never call anyone Sir whereas quite a few of my colleagues do. Do you ever call customers Sir or Madam over the phone at work? Indeed, do you like to be called Sir or Madam yourself when you're the customer, or like me do you dislike this?

Personally, I don't call clients Sir or Madam either.  I have colleagues who do as well.  I don't like being called Madam.  It makes me feel old.  I prefer to be called Mrs. or by my first name.  Madam makes me feel like I am 95.  My husband has coworkers that call him Sir because it bothers him.  He has a saying "Don't call me Sir, I work for a living."  He says being called Sir makes him seem pretentious.

I only ever do this if I'm being sarcastic. As a receptionist I often answer calls from people who automatically assume I'm stupid - if I get a 'well to do' sounding customer I'll match their posh voice and when transferring the call I'll say something like "Do hold the line whilst I redirect your call Madam/Sir"... They never know I'm being equally as patronising towards them...

The thing I hate being called though is 'dear'.... It's so condescending!!!

Maybe it's because I live in the south, but it is expected to call people ma'am and sir here. I expect to be called ma'am by people in customer service. I would be offended if they didn't. It has nothing to do with age. I'm 23 and I prefer to be called ma'am whether the person calling me that is 5 years old or 50 years old.

If the caller says, “This is Bob/Bobbie Jones, I want to speak with Tom Smith.” I always say, “Yes, Mr./Ms. Jones. Please hold while I connect you to Mr. Smith’s line. Thank you sir/ma’am.”

If the caller says, “I want to speak with Tom Smith” I always say, “Certainly. May I tell Mr. Smith who is calling please? Thank you sir/ma’am. Please hold while I connect you with his line.”

If Mr. Smith is not available, I return to the caller and say “I’m sorry, Mr./Ms. Jones, but Mr. Smith is not available to take calls at this moment. Would like his voice-mail or would you prefer to leave a written message? Yes sir/ma’am.”

Sir and madam are signs of respect – and you do respect all calls into your place of business, don’t you? After all, that’s what you were hired to do – answer calls respectfully and courteously.

Even if Mr. Jones says to call you Bob, continue to call him Mr. or Sir.

Remember, these people are not calling you. They really aren’t calling your boss. They are calling your BUSINESS. And therefore, should be offered the greatest respect you can give.

Unless they indicate otherwise, I call them Sir, Ma'am, or Miss. It's RESPECTFUL. If you take it to heart you may need to get over yourself a bit. They don't say it to make you feel old or put out in anyway. It's just polite and professional.

I would say no more than a few years younger, but I would accept up to ten years older depending on the guy and his level of maturity.  You have to be careful at my age when you start looking at older men; once they cross 40, some of them loose their natural minds, start looking for teenagers or just trying to become one!  Or else, they just decide to be old, and start sitting in the house, never wanting to do anything and letting themselves go.  Definitely depends on the personalities involved!

I think its the age of the person thats more important, A 10 Year age gap is nothing when your 50-60 but a 6 year gap is really bad if your say 26 and dateing a 16 year old, however an age gap of 15 years for people over the age of 30 is probably the limit for me.

If it's really love it knows no age difference. People however should have a similar outlook on life.. a too great age difference could make that hard.. it matters more when you are younger but if you are 34 and he is 48 it won't matter anymore..  if you were 18 and he 32 he will have a lot more experience and a lot of different interests but funnily enough meet the same guy 16 years later in your life.. and it's different. You will have gained life experience and you will then be 34 and he 48 and you can have the same outlook on life and it can be love.. 14 years.. can be okay.. and 25 years could be ok if you are Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas !!! Lol someone said.. half my age plus 7 so I have to have a guy who is 30 years older than me. I protest.. He will be 76 years old.. That's not fair.. Unless he has a castle in Spain an Island on Hawaii, a Ferrari, a Jaguar, a Rolls Royce, a butler and staff and lots of millions and enjoys bad health... xx

Its not just a selfish act on my part I love her to death and even as a pacifist i would kill for her  my cut off point is exactly the same gap between me and her because i would never be with anyone else but her.

It all depends on what you can accept or find acceptable.  Obviously, this DOES NOT pertain to minors.

Among adults of consenting age, as long as the couple is OK with it, everything is fine.  In the end, an age gap imposes the same kind of limitations as a gap in education, major cultural difference, or cross-class background.  IF the couple wants to get past it, then they can.  For me, personally, I would be hesitant to date a woman more than 20 years my senior, or five or six years my junior, although, I've dated outside those parameters before.

Also, it is worth noting that, for me, often, a really great lady can make me change some of my rules.

Bottom line, if the couple feels they are happy with the relationship, then they are.  Period.

I think a lot, because I let other people dictate the way I feel a lot. I say yes too often, and then when I try to back pedal out of something. Like when I over extend my help, those closest to me get upset. My husband and my inlaws have been making things hard on me with favors. My husband is in another state and his sister keeps asking me for favors, after I quit working for her still! Soo... I need to say no. I am only hurting myself and everyone around me. She lives 3 1/2 hours away, and wants me to watch 2 boys under 3, both over 30 lbs. You do the math. I have a cat too, she expects me to transport with me... And sleep in her basement, alone while my hubby is away...

Really, though, the best thing a person can be is honest. It earns a lot more respect than being too cowardly to tell people whan they get on your nerves... And the idiots out there deserve to be told, otherwise they'll just go on being idiots forever as everyone else will let them get away with it.

Treat them as if you are a professional and they are your customers. You have to be polite to them..That means not to say anything offensive or rude. If they ask a question you answer politely and you smile... see how good a sales woman you are. Do you think the girls in the shops like all the customers... still they smile and have to be polite.. just think you are one of them. You don't have to be their friends but politeness is important. That will help you later in life in a job. Then you need to just be polite and smile at customers. What you really think doesn't matter but you have to playact it. Of course it's like lying.. but in a job if you deal with customers and you have an attitude you need to hide that attitude and just be polite anyhow and smile. That shows you are professional, even if you are playacting.. but sometimes it's worth it.. rudeness in a job for example if you don't like someone, could lead to dismissal..

We all end up in situations sometimes where we have to be around people we don't particularly like. You can smile, be gracious for a few minutes - especially if you are in a "mingling" situation where you aren't expected to stay and talk for long periods of time. If it has to be longer, ensure you're not by yourself. It's easier to get around these types of situations when you have a buffer. However, if the source of contention is an actually issue, as in you've had problems with this person before and don't really speak to them, and speaking with them is going to cause a scene, it is better to simply avoid them.

Etiquette at the pictures



Everytime that I go to the pictures these days fourteen year old girls ask me if I would like them to sit on my knee. Up to now I've always said no. What do you think? would it be an outrage to public decency if I said yes, next time?

stick to your guns and only give her the deposit when she hands her keys over.  as for the rest of it, well if this is normal for her just shrug it off. if this is out of character then maybe she's having a tough day.

Was there a specific reason she needed her deposit back early? It sounds like, because you're not feeling well, you're probably a little oversensitive. Did she even know it's your birthday? I'm not sure you even know what you're upset about at this point...give her back her deposit, make it more clear with your next lodger, and call it a day.

Holly

Ok I think for starters you need to put aside the personal grievances you have with her...

Deposits have to be returned within 2-4 weeks of the tenant leaving, depending on the terms of the contract. You have a right to check the place before returning her money, but equally she may need the money to cover the deposit on her next place.

It's always good to check where you stand with a solicitor or the Citizens' Advice Bureau, as these days tenants often seem to have a lot more rights than landlords, which is great for us but not so much for you!

I don't think this is an etiquette question. She simply isn't in a position to make demands. Return the deposit when you have the keys back and after you have checked the room for damage.

I always try to be polite.  But usually it is the frazzled workers who cop an attitude.  Don't spit in anybody's food.  There was a guy who got arrested for doing that here in my community.  Needless to say, he was fired.  Also, he has a criminal record following him.  It was considered assault on a Police Officer.

and the smell makes them more hungry and impatient, watching others  eating...is just too much.
and sometimes some just listens to their instincts...not sooo human, but...(my cat miauws louder when i'm opening the can, babies crying when hungry)

I'm always polite with people who make my food, they're providing me with a service ( and I don't want you to spit in in my meal). I think that you're just concentrating on a few people who think that they have the divine right to complain about everything, those kinds of people annoy me. Although if people are paying for something they do expect it to be done right, but I understand what you mean.

Is it rude to not shake hands when you meet someone?



I was thinking about this because in most cases when I'm in the restroom, I notice 90% of the men don't wash their hands. They continue on about their day like nothing. What else do they do after? eat, shake hands? So what could you say to someone when they try to shake your hand?

I don't think it's rude at all. I understand why people do it in the business type word as a form of greeting but I don't think NOT shaking hands would be rude (as long as you nod your head in greet and say pleased to meet you or something). I don't shake hands as I'm female and I think it is a very masculine thing to do (and no I don't expect men to kiss my hand or anything either). I don't touch men that I don't know, that is an invasion of mine and their space. I kiss my girlfriends on the cheek and when I meet someone new I smile a lovely smile and say 'hi, really good to meet you' with direct eye contact and genuine interest.

I probably woudn't shake their hands either if i had known they didn't wash their hands. 
but i'm a really unfront person (sometimes not a good thing)
so if they asked why i didnt want to shake their hand, I would tell them. :) Try it. They'll probably think about it more. Especially if you say it in front of someone :P Can turn out to be pretty funny. But I've found that doing stuff like that works for me.

If you're worried about it, wear gloves (fashionable gloves, not like, surgical gloves...)
The germs and dirt are part of the bond that is made when hands are shaken, so make it a firm handshake, picking up plenty of grime from the hands is a sign of respect.
And always shake with your jerking hand.

You can't go around fist pumping colleagues and clients... it's a bit juvenille.  Keep the fist pumping to your friends and basketball court...

If it grosses you out - use hand sanitizer.. But as a professional man/woman - hand shakes are necessary..  It establishes equality... At work,  If you shy away from handshaking it can become an awkward situation and may come off appearing weak.

Is he interested in more than just being friends?



Went on 3 dates with this guy over the course of the past month. We're both in our late 20's, met on eharmony and are both a little shy. He's a modest, kind and genuine person. When I was away on vacation he sent me a text message to say hi and then another one to ask me on our 3rd date. 1st date we went bowling and out to dinner. 2nd date we watched a movie at his place. 3rd date we got lunch, brought it back to his place, watched TV, talked and played a board game. Every time before I leave, I give him a hug and he hugs me back.  I'm not good with figuring out the signs when dating, so...

Do you think he's interested in being more than friends?  I would like it to get to that level because I like him.  But I'm very shy when it comes to this stuff.

If he's the one initiating the dates, then it does appear that he is interested in being more than just friends. As you say, he is shy, so take it one step at a time with him. Enjoy the process :)

I'm not sure on other people but I think the majority of USA is a little depending on the situation. I don't mind being friends with anyone that is different than myself, either it be race, religion, or any of their opinions...but I do prefer certain races definately for dating. I'm a white  girl but I would not prefer to be with another white person..I really enjoy people that are different culturally because I can learn from them.. I try to hang around with as many different people as I can. I do notice..I hate to say it...that I am a little uncomfy around Indian people. It is rude of me to say that but the ones that I have met have not made my life any easier. I am still open to making friends with them and I do not judge their race because of my experiences but the ones I have met I plan to never speak to again. I love people though..so I hope there are more people like me when my kid goes to school...they will be half Japanese and  half Italian. I don't want my child being judged.. Even though it will happen.

Of course, everyone has a prejudice for something.  If you excuse the obvious which is race, there are many other things that people just don't or won't see as part of their everyday life.  But to be honest, it wouldn't be hard to say that everyone doesn't have some prejudice against races for some reason.  It is a difficult thing.  It involves many backgrounds and thought processes.  We are never going to be a perfect people and there will never be a kumbaya circle here.  It is what makes us all unique and in so many instances what makes us realize who the really scary people are.  Perfection will never be accomplished.

Of course we are all prejudiced, that is part of what makes people what they are.

The important thing is to decide if your prejudice is justified and if you think it is, can you justify it to an impartial arbiter.

I know I am prejudiced about paedophiles, abusers, racists, rapists, bullies,  bigots and people who are cruel to animals. I don't have any problems with any of those feelings.

I also know that I have groundless prejudices against other groups. I try to be aware of these feelings and try to ensure that they don't influence the way I behave to these other people. In this way, I try to be a better person.

Of course, they are unless they have no feelings or thoughts!! I know I am a bit prejudice (hopefully not a lot).

I am generally nice and polite to everyone but there are certain things I feel strongly against with. (Not race or religion).. but more on behavioral things.

I dislike people who cut queues, ignorant parents who let their children misbehave in public places (child throws biscuit crumbs in a musuem and parents did not stop the behaviour and pick up the litter!), etc.

Other than that, I'm to be open-minded about everything and everyone.

Yes. Everyone has that little lurking thought in their head about others or just to form some stereotype or generalized notion about them. It's important not to act on them but as thoughts? Yes as thoughts it is quite prevalent to consciously and unconsciously think about people a certain way.

Absolutely. It's a part of what makes us human. If we didn't judge others we wouldn't ever make good decisions about what's best for us and others. We come by our own morals and standards by doing this. Provided one's normal social interactions aren't limited by these feelings it's pretty normal to be at least somewhat prejudiced.

"Cruciferous" vegetables--broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, mustard greens, turnips--contain lots of sulfur.  Except maybe turnips, they usually won't give you gas by themselves, but when you eat them with sugars that do then you'll get that sulfur smell.  Just remember that the same stuff that makes them stink also makes a compound (sulforaphane) that helps your liver clean junk out of your body.

He called me a trophy wife?



I went to a party with my husband, who I am newly married to, and he introduced me to his "good friend" who is supposedly important. The man just looks at me, and then says to my husband "I see you've been doing pretty well for yourself, even got yourself a trophy wife." That made me so mad, and I told him that was such a rude thing to say, and now my hubby is upset with me. Did I overreact or was I right to be insulted? And shouldn't my husband be more upset with him for saying that?

You are correct.  Your husband should have stood up for you immediately.  To not do so is very poor.  Ask you hubby if he thinks of you as his Trophy Wife?  If he says yes, you may be in for a long, difficult marriage.

Honestly, it's obviously a joke. The man was kidding around. Also, why should you be upset? It's a complement. He doesn't know you intellectually, so the fact that he is impressed with you physically bodes well for you.

well it all depends on the tone and manner he said it. yes men call their wifes trophy wifes but its not always the best a idea to it in front of them bcuz it does make them feel liek objects and that never a good thing. but if someone is sayin it to u than thats s compliment he was saying ur a gorgeus woman nothign necessarily wrong with it but it is rude say it with the wife around. regardless i think its a lil 50 50 u have a right to b offended but then again it was just a compliment

I Wouldn't Think That Was A Compliment Either.
If I Were Your Hubby I Would Have Said, Yes She Is Beautiful , But She Is Also Very Intelligent. The Trophy
Wife Comment Is Well Known To Presume That He Married You For Just Looks. I Don't Blame You For Being Mad And He Should Have Had A Quik Response.
And He Is Mad? You Need To Give Him A Piece Of Your Mind On The Issue! Good Luck!

First off, it is not good etiquette to tell someone that they are rude.  If that were to happen again, smile sweetly and say one of two things - Dear, he thinks you married me for my looks?, or, look incredulous and say "I'm so sorry, I thought you just said I looked like a trophy wife - I know you wouldn't have made such a comment.  what did you actually say?".  The second is a polite way to tell him he's out of line, the first makes light of it.

Now the important part - your husband.  Your husband is probably upset that you embarrassed him.  This is a great opportunity, since you're newly married, to strengthen your bond.  This is a possible approach to him.  Tell him how it made you feel.  For example, "when he said that, I felt like some dumb blonde out of a movie without a brain in my head, too stupid to be able to marry for love".  Focus on how you feel and you can't use "felt that you...", has to be feelings you have.  Then ask your husband how he felt, and listen to him twice.  Once with your head (for undetstanding), and once with your heart (with love).  Do not interrupt him.  Try to feel as he did, perhaps embararrased that his wife was rude (your comment was rude).  Use that as a learning tool to make your marriage better, and then discuss how you would like to, as a couple, handle those types of incidents.

That's much healthier than the road you're taking.

That could be either a compliment or an insault. I wouldn't say you over reacted. And I don't think your hubby should be upset with you. You should sit him down and talk to him. Tell him that you may have misunderstood his friend, and that you thought 'trophie' wife, ment that he only married you for your looks. Tell him it made you feel uncomfertable, and that's why you acted the way you did. Don't let him act as though it's all your fault though because you really don't know how he ment it. He could have ment it that way, or he may have been complimenting you. I hope things work out for you and your husband. Good luck!

Is this rude to change plans for lunch?



I am not a "hang in a cafe" kind of girl as I tend  to eat and run and get agitated and restless sitting there for too long. Today my friend is coming over for lunch and wanted to go to a cafe and look at the shops in my village. I said yes to her, feeling guilty to say no as I thought she might think I was dull. I hate waiting for food and checking out people and all the noise etc. I am a bit of a hermit and like my life that way. Do you think its rude if I offer her lunch here (it will be good) and then we can whip down to the village after to look at the shops?

No, you shouldn't have to suffer sitting in a cafe. I HATE sitting face to face with someone for prolonged periods of time making meaningless gab while praying that the waiter gives us the check. It is the most boring, excruciating form of 'recreation' imaginable. You shouldn't have to suffer through it. And if your friend has a problem, well she will have to get over it. It's fun being up & about, not sitting feeling like you are handcuffed to a chair. Good luck!

Yes, it would be rude to change the plan without consulting her.
Just tell her you are uncomfortable in the situation and does she mind if you make lunch at your place?

However, just because you are a hermit, you need to realize that that is not particularly normal, and making others conform to your quirks is not fair. 
The fact of the matter is, it won't kill you to "suffer" waiting around a bit and eating lunch in a public place. She is coming to see you, so she is obviously not very hermit-like.
It is worth thinking about, IMO.

No not rude I don't think you even have to explain your reasoning. Just ask her if she wouldn't mind having lunch at your place. But keep in mind sometimes people just want to go out to eat, they want to be waited on and be in restaurant type surroundings. I know sometimes I feel that way I just want to go out and eat, even if my friend offers to cook and stay in then go out. 
Also she may take your request to eat in as polite way of you saying you don't have the money to eat out, so if she offers to pay then you may want to say that you prefer eating in regardless of who pays.

Buy or steal? They're not allowed to be sold on ebay, and you're most unlikely to find any in a charity or second hand clothes shop, so goodness knows where you'd go to buy them? Japan, presumably.

It is a matter of personal tastes, I suppose. Never haven worn someone else's old pants, I can't say I would want to. On the other hand, I did buy a pair of pyjama bottoms from a charity shop (perfectly clean) and never thought a thing about it. 
For some reason, though, used knickers just seem less sanitary.

however if from the front you can make the point ready for guests to use the bathroom

I think this was actually quoted as a major difference between men and women and if you don't agree in a relationship, it's one of those things that niggle away.  Personally, i don't care, but behind seems neater.

depends if you have kids or pets who like to play with things then over isn't the way to go.. you would end up with a mess. 
under saves that roll  you can keep hitting it and it won't make a large mess. it will just flip onto it's self

now it is easier to find the end of the roll with it being over. so if you don't have anything like kids or pets then over is preferred because of that

It doesn't matter, but I think over the front is better.  When it is from behind, it has a tendency to unravel more toilet paper after your "pull and tear."

Then again, if you have a cat that likes to play "unravel the toilet paper," hanging it from the back would be better than hanging it from the front.

When I was a nurse's aide I was taught to let the loose end hang in the front because of the risk of picking up germs the other way, from having people scrabbling at the wall with "toilet fingers" in order to unroll the paper.

The loose end must ALWAYS hang from behind.  The other way is just vulgar.  Ask Miss Manners and she will explain all the niceties to you.  Many people in USA have (apparently) written to her about this 'problem' and that is her advice.  Fortunately, I have lost her name, address, website, etc.

you are right, they don't. The divorce rate in africa is almost unheard of, but the AIDS rate is high.

that tells you you are a stastic. You are being used, and will continue as long as you have allowed it.

You will NEVER be more than a mistress.

So stop complaining and stay were you are and accept it, or GET SOMETHING IN YOUR head and stop being used..

That is so old. Its not just Africans. Men hardly EVER leave their wives for the other woman. You got to have some serious skills in the bedroom for him to actually divorce her for you. And you have to keep them up for the rest of your lives together. 
I would just leave him. Good luck to you.

Outspoken is more like speaking your mind without regard for the feelings or opinions of others. It can be a BAD thing. It has nothing to do with race or gender, but rather simple manners. Good manners means you regard the feelings of others. Bad manners mean you do not regard the feelings of others. Being outspoken hurts people sometimes. It is also referred to as being blunt, sort of like using a sledgehammer on a thumbtack.

Outspoken is when you choose to speak when it's not your place to speak.
In simpler words, you speak out when you shouldn't. And like the answer above says, you have no regard for anyone else's feelings, or how they may feel after you have said what you're about to say.
You don't look before you leap, you just jump right out there and say what you want, even when your opinion is not needed at that moment. If you are outspoken, then you don't wait your turn to have your say,

Why would you?  People of class don't need everyone trying to "chat them up".  They want to be left alone.  The same follows suit when you might have the chance to be somewhere and see someone famous in other avenues.  Leave them alone. Be respectful of their ability to have privacy.  They don't want to have everyone fawning all over them and they have the right to entertain in public and not have anyone jumping them.  If I see famous people, I snap a shot on my camera and that is it.  I don't need to make other people believe they are my new best friend.

I believe they have become a lot more open minded.. you would call them by their title but otherwise treat them like everybody else.. I guess most members of the royal family would want to be treated like normal human beings.. especially if they are in a pub..  They would not want to draw attention to themselves...or be given better treatment just because they are Royal...they should be treated with politeness and respect but so should everybody else..

Nope...There are still Americans doing that.  And I have seen people from other countries do it too.
However, it's now becoming the thing to just cut all the remaining hair very short (full-on buzz cut) so that the baldness is less noticeable.

We have a lot of it here in the good old USA.  I find it utterly disgusting and I've always wondered why they just don't either buzz cut it or just bald it all.  Bald is much more beautiful than that "comb-over".  Donald Trump is the leader of the pack....he's the biggest offender...I think that's why guys think it's OK here.

Dad put down his drink smiled and replied "Yes, I know it does!"

<question>



Girl says I owe her money... should I pay her or dump her?



Third date, this girl takes me out to dinner to a nice restaurant.

The bill comes and she's expecting me to get it... A little back story here, I took her out and paid twice before this one.

I reach for my wallet and decide to try and see how she reacts to me forgetting my wallet...

I said "hmm, I must have left my wallet in my other pants". Could you get this? (I was just kidding, just wanted to see what she'd say)..

She said "Alright, we can go to an ATM after this and you can pay me back."

After she paid, I asked her:

Me: "How much do I owe you?"
She: "With tip it comes to $76"..

So basically she expected me to pay her back the full amount of the bill and the tip, for her invite to dinner.

Me: "Nah, it's your treat, you took me out for dinner... "
She: "Excuse me?"
Me: "The bill is my responsibility?"
She: "If you were a real man it would be".
Me: "Good bye".

And I left... She trotted behind me hoping I would turn around... then she started trying to justify her stance and whatever...

I just said "I'll talk to you in a couple days" and I went home... I never answered her calls, I'm really consider dumping the tw**...

Should I dump her? Give her another chance? or worse, pay her $76?



</question>



<additional details>



No I don't need to pay her back to dump her... and secondly, I don't owe her anything.

If I owe her, then she owes me for the first two dates...



It is the responsibility of the man to pay the bill?... I wasn't present when that rule went into effect... seems like that rule only favors women... cheap skate women... I'm dumping the cheap bit**

give her the money which i don't think you have to but make her realize that when she asks someone out she is should pay especially if SHE takes you some where expensive and charging some one you take out is  unacceptable but dump her anyways 
if you dump her and dont pay her it makes you look cheap if you give her another chance its like your saying you dont mind what she did

on the 3rd date -- if you like the girl you should have paid the bill AND gone from there.  Emphasis on "gone from there."  But my guess is you don't like her that much after the convo you shared above???  If she doesn't change her $$$ loving ways in a few weeks and treats you like crap just for cash, dump her in a few weeks.

The key thing is that she took you out to dinner, ie she asked you out.  Therefore she should pay.

But is it worth ending the relationship over? Probably not, you can educate her on etiquette.



But maybe there are other reasons to move on

Talk to her.  Tell her you feel it's a bit cheeky of her to invite you out to dinner, and expect you to pay for it; you feel it is taking advantage of you.



My rule is 'whoever gives the invite pays, or makes other arrangements (such splitting the bill).

If you don't come to an agreement about who pays on any future dates, then dump her, because it will be a continuing issue if you two stay together.

Wow!
SHE invited you, SHE needed to pay for the bill 
but I'll be honest, I think you could have split the bill
it's just me, but it's about compromising..
and she shouldn't have whined about it, but yeah, either of those would have worked..

She was in the wrong and it clearly shows and she didn't realize how much of an *** she was til it was too late...so it seems..



BUT as for you, you need to be a man and not just ignore her calls, if you don't want to continue..
then at least be man enough and let her know, you told her you would call her later on but you haven't..
don't be a coward!



**Now, if you really think that this was that big of an issue, then call and tell her you don't think you'll work out, but Im all for second chances, so if you think there's an ounce in you that might like her and thinks you could forgive if she comes clean from her error, then give her another shot!
Good luck!

Does it bother you when management calls everyone "team"?



It seems pretty common place now that in most corporate work environments that anyone in any level of management will refer to and address the people that work under them as "team"



Is this just politically correct BS? Does this bother you on some level?  And if so, what other ways might management address people that would be better?

I think it was just bad luck.  It was "coworkers" who was talking about the girl, not you.  You just happened to ask the girl what her name was and she snapped back at you.  She probably wondered why you asked her name or she knew people had been talking about her.



I think I would have taken the high road and just apologized.  Honesty is the best policy.  Sounds to me like your coworkers were trying to set you up.
Always be careful when it come to office "gossip".  It's always a really big weave to get tangled up in and the one who is least involved always seems to be caught up in the web the worst.  Good luck!!

No they are not your friends, thay sound like @ssholes!  I suggest you either stick up for yourself very firmly, and tell them to knock it off, or quit the job. You are entitled to wear any kind of shirts, within company dress code policy, that you want. No-one has the right to harrass you and esp. not to slap or touch ANY part of your body.

</answer from>



<answer>



It has been that was for a long time.  BUT if you start to draw SS before your full retirement age, you will receive a lessor amount.  But if you wait, you will receive more.  Call your SS office and they can explain it or go online.  You cannot sign for Medicare until you are 65 even if you draw SS earlier.

My horrible sister in law how do I deal with this?



I feel I need to clarify more on my last question. My daughter has severe peanut allergies and this woman has said threatened to feed my daughter things with peanut refinement in them because she doesn't believe me - this could kill my daughter. She has called me rude because I said I am voting yes on a proposition she doesn't agree with. On her wedding day for her rehearsal dinner which she insisted be at my parents house she did no work and would have shown up to nothing had my husband and I not been there to set everything up - didn't even say thank you. Then at her baby shower had a fit that the fruit we had wasn't organic.  I love my brother but feel like our whole families can never interact with her there.

She sounds like a real tool. She is disagreeing with everything because she is insecure. That does not mean that you have to cater to her because she is your brother's wife. She is a poser. I would just ignore all the negative things she is saying  because she is baiting your entire family for a reaction.

I wouldn't say anything about it in order to avoid a family conflict but I would just quietly stop helping with things that she is going to be involved with. Do not agree to help host events for her and most of all do not leave your daughter alone with this unbalanced woman. Hopefully with time she may grow up, but if she does not, try not to feed her megalomania by arguing with her.

I would be extremely worried to have my child around her since she has told you that she wants to cause harm to her.  I guess if it were my daughter and her aunt said things like that I would get a restraining order on her.  There is no way I would let her around my child-EVER!!!  She sounds terrible.  You might want to tell her that if your daughter is fed something that does have peanuts and your daughter has a reaction then she (your sister in law) could be charged with attempted murder.

Next time she makes a remark about something,point out who bought it! Don't play into her little games. She is obviously very immature,and a danger to your child. When she starts making sense,pay attention! Until then, pretend she isn't even there. BUT, never avoid the chance to point out ,what a loser she is!

1) Above all else, keep your daughter away from this woman, and teach your daughter never to eat anything that this woman has made, given to her, or been around. Teach your child to always ask you before eating cakes, cookies, thai food, things like that.



2) This woman is going to cause problems in your family from here on in. Many families have someone like this. We call ours the ***** sister in law from hell.



3) Try to see your brother at times when you know she is unavailable, working etc. Call him only when you know she is not around.



4) Explain to him your fears about the peanut allergy thing, so he knows that you have serious reasons for concern. People die from peanut allergies. Cut out some newspaper articles about such incidents and show them to him.



5) She is going to complain about anything that isn't organic, so if there is a family occasion where she absolutely has to be there, put a label in front of each dish to say which is organic and which is not. If she is going to be a food nazi and only eat organic food, it is up to her to bring her own food along to these occasions so that she has something to eat. Tell her that unfortunately you don't have an organic supplier locally, so she should be aware that she needs to do her own catering.



6) Don't enter into debate about this. Tell both your brother and her that the peanut thing is a very serious problem for you and you will not discuss it further after providing basic information that any sensible person would take on board. If they can't guarantee they will act on your concerns, dont eat there.



7) Let your sister in law know that if she was ever found giving peanuts to your daughter, knowing full well that she has an allergy, she could be spending time in prison for murder, and that you won't hesitate to take legal action if anything suspicious occurs. It would be considered a deliberate assault by police.



Your political views and opinions are none of her business. You are entitled to vote in any way you think fit, and so is she. Don't discuss politics with her in future.



You had better develop a few strategies for dealing with this woman, she is not going to go away. Talk to other family members and present a united front, otherwise you are all going to be bullied and continually upset by her behaviour.

How old is your daughter?  If she's old enough you should tell her never to eat anything at your SIL's house.  She's probably bluffing to wind you up, but you just never know with some people.



Basically there's not much you can do apart from keep your daughter away from the horrible witch.  I've got an awful sister-in-law too and as a result we just don't see my brother much anymore - last time I saw him was at a funeral which was nearly 3 years ago!



It's sad but there's not much you can do really apart from maybe make your feelings clear to your brother and tell him that you won't be visiting anymore because of his poor choice of wife!  I'm serious - you shouldn't pretend to like her.  If he doesn't know already, then tell him - life is too short to put up with entertaining horrible people.

Thank goodness somebody else has a horrible in-law.  Sounds like your sister-in-law is jealous.  I feel the same way about my brother, when she is around he don't act like himself.  When she's not there, we have the best time!



I would tell him, if he don't control her, then you will-by getting the welfare system involved.  Take a tape of her.  Get a restraining order, if that don't work have your parents to come over for dinner and just avoid both of the at the same time.  Contact the police let them know that she is threatening YOUR child.  You are the mother, stand up for your child!  If you don't stand up for her, then nobody else will!

Mom's 50th Birthday, Massage/Facial a good idea?



My mom's 50th birthday is coming up, and she claims all she wants/needs is an alarm clock, a new coffee maker, and a cd.



We come from a small/rural town, and she's coming to visit the city where I live, and I thought it would be a nice idea to take her for a massage and facial at a local spa. Any opinions? My mother will NOT say she actually wants something like this, but deep down I think she really does want something special. Any other ideas?

"The List" of wants/needs are just like me with my kids.  I can buy anything I want but feel sorry for them trying to figure out a good gift.  (They're good kids:  they always come up with something not on the list).



I learned how to do a full body massage and practiced on several women.  Not one ever complained, but it is 2 hours of work!  I've now learned to pay for my girlfriend's day at the spa because it's best left to the professionals.  Yes, your mother will enjoy the treatment even while insisting how frivolous it was.



If you decide against the spa then it gets tough.  If she's not in a position where money is tight then she'll get anything she needs.  The trick is to get something that doesn't collect and isn't necessary like concert tickets, cruises, etc.  The same thing goes after she retires except then it's called cash!

I did that for my mom's birthday last year.  I got her a gift certificate for a spa, enough money for anything she wanted.  And so far she hasn't used it.  It has been about 9 months.  You might want to ask her if that is something that she thinks would sound fun or hint on the benefits of a spa.  Most people do like getting facials and massages, but some people are uncomfortable with it.  I think it sounds like a fun time and a way to make her feel special and pampered.

~~Well, it's an awesome luxury for the massage and facial, so I think she'll love it.



However, if money is tight for her, I would get the gifts she asked for. These would last a long time, and are very necessary items.



How about a compromise. You give her the massage, and then buy her the gifts. Just need some oils and towels, candles, and peaceful music.Just rubbing the back and relaxing someone is as good as a massage!~`

What would you think of her reaction?



There's a very quiet, somewhat shy young woman you work with. She was out for two days b/c she had a bad asthma attack and was taken to the hospital. When she called out, she said she didn't want you to worry or to let anyone else worry.  She returned today and even though said she was better than before, she occasionally would put her head down in between working.  She was also EXTRA quiet today.



Since you were going to be all over today, you told her, and emphasized, that if she's not feeling well she needs to tell someone.  Upon hearing this, she slightly tensed her shoulders and agreed with a shy shrug.



What would you think of her reaction?

I would think that her energy is drained and she wants more time off but doesn't want to have to ask for it in fear of losing her job.  Maybe the person who was empathizing could let the supervisor know that this girl still seems lethargic and they should watch to make sure she's OK.  Asthma problems can take a lot out of a person.

Obviously there is something more wrong with her and she just feels it is a little too private, or she could have just been embarrassed about having to have ask for help. If you are really concerned just keep an eye on her discreetly, you don't want her feeling uncomfortable or irritated like she is being babysat.

No! I absolutely do not hate them. I feel sorry for them though that they have this need to get attention in such a negative way. As far as the modest women, you really should try and join a church singles group. I know that its hard finding modest women, but I do know they are out there. Most women at our church dress pretty modestly.

I don't know how professional your work place is.  But you very well might have just lost your job.



1)  You swore at her.  2)  You yelled at her.



You have to be able to work things out with coworkers.  If someone does something you don't like, you talk to them about and try to solve the problem in a rational matter.  If that doesn't work you should take your issues to your boss or the hr department.  Strong arming a co-worker like that is not how you are supposed to work out problems.



Profanity is never a good idea in the work place.  What if a customer heard you say that?

In a work place that is very improper.....while I understand where you are coming from, I myself have lost it on a co-worker there were many ways you could have dealt with it.
For example "Look I don't appreciate your attitude and would appreciate it if you didn't act like that around me" or "Your rudeness and condescending attitude need to change ASAP"

I can well imagine that would have shut her up!  However, even though you were obviously at your wit's end at being provoked all day you shouldn't have basically lowered yourself to her level.  If this should happen again just tell her to stop being so rude and condescending long before she has pushed you to the point you snap and yell at her.

Speaking as a supervisor myself,  it is not so much a question of rude as it is a question of creating a hostile work environment.  This could cause at least a write up put in your personnel file.  Diff companies have diff policies on how many write ups lead to suspensions,  termination, etc.  It's best to get out of a sitauiton like that. I have rarely been so angry I felt I was going to totally lose my temper, but the few times I have I simply excused myself and took a walk down the road.  On one occasion the walk took 7 miles before I was cooled off, but it sure beat saying something that would bite me in the butt for years to come.

I think I'd have pulled her aside and talked to her in private rather than airing your thoughts in public. However, it's done now and the fact remains that you have spoke your peace. So, with that being said and done you may go on and act as if nothing ever happen. In other words carry yourself in a professional manner. I think she got the hint.

I always believe in making a nice basket. Put in things like, favorite magazines, drinks, gift certificates, stationary, a nice pin,a dollar store necklace, perfume, comb, or brush, a candle, or things you think they would enjoy. Then get a clear, colored outer plastic wrap, & set the filled basket on the wrap, & bring it all up over top of the basket, & tie a pretty ribbon around it! (add a balloon, too)  It's makes a special gift, & a great conversation piece!

I quit my job and my boss has left 15 voice mails. She has called over 50 times!?



There is nothing I owe them, no paper work I need to finish, nothing I left at the office.  She is just calling me and telling me how crappy I am for leaving.  I left because she hasn't lightened my work load even though my doctor gave me papers for light duty during my pregnancy.  I am not having a normal pregnancy and cannot be during hard labor.



I answered the phone the first two times she called and told her No, I wasn't kidding, no I would not be returning, and no absolutely do NOT fudge the paperwork to make it temporary disability.



How can I put an end to this?



Should I call HR although not an employee any more?



I have answered everything she wants to know, what else can I do?



Don't want this to be a legal issue, I just want the calls to stop.



Can't change my number either, It's my business line.

Thank you... I will post this information.



I used to work in a nursing home with about 300 residents and clothes would get lost all the time. You would not believe the fuss families would make over a missing shirt.
We would fill out a form asking them to describe the missing item...color, brand, size, etc,
After a while, we'd just toss away the forms.
With 300 residents, many of whom had memory problems, clothes disappeared. One old lady threw her clothes into the trash, one gave her things away, people would hang clothes in someone else's closets.
we just pretended to do something about it because it was impossible to search for every lost item.

One of the keys to being a good conversationalist is to be a good listener. When the silent moments strike, you simply ask a follow up question. If you've already learned that your acquaintance has 3 children, you can follow up with questions about them. Or if they mention someplace they have lived or worked, you can ask about that. Hobbies, interests, upcoming vacation or holiday plans are all good places to start.

Ask open-ended questions!



**First of all you need to know your audience.  Your audience is the person you're talking to.  You would talk about different things with a child than you would with an adult.



Ask the other person's views on certain issues i.e. election, homosexuality, abortion.



-OR-  On a lighter note you can ask fun, interesting questions,i.e. whats the weirdest dream you've ever had or what part of your body do you wash first when your taking a shower?
These conversations will lead to other more interesting ones.



Make the conversation fun-flowing. LOL

<question>



A serious problem... please help?



I'm a high school english teacher (I teach junior year english) and I'm quite new at the high school I teach at. I'm 23, so most of the students identify with my young age. This last friday I had an accident in the lunch room (another student spilled her nachos and soda all over me).



She was very apologetic, and I didn't have time to leave for home and change, so she let me borrow her cheerleading uniform. There was a mix up with the adminstration however, and they ended up calling in a sub teacher for my last class period.



It was very embarassing. When I arrived for class, the sub assumed I was a student, and not only had me sit with the other students, but also wrote me a detention for 'talking back,' and 'being defiant.' (I was trying to convince him I was the teacher.) To avoid making a scene, I pretending to be a student for the rest of the class.



Now I'm just worried how to act if I see the sub on campus again. I know he comes to our high school quite often, and still thinks that I'm a student.



Any advice would be appreciated. TY

He needs to know that while you are not mad at him, he needs to know you are the teacher and why you were out of dress code. He may need to learn new things, and stereotyping won't help him later in life.

This is a tough one. If the person is on salary and will be paid for a sick day, I'd be much more firm in telling that person that you are worried about getting sick and you would appreciate their going home to get well.  You can say it firmly but politely.  If the person won't go home, you may want to talk with the supervisor and see if a policy can be created where people are strongly encouraged to stay home if they are sneezing, coughing, feverish, or otherwise clearly contagious.



However, if this is an hourly job where the person is not paid when he/she is ill, this gets much dicier. In these economic times, people need every penny and often can't afford to take a day off without pay.  In this case, you'll need to be more compassionate. And yes, keep that hand sanitizer close by, and stay as far away as you possibly can from the sick person.



Good luck!

Unfortunately some short-sighted bosses encourage employees to come to work even when sick and disapprove of employees taking days off even when those employees are very ill and spreading germs. Unfortunately some individual are financial circumstances such that missing even a single day's pay is not an option. Wash your hands a lot and get everyone involved in disinfecting telephones, doorknobs, and other surfaces.

Kindly suggest that they may need to go home and rest. "Oh so-and so, you will get better much faster if you go get some rest a home". If they still don't get the hint supply them with a get well basket equipped with anti-viral tissue, hand sanitizer, some kind of tea and a mug, as well as a few face mask (the kind that cover your nose and mouth), and some lysol wipes. It will make you look nice, and maybe they will get the hint then.

I almost always HAVE to come into work if I can drag myself in - but then again, I am frequently the only one in the office. If I worked in a different environment; where there were many others in the office with me, I would definitely be more considerate (and wouldn't feel that I have to come in, as there would be someone else who could complete any necessary tasks).

Why is it so many people destroy their entire lives because of arrogance?



Being a student of history, having a stupid father, and working for different people, I've realized that most people who fail in life or at leading others do so because of arrogance. I mean that many of these people simply fail to have an open discussion and listen to the criticism of other people. These people actually think everything they do is right, and everyone else is wrong.



I left one business because the boss was a complete tyrant who refused to be flexible and just look at the numbers, which were plain as day, and adapt. Americans are arrogant because they buy gas guzzlers, use extensive amounts of credit, and support stupid wars even though it is leaving us in massive debt and making this country even more vulnerable than one turbaned terrorist ever could.



Why do people let this happen? Are arrogance and pride the big factors in determining whether an organization is about to fail?

People should always be open to constructive criticism. It is how we grow, learning how others see us. If we constantly think we are right, we fail to grow and ruin our lives by thinking others are at fault. Those who have acheived in their lives are open to constructive criticism. Not just people in the workforce, there are some arrogant workers around, but people in everyday life who are dealt the hardest of blows and use strength and turn to God and know that there is an element of truth in all hardship and pain. It is often painful to hear the truth about ourselves, but we must do it to learn.



I come from a Social Work background and if you are not open to change and criticism, unfortunately you are out the door. This is where many people have failed is in this regard. They think they know it all. This is common in young people. It is a hard lesson to learn we don't know as much or aren't as good as we thought we were. We can be angry and fight it or choose to consider it and think it out and grow from it.

Its plain arrogance. The problem of arrogance is that it has a lot of selfishness hidden, but nobody want to realize that.
There are too many that are like that around the world, they believe only in what they think and feel (if there is any feeling at all).
I am not american and I don't live there, but I guess that the main problem is not to recognize that something has been done wrong. I know is very easy to judge from a distance, but I feel very sorry looking how things are going bad. America is a big nation and was a great one some decades ago, but now in different scales (from the cost of gasoline up to the cost of an endless war) all seems going in the wrong direction.
People don't like to recognize that something failed, and they continue dreaming there own dream (here comes the selfishness), thinking that tomorrow will be better, but how can tomorrow be better if there is no sign on changing the present? Changing ideologies, policies, points of view, decisions today will create a strong base to begin building a better place for tomorrow.

Do you think people like this are weird? obsessed? or crazy? read the details?



there is this guy who works in the school cafeteria at my college. he looks my way, and he has said things to me like nice things about how i look, and asked me about school. at first i thought he was just being nice, now i've noticed this man checking me out, sitting where he can see me eating at the cafeteria, staring at me eating, and saying things like how come you keep changing your sit in the cafeteria, or i haven't been seeing you around!



i thought maybe i could sit somewhere else, and avoid him, but although he hasn't been saying any of these things to me lately, he's been watching me in the cafeteria, and walking close to me...



i used to have a boyfriend, actually last year i had 2 boyfriends, and they told me, i should just tell him i have a boyfriend, and he'd leave me alone, but i never got a chance to say it...



no i don't like the guy, he's old enough to be my dad's age which is like 40 something, and he calls girls in the cafeteria shorty...



he seems like a mack daddy or something, sort of obsessive, and the feelings aren't mutual...



he sees me usually in the cafeteria solo, and he seems to try to bother me then, actually a lot of males work in the cafeteria, and they are always checking out girls and stuff, but this guy has drawn the line, he isn't just ghetto, he is annoying. even if he was good looking, i still wouldn't want him in my life, haha...



what should i do, keep ignoring him, i try to avoid even coming into the cafeteria when he's around...because i know he's a loser.

He is kind of a pervert.  Some men don't realize they are no longer something a young girl wants, but they still want younger women.  He is stalking you, after a fashion, since he refuses to take a hint.  He is acting creepy and you can tell him you are just not into older guys or that you have a boyfriend and so you would appreciate it if he stopped hanging around trying to chat you up.  Or you could stand up, look him in the eye and say "Not going to happen!" or "Can't you take a hint?  I am NOT interested" and then storm out.



Or just sit with some other people and point him out to them and tell them what a freak he is - because guys like that do not like to be made fun of or be called on the kind of creepy old dudes that they are.



He just wants something fresher than he is, as they say.  LOL  And it is weird that someone thinks a college girl is going to be crazy for some middle-aged dude who can only score a cafeteria job.  I was stalked by a positively ancient Asian man who carried blueprints around on the bus.  He could not imagine that a young professional woman about a third his age was not wanting him - guys are freaks!  LOL  Like those guys who are biking on some kid's bike because of a DUI but they wink and leer at you as you wait at the traffic light like you must be dying to get on that broken down bike-to-nowhere with them!  Yuck!

More than likely he's a lonely loser and relatively harmless (other than being annoying), but on the slight chance that he's not, DON'T piss him off. Try not to make any more eye contact with him than is absolutely necessary and change your daily routine when possible. Just stay away from him if at all possible. If he seeks you out for conversation, excuse yourself and leave. Your safety is the most important issue when someone makes you uncomfortable.

The only thing these type of people listen to is if your blunt and straight up with them.  Tell him he is making you uncomfortable and to stop talking to you and staring at you.  If he doesn't, contact campus security.



Trust me, avoiding him or making up excuses will only make the matter worse.  Be blunt.

First you have to tell him directly to stop talking to you, tell him something like "I don't think that my schedule is none of your business, and your comments are not appropriate" If he doesn't stop talk with his supervisor and report him. He should know better than bothering the customers. Don't hide or try to ignore him if he hasn't get a clue that his attitude is not welcome he is not going to unless you are direct.

Don't ignore anyone at the table. I had a waitress that completely ignored me when I took my family out for my husband's birthday. My hubby and son got thier pop refilled before they needed it, while I never got a refill on my water. I was the one paying the bill. She got 0 tip.



Also, a waitperson who can make the meal seamless. Don't interrupt what may obviously be a meeting. Bring the food and drinks without small talk. Of course, if you need to clarify something about the order, that's different.



I tip the best when I have been made to feel like I mattered, and that I lacked nothing.

First of all, there is a fine line between being helpful and being too helpful. If you go to a table too much, they will get annoyed. My suggestion is when you give them thier menu, don't forget to greet them, tell them your name, and the specials of the day. Example : "Hi, welcome to Four Corners. I'm Alanna, and I'll be your server today. Would you like to hear the specials?"  If they say yes, make sure you have them memorized. Then ask for drinks. When you get back, ask if they would like more time with the menu. Normally, they will say yes, unless they are a regular. You should be able to watch them and be able to tell by thier signals if they are ready. One tell tale sign is when they put the menus down. Get thier order. Keep a watch on thier drink levels, especially if they have coffee. Offer to give them refills as soon as they start to get close to empty. When the food is up, make sure to bring the customers extra napkins, especially when they have children. Also, if they have something like steak, make sure you ask if they need any steak sauce. The less the customer has to ask you for, the better you will be. When they are finished with thier meal, ask if they would like dessert. If they say no, ask if they would like a box. Ask if you can take some of the plates they are done with. That way when you come back with the box, you can give them the check, and tell them that its there whenever they are ready. Make sure not to come off as trying to rush them off. Really, the best tip I can give you is to come in a few minutes before your shift to prepare. That way you can learn the specials and if there is any new desserts or if any is sold out. Its good to see if any food is sold out. Just find your groove, if that makes sense. When you are a server, you get into a groove where you can go super fast and do fifty things at one. Like a Super Server, haha. Hope this helped.

Ever seen Office Space?  Don't be that guy.
Be friendly, but not in my face.
And don't be pushing the daily specials, beer, appetizers, or desserts on me.
Keep my water filled, and be available in case I want anything.
Trim yer nails, for God's sake, and be clean, well-shaven, and skip the cologne.  Write a little smiley face on my bill and I'll kick yer a@@.
Treat me like you want me as a repeat customer, not as a one-time thing.
Depending on the restaurant, gimme all the freebies you can: when I was a waiter, we could do soft drinks, soups, salads, and bread ourselves and not send it through the system: hook a customer up and that means big tip!!!

I'm glad that you asked this question to improve your performance. What I like about a waiter/waitress is their politeness and friendliness. The accuracy can always be improved by double checking the order by reading it back. A nice smile when greeting and checking if patrons need something during their meal it's a big plus.  Sometimes they just give you the food and you don't see them again until they deliver the check. I don't like that. Of course if its busy I understand but for me that wins them points and a bigger tip ;)

A good waiter would try to have you seated in an area you like. They are courteous to you and don't try to force their specials of the day on you. The thing I hate and never fails is chewing on a piece of food and being asked something and nearly choking on the food to give them a reply.

I've told my counselor that I'm being domestically abused at home by my mom + family and I even got some scars to prove it. Okay, the point is I'm going to be taken away by child services and my mom was crying last night and was saying how she's going to die but not in peace by knowing how she drove her daughter out of her life and didn't realize it until last night. She even admitted that this is a terrible family and want me to be happy. So she said if I want to leave, go ahead and leave and she wishes me to have a better family than this one.

It sounds like your mom has spent so much time living in dysfunction that she came to view it as normal (which is totally common).  She probably truly didn't realize that things were as bad as they were, and rightly blames herself for not doing her job as a mother.  She's showing remorse and wanting you to have a better life than what she can give you right now.



Edit: Your mom will probably not go to jail, and even if they do press charges, you won't go to jail if you don't cooperate.  I don't know why anyone would say such a thing!



I think she took a very honest and hard look at what was going on and then made a very difficult admission to you.  Hopefully, now that she has had her eyes opened, she will be able to heal from whatever was done to her and help you to heal from all that has happened to you, even if you never come back to stay with her.



I hope that you are able to get help in dealing with the horrible things you've had to endure and that one day you'll be able to forgive your family, even if just for your own sake, and put it behind you so that you can live the rich full life you deserve to live!  My prayers are with you.

Sounds like she might be emotionally retarded.  (But frankly, you might be, too.)  It might be more beneficial to think of it in terms of both you AND your mother are in desperate need of making some changes in your lives BUT the odds are really stacked against you that you'll be able to do it ALONE.  Basically, we all could use a little bit of help in straightening out our lives.  Plus, you're under eighteen: nobody has it all figured out by 18; lots of people live their whole lives without figuring it all out.  So if you want out of that family, get out, and then figure out if you want to go back.



It's kind of shocking when we realize that our parents don't have it all together; certainly we DESERVE parents who have it all together: but unfortunately, this doesn't exist.  And so the task for YOU will be to find out if you can love your mother despite her serious mistakes and limitations and awful/beautiful humanness, or if you will carry this resentment with you forever.  I recommend talking about this with a shrink.
I look at it this way: you wouldn't get ANGRY or UPSET with a retarded person because they can't figure out long division; why would you get upset with an emotionally retarded person for being all messed up?  I'll bet that if she wasn't your mother, you'd feel nothing but compassion for her.  But since she IS your mother, that's a whole lot more complicated.

Your mom isn't retarded, she's mentally ill.  The fact that you have been abused to the point that children's services is taking custody of you tells us all that you desperately need to be out of that household.  Your mother is very sick and in need of therapy.  It is not your job to heal her, she is the adult and it is her responsibility to get help for herself and her family.  If she doesn't die in peace it's her problem for not seeing what she was doing to you.  You are the child and none of this is your fault.  Go with Children's Services, ask for therapy and do whatever it takes to take care of yourself.  You deserve to be happy, and unfortunately, sometimes that means getting away from toxic people even if they are your biological family.  Doesn't mean you won't find a loving family elsewhere.  Look at it this way; can it be worse?  Know that there are loving people in the world who want to help you.  Bless you, sweetheart, I'll pray for you.

No, it sounds like your Mom is apologizing in a round about way, and that she really doesn't want you to leave.  Though, now that the state is involved you very well may not have a choice.  As a matter of fact, in almost all cases l like yours they will press charges against your Mom (or whoever was abusing you) and they will go to prison for a while.  And you won't be able to stop it.  I was in that kind of position as a teenager, and once the whole court thing started I tried to stop it.



You can't.  They do it on your behalf and force you to participate, or you go to jail too.



I feel badly for you.  I feel badly that you were abused.  And I feel bad for where you're going.  You don't know it yet, but you've got a very hard road ahead of you.  Good luck hun.  And if you discover that there's anything that I can do to help, don't hesitate to email me via the link on my profile page.

Neighbor has a car alarm going off constantly.  How do I tell them it's annoying?



For about a week now, someone that is staying with my neighbor has had something wrong with their car horn.  Every 30 minutes, their horn blows 5 or 6 times really fast.  This has to be a malfunction with their horn or alarm system and they have to know it's there.  It goes off all day and all night.



My family has a good relationship with this neighbor and we have known him for years, but we work different schedules, so I can't just go next door and talk to them about it.



How do you think I should tell my neighbor that this is really starting to get annoying and I'm losing sleep because of it?



Should I leave a note on the car?  The car isn't his and I don't want to offend his guests, but it is their car.



Should I leave a note on his door?
But most importantly, how do I tell him that the car horn is bothering my family without turning into the crotchety old neighbor lady?

Call the police and request they notify the owner of the malfunction. Do not request to press any charges of noise. They will simply try to find the owner and inform them that they are distrubing the neighbors. No names have to be issued. First time the police are as a rule friendly when they call on a person for this.

Notes are usually much worse than conversation. People can read all kinds of things in a note - it's probably better if you're talking with the owner of the car than your neighbor, but it wouldn't hurt if your neighbor was present at the time.



The alarm might very well need to be reseted - it sounds like the long-term tampering system is activated and won't go off. So if he has installed it himself, he'll probably find the instructions on how to reset it in a manual, otherwise it's a workshop for that particular brand that should help him.



Is it possible that you could coax some other neighbor or family member that knows cars to go over and "offer their help"? It could be easier for you to bribe that person with a sponge cake or similar to offer their help. Males and cars you know - they will probably listen more on someone who is male and knows cars. It's a thing of prejudice, but you may reach your target with minimal effort.

I know exactly what you mean!  My name is Deidre, and people always want to pronounce it Deirdre!  I generally just pronounce it correctly, and explain that while Deirdre is the original Gaelic, it means sorrow, and I refuse to have a sorry name.  I've even been known to teel them about the Princess the name comes from (it's a beautiful story).  It really only gets on my nerves when they keep doing it after I' ve corrected them several times.  I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to be called by your correct name, and as long as you're saying it nicely, they shouldn't be offended by it.  I can't imagine anyone saying that it's rude to correct them politely.

Are these people your customers? Because that's why they're offended. The customer is always right, even when it comes to your name.



Yes, your name is important to you but unless it's a classmate, co-worker, friend, or someone you're going to see more than once in your life, just let the mistake slide.

Well nice to see I or we aren't only one. I have a slightly different spelling of my rather common name and so I get a 'phonics' version...After I correct them (nice) and show or explain how they should be looking @ spelling they get it and are sometimes like "Duh..that's makes sense"  We get same thing with my son..they always want to add an "H" to it. I more than him politely explain there is no "H" and pronounce it correctly or give an a famous name example. I think @ times when you have Italian or European descent names people want to Americanize them because that's more common. I say if people who have truly ridiculous names get them pronounced correctly my son & I deserve the very least as well



Source(s):



Another thing I dislike is where I work callers who ALWAYS call mispronouncing the person they are looking for name and almost mocking it....I give them correct pronunciation time & time again, but still the caller feels they are 'too good' or 'too important' to care or make note of how to pronounce another's name. I find it very condescending to person they are calling to speak with!

I have a similar problem My last name is Irish starting with Mc but I get just about everyone trying to add a second C or they spell it Mac.



Most of the time I just politely inform them that I am an Irish Mc not a Scottish Mac.  Usually get a laugh but then they usually remember the next time.



I don't think it's rude to correct someones initial mistake.  If they take offense that is their problem not yours.  Just try not to sound condescending, People usually take offense to the way they are corrected more than the correction itself.

Considering how many people have crazy, made-up, unpronounceable names how can you not correct them when they mispronounce?  I don't know how to say anyone's name anymore!  I have no problem with being politely corrected, only when they act huffy about it.  You have a right to be called by your name, and anyone who has attitude is being defensive and immature.  I always thank them for correcting me so I don't look stupid for not saying their name right.

You are right ... as long as you are doing so politely; there is nothing rude about the mere act of correcting someone who is mispronouncing your name or calling you by one name when you prefer to be called by both. If they are calling you by only the first name, rather than mispronouncing your name, you can say, "Please call me (my name)."

I think it depends on the situation.  If you're talking to someone you've just met, that you're probably not going to see again, I don't think it matters what they call you.  Some versions of my name I'll let people get away with too, since it doesn't bother me much.  And timing is important too ... wait for a lull in the conversation where you can discreetly mention it.



But I'm unfortunate in having a last name that can be mispronounced to sound like another word for butt, and you bet I'm on top of it when someone does that :) no matter who they are or what the timing is.

To save money, they are cutting back on housekeeping and having me clean the toilets and showers. Is this aginst health code? If they came back there to find me for breakfast I dont think they would still want it if I was scrubbing urinals at the time but thats just me.
disgusting yes
against code?  not sure.
thanks!

That depends on a lot of things, what state you're in for starters.  Wash your hands with hot water and soap after any bathroom duties (required by management or required by your natural body processes).  Illegal, unlikely, unsavory. . .definitely.

I'm unsure of my girlfriends motives, does anyone know of any see through floors?



Hi, does anyone know of any see through floors or dance floors in any clubs, bars or places in Melbourne, Australia? In the warmer weather when we go out, my girlfriend often wears a dress and doesn't wear any undies under it. I want to take her to a place like that, and when we "happen to" turn up there and "oh look, fancy that, a see through floor". I want to see if she "lights up" at the opportunity, or if she avoids it. I want to see if her reason for not wearing undies under a skirt is purely for comfort as she says it is.

try to find another way to drop that in. you dont need see through floors.. by the way you are in the minority in australia being a male.. if she wont go for you, you should have plenty more around you... i believe there are statistically 7 women to 1 man...

Where are your manners?!?



I'm 22 years old and a mum to a 3 year old and a 5month old baby. I'm really frustrated at how rude the average person is. I use the bus quite often and it really winds me up when i board the bus and someone is sat in the space for pushchairs and wheelchairs and don't move to accommodate the space for my pram! You know who you are, you sit there listening to your mp3 player or carry on reading as if you haven't seen me! And when i kindly ask you to move somewhere else, you give me a dirty look and sigh as if i'm the one being rude when there are at least 30 other free seats on the bus! Then when i come to getting off the bus, theres always someone jumping on the bus before you're even given chance to get off! I've been on the bus many times and can't believe people don't even give up their seat for the elderly anymore! No one even offered me a seat on a crowded bus when i was 8 months pregnant! thats right, you just watched me in distress as others pushed past me to get off the bus! How can you people be so rude?! Did your parents never teach you manners?!



</question>



<additional details>



This isnt a rant as some of you think, i just wanted to raise the issue to give people something to think about.  and to laura, how can i sit on a seat at the back of a bus when iv got a pram with a young baby asleep in it?!



i always gave my seat up when i went to school on bus and friends laughed at me for it. and i know there are still well mannered people out there! it must just be the area i live in!

Take a chill pill.  You were probably one of those people before you had kids.  Society just doesn't emphasize manners anymore.  It's something you just have to deal with.  But don't worry, there are people out there who are kind and considerate, hopefully you'll run into some one day.

Respect in all it's forms went out of the window years ago, However it is not completely dead. the trouble starts at home, continues in school and carries on in the workplace.
In the brain, manners are next to respect, just in front of etiquette and thoughtfulness, the least used part of the brain

Say see ya later and find a guy who appreciates your achievements and can tell when you deserve a pat on the back. This guy is only thinking about himself and he even thinks that taking you out to "celebrate" his good fortune is doing you a favour. Discovering that his stuff-up won't lead to a fine is hardly an achievement worth celebrating and the dinner and cinema is probably more about getting into your pants at the end of the night.

He's doing what men do best: acknowledging what is in his eyes, a victory.



Anniversaries are "boring" - they just commemorate a victory. For men, (well, many of them, not all), it's about the chase and the victory. Then on to the next challenge...



To get him to remember an anniversary - "Wow, I can't believe we've been together for five years next week. Last year was so lovely when you did X. I wonder what you're going to do to surprise me this year. You're always so thoughtful / clever / kind" - yeah, sucking up works, but if it gets him to remember, he'll be thinking of it as a competition - how to make this year special.



Or talk about what a friend's boyfriend did - then he'll get the hint. But don't belittle his little victory or he could resent you. Just say - "This is great news. Not as big as, say, getting a new job. So when you get your next job or when I get mine, you'll have to think of a way to celebrate it." And then remind him when it happens. Guys don't often get the hint...

Are you friends with any police in the town you live?  I'd have him pulled over more often if you get a night out for it!!  Halloween is coming up, you could always rent a uniform for a while.  But really, men can be really strange about stuff like this, Men are from Mars, Women are from Venous (is that how it went?)  Tell him that you are grateful things aren't as bad as they could have been, maybe make it sound like you are really "celebrating" the fact that you saved money by not paying a big fine or better yet - he could get a card and take you out just to say I LOVE YOU(even if you have to pick out the card-lol).  Maybe he just needed to be "fussed" upon that day (we all have those days), but remind him that you can "get a ticket" just as easy as he can!!

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



He should write to each person individually and just say



Dear xx xx
I would like to express my profound gratitude for all your help after my [recent disaster]. Without you things could have been so much worse.



Once again, thank you.



Yours sincerely



Mr Boss



You might like to vary the ways of saying it so that people don't all get identical copies.



I don't think hallmark do a "Thank you for helping out when my house was burning down" card but you could always get a blank one and write it in.



Hope you get it sorted!

How can you find someone who has decided to vanish? ?



I have 3 children who's father has decided to vanish, we have an address where he is registered but his whereabouts are unknown, we have no mobile or landline number just a letter that has the postmark Leeds which does not relate to his other address. They have not seen him in 19 months I would appreciate any ideas. Thank you.

Do you do it? Do you also fart a little when you're in bed at night, then pull up the covers and sniff, just to see what it smells like?

I don't like farting in public. However, sometimes they just slip. About farting in bed yes I do fart in bed but I let the smell out. If I catch the smell then oh well. I guess it is reprehensible to do it in public because if it smells really bad you're putting other people at discomfort and that isn't right.

Without know any more specifics about your relationship to the person, id say yes, but keep is simple.



As others have suggested, bring a plate of food.  A tray you aranged yoursef is always impressive. Just remember to keep the number of items ont he tray an odd number, is looks better.



As for a present, if you dont know anything specific they would like, your cant go wrong with gift vouchers.  Although not as personal as an object, it is more personal then plain cash.

there is no requirement that you bring a gift, however, since you are a friend, there is no reason why you shouldn't.  if money is tight, offer to buy a drink or do something special.

This asian woman was so rude!?



after class ended today, I stood next to the professor getting ready to ask him a question, when this ignorant asian ( witch) gonna just cut in front of me and ask her question.  I just stood there staring at her.  I wanted to slap the hell out of her. Then when I attempted to ask my question, she cuts me off and said excuse me and continues with her question.  I didn't want to seem rude to the professor for debating with her. Sometimes, ( no offense to the culture & yes, rudeness comes in all colors and flavors) they are so darn rude. Just because they live in America doesn't give them the  right to think they own the darn country or you are priviledged and can say and do whatever the hell they want.

Why i am thinking much to a male co worker?



just met him 5-6 months ago.. and work 2-4 days a week in a longer hours, i am single and 5 yrs older, and he is into a relationship for more than 4 yrs and planning of getting married two yrs from now.We talk to each other every day if we have work, and we'll do lunches together. if his gf knew about the conversations between us, she will be mad. and we do watch a movie together (only as a friend). i do not like the guy because for me he is not ideal, and do some weird things sometimes... for me he is not the bf material i am thinking of... but why i can't erase him from my mind???

It throws up a red flag to me only because you seem to be trying to convince "us" that he is only a friend but yet you are concerned that his girlfriend might not see it that way.  I am married and wouldn't have an issue if my husband had lunch with a female friend but I would have a problem if this "friend" couldn't erase him from her mind.  There hasn't been a marriage yet so you both or all of you certainly have time to resolve this situation before further relationships develop.  The "gf"/ you may or may not be right for him, he may/may not be the correct person for you. How fortunate you all are to have this time to resolve this issue.  I know if I was "just thinking about" a co-worker who was planning a wedding I would speak now or I'd have to hold my peace!!!  lol

At the risk of sounding heartless maybe he doesn't want to be found and what good would it bring your children to find him.  I know its easier said then done but if he doesn't want to see them and doesn't care about them then they ar better off without him aren't they?

I have a very soft spot for people with disabilities (my brother) and so I have a really hard time with people like this.  If my friend decided to do this then they are no longer my friend.  Lord help this friend if they should seriously be in a car accident and be disabled for the rest of their lives.  They sound young and foolish; hopefully someone will set them straight tonight and let them know the costume is Unforgivable.

I was at a stranger I had met at the pubs house with some other blokes from the pub. He'd asked seven of us back to have sex with his wife while he watched, it takes all sorts. We'd been hard at it for some considerable time and Id just finished assailing her chocolate exit strategy with some rather vigorous thrusts as part of some DP action she had requested. So I asked him for a drink as I was understandably thirsty. Well I was outraged, he told me to go and get it myself because he was busy watching, I mean when you're the host you don't get guests to get their own drinks.

I always assumed in order to have someone call you red they were referring more to temperment than merely the hair color.  I can't ever imagine giving someone a nickname like that if we weren't super close.  A shortened version of the name maybe (like calling Suzanne "Suz") but a completely personal nickname seems outrageously rude.  Like how you'd never just call someone kitten unless it's your girlfriend or child.



I think you handle that exactly right.  Just politely ask them not to call you that again.  My sister has red hair and she loves being called Red.  But that's b/c she uses the fact that she has red hair to get away with other stuff.  She'll lash out her temper or be so stubborn that she'll argue with a sign post, even when she couldn't be more wrong or even around strangers.  Then she'll just say "It's the red in me coming out" or "I am a redhead" like it's an automatic out.



I always felt that the term "Blondie" was intended to be more derogatory than "Red".  It is usually said with a bit of awe and respect.  Like I said, you express it completely the right way (unless you are still in high school--in which case you shouldn't let anyone know it bothers you or they will just do it more).

This asian woman was so rude!?



after class ended today, I stood next to the professor getting ready to ask him a question, when this ignorant asian ( witch) gonna just cut in front of me and ask her question.  I just stood there staring at her.  I wanted to slap the hell out of her. Then when I attempted to ask my question, she cuts me off and said excuse me and continues with her question.  I didn't want to seem rude to the professor for debating with her. Sometimes, ( no offense to the culture & yes, rudeness comes in all colors and flavors) they are so darn rude. Just because they live in America doesn't give them the  right to think they own the darn country or you are priviledged and can say and do whatever the hell they want.

Being Asian has nothing to do with it. She was just rude.



Your statement can be turned around: "Just because they live in America doesn't give them the right to think they own the darn country or you are priviledged and can say and do whatever the hell they want". She has just as much of a right to be in the US as you. What makes you think you own the country and can do whatever you want?



The other day a black woman cut in front of me at the checkout line, and she had a huge pile of stuff. I only had one thing. I said, "Excuse me, I was in line" and she apologized and let me go ahead. It had nothing to do with her being black, she just didn't see me.

Sadly this culture has an issue with entitlement.  I am not being a racist here but I live in an area that is loaded with Asians and it is so amazing to me how little respect they have for non-Asians.  Cutting in line, ignoring and generally being rude.  I will not even go into how they drive, cut you off and smile and wave.  So frustrating to say the least.  They are very clannish and stick with their own.  Just take a deep breath and realize it is just their culture and no real attack on you per say

Your question is racist as the emphasis is on "this ASIAN woman". It suggest all or most Asian behave this way. Well, the answer to this may be taken as a sweeping statement, ie yes Asian women are very rude. BUT is this true? You see, there is a great deal of difference between PERCEPTION  and REALITY. Because of your prejudiced opinion of Asian and the fact that you met a really rude Asian women makes this to be your perception, this is how you FEEL. another person may have met with a most charming and respectful Asian woman and totally disagree with you. So who is right?  Generally, most asian, esp. girls are more introvert (my PERCEPTION) and thus do not normally rudely intrude into two persons talking, esp. if not their close friends.

Your avatar looks somewhat Asian.



What is your ethnicity?



More importantly, why does it seem like you attribute her behavior to her culture?



She was rude...her actions were impolite.



I completely understand how you feel.  You were there first and she should have waited her turn.



But like you said, rude people are everywhere.



Judge people on an individual basis...not collectively.



One month ago, I was at the mall.  I was the only person in that store besides an older Hispanic woman and her daughter or granddaughter.



I was about to pay when she pushed in front of me without a word.



I was pissed!



I stood there staring at the back of her head the entire time.



And yes...in the past, I have felt that way about Hispanics until I realized that I was being unfair and generalizing.



Despite the numerous experiences I've had with certain, um, *types* of people (fill in the blank)...this doesn't mean that I'll judge them on the whole.

What are some strategies to deal with a co-worker who wears too much perfume?



Here's the deal:
I'm 11 weeks pregnant and VERY sensitive to smells. When this woman comes in in the morning, I have to leave the room because the smell makes me physically ill.
I'm a teacher and I have to share my classroom with this person.  I've been at the school for 6 years and this is her first year.  I've spoken to members of the "indoor air quality committee" (yes, there is one) and nothing has been resolved.
How do I deal with this but keep the peace and not be too offensive?

<question>



If someone is talking about you behind your back at work, what do you do?



My boss at work has told me that a few people have stopped by his office and complained about me. I asked who they were and he would not tell me because they came by in complete confidence. I can guess who they are but really do not know how to proceed.



My critics told my boss I do not have a clue and have terrible interpersonal skills. This ended up in my performance appraisal. I am looking for advice!



I can not think of a situation where I am deserving of this criticism.

Ouch. I don't understand how something your coworkers have said ended up on your performance review. I thought it was up to your supervisor to determine where you excel and where you need improvement? Perhaps you can bring that up to your boss.



Saying you "don't have a clue" is really unfair. Try your best to show off your good interpersonal skills (make sure you're always on best behavior when the boss is looking) - Im sure you will prove them wrong.



If you are absolutely certain this is the work of people who are being workplace bullies and "don't like you," and that you don't need improvement in these areas, talk to your boss - try to reason with him and explain that you can prove your skills to him no matter what some bullies are saying about you. Good luck.

Unfortunately when you hear something like this it is best that you heed the advice.  If more than one person is going to the boss and complaining, and the boss is listening...and siding with them then there may be a bit of truth to it.
I am not saying that you are a bad person, or bad co-worker but perhaps there is something that you are lacking on in your interpersonal skills that you are not aware of.  Don't take it so personally but I would definitely go back to your boss and ask for advice on what you can do to work these problems out.  Sitting back and denying there is a problem will do no good, it may just cause more problems and lead to dismissal.  But showing that you are willing to improve and at least "admit" that you see fault (even though you may not really feel fault) will help.  Sometimes we can be our own worst enemy.  Find out what you can do to improve your performance and become a better employee and part of the team.  It will help you all the way around.  Good luck!!!

the important thing here is this. if its co workers runing at the mouth and saying stuff...and your boss told you ..but did not himself say you were doing poorly..they dont worry about it..it is your bosses opinion you need to worry about....it is him that is the one to be critic and put any word out ....other ppls words.



sadly sometimes ppl run at the mouth becasue they have nothing better to do, or because it is they themself who is lacknig in that area...



if your boss told you certain areas that these ppl said you need to improve on, perhaps watch yourself, see for yourself if you need to...tweak it a bit for yourself NOT them...and just go from there.



If your boss thought you were doing so poorly you woudnt still have a job, remember that...



as far as confronting them, its not worth it..it only makes you as petty as they are. let it go, as hard as it is yes..but let it go. jsut go on with your daily routine as you need to and dont have a lot to do with these ppl unless you really need to talk to them. other then that just go there do your work and be done with it and them for the day.

If you are 100% sure that that person is the culprit, call a meeting, with all your coworkers present and bring up the subject of "talking behind somebody's back" while constantly making eye contact with him or her, then ask him/her what is her opionion of the subject.



For example:-



You: Well, we all know that talking sometime bad behind someone's back is despicable, the problem cannot be solve easily. But we try to minimise this. So, Mary (the culprit), have you even say something bad behind someone's back, and do you have any suggestion to reduce it?



Then sit back and watch her squirm.

I've been in this situation a few times.



Most of the time, it turned out that the people talking about me were simply insecure and trying to make my life more difficult.



If you're 100% sure that what they have said about you is NOT true, then continue to live your life and do your job.



There will always be people who will dislike you or have a problem with you.



Your handle is "tall model-looking girl".



Are your coworkers mostly female?



Typically, attractive women have a difficult time with other women at work.



Do you think it has anything to do with your appearance or how they perceive you?



Do you have a good attitude?



Do you perform to the best of your ability?



I know there's nothing more upsetting than to have jealous people talking about you, esp. to your boss.



If you know that there is room for improvement, then take the opportunity to learn from this and do things differently.



If you know that you've done nothing wrong, who cares what they say?

Self-conscious about crying ?



I'm a very self-conscious, shy and quiet person and even more so with my colleagues at work.  I had to take 2 sick days this week b/c I had a severe asthma attack and was taken to the hospital.  I returned to work on Wednesday (I teach), but felt worse as the day went on.  Thursday I went in but didn't feel good and had my head down.  When a few of my colleagues saw, they wanted to check up on me and, as I tried to hold back tears, I told them I felt worse.  One woman said that it was my body's way of telling me I needed more rest.  They all seem worried about me, but I started to cry and buried my head as I rested it on the table.  I feel so embarrassed for crying.  I tried to get it together so I could teach the next 2 periods.  But after that,  I knew I couldn't make it through the rest of the day, so my boss drove me home.



There were about 3 of my colleagues who watched me quietly cry / heard me on the verge of tears.  Do you think they feel I'm a baby or immature b/c I started crying?  What would you think?

No, they will not think those things. They will think what any of us would think - that you are a just a nice person who went through something really traumatic and who's body is still having difficulty recovering. Your coworker who said you need rest is very wise. You should take off another day or two if you can, and let yourself heal (physically and emotionally - it's so hard to go through something like that and have to get back to every day tasks). Chin up, get well soon, and don't beat yourself up over something we ALL do! hugs!

No they wouldn't think that. It obviously shows how bad you were feeling, and they probably felt bad for you!

Other people's perception of you depends as much on their hangups as on your behavior.  You may expect that some of your colleagues will feel compassion for you, and that others may well lose some amount of respect for you due to your perceived 'weakness.'  This is human nature, and there is nothing you can do about it.  What you can do is cut yourself a break.



It seems like your illness has taken more out of you than you realized.  You are obviously tired, and probably stressed, both of which can make tears come more readily (unfortunately, I know this from personal experience).  Your co-workers are right- you need rest, and you need to not worry about what other people think.  If, when you feel better and go back to work, the subject of your crying comes up, be ready to laugh it off- "Yeah, it's amazing how sensitive three days of gasping for breath can make a person..."

You seem to have a bleak view on the world. (Parden me if I speak out of turn)



I don't think most people see a person crying and think to themselves, "What a cry baby"



They're probably wondering what's the problem. At the harshest, they're thinking, "Wow, things must suck for them"



Most people are understanding and sympathize with you. Your colleagues don't see you as weak. If anything, they probably see you as strong for going through the day, with the problems you have.



You shouldn't be worried about being self-conscious because everyone is. (Yes I meant everyone....except me.......&lt;_&lt;........&gt;_&gt;.....)



You need to see that they checked up on you out of compassion/worriment/ and respect. If they didn't think highly about you or even like you would they waste their time to see if you were okay?



A great person isn't made by what they get over but by what they get through.



Hardships and Adversity are a person's tests and trails. It allows us to grow in mind and in body.



A Shy and quiet person isn't a bad one. Someone how is calculate and reserved is a person who understands that actions speak louder than words, and a person should speak when there's something important to say.



You should not allow anyone to make you feel bad, especially yourself. A person is only valuable if they value themselves.



I could throw a few more cliche' out there but you know where I'm going with this.



Basically:



you = strong person.



colleagues = don't think of you as a cry baby.



strong person = don't think of you as a cry baby.



So by the transitive property you = colleagues (.....wait....)



whatever I was trying to say before I got lost in quantitative composite dynamic was that you should feel bad about crying in front of your colleagues. You realize (at least subsconiously) that your work place is a safe envirnoment, which allowed you to cry there. You seem to work with good people. And if you'd like, they could be come good friends.



I hoped this helped, good luck.

Not necessarily.  First of all The Secret as in the movie, is only a small part of the picture.  It takes some real principles and turns it into an infomercial... making it seem like magic.  If you want something you get it.  Well there is MUCH more to it.  But I will say that I use the Law of Attraction steadily, daily, and the results in my life have been mind blowing.  But studying a photo of the object of your desire every day isn't going to bring that person.  You cannot attract something to which you are not a vibrational match.  You cannot make someone vibrate in your frequency so to speak.  Every living thing, from a cell to a human being, has an equal opportunity to choose and select what they want, and a vibrational equivalent 'out there'.  Well if the person you are desiring, is a good match to you, and they are wanting to be with a person like you as well.. then there is a kind of cooperation.  But if you are asking, can you, by force of your will and desire, make someone fall in love with you like Love Potion #9, then no, it doesn't work that way.  Free will and all of that.  You are much better off to say to yourself that you want to attract a guy who is good looking, honest, famous, wealthy, etc. more so than set your sites on one person.  PS - When I say a 'good match to you' I don't mean good as in good for you.  I mean a good match to what you are putting out.  So if you are sending out constant signals that you are expecting to get a guy who cheats, is disloyal.. well that is a 'good match' vibrationally.  We don't necessarily get what we want, if we don't know how to ask for that purely... we are more likely to get what we think we will get, what we expect from the past, what we worry we will get, etc.  It is all about what the DOMINANT focus is.

<question>



I was at the movie theatre last night and noticed that the fellow sitting in front of me?



Had a large boil on the back of his neck. Throughout the movie his was rubbing and squeezing the boil. Lord, I was aghast when the red nub burst! No less than two tablespoons of pus were freed in a high velocity expulsion which unfortunately found it's way directly into my tub of buttered popcorn. I timidly tried my best to eat around the pus, but eventually lost me appetite for the popcorn all together and decided do dispose of it. My question is whether I should have confronted to pus squeezer and perhaps insisted that he purchase a new tub of popcorn for my consumption. What do you think?

~~Yes. The poor delivery person doesn't get any benefits from it (or such a very little bit, it can't help them).



It's a service oriented job, and the IRS taxes them whether they get them or not. It's common courtesy to tip, since that is the majority of their income.~~

Yeah, the delivery charge is supposed to cover gas, but unless gas plunges down to 50c a gallon soon it does not. Also, most people who deliver pizza are not the kind of folks you want to piss off when they are handling your food, trust me.

What do you do when you have an office partner who won't shut up!?



Moving is not an option. I've asked him to be quiet so I can work, but he pays me no attention or forgets.  This guy rambles on about the economy, his religion, his family, his opinions, politics, movies,  everything and anything. I've discussed it with my super, but he thinks I can put up with it better than anyone else in the office, plus we are low on space. Any suggestions? I need to get my work done. Help!!

A great pair of headphones & your favorite music would be a simple solution. This assumes that you are not in contact with customers via phone or in-person.



If headphones & music are not an option, you need to do 1 of 2 things:



1) consider finding a new job since your manager will not directly deal with it;
2) train yourself to ignore him, without acknowledging his presence or his comments. It'll be hardest early on, but will become more easy as you learn to do it.



Good luck-- you're in a situation none of us would envy.

Since you've already tried to resolve this with him, the next step is to approach your boss.  Very nicely, tell the boss that you feel you are not as productive as you should be (which will help make the problem your boss') and that you require assistance in what the do about the problem.

Yes, I did this and believe me, after about 2 weeks, it stopped.



Decorate a can (coffee can- etc) and make a label that reads



Quarters are a must if my concentration you bust!



Everytime he begins to ramble on, shake the can and yes, make him pay. I treated the office (6 of us) to a lunch with the money and bought me a bottle of perfume too!



Add it up, a quarter x at least 6 times a day x 5 days = $7.50 a week. He learnt like I say, after 3 weeks. It was a good lesson learnt and we all had fun with it.

You need to find a way to borrow or rent a camera. They really aren't that expensive anymore. You can get a surveillance in for a month for rent and it would be worth while so that if you fire this person, they cannot get unemployment! will save you a fortune in the end.

If there were no witnesses, then your best bet is to try and trick them, scare them, or intimidate them into confessing somehow. Perhaps you could send an anonymous letter that says "I know you stole such-and-such, and unless you want to end up being prosecuted, I suggest you return it, and no questions will be asked."

They are miserable and self-loathing people.  They have no life and have nothing better to do than to sit around and try their hardest to make others feel as horrid as they do.  They crave attention so badly that they will absolutely anything to get it.  They don't care who it hurts or why, as long as "they" are the center of attention.  The only thing you can do about such person is to cut them off and ignore them.  Once they realize that their "attention" has been cut off and they are no longer in the spotlight they will sooner or later move on to someone else or somewhere else.  They HAVE to have the attention or they will shrivel up and die.  They are unhappy and bitter.  Sometimes I have actually felt sorry for them but the moment usually passes.
Peace & Love  :)

Please nominate for dummy of the year?



My friend and I had been text messaging each other all day yesterday about a guy that I like, (let’s just call him Rob in this story). These messages where hot but seemed harmless because I thought they where just being viewed by my friend, then I accidentally sent a message to Rob by mistake and this is what it said:



“It’s not considered creeping around together if neither of us is dating anyone”



He text me back immediately, and I was floored! Talk about getting busted, and I tried to deny it and cover it up with lies, but he knew exactly who I was and what’s worse is now he knows how I feel about him and he’s loving every minute of it.

This is the biggest problem with cell phones and texting...and truthfully your FRIEND....she should never have let him in on your "secret".  Seems to me like she was scamming you all along.
You are not a dumba$$....but now in the future you now who to trust and why.  Everything in life happens for a reason...apparently it was meant for him to find out.  Now it is time to figure out what you're going to do know that he knows...
Are you going to move forward or cower back?  He already knows so if I were you I'd just go on ahead and see where it goes?  I'd talk to him in private and let him know that he wasn't supposed to be "in" on the convo but since he was find out where he stands.  Don't wait forever and let his head swell too large or he could use the situation to his advantage and use you.  Good luck!!

<question>



When one is very successful in business, what is a good response for denying a small/big loan to friends/fam?



The only thing I could think of is telling them that any/all money that comes in has its proper place, such as bills, and a trust account and that it cant be pulled from where I put it...."?"



Even if there is a lot of money sitting in the bank, I dont want to get in the middle of a 'friendly loan'. I have seen first hand, that many times people choose to not ever repay loans. I have figured, to never give out a loan. In the future, if there is someone who needs assistance, (and I choose to help) instead of them carrying on that debt, just give it to them, because if they dont pay you back, the two of you will carry a burden. So I just choose not to loan anymore.



PS: As a youngster, I lent money out 4 times, ranging from $20-400. Not once was I ever repaid once in full....I guess they figured I forgot, or that I had money already, and that I wouldnt miss it or something. So now that I am an adult, and I am finally seing a great level of success from all of my hard earned work, I just want to have an excuse ready for in case this ever question ever comes flying at me from a really close friend/relative.



What are some good excuses when they know you have money?

Is it correct to be asked to buy a baptism outfit for a baby by the parents?



I have been asked to be the God Mother to my nephew by my brother and his wife. They are both catholic. I am as well, but not practicing. They have recently told me that it is tradition that the God parents buy the baptism outfit. They gave me a dollar amount and asked if I wanted to pay now or when I saw them at the Baptism in a text message. I'm absolutely appalled by this.I planned on giving a gift and a nice one.  More than I'm sure an outfit for a Baptism would ever cost. So it's not about the money. Just to add to it...I'm flying in from another state as well as my boyfriend. We are both taking time off from work for this event. I would just like to know if this is right or not to basically ask for money in this manner. Thanks!



FYI... I called my brother & told him  that I didn't agree with him asking me in the manner he did and that maybe if he was more tactful about it I would be more accepting of this tradition.

ive NEVER heard of any "tradition" where its acceptable to ask for gifts esp from the godparents b.c they are giving you a great gift as it is! im sorry your going through this its ridiculous and i hope you called your brother out on this! good luck and i wouldnt buy the outfit i think agreeing to raise your nephew in the event something happened to them is a pretty great gift as it is and if anything they should be purchasing YOU a gift.

I think this answer is great! I did call my brother out on this. He didn't like that so much. I'm cool with it being their tradition, but if it was brought to my attention in a more tactful manner I would be more accepting of this tradition. I think they have lost the meaning of a baptism.

If it was me I'd say thanks but no thanks, find another god mother - preferably one who's got pots of cash.  Or I'd say I'll do it but I'm not buying the outfit and if he's not happy with that then he can ask someone else.

Could it be a family tradition in the mother's family? I've never heard of it in the Catholic faith, and most of my family is Catholic.



Perhaps you could compromise with them, and say you will buy the dress, but you get to buy it, not just supply the cash? Then you get to pick out the dress your godchild wears; that is an honour indeed...if that's what they would have asked you, then I'd tell you tradition or no tradition, that would be an honour...but to ask you to just fork over the money for it, that's rude.

I have actually never heard of this tradition. But however I dont have any kids so they could be right. Either way, it sounds like you have many expenses under your belt as it is, and if you dont want to buy a baptism outfit then you dont have to. Tradition or no tradition. Your obviously not feeling too good about the idea and you should go with your gut feeling. I think if they had the decency to call and ask you respectfully you probably would have been ok with it. You just call them and say, "hey I really wasnt expecting to have to buy this in addition to the gift, the flight, the hotel etc..., and I just wasnt prepared for this sorry...maybe if you had called and asked me sooner."



ps...the dresses usually run anywhere from 40.00 to 100.00 bucks depending on the detail or quality.

Send it immediately but also follow up with a phone call apologizing for the lateness.  A Bat Mitzvah is a formal enough affair that you need to show respect and proper etiquette and let them know that you are sorry for reply late.  It also shows maturity on your part.  Good question.  A star for you!!

Does it bother you when management calls everyone "team"?



It seems pretty common place now that in most corporate work environments that anyone in any level of management will refer to and address the people that work under them as "team"



Is this just politically correct BS? Does this bother you on some level?  And if so, what other ways might management address people that would be better?

My job is set up in small service "teams" at customer sites so honestly if just addressing people at my site I don't mind the word "team."  If they start lumping my team in with other teams that aren't performing so well, or just in general I don't like that so much.  I can't (really) affect anything on another team (well and at least get my job done) or vice versa so there is no real interaction on a regular basis either to warrent the term "team."

I believe that if an organization is TRULY functioning as a team, which hinges on supporting each other achieve their goals and thus, the collective success of the organization instead of fostering a negagtive, competitive enviornment the use of "Team" would be entirely appropriate.  Unfortunately, this is not usually the case, therefore those who know better are offended or at the very least annoyed that PC BS is being used in the office by people who have know freaking clue what the term means within the context of their workplace.

I find it bothersome because it seems as though "team" denotes a sense of community (which is good) in a place where identity is submitted to the furthering of the economy (which is bad, and alienating even).



Not only that, but "team" makes it seem like everyone is there to compete, and at the end the boss will take them out for pizza and a Will Ferrell movie or something. Haha



Addressing people like they are people would be a nice start:
"Hello everyone" is a more humanizing, yet still polite, manner to address people. At least better than "team"...

It's a fact of life and you just have to live with it.  Most of us would "prefer" to be accepted as an individual unit and be appreciated for the work we do alone....but most businesses don't look at it that way anymore.  They micro-manage everything and most of the time one person pretty much gets credit for everything.
It bothers all of us on "some" level but today we all need to work and we all need a paycheck.  I own my own company and DO NOT treat employees in this manner and never would.  I look at each employee as an "individual asset" with a job that they bring to the company that is important.  I really believe that companies that think on the "team" level are lazy and just don't want to deal with individuals

They refer to their group as a team because you ARE part of a team that works together towards a common goal.  Everyone's job is a facet of the big, common picture.  I don't know why that would be considered  "politically correct BS".



Other choices could be "co-workers" "group" or "department", but none of those validate the work ALL people put into a group project as well as "team" does.  Just my opinion.  (BTW - no - it doesn't bother me at all)

Only if it's just in name only. It would be laughable if they used that word where I work because we are not a team. We are individual departments and communication is difficult because information is not shared. It's as you need to know. I don't know what the deal is. It could be that people just don't know any better. I wouldn't say that I work with the smartest people. There are some people that are and I am so thankful to them because they get it. It's just easier to communicate with people that use the brains they were given.



What do you have against it? What don't you like about it?



It makes sense to me. It's how a good business should operate. One common purpose - to be a profitable entity. However, if you are just contributing and you aren't rewarded for your contributions then that is another issue. Managers usually get bonuses and other perks. They should share those with their top of the line employees but many don't. Those are egotists.



I wanted to get out of business because the b.s. was too much to bear. I'm practical and hard working. I don't need b.s. to get me to work harder and better. It's innate for me. I don't need drama.

RWBitters, let me answer your question from the perspective of someone who spent 30+ years as an aerospace defense contractor wage slave before my retirement last year.



Most people who are in management couldn't manage their way out of a wet paper bag if their lives depended on it.  Really good, talented managers, who know how to work with people and understand the product or process they are managing, are one in a million talents.  The rest are just warm bodies filling the spots on the org chart where an entity designated "manager" is required.



To try to keep all these people from doing the least possible damage to the organization, there are "management consultants" who write books and give courses to people in management.  The purpose of these books and courses isn't to turn average people into great managers.  That can't be done.  The purpose is to minimize the damage done by the untalented people who become managers because there aren't enough talented managers to go around.



Once you understand that, you understand everything you will ever need to know about surviving the "flavor of the month" kind of management philosophy that permeats the culture of large corporations.



Don't take it seriously.  It isn't a revelation, it isn't intended to revolutionize the workplace, and it will pass and some new philosophy, equally silly and futile, will take its place.  You have already grasped that it is nonsensical; what you haven't grasped is that practicing its tenets limits the harm that your superisors and the people above them can do to you and the organization, and that is the function it serves.



As for letting it bother you on some level-- dude, if that sort of thing bothers you on ANY level, you need to bail out of the big corporation work environment before it sucks the life out of you or beats you down to a nub.  Seriously.



Do your job and let the "flavor of the month" managment philosophies just wash over you like water off a duck's back.  (Keep the freebie pens and other motivational gew-gaws they pass out, because they become collectible and you can sell them on eBay to augment your retirement.)  Develop some interest outside of work as an outlet for your real passion and originality, learn to laugh at the BS that passes for management in corporate culture.  If you find people in the management food chain who take the BS seriously and are earnest and serious about practicing it, avoid them if at all possible-- these are the people who will make your life miserable.



And if, once in a blue moon, you encounter someone who is a genuinely talented manager, give thanks and try to stay with them in their sphere of influence for as long as you can.

I Am IRRATIONALY NICE, OR PRETEND TO BE NICE, how can i stop?



here is an example... i worry too much about how people will percieve me or would think about me if if say, or do anyting,,, and the thing is other people don even care or pay attention to that.. BUt i can't stop about thinking about other peoples preception or feelings... here is an example...



Lets say i am in a group study with two of my friends for a test, aking questions to eachother... and all of us ready for the test up to certain level... and we all know who is ready better than the other one of us... so if one of my friends askes a question, thinking i could answer the question better than the other friend of us, he would say the question out loud so both of us can hear it, but gives much attention to me(stare at me) because i could answer the question better than the other freind....



But if i ask a question and think one of my friends would answer it better, i would say the question out loud, but try to give my attention for both of my freiends so the other freind won't feel discriminated. but the other freiend might not even notice it..so silly....



I know this is so irrational and silly, to pay much attention to peoples feelings instead of my question and the answer to my question....



How the hell could i stop being concerned about people's fellings and try to be super nice?

There are always going to be people that don't like us.  It's just part of life.  We just need to focus on what we like about ourselves and be ok with ourselves.  Make a list of things you like about yourself and meditate on that for a while.  Do a few nice things for yourself.  It sounds like you have a lack of self-confidence, and you are probably a great person if you are so concerned about not upsetting others.

Being considerate to other's feelings isn't necessarily irrational, but if you feel that you are HAVING to keep up this front even though you feel otherwise you are going to drive yourself nuts trying to please everyone.  The fact is that in life there WILL be conflicts, and there will be people who disagree - you respect each other's differences and then you move on.  I think that for some reason you are thinking that every disagreement is going to turn into a war, so you try and be the peacekeeper and head off any possible conflicts.  This is not your job.  You need to figure out why you do this - did you grow up in a family that had a lot of conflicts or fights?  Sit back and let things go the next time a situation you described comes up -  I bet the world doesn't end.  ;o)

Unsure  if I was impolite?



We are 6 couples in a group. One couple had us at their house. Although they supply supper and drinks my husband who drinks beer always takes some beer and a bottle of whisky as that's my tipple, although I only have 3 at the most and naturally our bottle is left which is no prob.  However, on arrival the husband of one of my friends (not the host) was seeing to the drinks and when he brought mine it was the tiniest drop in the glass. I said to him "Can I have a drop more in please because I like to taste my whisky?".  Not losing any sleep over it but afterwards I did think I wasn't perhaps good mannered.

A little sarcastic maybe?  Depends. Was he seeing to the drinks to be helpful?  If so, perhaps you should have thanked him and just refreshed your glass more to your liking.  If you think he was trying conserve the whiskey so he could have more of it, then that he's just a jerk.  Again, maybe just tend to your own drink next time.

I think the "I like to taste my whisky" part was a bit ungrateful... but no, asking for a bit more of your own alcohol isn't impolite. They invited you round for you to enjoy yourself in their company, I am sure they got their own drinks right.

You were not impolite.



It was 6 couples who were all drinking.  You were drinking you own liquor and it was your own call.  You were not rude nor impolite, you simply asked polite for some more liquor.
It would have been rude had you been snide or loud, but you weren't.  You simply asked politely for more.  What you did was tactful and appropriate.  I think you were well within your rights.I am quite sure if anyone had a problem they would have said so at the time.  Sleep well tonight and continue on your adventures with your group.

<question>



When one is very successful in business, what is a good response for denying a small/big loan to friends/fam?



The only thing I could think of is telling them that any/all money that comes in has its proper place, such as bills, and a trust account and that it cant be pulled from where I put it...."?"



Even if there is a lot of money sitting in the bank, I dont want to get in the middle of a 'friendly loan'. I have seen first hand, that many times people choose to not ever repay loans. I have figured, to never give out a loan. In the future, if there is someone who needs assistance, (and I choose to help) instead of them carrying on that debt, just give it to them, because if they dont pay you back, the two of you will carry a burden. So I just choose not to loan anymore.



PS: As a youngster, I lent money out 4 times, ranging from $20-400. Not once was I ever repaid once in full....I guess they figured I forgot, or that I had money already, and that I wouldnt miss it or something. So now that I am an adult, and I am finally seing a great level of success from all of my hard earned work, I just want to have an excuse ready for in case this ever question ever comes flying at me from a really close friend/relative.



What are some good excuses when they know you have money?

I am in your exact situation.  I own my own business and people are always asking to borrow money and even "gift" them money.  My biggest problem was at first I did it a lot because I felt like I should.  People know that I donate a fair share of money to charity and feel that family should come before chairty.  The people who ask me are the same people who have NOT repaid loans in the past, but they also have stopped me from completely from making any loans in the future.  Right now I have over $50,000 in loans to friends and family.  I never had told my Husband how much money was out until we started having marriage problems and figured this was as good time as ever to come clean.  We made a vow to loan NO MORE money out ot anyone.
Honesty is the best policy.  Yesterday we got a call from my Son's ex-fiancee who is now married to someone else and she wanted to borrow money.  I would loved to have loaned her the money because she has a baby by my Son but she has used me in the past, but I have stopped loaning money to my own Sons because they do not repay me and they work for me and are very overpaid.
Be honest and upfront and tell the truth.  I simply told her that I do not loan out money anymore because it causes too much controvery.  If I don't do it for my own kids I clearly cannot do it for anyone else.  It was really a hard call for me, especially with my Granddaughter but she is married and I know a lot more about the situation.  Be honest.  Stick to your guns.  Good luck.

For several reasons. It shows respect therefore you will get more respect.
People tend to stereo type others.  You do not want the judge to get a misconception of who you are causing an unfair ruling based on such.
Also it shows that this event and the outcome matter to you.  It was important enough for you to dress for. (as you would for church to show respect)

Dress up. If you are a man, wear a suit and tie. Polish your shoes. If you have piercings, take them out (if the holes are new and you don't want it to grow back, wear tiny studs.) If you have tattoos, cover them. Comb your hair nice. If it's long, wear it in a tidy ponytail. If you have facial hair, tidy and comb it. If you don't, shave yourself clean that morning. Wear deodorant.



If you're a woman, wear a dress or business suit. No mini skirts or low cleavage. Go light on jewelery. Cover any tattoos. Light perfume, if any. No sneakers.



Leave personal statements at home. You are trying to sell yourself to the judge. This is not a time for a revolution of forcing society to accept you however you are. You are in a position to put your best foot forward.

<question>



Why fiance doesn't like to hold my hand in public?



My fiance hates grab my hand in public, he said that he has never been like that so and it feels uncomfortable if he does, but when we are in the public suddenly he tries to give me a kiss and more when there are other guys around. Why is he acting this way? and why he hates to hold my hand in public?



</question>



<additional details>



He is not guy, I will think of all the answers and opinions, that he may want to pretend he is single, I do noticed that when there is girls around he is distant to me but if there is guys and I look at them he will come to me right away and show everyone we are together. By the way, I'm a very atractive lady, even his own brother and best friends had comment that to me, that I can have anyone I like so they don't understand why I take this s(hit) from my fiance.

Many quieter guys don't like public displays, of course until another guy comes around, and then they have to "mark" their territory. Take it as a compliment, or tell him if he can't hold hands with you, no kissing in public either.

not that he hates to, it's just new to him.  your obviously his first real woman, so he finds it uncomfortable for people to see him with someone that he's serious about.  don't take it personal.  just not as touchy and feel as some of us are.  as far as in front of other guys, with the kissing, it's a man thing.  as if to say...this is mine...don't think about it!  lol  sounds stupid, cause it is.  we can be total jerks when we're not trying to be.  he'll come around.

I've had to deal with this myself, and based on my experiences, your fiance is gay. He doesn't want to hold your hand because it's unnatural for him. When he kisses you in public, it's a way of trying to cover up his blatant homosexuality. He kisses you as he would kiss his mother. I would suggest talking to him, and try to see if this in fact is true. But that's only based on my experience.

Get him used to holding hands when you are walking alone, away from crowds.  It took my husband about 30 years of marriage before he was comfortable with holding my hand in public.  Your fiance might think hand-holding is for sissies and the big kisses, etc., are manly.  Go figure?  Who can understand men completely anyway.  Don't give up on him.

I don't hold hands with my husband either, I find it juvenile and something I gave up in the 7th grade!  You don't need to hold hands in public to know he loves you.  And he kisses you in front of other guys to mark his territory, be glad he doesn't pee on you like a dog does!!

The suddenly kissing you around other guys sounds like he is making a statement that you are his,as far as not under usual circumstances wanting to hold your hand in public goes,he probably is really uncomfortable with public displays of affection. I wouldn't push the issue as long as he is still affectionate in private.

He is obviously very young and extremely immature. As other readers have answered, he wants to kiss you when other guys or his friends are around to show off to them that you are his. Kind of like a dog pissing on a bush to mark his territory. Consider your lips his pissing place until he grows up.

Grandma doesn't have enough to do.  Just because grandma is grandma, doesn't give her the right to say bad anything about anyone.



I think it's time grandma is told to grow up and get a life.



*Tell her as of today if she doesn't clean up her act, may the truth be told.  Tell her that you're wise to her and will not except anything less than respect from her with out the hypocritical side of her.*



Grandma is abusive and uncaring, other wise she wouldn't be doing what she's doing.



My daughter recently told me about her grandma.  She went over to



visit and got much the same abuse as you're talking about.  My daugher said she left her house, got on her bike and never went back for another visit with grandma.  Her grandpa was her salvation as he loved her so much.



Why people like this have to be abusive to their own grand children is way beyond my comprehension.  I'm glad my daughter never went back for more abuse.  She's now 37 yrs old and memories of grandma are not good memories.  I wish I had known about this back then, because I would have done something about it.



It's to bad about your grandma.  All I can say now, is stay away from grandma.  She's just not a good influence.  Don't be afraid to talk to your parents about this.  I sure wish I knew.

I need to know if I over react or if I am right when it comes to kitchen?!?



About 8 years ago I went through a depression stage. Before I went through this stage my kitchen and bathroom had to be the cleanest rooms in the house. While going through the depression stage the only room I cared about was my bathroom. I cannot stand sitting on a dirty toilet or looking at a garbage can full of toilet paper. I had to keep my bathroom clean and would complain if someone would not pick up their clothes or towels. After my surgery (which was about a month a go) I started getting picky about my kitchen again. I have to have my dishes washed, counters cleaned, stove clean, and table wiped off before I go to bed. I ask others if they would please wash my stove off after using it and the dishes after using them. I cannot go to bed until I know that they have done this. When these things are done it makes my morning peaceful, I'm not looking at a sink full of dishes or filthy table, stove, and counter. Yesterday I was not feeling well. I had hardly any sleep. I went to sleep before everyone else. They cooked dinner for themselves. They did do the dishes before going to bed and did wipe down my stove. What they didn't do was wipe down the counter or table. When I woke up this morning there was crumbs on my counter and grease smeared on my table in one area. the rest of the table was just filthy from everyone eating on it. This upset me this morning. When I woke my husband up for him to go to work he was mad at me, because I was not in a good mood after what I had seen. I need to know am I in the wrong, Should I just let it ride and clean it up myself? Am I over reacting when it comes to my kitchen?

Sounds like a touch of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Basically, your surgery made you feel out of control and anxious, and your wish to control the kitchen soothes your anxiety. Remember that anxiety is not fatal. Yes, it's an unpleasant emotion, but don't let avoiding it run your life.

You sound very uptight about your kitchen and it seems more like an obsessive compulsive thing than just liking a clean kitchen.  To be in such a bad mood over someone not wiping a counter is extreme and you need to relax a bit or get some professional help before it becomes a full blown obsession.

You appear to have a compulsion, perhaps even OCD, with a cleanliness obsession. I see no reason your family has to join you in your obsessive need for everything in the kitchen to be spotless.



Instead, maybe you should be seeking help for your issues about controlling your environment. Often when the underlying cause for the need to control what you can is exposed and dealt with, the obsession about cleanliness, safety, or whatever form OCD takes, disappears or is greatly reduced.

Friend, I feel for you. I deeply understand your plight about cleanliness and I don't think you are overreacting to your condition, but I do want to say that perhaps your 'depression' might cause you to be a little more concerned about cleanliness in the way that you emotionally respond.



I, too, have suffered from depression and even though my condition took on another type of reaction, I do understand.



What I think you might want to consider is having a discussion with your physician and perhaps having some meds to help you emotionally.



I didn't want to take meds, but I found that it helped me stabalize and not become so angry all the time. Little things would upset me and nobody could understand, but the meds keep me calm.  I am a better person, I am more in control of my life and I am stable...no more ups and downs.



Please see a doctor and talk to your husband,  I didn't have anyone to talk to.



Best wishes. (And there is nothing wrong with coming into a clean kitchen)

i just had the same kind of issues with my friend, whose house i had to end up moving out of, because she was so anal. she definitely has OCD, which you might just be a little, too. theres nothing wrong with wanting a clean house, just as long as the idea of it not always being perfectly clean doesnt stress you out majorly. i would tell the other house occupants that you understand they have put forth some effort, and do appreciate it. but tell them its important everything gets done when they use the kitchen. just say its because you dont want to attract bugs ((which isnt a lie, since i imagine you really dont want bugs)). maybe you could write down a list of evreything to be done, in a nice, non-anal way so they dont forget, but its not in their face, being obnoxious. like i said, my friend, whom i have love for, is just like that. she had some other control sort of issues, whcih was more the reason i left. but she wanted things organized and cleaned a certain way, a way that most of us dont usually do for everyday cleaning. try to relax a little. its okay to be tidy, but dont let it run your life. theres a whole world of less-than-tidy things to do and see and experience. dont get stuck in one mindset. stay calm when addressing the issues with your roomies, so they dont think youre overreacting. if you feel it to be beyond your control, maybe see a doc about it. good luck

My husband does a good job washing dishes, but, he never checks the stove for pots/pans, doesn't wipe counters/tables.



It used to bug me a lot.  It still does, but I've learned that we have to choose our battles.  In the grand scheme of things, I guess a dirty table and counters doesn't really compare with a lot of worse things that could happen in your life.

Not everyone is going to be as picky as you.  The best way to deal with this is to appreciate what efforts they DO put forth, and do the rest yourself.



Look at your priorities here-
What is most important?
- A pristine kitchen?
or
- Your marriage and a peaceful life with your family?



Part of marriage and family is compromise. You need to come to the understanding what we all have flaws.  What makes a marriage work is tolerating and working around your spouse's flaws.  He most likely accepts and tries to work with YOUR flaws.  You need to do the same in return.



YOU are the one who needs it so pristine. I get the feeling that no one could really ever do it completely to your satisfaction anyway. This is your pet peeve. Own it. Make it your responsibility.
Rather than ragging on everyone else for not catering to your needs to your satisfaction, you should, again, recognise and acknowledge their efforts, and then "fix" it how you want it from there.



Simply "letting it ride" is not enough.  In the end, you'll be the only one doing it at all.  They --should-- be helping and doing their part, this is what family is all about, and is an important thing for children to understand and for you and your husband to model. If you just let it ride, you are skipping the most important part, and that is the understanding that they do try to help, that they make an effort.  You need to not only recognise this, but acknowledge and show your appreciation for what they do to help out.



Here's my recommendation on how to do that-
"Thanks guys, for helping to clean up the kitchen. I appreciate how much you've done, and that you made it that much less for me to do".
Any further thing you can point out that was done particularly well, make sure you acknowledge that too. You could add something like, "I know I tend to be pretty picky about how the kitchen looks, but I do appreciate the help I get from you".



There's a benefit for you in doing this.  When you recognise and acknowledge, and show appreciation for what people have done, you motivate them to do it again, and maybe even to do more.
Ragging on them for not doing enough makes them feel that no amount of effort on their part will ever be appreciated. Nothing they do is good enough.



So why bother at all?



Focusing on the positive promotes the positive.
Focusing on the negative is undermines your goal, and makes everyone feel bad to boot.



I hope this all makes sense to you, and that you find it helpful.

Let's talk about a dust bin. Normally how would you use a household dustbin? What I do is this: I have a plastic dustbin. I line the dustbin with a plastic cover, I have several of such covers which I collected while buying stuff from supermarkets. Then I keep the dustbin in the corner of the room.



Every now and then I have some waste material like a paper or wrapping that I want to throw. I throw this waste into the dustbin. The waste will continue to remain in the dustbin (note that this is not degradable waste and will not stink).



Slowly over a week or two, the dustbin fills up with several waste papers and it at the brink of overflowing. Now I tie up the plastic cover, packing all the waste materials, and pull it out. I line the dustbin with a new plastic cover. The old plastic cover with waste is thrown in the public waste recycling system. This is the normal cycle.



Now if I'm like you, what I would be doing is this: Every time I want to throw a waste material into the dustbin, it would be the only waste material in the plastic cover. I would immediately tie up the plastic cover and take it to the public waste system. Then I would line up the dustbin with a new plastic cover.



The reason? I want the dustbin to be clean and free of waste materials all the time. So the moment one waste material goes in, I am in the rush to immediately clear it out. This is definitely over-reactive in my opinion.



About your kitchen OCD, it is alright to say it's not just your job, but everyone's job to keep the kitchen clean. However you will be perceived as over-reactive if you demand that they clean the kitchen immediately as it gets dirty. The normal way would be to let the kitchen get dirty as the day progresses. Then, at the end of the day, all of you can work together to clean up the kitchen before hitting the bed. Or you can take turns in pairs or so.



And I agree to others on the fact that you must not let your obsession with tidiness rule your life. It could become malicious when it comes to your relationship with your roommates, creating animosities. You must be understanding towards them, and at the same time be assertive about your values. And it's always good to give proper reasons why something should be done, rather than saying you just want it done.

Should I report them to somewhere?



I do a paper round- 141 papers every friday.
I was meant to get paid £17.96 today, but instead I open to envelope and find 56p. i phoned them and she told me to phone a different message. They did this last week to, and I only got £3.50 instead of £9.
I'm sick of it really, as I really needed that money tomorrow, but I am obviously not getting it.
Should I refuse to do the round?
Report them?
Tell them I'm going to report them?
Or am I being unreasonable?
I don't want to have to do anything like phone them lots, because then i'll get angry, and i know it's not the woman working there's fault.

Stop delivering.  They did this twice... it's intentional.  They're trying to screw you over.  Stand up for yourself.  What, they think you're providing a charity service?  Hell no.  Keep their balance somewhere and when they ask what's going on with their delivery service, say innocently that you thought they wanted to cancel the service because they refused to pay.

So I stopped suddenly with him on the stairs behind me so keep in mind his face was directly level with my butt. I said "Hey what does the president first thing every morning?" he said 'what?' and I blew out a huge fart right into his face! I was laughing so hard I could barely talk and I expected him to laugh also but he got offended and left! I think he will tell my boss as well.

People who do not move towards the rear when there is standing-room only. It is complete laziness and clogs up the front of the bus.



People who stand in front of and block the rear exit doors when they know they're nowhere near their stop. Really, when there are no more seats left (and even beforehand), the first place people go to is the area directly in front of the rear doors.



Perfectly-abled (not elderly, disabled, or those with young children) people who exit out the front door. Especially those who take their time exiting the bus while you walk into the bus assuming nobody will come barreling at you.



People who are seated but take up half the aisle with their legs and don't move them when they see you trying to walk past them.



People taking up multiple seats with their legs, bags.



The overhead bar being 6 feet in the air (I'm very short).

Well right now I could paper my Living room walls with the violations I have received, esp recently, one today was re a young kid who wanted to know our OPINIONS re his video on youtube, a comedy about vandalism and I told him it was immature and stupid and I got a violation for insulting other users! So unless you agree with whoever is asking the question you will more than likely get a violation notice! And I got another one re a girl who asked more than once about whether or not it was OK for her to fart on her boyfriend's face and I told her enough already just do it and got a violation for that as well. Still here though!

<question>



Should I give my seat on the bus up to any lady, or just the elderly, pregnant or disabled?



Good evening. I am member of the Royal Naval Reserve, or RNR, and I am hoping to join the Regulars next year.



Every week I take the bus down to my Unit, and of course I am wearing my naval uniform. The bus is sometimes quite busy as it meets the rush hour, but I always tend to get a seat as mine is the first stop.



It does get crowded, and I was wondering is it good manners to offer my seat to a lady, even if she is of my own young age and obviously fit and healthy? Or should I only offer it to those who really do need to sit down, such as the heavily pregnant or elderly? As I mentioned I am in uniform, and I feel it's important that I convey the right image of HM Forces and that I honour the oath I took to HM the Queen and my country, so I don't want to put a foot wrong. Any advice is appreciated.



Thanks.

That is a hard question to answer considering some women get offended if a man offers to be polite, cause they think it is discrimination. I'd say the only way to be safe is to not give your seat up at all to any woman unless of course it is your mom or girlfriend. ;-)

For the elderly, pregnant, disabled, etc., most definately, that would be polite.  As for young, fit people, ask them what their problem is if you don't feel in the mood.  Otherwise, I'd say yes, it would be polite toward anyone.

As a young, healthy female I would say only give up your seat to those who seem to need it and/or want it (also consider your own needs).  Whether or not giving up your seat might offend someone is something you shouldn't worry about, a kind gesture is still just that, and if you really want to offer someone your seat even if they don't seem to need it, go ahead.  The worst that can happen is that they might feel offended, and usually your instincts will warn you about those who wish to be left alone.

I think it depends on whether the lady looks like she needs to sit down. I live in Paris, and I'll always offer my seat to anyone, regardless of gender, if they look like they need it more than me. But there are often people who prefer to stand rather than sit, because for example, they're only going a few stops and would have to get up again as soon as they've sat down, and so forth. There have been occasions where it embarrasses the person as they don't want to sit down or feel that it's impolite of them to take the seat if they don't need it and it ends up that you're both standing and no-one sits down. So only do it when there is genuine need. Or simply ask them first.

Does chivalry still exist?
Yes, I think it does. I am from Southern California, we don't have much public transportation here. In fact, I've never been on a public transportation bus. But if I did and  a gentleman offered me his seat, I would be totally grateful and honored.  I say, YES, always offer a seat to a lady OF any age! Also, open doors, offer assistance with bags, when appropriate etc.  I don't know anything about "The Royal Naval Reserves" but I know that any gentleman should always consider the needs of others before their own (regardless if they are fit and healthy).

If you feel like you deserve it then more power to you.  I'm all for self love.  Today we as women don't love ourselves enough and if you are "spoiling" yourself a bit then go on ahead and do it.
As long as no one else knows who is doing it who is it going to hurt, and even if someone finds out...who cares.

You should always respond to a compliment with Thank You. From there it is up to you to figure out if the person complimenting you was sincere or had an ulterior motive in mind. Maybe you actually think you look pretty. Maybe you are complimenting yourself because you plan on cheating yourself out of money or stealing your boyfriend from yourself when you have your guard down.

My flatmate is very inconsiderate. What can I do?



I write this question having being woken for the umpteenth time. My flatmate is a very heavy sleeper so to combat it he has two alarms that go off about seven o' clock. These always wake me up because they are ludicrously loud. This morning in particular I was trying to catch up on sleep I had lost from him coming in late last night. He comes in at 3 in the morning and proceeds to have a phone call in the corridor, outside my door and in his room. The soundproofing in this building isn't perfect so I could hear him word for word. I had to go in and have a go to make him put the phone down.



What the hell can I do?



</question>



<additional details>



Jeepgirl: I have a decent pair of earplugs. The point is that he has woken me up THROUGH them. That is why I am so angry at him.

Maybe try to talk to him and tell him, you know, you have to sleep to every once in a while. If he has to make a phone call at 3 in the morning, he can try to be a little more quiet about it since you were trying to sleep. If he doesn't stop, maybe invest in a good pair of earplugs. But seriously, I would talk to him about it and try to make him understand that he's not being very fair by waking you up and everything.

Maybe you should consider speaking to him about the issues before they arise again. Maybe one day over breakfast you let him know that you're not particularly happy with a few things and that you would like to set more boundaries. Sometimes people tend to listen more when they are not doing the 'wrong' thing then and there. So, in a sense they are not offended.



I would also suggest that if he is coming home so early and wants to sit on the phone, if he did it in the main area or outside. Mention that you can hear him word for word and that may make him consider you next time.
Good Luck

<question>



Am I in the wrong for saying that?



My roommate/friend was talking again about how she's excited to go home for Thanksgiving, and then she made a comment like "I'm actually happy to go home to see my family, after all the **** they put me through". I couldn't take it anymore.



First a little background: she's palestinian, and i guess she went through a little of the war, and her dad has like 10 kids, not all of them related to her. She said her parents were really restrictive to her and bossed her around and so she can't take it there at home.



now back to the situation, i was like "you shouldn't say that. they're your parents. they brought you up" and then she brings up "no but you don't understand, they were just really restrictive you know? like they made me drive around like a chauffeur for all 10 kids, even when my father didn't have anything to do, he just made me drive everyone around." and in my head i thought, wow sounds like...every other teenager.



That gives you no right to say any of those things, to make your parents seem so bad, to make yourself look like such a hero for going home, like you're doing your family such a favor by gracing them with your presence. you know, the thing is, they probably WILL make a big deal when she goes home because they love her.



But I just ended the convo with a "whatever....i don't understand'" and she's like "yeah you dont understand. it's okay"  i think what really stung was the "it's okay", as if she thought i was too stupid to understand. ugh but all i know is, a family that calls you up and sings you happy birthday on your birthday doesn't sound like the abusive, hellish family you constantly moan and graon about.



this may not be a question, but more of a confessional, but feel free to comment. thanks for reading :)

You're a man.  If you cry, then there is your answer (not trying to be sarcastic).
Crying means you are human and I think a man is more of a man if he can admit that it's okay to cry.

A man can cry, for he's human. But there's this social expectation of a man to be tough and not show emotion that isn't happy, angry, or fear. He can show fear, he just can't cry.

Has this ever happened to you when you farted? :[?



Sometimes I will be farting very smoothly and all of a sudden I get this warm sensation in my panties. When I run to the restroom and look in it..it looks like there is something with the consistency and color of peanut butter smeared neatly in a paste in my panties. OMG, Help! What is it and what can I do to stop this? :(



</question>



<additional details>



Have any of you dabbed it and licked the paste? I have found that it tastes sweet which is very odd because I NEVER eat sweets. I'm not saying I eat it. But I quickly touch the peanut buttery paste and then lick a film off it off my finger. More like for a lab test.

Buy some iron tablets when you're gassy.
Iron as in baby formula, stops the runs.
For infants with hard stools, then buy formula without iron.
anyway, iron supplements work the best.

The best way to over-come your shyness is to go out and talk to people. That way you will make friends. Theres nothing to be nervus about trust me.

You can`t make new friends straightaway - it happens to most people during the first few days or weeks.
Don`t worry about it.  Worry can be contagious, and then you WON`T make any friends!
Be calm, keep your cool, it will happen.



As regards you thinking yourself ugly  - that is another self-fulfilling thing  - if you `think` ugly you`ll be ugly.

I would like to point out that no-one in college will see your pain. You have to do something yourself to get some confidence.

I know exactly how you feel. I was like that all throughout high school. But when I went to college, I made lots of friends quickly. The best advice I can give you is to try to chat someone up. Make small talk with someone when you're eating lunch or right after class.

I used to be pretty shy myself. But you have to get over your shyness and over fear of rejection. Be outgoing and just start random conversations about watever is on ur mind.



If you feel inconfident in yourself and how you look you can always try to change your look into something you like. If you act and feel confident people will want to talk to you =]

I have the same problem. Just wait a while and show your true personality and stay away from the cool kids and you should be okay. Find a bunch of people who have the same social problem as you. If you see someone who doesn't talk much, talk to them. Get to know them. Focus on your studies. Have fun.



Good luck and God Bless You

Everyone feels the way you're describing, especially in the beginning, starting a new class, new group, new semester, etc.



Smile, be pleasent to be around, be friendly, open, and honest, and people will talk to you and you'll naturally begin making conversations and becoming more comfortable. It's not as bad as you think. And it gets easier the more you do it. Plus you'll gain confidence the more you do it. Best Wishes.

Well first of all stop thinking down on yourself,



I know this sounds cliche but everyone is beautiful in their own way



I can understand going to college and not knowing anyone being hard.
But what you should do is really try and put yourself out there.
Smile at everyone as you pass them in the hallways.
Talk to your classmates, start small conversation such as "how is your day going" "what are your plans for the weekend" "where are you from"
This really gets conversation started and in no time you will be making friends

K , i'm sure all you need is a little confidence and you will be surrounded with friends , with the hair thing why dont you tie it at the bottom it looks a lot better or you could have it in a short style that cant be tied back. if you feel put out by not wearing make up why dont you wear some ,because your doing beauty i doubt you need advice from me ! But makeup dosn't change who you are , and thats what is important . People will like you , for you.
I realised i dodn't really talked much about the cofidence thing ... to boost confidence you have to be confident in yourself , why dont you go to your friends or your mum and talk about all the qualities you like about yourself then everytime your nervous think back about those qualities.
They dont have to be big things they can be:  "I like my Hair" or "I have a pretty voice" , "i am clever"  Whenever i need to be confident i sit and imagine doing whatever my task is really well and feeling really good about myself after.



I Hope this helps.

PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW THE ANSWER, LIKE THE FIRST ANSWER SHOULDNT ANSWER THEY GAIN 2POINTS FOR SAYING I DONT KNOW!!!
it is suggested wearing the poppy on the left lapel or positioned on the left side of your chest, near your heart. That, however, is only a suggestion. More poppies get lost to driver's side retracting seat belts every year than most people imagine. There is nothing wrong with wearing a poppy on the right side, although at a Remembrance Day ceremony you will see veterans, members of the Canadian Forces and uniformed public servants wearing them uniformly on the left. My answer was simply to make a donation, get a poppy and wear it, preferably on the front of your clothing, showing no disrespect for the symbol or its meaning.

<question>



I quit my job and my boss has left 15 voice mails. She has called over 50 times!?



There is nothing I owe them, no paper work I need to finish, nothing I left at the office.  She is just calling me and telling me how crappy I am for leaving.  I left because she hasn't lightened my work load even though my doctor gave me papers for light duty during my pregnancy.  I am not having a normal pregnancy and cannot be during hard labor.



I answered the phone the first two times she called and told her No, I wasn't kidding, no I would not be returning, and no absolutely do NOT fudge the paperwork to make it temporary disability.



How can I put an end to this?



Should I call HR although not an employee any more?



I have answered everything she wants to know, what else can I do?



Don't want this to be a legal issue, I just want the calls to stop.



Can't change my number either, It's my business line.



</question>



<additional details>



that would be *doing* hard labor.. sorry!



No, I am NOT exaggerating.  I blocked the office phone number, and now she is calling from her cell and house number.



Between the hours of 5 pm and 2:30 am she has called 47 times to be exact.



15 voice mails.



Latest one says



"You need to call back.  You cannot just quit without notice.  You don't have that option.  That's not a luxury we have at this company.  You MUST call me back.  I will be forced to put you under a medical leave if you do not call me back.  This will affect your insurance"



the one before that says



"If you don't call me back, I will be forced to put you as temporary disability.  You can't just quit.  Way to let down the team.  I thought you were more mature than that.  Shows how wrong I was when I hired you."



and before that



"I know you blocked the office number, I will be calling from my cell phone.  Call my cellphone or house number immediately"



those were left between 10 pm and 12 am

You sound like you are exaggerating. But if there is an off-chance that your boss has left that many voicemails then what are the exact words she is using? She must have a purpose for doing so. Otherwise, you need to call her and let her know to cease and desist.

You should call HR first. No amount of insurance or anything else to do with this company is more important than your and the baby's health and this woman's actions could definitely cause you enough stress to harm both of you. If HR doesn't put a stop to it, call the police and charge her with harassment. Document everything, including your conversation with HR, and save every message she leaves/sends you. Your leaving may affect your insurance, but if she continues to harass you, the company could be held responsible for your medical bills and a lot more.



I am definitely against frivolous lawsuits, but harassment of this sort is just way over the top.

Call HR and do it this morning. What she is doing is harassing and stalking you. It is illegal.



You can call and have charges pressed against her. In many of her phone calls she said things that were personal. If it was strictly business than it should be only business. But instead she puts you down and tries to demean you. I think it is a good thing you left there when you did. She sounds a bit disturbed to me. Keep all the messages...do not delete them!
Again, call HR and do it today!

My goodness, your former (Thank God!) boss has severe psychological problems. Call the police, you are getting harassing phone calls. It'll be an easy case for them, because you know who's doing it. When detectives show up at her home or office, she'll probably stop calling.

Did you give any notice before you resigned? If you didn't then perhaps you have made her look bad to the rest of the staff - her management style is possibly being questioned now.
She is venting her spleen because she has unresolved anger. I would contact HR for advice as this is harassment.

They let their idiot kid run upstairs ALL DAY LONG!!!!?



I'm going to lose my f****g mind!!! I live in a basement apt. in NYC & I rent it from my bf's parent's friends. ( I didn't know they were @ first). Well, there is a language barrier b/c they speak Spanish but they are able to communicate somewhat in english. I pay $950 for a 400 sqft apt. (I'm not complaining just filling ya in). However I can't take it when they allow their stupid @$$ little girl to run all day long. I'm easy going. When they have parties once in a while, I never complain. I realize we are all on different schedules but I'm not a heavy-sleeper and these people have constantly woke me up. It gets better...on the weekends when the idiot little girl is finally gone, the brother-in-law blasts his speaker on the floor and it vibrates through the wall...SO forget sleeping in! I have pounded my fist on the wall and he lowers the music. (So obviously you CAN hear when I tap like that). Upon having my bf call SEVERAL times and even me calling nicely once asking for the noise levels to be lowered..I have simply just started to pound my fist on the wall. Apparently the mom-who is such an idiot I don't even know how my bf's parents are friends with her- doesn't get it. So she lets the girl BOOM around all day. I had enough so I kicked the wall so hard my foot went thru it and then she runs downstairs. There is a door that is connected to our place, which is also really annoying b/c they have been so f***g nosy and just sort of knocked and walked right in. I hate this. She comes down and taps on it and gets ready to open it but I yell there's nothing wrong...It is just loud! Then I walk off to my bedroom and ignore what she has to say thru the other side of the door. How dense can these people be? I'm sick of them pretending that they don't know any better b/c they can only speak spanish..does that affect their common courtesy? Geesh. Anyhow the inside door is right behind their laundry room & they also decided to put the cat litter down there (which I had to complain about 6 times to have them move). My roomate and two other people mentioned not being able to sleep due to the smell of cat ****. We told my landlord but then one day she had me come inside to give me a package and she tells the cat..go pipi and shooes him..where?..downstairs! After we explicitally told her this smell is keeping everyone up. If you have a cat you know how awful cat crap smells. Well, I have about had enough. Initially when I looked @ this apt. they told my bf they were hesitant to rent to an American (they are South American)..which I thought was BS but it was a good deal and I needed an apt. So finally I moved in. DUde..they aren't doing me any favors..I pay rent. So why should I have to put up with the noise? No one can even study here. It's that small constant thumping that can make you wanna pull your hair out when you're intending to focus on Chemistry. I have been so nice to their little girl & to them..and I feel like my niceness is being taken for granted. The noise still hasn't stopped..she's running as we speak! There is constant booming..but I let that pass b/c even though it's ridiculous to be fixing **** @ 11pm @ night..I'm trying not to be too extreme. My bf says..it's their house. The thing is though..I am paying rent! They rent parts out of their house to help meet their mortgage..so it's not like they are doing me any favors. I am SOOOO clean..quiet..and ALWAYS pay rent on time. I have never thrown a party here either. I feel like , b/c they have this comfort zone with my bf's parents..they just don't care to stop the noise. I have moved SO many times and I have a great roomate here in the other room (I'm subletting it..) I don't want to abandon her b/c of THEIR inconsideration. I know this problem isn't just me. Everyone who has visited here has commented about it. Do I really need to resort to blasting music @ 4am on a weekend or something? I mean..am I going to have to stoop that low?



BTW these people are really nosy & my bf is ridic! The lady goes " Oh I saw you come in late etc. etc." This is her way of finding when my bf comes and goes and what does he do? He falls into it and is like " Yeah I am working such and such hours now". GREAT!



Someone help me before I knock these ignorant people out ! I know it's their house but I PAY RENT! Is it unfair of me to expect the same treatment as someone who rents an apt? I don't think so. My idea is..if you want to rent out this place..then keep your stupid kid in check and be courteous. Your noise and cat **** interfere with our sleep and to me..that's MAJOR.



Thanks for reading this all & I hope to get some REALLLLLL good answers! Even if they are ones that give me bad ideas..maybe that's what these idiots need!

LMFAO! *phew* Your responses so far are AWESOME. I would like to throw in, that for right now, moving is NOT an option. My roommate is helping my bf get an awesome job and we are renting her a room (she's awesome by the way) so we don't want to leave her out in the cold. Also, my other option is to move underneath my bf's parents. Who probably would charge us half. Yeah, it's going to be noisy with them as well b/c their culture doesn't seem to think any volume is too loud..HOWEVER it will be different..I will have to put up with it b/c we are all helping each other. But this lady..is not helping me or doing me any favors. I'm paying $950 plus internet a month for a 400 sq ft apartment in Corona, NY (it's a crummy area but not a complete ghetto).

Unfortunately, I am going to have to agree with the first poster. I'm not bias, as my Mom's side of the family is hispanic. But they just don't seem to value their stuff as much and there is a LOT less order in their houses. The kids run around like savages. When I went to HS I was always envious of all the hispanic kids. They go to do WHATEVER they wanted. Of course I'm not envious anymore b/c they are all parents & never did anything with their lives. It's quit disheartening.



My suggestion is to call upstairs each and everytime they are loud and pretend you are concerned. Ask them if everything is ok since you are hearing such loud noises. Pretend to be alarmed. If they wanna be fake you can be too! LOL. I had this same exact problem. The lady could only say "QUE?" when I addressed it. It was selective comprehension. The ignorant idiot knew exactly what I was saying but was always pretending to be stupid...or perhaps they really are...? :(

Oh god, I SO don't miss being in your situation!! I used to have a hoochie mama above me who partied on work nights until all hours of the morning. I put holes in my ceiling banging on it, one time my bf waited until she left one evening and put nail glue in her keyhole so she couldn't get back in. I didn't approve of this, but I wasn't real heartbroken over it, either. Anyway, you're probably gonna have to move - these people are obviously clueless - but in the meanwhile, have a little fun. Blast porn movies through the ceiling. Really loud, moaning, ones. Hey, maybe even some gay male porn movies. See if they take the kid to the park when you do that. At the very least, you can have a few laughs and see if you can drive them as crazy. Wonder what nosey questions they'll come up with after that? Then again, they are friends of your boyfriend's parents....so you might get some funny looks at the next family dinner. lolzors



The person above me is wrong; there are plenty of idiot children! Like almost all of them! Parents are supposed to teach them not to be idiots, though, so they don't become idiot adults!

Tit for tat. Have a party..don't over-do,however. Deviously thinking, I think you should blast FULL music @ the bil's room when hes asleep..then go back to your room & pretend you dint know what happened. Better still, when it like 3:00 am..take the b-i-l's music system (or whatever he uses)..sneak it from his room, take it to the landlords room, switch it on & run away. he will get into trouble..if asked, innocently bat ur eyelids, yawn & say, "wtf are u going on about??" xD



bwahahahahaha...



Btw, tell ur bf in a cute/sexy way that you dont like him telling the lady that he was there..ask him to deny it! lol Wtf is the woman up to anyways? lol stalking u guys? whats her problem?!?! hahaha idiot. Btw, tell ur bf (in a kiddish way).."its gonna be our lil secret, k?" hehe xD

Yep! I agree. Hispanic people really don't know how to discipline their children and the rest of us suffer for it. I don't know why either. I have lived next to black people who's children were not perfect..but when they were loud or misbehaved their parents did NOT play. So it was a nice arrangement. I'm half hispanic and live in a predominently hispanic area and I'm moving to a white area ASAP. People can call it racist all they want but in a white area I won't have to deal with them running around like morons and playing that bachata **** in their backyard until 2 am on workdays. These people and their rudeness disgust me and they wonder why are treated the way they are by society. Puhlease! OH, thumbs up to the first answer and the answe that mentioned her thereafter... Bring on the thumbs up if you agree with us! Obviously we have an angry hispanic giving us thumbs down.,..but hey, it's nothing personal!

Part of the problem is density. You cannot stuff people into such dense quarters and not have them effect each other. If there was space between dwellings people could have less intrusion into each others' lives.



I was in a biligual mass and the spanish speaking people were letting their kids wander all over the church. I never attend biligual masses any more. The Black people and the White people kept their kids still and quiet.



I've known Mexican families who raised their kids to be respectful and none of the Mexican kids I knew growing up were unruly- they were good kids.  My former neighbors, who were Mexican had the most orderly kids in the neighborhood. I watched them from the day they were born. I miss them since they moved away.



Today, things are different. Still, I don't think it's race. I think people work too much and don't have enough time to teach their kids anything. When they grow up and have kids, they don't know how to



set their kids straight.



People who are chronically a nuisance should be made to change so they don't drive others away. This is what can be done- and it's very strong: The landlord can be sued for having nuisance tennants. There have been instances where this was done in my town and the neighbors all sued the landlord of the nuisance family  for $5000 each and won. It was for more serious stuff than noise, but any nuisance can be fought the same way.



I had a noisy neighbor who blasted his stereo at night. I gave him a good set of headphones. He didn't blast the stereo after that.

Sweet mother of God, we're in the same boat!!!!!! I deal with these totally rude, ignorant neighbors upstairs who happen to be cooking METH in their bathroom. No joke, no lie. The smell makes us all dizzy and crap here, yet the cops do nadda b/c each time they come these ppl act nicey-nice and play dumb. Yes, I live in a hick town and acting sweety pie does go a long way. So, the cops tell ME I need to move. F**k that! I'm not going anywhere. They also have a freaking brat little boy.....and guess what, they're hispanic. Wel, the girl is white guy is mexican. Kids does flippin cannonballs off the couch at 2am, and they vaccum at that time, too. WHO THE HELL DOES THESE THINGS??!!



And honey, I'd have put my foot thru the wall, too. I damn near poke hole in my ceiling banging with a broom stick. I yell, I call the cops at leat twice a day and nothing. I can't move either, so I just try and make their life as crappy as they make mine by doing everything I can to get them evicted.



I'd bag up the cat s**t and polietly dump it somewhere where they can smell it just like you do. And tell them that you don't like it anymore than they do yet somehow, they park it right at your door like its cool and you enjoy the smell. Please.



I'm too lazy to make noise and jam my music, b/c I hate loudness myself, and I have a 6month old..... who by the way woken by the noise here. Maybe if you don't want to stoop to their level you can deal with it, but odds are even if you did it would not bother them.



Best bet is to plan a move when you're able. And try not to move to a noisey, brat infested area. Meanwhile, you should give as good as you get when it comes to your upstairs folks!

talk to the landlord



bring in your friends and have a really big party(don't invite the family who are bothering you) and be really loud with loud music and everything then the family will realize that they don't like the noise either and maybe they'll quiet down



but if that doesn't work then babysit kids like 3 of them and let them run loose and be loud and obnoxious

Am I in the wrong for saying that?



My roommate/friend was talking again about how she's excited to go home for Thanksgiving, and then she made a comment like "I'm actually happy to go home to see my family, after all the **** they put me through". I couldn't take it anymore.



First a little background: she's palestinian, and i guess she went through a little of the war, and her dad has like 10 kids, not all of them related to her. She said her parents were really restrictive to her and bossed her around and so she can't take it there at home.



now back to the situation, i was like "you shouldn't say that. they're your parents. they brought you up" and then she brings up "no but you don't understand, they were just really restrictive you know? like they made me drive around like a chauffeur for all 10 kids, even when my father didn't have anything to do, he just made me drive everyone around." and in my head i thought, wow sounds like...every other teenager.



That gives you no right to say any of those things, to make your parents seem so bad, to make yourself look like such a hero for going home, like you're doing your family such a favor by gracing them with your presence. you know, the thing is, they probably WILL make a big deal when she goes home because they love her.



But I just ended the convo with a "whatever....i don't understand'" and she's like "yeah you dont understand. it's okay"  i think what really stung was the "it's okay", as if she thought i was too stupid to understand. ugh but all i know is, a family that calls you up and sings you happy birthday on your birthday doesn't sound like the abusive, hellish family you constantly moan and graon about.



this may not be a question, but more of a confessional, but feel free to comment. thanks for reading :)

She felt close enough to you to share her story. You are not in her situation and her parents are not yours so perhaps its not something you would understand. But to be honest, I had a much easier childhood than hers so I can emphasize. And just because she is angry at her parents, it doesn't mean she doesn't love them. I'm sure she doesn't think you're studpid, but try not to judge her because you've not been in her shoes and you don't know exactly what its like for her.

I think you went overboard with this. Everyones perspective on what was a bad situation is different. There may heave been a lot of other things that happened that you don't know about.

To be honest, It's her business.  You weren't there while she was growing up so what gives you the right to say things like that to her.  Just let her speak her mind.  She's obviously nervous about seeing them again and this is her way of handling things.

well u dont have the right or the knowledge to oppose what she says about her parents, after all not all parents are saints! And if u think ur too smart and know what every typical teenager sounds like and thinks about their parents then ur expected to also know that they dont like being told, oh dont say that ur parents r the best blah bla
i think just because u have had different type of parents, a positive role it seems doesnt mean everyone feels the same way that u do, and if u were to reply on her whinning about going home, u could just knod. its such a typical annoying thing that everyone says to u when u critisize ur family, its her parents and she knows better, little miss values!
and yeah, i dont blame her for saying yeah its okay because ur stereotyping all parents as great and have raised u bla bla bla!

Every person is different.  Just because you don't think you would feel the way she did under those circumstances doesn't mean that she's wrong for feeling that way.



As her friend, you don't have to fully understand, but you do need to support her.  Friends don't undermine friends - especially on something that really shouldn't matter so much to you.

Just ask them.  Then say "Oh, hi!  I didn't recognize your voice.  How are you?".  Fact is, no matter how friendly they are, they know you can't see who you're talking to and it's up to them to tell you who's calling.  They're being impolite by not telling you, even though they don't mean to be.

Before the time of "not very nice or trusting" people you could say "Hello, Jones residents, this is Jill", but I don't want to give out  too much information these days, for whatever reason, so I go more professional and say something like "good morning (or approp. time of day), I hope you're having a good day".  Then it seems easy to flow into a conversation AND get their name without having to ask.  Just a thought.

Voices sound different on the phone.. if they say.. hello Samantha.. how are you.. Is your mom there.. then say.. I'm fine thank you .. yes my mom is there but you know voices sound so different on the phone, may I ask who is calling please? Then that sounds perfectly normal.. nobody can take offense to that.. if they say their name and then you know who the person is.. say..'' Oh of course Mrs X.. sorry I didn't recognize your voice.. but it's always easier if people give their name.. then there are no misunderstandings''' I will get mom for you .. (and if she isn't there of course you ask if you can take a message).. You should answer the phone.. a lot of people say just ''Hello'' but I would say.. Hello good morning, the Smith residence (or whatever your family name) residence..., may I ask who's calling?" then the problem is solved right away.. (You should give your name also because if they are not friends of the family they face the same predicament as you.. if you just say 'Hello who is calling please'' then they don't know who you are and if they haven't perhaps misdialled...then there are 2 people who don't know who is talking... so I would say.. Hello, good morning.. this is Samantha S...May I ask who is calling?

This happens to me a lot. When I visit my mom, sometimes she will ask me to get the phone for her. The bad thing is, I sound just like my mom and some of her friends will just launch into conversation with me, telling me stuff I probably shouldn't be hearing. LOL



Anyway I just ask them if they want to speak to mom and hand her the phone, if she asks I just shrug and walk away. LOL BTW I'm 49.

Nah.... the answers above are good, but it makes it sound like you're a bit dumb.



Best thing is to say - "Sorry, the line was a bit bad there, I couldn't hear you properly. Who's calling?"
or
"Sorry - there was a lot of noise in the background / from the tv / from the kitchen / from my little brother / &lt;make up an excuse&gt; and I didn't hear you properly. Who's calling?"



and then:
"Oh, hi aunti Madge! You got drowned out by the noise!"



Why does this work? Well, because, when we're speaking on the phone, we tend to hear our own voice at our end, but not take any notice of what's coming through to us from the other end. Therefore, the caller won't necessarily have noticed if there was any noise or a drop in the line, and can't verify your excuse. You're in the clear, you know who it is, and everyone's happy.



Good luck!



EDIT: I use this excuse all the time if I'm supposed to have recognised the voice. My partner's family never introduce themselves on the phone and just launch into "Hi &lt;my name&gt;, how are you and what have you been up to?" and I'm on the back foot thinking "who the hell is this??".

Perhaps your best bet is to take the dog you can't be asked to walk, on a walk, and skip both the gym and the pub.

Why i am thinking much to a male co worker?



just met him 5-6 months ago.. and work 2-4 days a week in a longer hours, i am single and 5 yrs older, and he is into a relationship for more than 4 yrs and planning of getting married two yrs from now.We talk to each other every day if we have work, and we'll do lunches together. if his gf knew about the conversations between us, she will be mad. and we do watch a movie together (only as a friend). i do not like the guy because for me he is not ideal, and do some weird things sometimes... for me he is not the bf material i am thinking of... but why i can't erase him from my mind???
