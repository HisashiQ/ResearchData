Friend see to that whether your speaker is working properly, i think there may be problem in your speaker. Better connect another speaker and see, whether that is working or not.



Then connect your speaker to another system and check..

Could be a loose connection, maybe a short in the wiring, speaker connection to the wrong plug, mute accidentally clicked in the task bar.  Or if the speakers are old, an intenal switch is stuck not allowing it to go from speaker to headphone.



Try plugging the speaker into a stereo or another speaker into the computer to see if that works.



Or, the sound card isn't configured properly.



Doubtful on this last one, but if all else fails...

The space that the files take up is (mostly) overwritten by the system, and the records of the file in the system's file allocation tables are also overwritten. You're partially right: there is data left behind in those files. But the space it takes up is marked as "available" and can be written over by new files.



There are tools out there that are supposed to "scrub" old data from the drive. But the only real way to really, really get rid of old data is to clean the disk with something like DBAN. Which will wipe the disk clean, so that may not be an option.



Once you've used the system for a while, those old file will disappear more and more. It's difficult to put together even the remaining chunks of a file after a while.

Their current space on the disk is marked as free. This allows the machine to save temporary system files (many) and anything you save over that space. Within about 2 hours if you are using the machine a lot (temp internet files use a lot of free space) they normally become so corrupted as to be unreadable. Within maybe a day or two they would almost certainly be unreadable in any part.

The above poster is incorrect.  You don't have to format your drive to delete files for good.  In OSX this functionality it built in by default, by on the PC it is not.  Here are a few programs that can recover deleted files, as well as permanently delete them:

How do you replace a key on a computer keyboard. How do they snap in?



Dell laptop



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Laptops are very tricky to replace the keys on.
It's hard to explain without being able to show you but here goes..



Under the key there is usually 2 small plastic clips which fit together in like a 'scissor' way (they join in the middle and pivot). Once they are joined in the middle, there should be 2 small clips on the keyboard itself and one side of the plastic clip will join onto the clips on the keyboard. Once that is done, if you carefully align the key on top of that and press it gently it should click into place, you may have to press it at an angle to make one side of the key click on before the other side will go on.



Be careful though, the 2 small clips can break very easily and as the key has come off, there may be a possibility that it could have broken when that happens in which case you would probably need to get a new keyboard. If this is the case, it's probably best to return your laptop to Dell if it is still under warranty, or if you are confident about taking the laptop apart, you should be able to find a replacement keyboard on ebay which you could fit yourself.



Sorry I can't really help more but it's a hard one to explain.

I don't know, but if I would try an experiment (with the risk of damaging your cd), I would see how the mold would react if I place the cd in an airtight canister, with a cloth of alcohol next to it.



I hope the mold would die in the alcohol enriched air.



But the question would remain (will the dead mold continue to disrupt the data or not.

Is there a way to keep the white Apple light on the cover on when i shut my MacBook?



I see it on the laptops in programs (Ugly Betty) when they are using the Macbook and close it the white apple light on the macbook stays on. When i close my macbook however the light goes of and instead the white standby light pulses. Is there a way to keep the apple light on as well? I know there are softwares like InsomniaX which keep everything on when you close the lid. But this also keeps the hard drives running, the actual display on and speakers etc.



Basically... i want to put it on standby but keep the apple light on the lid.



Anyone know if this is possible, and if so how?

Check that you have fitted the correct speed RAM. If the new RAM you have purchased was a lower speed than what was already in your system, it will run at the slower speed which may bring your score down.

I would go for the Asus machine before any E-machine. They are pure garbage and are considered "disposable" if your looking for a new pc.. goto Dell's outlet, which are new/used machines that are refurbished with full warranties. The Eee got a 78 out of 100 score from PC World magazine and was designed for students.



As far as games go the Asus WILL NOT cut it.. but the E-Machine might but why spend money on a pc just to run a game.. goto the Dell outlet.. you'll be glad you did!

neither of these machines will do very well on the limited RAM .  Both have extremely small amounts of data storage.  The processor speed is not nearly as important as the amount of RAM.  XP requires a minimum of 1 gb.  Vista minimum is really 2.  I would shy away from only 8 gigs of data storage (Asus).  If you need to expand the 40 gigs in the emachines you could always use an 8 gig stick.  Most programs nowadays require at least a gigabyte for the program alone.  A good photograph taken with a decent digital camera will consume 20 - 30 megabytes a piece (i.e max 50 photos per gigabyte).  You can always add a usb wireless port to the emachine.

It depends on what you need.
Emachines based on the spec is totally an old machines.
Possible 4-5 years PC specs.



The Asus Eee is targeting the current user more on the mobility.
simple user. who most ignore the power of PCs.

The laptop came with the ability to use bluetooth, but its just a button. It does not work at all. I need to know what parts for the laptop do I need to purchase so that I can get it to work?

Well, first you need to attach something that works with bluetooth. Like a mouse. Or a BT-capable cell phone. Bluetooth is used for close-range attachment of devices. That's it.

<answer>



How have you confirmed that it does not work?  What are you trying to do with it?  If when you press the button there's not a light or an icon in your system tray indicating that it's activated then it's broken internally probably, and if that's the case just go buy yourself a USB Bluetooth adapter...it will likely be cheaper than diagnosing and replacing whatever it is that broke on the integrated one.
However as the prior poster said, unless you try to connect something to it and you receive the error that the Bluetooth is unavailable, don't be convinced it's actually broken.

Dell uses the three lights to display different error messages.  You did not give the exact model (the errors vary with models) but on many of the Dell laptops the middle light indicates that there is a problem charging the battery.  It may mean that the battery is nearing the end of its life (they are good for about 2-3 years) and may soon fail to charge.

C2D L2 Cache significance?



I have the option of getting a DELL M1530 with :



C2D 2.1 GHz with 2 MB L2 cache



OR
C2D 2.4 GHz with 3 MB L2 cache ($50 more than first choice)



OR
C2D 2.5 GHz with 6 MB L2 cache ($150 more than first choice)



Is the 6 MB L2 worth the huge price difference? I'd like to know. Use is college/gaming. RAM is 4 gig, video is 256 MB dedicated, hard disk is 7200 rpm 250GB and a 1 TB external



Oh ya, I also wanted to ask: Is there a significant difference in speed between 5400 and 7200 rpm hard disks in lappys?



Sorry for cheating with two questions. Thanks for answering.

i have a TV tuner for my PC and i love it.
What mine does is i can watch and record tv on my pc.



i could also program it to record my shows that i like .
thirdly i can record things that are on my tv (my tv has a RWY output) so that enables me to record my game play.



basicly it adds a TV to your laptop (PC) and makes it more of your personal entertain station.

Your OS doesn't come with MPEG 2 Codecs and you'll need 3rd party software in order to play them. Or in the event you do have the correct codecs you'll need to configure the auto play options when inserting a DVD. You can access the atuo play from control panel.

Compatibility mode is what is used to enable some older programs to run on operating systems that they were not designed for. For example you may have a Windows 95 program that you wanted to run on XP, then you could enable compatibility mode which would make it run.



Compatibility mode is enabled on a 'per-program' basis so you will need to right click on the icon for the program you want, then click properties and there should be a tab along the top for compatibility and from there you can change the options (this is for Windows XP, the settings for it may be in a different place in Vista but I haven't tried it so I don't know about Vista)

The typical 32 bit or 64 bit CPU weighs a couple of ounces.  (A CPU is an integrated circuit - it plugs into a socket on the motherboard.)  A small 8 bit CPU can weigh well under an ounce (like the one in your cellphone).



A server (or desktop - they're the same computer, just being used for different purposes) can weigh anywhere from a couple of pounds to many pounds, depending on the weight of the power supply, how many drives are in it, what other cards are in it, etc.

CPU's are very light weight, like less than 1/4 lb. Servers range greatly since there are several different makes and models so there really isn't an average.

You will be able to buy larger batteries for the Acer, however, until you get one, one thing you can do is completely drain the battery, then recharge it fully, and do it once more. This works with cell phones, and most things with batteries such as that. Hope it helps.

Vibration vs Force Feedback?



I am thinking of buying a racing wheel for my PC but do not know what is the differnece between Vibration Feedback and Force Feedback (other than the fact that VF wheels are cheaper than FF wheels).



Please help / advise!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Vibration is just what the name implies.  It's used usually as a general indication of a rough ride, or being hit by something.



Force feedback means physical resistance against your movement of the controller.  If you're against a wall on your left side and you try to turn left, you can't, so force feedback keeps the wheel from turning any more to the left until you're clear of that wall.  It's a much more realistic feeling of being in the game.



Vibration is typically done with a motor with an unbalanced weight on the shaft.  Force feedback is a lot more complicated than that, hence the price difference.

Why use a Zip drive for DOS when you could use a network to copy the files instead?  Or even move the drive to a new system.  Then you can access it normally.

Nothing.



They use small storage units and you copy files to an from them like any other disk drive.



I can't believe someone still uses one. You can fit about 100x the data on a small USB stick. It's a really obsolete technology at this stage, unless you just need to store small amounts of data.

They used to be very popular for data storage and file transfers. I have over 40 zip disks with backed up data on them, however I rarely use them anymore. With the advent of cd burning and now dvd burning, the zip disk appears to be following the same path of extinction that the floppy disk is heading.
There are 250 meg disks and 100 meg disks. you can use an internal ide drive to read and wrtie or you can go mobile and use a usb drive which is also available.



Contrary to some of the other comments I've read here, I've actually never had any problems with them other than if you want to share any of the files that are on them, then the other person also has to have a zip drive. (but the usb drive helps).

What you really need to know is the name of a good electronics recycler.



You can go out and fetch yourself a USB jump drive for about 20 bucks that will have a (minimum) 10 times the storage of a Zip disk.



The technology is not only obsolete, it is a dangerous way to store data. Hopefully, you aren't storing anything important on one of those relics. One reason they aren't around was because they were essentially junk.

Well first things first
you cannot avoid fingerprints



nextly if you want to clean your notebook use a damp cloth preferably soaked in soap water and rinsed then clean the surface with it gently,then wipe it off with a dry cloth



You can also use a cleaning liquid which is easily available in the market

While yes, it's nearly impossible to rid a laptop entirely of fingerprints, the cleaning/polishing cloth that should have come with your MacBook does a good job at removing them.  Also, Monster makes a product that is basically like a baby wipe for electronics (you can find them at BestBuy, Circuit City, probably WalMart and such).  These work well for removing fingerprints and do a decent job at preventing them for a bit too...I think the cleaning solution is an electronic specialized type of Windex formula.  But word to the wise...don't try Windex, it can create this weird gummy film if you're not careful that is very difficult to get off and in other places it mattes the machine case in a weird way that never goes away.

For a new machine you probably aren't going to beat dell:

Otherwise, check on e-bay or in your local classifieds for a used machine - unfortunately you probably won't get a warranty, and laptops are notoriously easy to break.

First, we'd need to know Your home area, or where You'll be shopping.



Just to be somewhat helpful, I'm in Massachusetts, and have seen a LOT of great refurbished models from www.microcenter.com, which is located in Cambridge for me, but they have a nationwide website, so probably have one close to you too.



I've seen prices from $279.00 up to over a $1000.00, but the lower end prices are more than I'd need for personal use, even as a free-time repairs guy.

What do you mean by saying, "because of my integrated microphone"? If you mean that you want to record using the integrated microphone, there are many ways to do so.
If you are a Windows user, one simple way is to use "Sound Recorder" (Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Entertainment &gt; Sound Recorder)

BT Broadband Connection issues ?



This started happening during the time I had some DIY/Home Improvement chaps, sorting out the flooring/bathroom tiling and downstairs painting/decorating.



Basicaly I found the ADSL Filter in the Phone socket terminal (the white square box to plug in your conventional phone lead)  partialy broken, the casing of that little ADSL Filter box must have taken a serious 'bash' as it was now loose and not secure.  I noticed that the gold pins for the 'phone end' on the end of the ADSL filter were bent, and badly maligned and the plastic holding them in place was smashed.



Somehow it still worked but this is problem I am having right now.



If somebody makes a phone call or answers one,  the internet connection remains on - but the browsing online to pages/links ends abruptly and I get a error page from Bt Home hub - your internet connection is not active etc etc.



No uploading/downloading of data on the broadband line occurs during this point, which is where somebody is speaking to somebody on our phone line.



How should I go bouts resolving this mess ?



</question>



<additional details>



P.S - oh and as soon as somebody hangs up on our phone line,  you can start surfing teh web again.  They key thing to note is that the internet connection doesn't turn off, it remains on - just being able to follow urls on the web stops working.  Weird eh ?

Call BT: they'll replace your filter free of charge, at least.  It's also probably the filter issue that's causing the Internet to cut off when someone's on the phone.

Hello everyone, for the internet connection which is best over telephone lines or cable?



The person who is supporting our Client right now is using the net connection as : ADSL 2048/256 Kbps(*)over ISDN line. I have evaluated the service provider in my area as BELGACOM---gives net connection over telephone line and VOO --gives net connection over cable line. Now I am not able to understand which one will be best for me?

Tough call if both are available.  I have always and will only use cable (until I can afford to have a partial T run into my house!).  You get better speed and a more reliable signal (in my experience).  DSL's biggest selling point is that you don't have to split bandwidth from the trunk with other area subscribers.  While I live in a huge neighborhood where most people use cable Internet, I have lightning speeds that impress even the most skeptical of users.  DSL is quick and the speed they sell you is all yours (never fluctuates)...but the last thing you want to have to do is run (and pay for) a dedicated landline specifically for a DSL connection, have the garbage truck back into the box where the line terminates and kill your connection, then wait in the long service line the provider puts you in to have a tech come out and repair the trunk...it's a pain (this happened to my client a few years back and cost his company several hundred thousand dollars in lost sales).  Cable is buried, marked and fast...and doesn't require a separate line.

Cable has the potential for faster speeds.  It's a bigger piece of wire.  But you'll pay more for those speeds.  It also gives you the advantage to completely remove your phone from your home.  Thus no more phone bill (put that money to the internet cost).  You can use a voip program like skype for your home phone. It's not very secure though.  Everyone connects to 1 satellite, and that satellite connects to the hub.  So someone just needs to introduce a sniffer to the satellite and they can track all of your traffic.



DSL is more secure at lower speeds. (it's not noticeable unless you're an active torrent user)  It's your connection to the switch board.  However the further you live from the hub (Next door compared to 2 blocks away) will affect your download rate.  (Further from the hub, further for the information to travel, more people in front of you connecting.)

Laptops suck for gaming.



You can not upgrade the video card.



The exact same hardware specifications operate 20-35% slower in a laptop.



Few laptops have video cards that are capable of reasonable frame rates.



Do a search here for all of the poor smucks that didn't listen to this advice and got a laptop anyway.  Most are complaining about poor frame rates or low quality graphics.  Many ask how to upgrade their laptop's video card.

You will not find a gaming laptop for under $500. A desktop that will play most games okay is possible. If you want a laptop get one WITHOUT an onboard chipset. That way you can upgrade the graphics card. You also might have to upgrade RAM if you buy one under $500. You should measure cost of upgrades and laptop versus cost of more expensive laptops.

You won't be able to play it with good graphics or anything because the recommended requirements are an nvidia 7900 which is very high spec for a laptop, but I am sure you can customise a dell for about 500 quid that will run it acceptably.



You want something that meets this spec:



Minimum System Requirements:



CPU: Pentium 4 2.4GHz Single Core processor



System RAM: 1GB



Video Card: Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 128MB RAM (NVIDIA 6600 or better/ATI X1300 or better, excluding ATI X1550).

Probably the second one from the left is your best bet, but it exceeds your budget slightly.

you need a bigger budget if you want results around £1000 I am using an area 51 M9750 Alienware laptop which does play games quite well . You could use an external graphic card such has the Asus XG station, but that is like a brick sticking out of the case.

How can I load a game on a second harddrive?



Our computer has two seperate hard drives to load games on.  My daughter would like to move her sims and itunes onto one of them so our other programs will go faster.  How can I get the computer to switch harddrives  so she can be able to load her games on the other?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



To install a program to the second drive of your computer, you will have to reinstall the program.  When you go through the install, you will need to select either the custom or advanced install.  That will give you the option to select which hard drive to install it on.



Since the program is already installed, you will want to UNINSTALL it first so that you do not end up with two copies (one on each drive) of the program.

Cache memory is random access memory (RAM) that a computer microprocessor can access more quickly than it can access regular RAM. As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading of data from larger memory.

This is when programs, such as browsers, download/produce a file, and save it to your hard drive temporarily. If you're streaming music, you can re-play the same track while only downloading it once.



There's also hardware cache on CPUs, this is small but fast memory that it uses to improve speed.

cache memory is a small amount of memory situated in the processor itself. It works as a buffer for most frequently used data or execution code so that processor do not have to look into RAM each time when something is required. Since cache is pretty much faster than RAM it is desirable to have the required data and codes to be in cache as much time as possible. This improves speed of the computer as a whole.!! Then some one might say why not increase cache and remove RAM altogether ? Actually cache memory is very expensive, usually a present day processor has 16 kb of level 1 cache and 1 or 2 mb of level2 cache.



Level1 and level2 are types of cache. level1 is faster and of lesser amount while level2 is relatively slower. There may be even level3 cache memory as well.

Cache memory is used as temporary storage used to hold data for a hardware device until the hardware is ready for it. to allow the device to run faster.  For example, a processor will have a small cache so that when it loads a program, it can hold the next few commands in the cache and have them ready for processing, as that is faster than have to go back to the hard drive for each command.



It is also used on hard drives, CD drives, and floppies when writing to them. Often the computer can send the information faster that it can be written to the disk, so the computer will "cache" the additional information until it is ready to write it.

You can't do it with just a USB cable, you need a crossover cable, cheap enough and available at most  pc stores.

you can do this with a cross-over cable, but the network settings may be a little complicated.



your best bet is to go to walmart (just cuz they're the cheapest) and get a USB pen/flash drive. A 2GB flash drive will only cost about $15.



plug it into your desktop, copy all the data you wanna move over too the flash drive, then plug it into your laptop and copy over again. use it just like a floppy disk to move data, its that simple.

If it doesn't need bells a whistles then i would get an HP, they're inexpensive and last a long time.



I would not, repeat, would not get an Apple. They make nice laptops but its not worth the money with what I'm guessing you'll use it for.

In this article in a magazine,



it said that Sony and Toshiba
are the most reliable makes of laptop
and far more unlikely to break down.



I have a Sony VAIO and is very, very good.
It has never given me any problems.
It's very quick an reliable.



My sister has a Toshiba.
She's had it for years, and it's stayed the same.
It's still as good as it was when she first bought it.



So I would highly recommend one of those.



I used to have a Dell and didn't last very long.
It randomly broke and started going really slowly,
not long after i bought it.

Should I get XP 32-BIT or XP 64-BIT?



I currently have a vista laptop and is currently 64-bit. I'm a bit of a gamer so whenever I play games on my laptop it tends to lag.. video card is Geforce 7150m. I've heard that XP gives more FPS than Vista. I'm just wondering what would make me have more FPS;XP 32-bit or XP 64-bit.



ps:I have around 200gb of hardrive and 4.00gig ram

I have heard of people having problems downgrading to xp, but i htink there are tuts out there.



Here is the problem:



The FPS difference from Vista to XP will not be worth the price. You have a Nvidia 7150m. That is a "piece of sh*t" if you're talking about gaming... You'll should be happy playing most games at low or medium settings...



also... if you really think you will benefit from it, you should get 64 bit bcause 32 bit only recognizes around 3.2 gb of ram.



~You have to get a new computer... since you cannot upgrade laptop gpus very easily.



EDIT: In response to Gijoe or w/e... he is WRONG. 32 bit will not recognize 4 gb of ram. PERIOD.

32-bit version.



When they deploy 64 bit games that you intend to buy then make the move over.  The processor will spend it's time as well as your memory to drive 32-bit emulators to support all the applications and games you use now.



If ever you feel the real need to use more than 4 GB of RAM then you will also need to transistion over to 64 bit (or buy a motherboard that supports extensible addressing to make use of more than 4 BG of RAM).



XP does not use as much resources as Vista so I believe that your 4 GB will work out fine.

32-bit is more compatible with applications, drivers.
Vista is better at least because XP doesn't support DirectX 10 and Vista has more features (Ultimate version) and it is more secure. But I feel more comfortable with XP because the GUI works smooth.

Yes, you need an enclosure. Make sure the enclosure works with either pata/sata depending on the type of drive you have. A lot of enclosures can now fit both types as well.



Typically you set the jumper to master unless otherwise noted.

You can't turn your internal hard drive into an external harddrive without the cables sticking out of the tower.



You will need an actual "external harddrive" and yes, those will run off of a USB cable.

Assuming you stored all your of these types of files in "My Documents", just go to "My Documents" and delete everything. This will have the same effect as making a new user, and deleting the old user without saving any user info.
Creating a new user option will also delete all preferences and usage data.



Depending on how "deleted" you want everything to be there are additional steps to take to completely clean your system of person files/data.



A complete wipe of your hard drive and rewriting 64 time with 32 random codes overwrite is very time consuming, but cheaper than replacing the hard drive and doing a fresh install of windows.

There is no simple way to do that.  You would have to go through by hand and find and delete all the information.  Or you will have to format the hard drive and reinstall Windows from either you Windows CD or a Restore CD. But there is no simple command or programs that only erases all the data.

Your screen is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise.



You can right click on the desktop and chose properties (personalise in Vista) and correct it from there or:



if you are using an Nvidia based graphics card correct it in the Nvidia Control Panel,



If you are using an ATi based graphics card correct it in Catalyst Control Centre.



It's very easy, you are looking for screen rotation and to set it to zero. .

I tried to copy 2.05 GB Video from my hard disk to a DVD disc which had 4.7 GB capacity.  ?



But the disc got ejected with the message that the material i was copying had 8.6. GB, since the disc capacity of 4.7 GB was not enough.
A few weeks ago i had copied the same material in 4.7 GB disc without any trouble. Why is the computer  now saying that i was trying to copy 8.6 GB size, even though the actual size is 2.05 GB? On earlier occassion and this occassion i have used Nero Essentials.

probably there might be some hidden files in the folder which you are copying into a DVD. So if you try to look at the properties of the film you are trying to copy it 'll show only 2.5 GB but if you are copying that whole folder it may show 8.5 GB.



Just check it out.

I chose the CP CQ50 105NR which is currently available at Best Buy for a discount. It has done wonders for my computing and uses VISTA installed completely. Vista does best when it is the manufactured installed platform and having no problems here.

2 laptops... which one to choose?



I want to buy a new laptop and I found those amazing 2 laptops online with a great price



both are with the same price and same specifications "few differences illustrated below"



First laptop:
Gateway P-7811FX
Intel® Core™2 Duo processor P8400 2.26GHz L2 chache 3MB
NVIDIA GeForce 9800M GTS graphics with 512MB



No Bluetooth, No fingerprint scanner



Second laptop:



ASUS M70Vm-X1



Intel® Core™2 Duo processor T9400 2.53GHz L2 chache 6MB
NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GS
Bluetooth and fingerprint scanner included.



If you were in my place, which will you prefer? the more powerful CPU or the more powerful GPU?
or the differences are not that much?
or ASUS over Gateway since the differences are insignificant?



Please advice

Keeping the laptop on stand by is a better idea.
When you start the laptop from switch off, it consumes 3X power .
Standby uses lesser power.



Also have you tried hibernating your laptop? that will give you a 10 times faster start up.

Yeah I have it in stand by all the time but if you wont to shut it down go do a Hibernate is shuts down your laptop but allows a quick start up. But shutting down is better for battery life because you battery doesn't live forever and even if is charging it can mess up your charger.



But I always use Hibernate trust me. Oh and sometimes it can mess up your laptop screen I heard somewhere and that viruses can access your laptop because is only stand by but I don't think the second one is true

It depends on your Hardware.



for 32 bit OS the system only can read 3 GB of RAM, so when you have more than 3 GB RAM it better you get 64 Bit OS.



The CPU also one of the factor to calculate the work. 64-Bit processor is required for best performance.

I'd recommend the hd4850, I thinks it a little more expensive then the ones your looking at (maybe $10, it depends on what deals you find)



9600GT is the budget card of Nvidia's 9000 series.  the 8800GT is the average/slightly high end card of Nvidia's older 8000 series.  Its hard to say which is the better card.  I haven't used either of them and haven't been able to find good benchmarks.



the HD4850 is the cheaper of the two cards in ATI's current generation (4000 series).

generallyu speaking 9000 series stuff is better.



however, the second digit, 6, indicates it is a 'budget' chip. whereas the 8800 might be more robust, but in similar pricerange cause its older.



but who knows, maybe the 9K has some added features.

Usually, there is a slot, called AGP, or PCI-E for newer graphic card, in your motherboard, so you can upgrade your integrated graphic card using an add-on graphic card.

Yes that's integrated. If its a laptop, you're out of luck, but if it's a desktop, it'll have a PCi-e slot for a video card.



If you buy another video card, you'll have to disable the integrated one, but it's easy to do in the BIOS. Just make sure your power supply has enough amps on the 12v rail to get enough power to the new card.

So is there any thing i can do to use both of them to listen audio at the same time.?

Nope. That behaviour is controlled by the audio device on the motherboard. But if all you're after is two audio plugs, you could always get a 3.5mm stereo jack double adapter.

How can I prevent my memory card from formatting itself?



No. I'm not joking around. A few of my friends' memory cards formatted themselves and we don't know why or how it happened.



I have too much stuff in  my card and I obviously don't wanna lose them... So how can I prevent my 550Mb Micro SD memory card from formatting itself?

<answer>



That PC is at least 10 years old.  New graphics cards will not work because they use a different voltage.



See if you can find an nVidia MX 400 or lower.  Tiger Direct may still carry them.

Why can’t I get ALL pictures onto my 2GB memory card with an external card reader?



I’m trying to load a couple hundred pictures onto a 2GB SD card.  About half of them will transfer then I can’t get anymore on.  An error message of ‘Can’t create a directory for file “Named Picture”’ comes up and then the transfer stops.  Even after removing the supposedly offending file, no other files will go on.  However, ‘Properties’ shows that about 2% of my card’s space is used by these pictures and there’s still lots of space left on the card.



I am trying to transfer them all at once.

Its possible that you are copying all the files into the root (or top) directory and that is the cause of the problem (don't ask me why thats a problem - it makes no sense to me but I've experienced just that).



Try creating a new directory on the card, and then copy the files into that.

More then likely most of the people that attempted to do that, later found out that some of the drivers for their computer do that support XP. So if anyone wants XP it would be wise to go to a site like tigerdirect and buy one with XP already installed on it.

A few questions about SLI Technology?



1. Do I need a motherboard with SLI tech enabled to use a SLI graphics card? Do I need it to use 2 or more together?



Can two different graphics cards which both have SLI enabled be used together?

A) Cards with SLI will function on their own in non-sli motherboards. SLI cards can still function on their own in SLI motherboards. Obviously you can't do SLI if you don't have an SLI mobo though.



B) Not unless they have the same core (G70, G80, etc) which usually has to do with being in the same series. For instance, the 9800M GTX and 9800M GT both use the G92 core. You could use those two together, as long as they both support SLI. This applies whether or not they have the same GPU and memory clock speeds, memory size, or are even made by the same manufacturer.



But you couldn't use the 9800M GT and the 9800M GTS together in SLI. The former is based on the G92 core, while the latter is based on the G94 core.



Hope this helps!

You need an SLI motherboard to use SLI.  You can use a single video card that's SLI capable in just about any board.  SLI only works with 2 or more video cards, otherwise it's not SLI.



If both video cards are compatible and from the same manufacturer, it is possible to SLI enable them.  However, the best results are achieved when you use two identical video cards.

1. Yes, you need a motherboard with SLI enabled to use SLI graphic card



2. It depends on what will you do with your computer. If you use it just for typing, then you do not need more than one graphic card. It is a different case if you use your pc for gaming, which takes much resource.



3. SLI is a combination between 2 or more NVidia graphic cards. In ATI graphic card, it is called CrossFire. It is better to use the same NVidia graphic card to run SLI.

You can use a video card that is SLI capable without actually utilizing SLI or having a second PCI-E slot. You need to have a mobo capable of SLI and the same graphics cards in order to use SLI.

Did I break my external hard drive?



I have a Seagate FreeAgent Pro 500GB external hard drive.  Yesterday it dropped off my desk and fell about 3 feet onto a tile floor.  Now, the light comes on as normal but the drive does not boot up and the computer does not recognize it.  The drive itself only emits a very faint beep or buzz every few seconds.  This only happens intermittently.  My question is do these things have like a reset button or something I just can't find or did I possibly just kill it?

Yes but the motherboard has to be compatible and there has to be a 64-bit OS running on the system for it to read. Usually this is rare and it'll truncate the number to 5-4-3.2GBs even depending on how it was made.

Many motherboards are able to support 16GB of ram, and often more. But the difficulty of getting 16GB of ram is complicated because you need to find 4x4gb and a windows OS that runs x64bit. Is it worth it? No. If you use a home computer 2-4 GB is enough. Servers need more to support everything, so they usually use 8GB.

Servers are made for that much RAM (and more)  but normal home Computers don't have that much.  I guess if you bought 2gb Rams and put 4 in  you could get 8gb but thats probably the highest.

It depends on your application. If you don't want to play games, or run graphically intensive applications, it will be fine. MSI motherboards on the whole are average, and do have a risk of being poor quality in their lower end models. This board will be obsolete for most things within 8 months.



I generally advise against micro-ATX boards, primarily due to the expense involved of memory, lack of space, and reduced functionality to fit in a smaller space.



If I were you, I'd pass on this and wait until I could afford to drop a few hundred more on a 780i or 790i.

Write-protected usb flash drive?



Ok, well i have an intergral 2gb usb stick, and its worked perfectly since christmas, but when i plugged it in today it said "This disk is write-protected". when i tried to delete any files it just tells me that its write protected and i cant. I have no switch on my stick that protects it, and i even checked to see if it was a virus (disk-knight) but when i followed the instructions of removal, none of the files that it tells me to delete are there (So i geussed i have no virus).



Does anyone know how to get rid of this damn write protection?

I just installed 2GB of RAM on my Acer Aspire 5315 (came with 512MB) but I don't know if it's done anything?



I got the compatible Samsung 200-pin SO-DIMM DDR2 667MHz PC2-5300 upgrades, 2 X 1GB chip/cards. Opened the back of my laptop and removed the old Samsung 512MB PC2-5300 chip and put the 2 new 1GB cards into the 2 RAM slots. All clicked/sloted in okay, it's the first time I've done anything with computers, obviously, but it all seemed to go OK and when I switched it back on everything seems to be working alright, the same as usual anyway. My problem is this;



a) I can't tell any difference in speed or anything like that.



b) the crucial.com scan I did beforehand said that my computer has a maximum of 2GB RAM with 2 slots. But it said both slots were empty and that no memory was installed (when there was 512MB installed and occupying the rear slot) and at the very top of the results it said that my system currently had the maximum memory installed. All very confusing.



c) the crucial.com scan that I did after putting in the new RAM had EXACTLY the same scan results as the one I did prior to installing the upgrades. It also still made no sense whatsoever, claiming that my system simultaniously had the maximum memory installed and also no memory installed and both slots empty.



Can someone explain what is happening? Do I have to acctivate the upgrades somehow? Logic tells me that if my computer is runnning as per usual the it must be utillising at least 512MB of the new RAM upgrades, but how can I find out if the whole 2GB is being utillised? Obviously crucial.com isn't gonna work, unless I am a total spastic and can't make head nor tail of the scan results, but to a layman they don't seem to make any sense at all. Can anyone help? The reason I tried to upgrade is because I am switching from *gulp* dial-up to wireless broadband and I figured that it'd just work better with more memory. Have I wasted my time? I sorta expected a big jump in proccessing speed but it seems the same to me, how can I test it?

Go on start menu and right click computers and go onto properties. If its still the same as it was it isn't compatible with your computer.. It also might tell that the ram is their and the person who put it in has put it in properly/hasn't installed it properly.. so on

Thanks, I found it. It is there and working ok. I was just expecting a much more significant increase in proccessing speed. You know, for 4 times the memory it wasn't that big of a change. I don't play video games though so I suppose I can't really appreciate the benfit. I want a super fast computer

Right-click my computer and select properties to see how much RAM you currently have installed on your computer.  You must have SOME ram working if you're computer's booting up as it won't run at all without RAM.  More RAM is NOT equal to more speed.  You'll only notice a difference in memory intensive applications or if your computer was always low on ram before.

right click on your task bar (the itty-bitty icons next to the time in the bottom right corner of your monitor) then click on task manager, then when it opens click on the tab that says "Performance" it will graphically show you your CPU Usage and your Page File history, basically if your using up a lot of ram it will demonstrate that in the bottom graph, and it will demonstrate how hard your processor is working in the top graph, if the top one is under 75% your computer is just fine, if the PF usage, depending on your available RAM, is around 500-650 MB your computer is fine, if it's over you have too many things running that you dont know about, if it's under, your at like lightning speed.

Yeah, sounds like you don't have drivers or software installed for your phone.  Could also be you don't have the software installed for your USB port.  WinXP usually comes with this built in.  Charging means the power part of the plug is working.  Does other stuff work in this plug?  If nothing works, maybe some wires are plugged in wrong on your motherboard.

Hi Friend, As you say that your usb port din't recognize your phone and it start charging your phone. so I request you to try connecting other device such as card reader, usb mouse or keyboard see whether it is working properly or not.
If that device is working then try connecting some other phone and see whether it is detected. If other phone is got connected than there might be some problem in your phone. Or some phone has the function that when you connect your phone to the pc at that time the phone display the option such as PC SUITE, MASS STORAGE etc.
Check for that setting also on your phone



I hope this information is useful for you

Without a doubt, the more modern ATI 4870 is the best.
The Nvidia 8800 series is growing old and is now superceded by the 9XXX series. The 9800 GT on up is a better comparison and, quite frankly, it is a toss up. The avid gamers I know prefer the ATI cards.

Advanced computer science question, the acrynym invloving DDR3 RAM and DRAM?



I am reading a book on memory management and stumbled across something interesting and decided to do some investigation. The four presets of ram include
DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM)
SRAM (Static RAM)
VRAM (Video Ram)
these presets have been extended with optimisation through various manufacturers that in return have slightly added new acronyms to the original presets. I did a google search for RAM and came up with:
--------------------------------------...
Kingston 4 GB PC3-10666 DDR3 RAM (KVR1333D3N9K2/4G)
Price Range: $242-440



--------------------------------------...
If u look carefully the description specifies "DDR3 RAM", my question is; Is this type of ram a branch from the DRAM preset but instead of using DDR3 DRAM they use DDR3 RAM because DRAM is considered by default?



sorry if my wording doesn't make sense, i will try and explain it with an analogy. Like for example instead of expressing 10 m as 10.00 m the .00 is allready assumed. is this the same with DRAM and RAM?

I should be fairly straightforward.Switch the PC off .Open the case.The existing CD burner sits in a bay and is connected to the PC by a power (red & black wires) and a flat grey data lead.The data lead connects to the PC by plugging it into a slot on the motherboard but you will not need to touch that.



So swapping the CD for a DVD burner should be a simple as unplugging power & data lead from the CD burner and taking it out of the bay it's screwed into.You then fit the DVD device and reconnect power and data leads.Replace the PC cover.Switch the PC back on and reconfigure the BIOS to recognise the new device.Windows should then recognise it and install any new drivers it mi9ght require.

<answer>



1.  Determine what type of CD burner you currently have inside your tower (IDE or SATA)?



If this is a laptop please let us know.



This is pretty easy, if there is a flat gray ribbon like cable it is IDE.  If it is narrow red ribbon, it is a SATA cable.



2.  Decide if you want to replace the CD Burner all together or just add the DVD burner to the system (some people like to have both).  If you already have 3 other drivers in the system you will have to replace it.



3.  Find a DVD burner based on the information above in #1.



4.  Once you get the drive.  Turn off the computer.  Un-plug everything from the back of the computer and move the tower to a location that is easy to work on (usually a flat service, preferably a table.



5.  Remove the side of the case and locate the current drive.



If you are replacing the drive:



Unplug the current drive from both the power and data transfer cable (IDE or SATA).  Unscrew the  drive and slide it out the front of the case.



Replace the old one with the new one, screw it back into place and connect the wires back up to the drive. -- Your done.



If you are adding the drive:



Change the jumper setting on the back of the drive (I would suggest Cable select if this is an IDE drive.  If SATA just leave jumper as set)



Put the drive in empty slot in the case and screw in place.



Hook up power cable.



If IDE hook 2nd connector of the IDE cable to the back of the drive.
If SATA, plug into open SATA port on motherboard with the cable that came with the drive.



You are done.



Replace side of case, hook back up and let the system boot up.



-- Will watch for any additonal details and will update.  BTW it is always helpful to know the make and model of the computer (if it is a HP, Dell,etc) or the make and model of the motherboard so that we can give you the best information.

Do you need both drives?
With the mains cable unplugged from the PC to avoid the risk of electric shock, take off the side panel and look inside your PC.
If you do not need both drives then simply look at which way round the connecting cables go and replace the CD-RW with the DVD-RW. All you really need to check is that the jumper switch on the new drive is in the same place as the old one. This switch determines if the device is M (Master) or S (Slave) or CS (Cable Select)as long as it is the same as the drive you remove there will be no problems.
If you want to keep both drives you most likely need a new Data Ribbon cable to connect it to unless the HD and CD-RW are on different cables. Again just copy the way the cables fit on the drive in place and add the new DVD-RW as the slave drive to the old CD-RW, check the jumper switch on the back is set to S before you put in.
If you have to add it as a new drive because the HD and CD are on one cable, you need a new cable (IDE data ribbon unless its a SATA DVD drive) and set the jumper to master and connect one end of the cable to the drive the other to the motherboard next to or just behind the one for the HD. Connect the power cables and reboot.

Getting two more Nvidia 8800  ?



I have one at the moment. I want to increase my PC's graphical performance whilst playing games like Crysis/Warhead, or future games like Doom 4, Rage, etc.



Would it be a good idea for me to purchase two more 8800 ultras (for £130 apiece) so that I can achieve my goal? Should I expect to see some very good framerate improvements considering I will have 2.304GB of memory dedicated to graphics as opposed to the 768MB at the moment?



My PC's specs include 4GB of DDR2 low latency RAM, Intel Core 2 extreme QX6850.



Thanks

hi mate



allthough by getting two 8800 ultras would seriously improve the performance of games like crysis and up and coming games however allthough the 8 series cards are pretty good why not buy a single gtx260(http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... which would cost around the same as a single 8800ultra however with improved specs in the gtx260 you will be able to run games without any problems



also taking into consideration the excellent processor and low latency ddr2 memory this will also combine well with the next generation nvidia gtx series



however you may also consider the excellent range of 9 series cards,especially the amazing 9800gtx(http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... from being around £20 cheaper than what you were going to pay for the 8800ultra,its specs are also superior aswell



these include a 738mhz core clock and 512mb of ddr3 memory running at 1836mhz,along with the sizable 256bit memory bus and Microsoft DirectX 10 and Shader Model 4.0 support the 9800gtx also has a "physX" processor aswell,these were once only avalible when you purchased a ageia physx pci card costing around £150 however when nvidia purchased "ageia" late last year they decided to include the physx processor on their high-end cards



the 9800gtx pound for pound is a bettter card than the 8800gtx and taking into consideration the cost of the 8800gtx on release the 9800gtx is around £150 cheaper,making it possible for gamers on a budget to keep up there with the hard core gamers



for example 2 x Asus GeForce 9800 GTX+ (http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... would set you back around £260,this is still significantly cheaper than a single 8800gtx,and much faster



even the mid-range 9 series cards like the BFG GeForce 9600 GT OC 512MB(http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... are excellent purchases,and have some strong specs including a 675mhz core and 512mb of ddr3 memory running at 1800mhz,these are strong specs and a excellent card to be used in a sli configuration



in respect to the graphic cards memory,  2 512mb cards would be more enough and wouldnt affect the overall gaming performance,and with 4gb of system memory and the QX6850 you will have one hell of a p.c



any problems let me know



good luck mate !

Hello,



If you really looking to kick those games in the bucket, I would consider one card. Sli and Crossfire are not 100% transferrable. You're looking at 75-90%. Plus with two cards, more glitches, bugs, and other problems. The best option is one super card.



You can choose the latest nvidia card or ati card.



Right now it seems ATI has the best card out. But you're looking at $550+ dollars for 2gb card.



Here's the link:



http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...



Again, all newest cards have driver issues and hardware issues. It's just a suggestion. You can look at the Nvidia too.

Make sure your computer can run SLI before you spend that money. Two graphic cards will give you more speed in game play. Why not buy the single Nvidia card 200 series, that will work out cheaper and work just the same as two cards. Also it,s important to look at your power supply before installing two G/Cards.

well. it seems like your pc is a pretty good highend one! and you can get the newer series graphics card and replace your 8800. search for GTX260 and GTX280. if you got more bucks, put them in SLI. so double the performance.

sli does not scale very well past two cards I would get 2 GTX260 in sli
and sell the 8800gtx for between £80-£100 to cover the extra cost.
Also in sli the video memory is mirrored you do not add it together

Who's driver do you install for a VGA controller?



After looking threw this site I'm a bit confused. Hopefully this will help other people like me. I know what my PC's  make , model, and that I can get down loads from the manufacture, But a video card was add'ed after (to run some Pc games) for my PC. I also know that I can get download's from the video card maker.



Going into device manager I have a  yellow "?"  in OTHER DEVICES with VGA controller( VGA comptible) in a sub. cat.



"New Hardware found" runs each time I reboot, yet everytime it's unable to find anything.



My question is this who's down load do I download to install so that my VGA controller (driver?) works with the vidoe card , works with the  PC.



I  have : compaq presario Mod# s6300nx, running windows XP, using geforce fx5200 agp card.



If the controller (driver) is to follow the video card maker then does this download I retrieve need to be the latest download for this card or a download from the year that I purchased the card?



Lastly, (trouble shooting note) within the last 4 days I tried downloading from nvida for my geforce fx5200. I saved the download to a CD. later after I  install the information the color on my screen went from the maney colors I had to only like 8 color's It looked like a film neg. I'm at a lost as to what went wrong.

It does sound a bit like your PC is still running from the onboard video card. If you look at the back of your case, does it have one VGA/DVI port, or two? If there are two, one near where you plug your keyboard and mouse in, then it's likely running from onboard graphics. If you hit "delete" on startup, then you should be able to access the bios and turn off the onboard graphics. Make sure you save the BIOS on exiting by pressing F10.

You should be able to download the latest drivers from NVidia and have them work for your gforce fx5200. You shouldnt have to use the drivers from a year ago when you bought the card. (when you bought it, it should have came with a driver and software cd)



Second, I would advise against saving the download to your cd. I would save it to your hard drive and install it from there. During the installation, it may try to extract files from where the install is running from. It may have issues trying to extract and save files to your cd. That could also be the issue with your display looking bad.



(note: i created a download folder on my hard drive, then everytime i download something, i put it in its own folder for easy access)

You need the proper power adapter for your Laptop.  You need to find out what the input requirements are for your Laptop.  Your user's manual should spell that out.  Your Laptop manufacturer should have one on the website that you may be able to purchase.  Don't just use any adapter.  Again, it has to meet the power input requirements of your Laptop.  Then on top of that, it has to be for 220V as it's input for foreign travel.

try to put rubbing alcholol in the back of the disk and rub it, if that doesnt work then you should try to put peanut butter on the back and wash it off good. dont buy those thing that says that it will clean your  disks becuase my friend bought one and it made the disk just worser

Spray them with windex and wipe them off with a paper towel very lightly from the inside outward, NOT in a circle motion! That will make it worse

HPs suggestions will work but only with original pressed CD ROMs and DVD ROMs not with CDRs etc. If they are not originals there is not much you can do. When cleaning CDs & DVDs remember not to clean CD around in a circle, but wipe from inside to outside of CD.

Try to clean the discs,  wash them with water (do not use any soap or detergent) and then dry them carefully with a soft towel or cloth in a straight motion from the center hole, outward.  This might hep your PC to read them better.



The only other suggestion I can think of is that if they are not personal (such as weddings and family albums and family music and so forth), then try to download copies online.

Dude, if you want to use the 5200, you need to upgrade your RAM atleast to 2Gb, If you go beyond 2gb you will feel the experience of 5200, especially when you play Carbon or underground..

I would recommend going higher on the graphics card if you can afford it.  an Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT is only about $80 now and is a decent card.  It may be that your card is out of date.



You might have better luck on your graphics if you roll back to an earlier driver.

Can a Sandisk memory stick pro duo corrupt instantly?



It is an official 512 mb memory card that came with the phone (W800i), all of a sudden the phone froze and would not respond until I removed the memory card - then my PC wouldn't read the card either!



Is it possible that the card is corrupted?
Or
Would it be the phone?
As I say the PC and the phone cannot detect the card.



Can a card like this just all of a sudden wipe all the data on it and stop working?



The card is about 5 years old though.

I encountered a similar problem with a micro SD that came with one of  Nokia's cell-phones.



What happened is we took out the card and when we put it back in the phone would not recognize the card, but the PC did and the card was fine, so we took it in to see what the problem was and it turned out that one of the copper pins were out of place or bent.



but your saying both the phone and the pc don't recognize it, then;



1. it could be old
2. damage (magnetized, cracked, bent, etc.)
2. the phone and the pc pins are out of place (unlikely)

your issue is likely that the internal software included with it to allow the computer to automatically detect and run it is corrupted, and as such is useless. just throw it out - SD cards are really cheap nowadays, i saw a 16gb one - 32x the amount in yours - at newegg for 30$ yesterday.

What type of hardware and software would be needed for an IT Support help desk?



Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Hardware:
*A decent computer : urgent calls require fluent computers, HP COMPAQ computers are ideal for business laptops
*Wireless headset + phone, vOIP = a plus, try helping a client with the phone in one hand and operating the computer with the other
*An extra monitor, so dual monitors can be used



Software:
*A call registerring program/ticketing system/... There's many free online php packages that do this, but this mostly depends on how your helpdesk will work. Can customers report problems via phone, email or website altogether, or one exclusively? You will need to track open calls, submit calls, add comments and perhaps establish a knowledge base for future reference AND for employees that might be hired in the future.
I would reccomend NOT using email exclusively, but a ticketing system. If you'd like to know why, I would gladly elaborate about this via mail (IM_geek@ymail.com).
*A screensharing program, if you're offering some kind of IT tech support. Teamviewer (www.teamviewer.com) is perfect! IT can be used freely or you can buy a license. Commercial (=multiple) use requires a paid license. Fantastic piece of software. I've used LogMeIn, Go2Assist, kVNC, Radmin viewer, etc, but Teamviewer takes the cake
*A program to keep track of remote connection (again, if you plan to offer IT TECH support and need to log into remote servers).
VisionApp Remote Desktop is good, free alternative for this (http://www.visionapp.com/resources/downl...



IT Support is underestimated and extremely, extremely important. Implementing a solution with a client is only half the work.

Need help deciding on new computer?



I am buying a new desktop and i'm having trouble understanding what i need. There's a lot of new stuff out there since i last bought. I mainly use my computer for watching videos on itunes and web surfing. I want this to be like a media center. blue ray player, hi-def, tv tuner w/ pvr. Not sure if i need a really good video card, expensive ram (ex corsair dominator) etc. or is that stuff just for gaming. will a quad vs duo make a difference? Please help with some advice. Thinking of buying from ibuypower cause they seem to have more options.

you don't need high RAM / Graphic card if you don't play computer games



1 GB RAM and any video card would do the work.

get yourself a custom assembled one.
You can get great stuff under 200$ by that method.

If you plan to use it as a media center, it would be best if you had the dual core and a good video card. In particular, be sure that the card has its own onboard memory (and will not be using the computer's memory).



Also important, make sure that the computer has all of the media ports you'll need to hook up to the various entertainment center equipment you plan to use.



You might want to go to your nearest Best Buy or Circuit City and take a look at the options on the computers in their home entertainment sections. Write down the options and then compare with what's available at iBuyPower

You probably had a software update that is now conflicting with the camera. You should install the software for the camera. You can find it here:

its not a problem. 16kb isn't that big space taken by the pendrive. manu pendrives take some mb's of space too. its the system usage of the pendrive. so no need to worry and format the pendrive again and again.

You should have no problems with the hard drive.  With vista you will need lots of memory around 3 to 4 gig. a format will work just fine.  Last think double check your video card is compatible with vista

To me, it sounds like you have a short in your wiring.



No virus can instantly shut down a computer the second you hit a button. If the computer starts to shutdown (in the standard process), then you may have a virus.

However, my guess is that the drive is damaged in some way, and the computer shutsdown as a failsafe to prevent damage to it.



Test:

Start the computer and go into the BIOS (normally by hitting like F12 during the bootup sequence). Once inside, press the eject button on the drive. If the computer shuts down then, you know it is a hardware problem because a virus will not be running in the BIOS stage of the computer's startup. Remember, a virus is a program. Any program can be found and halted.

Carefully turn your keyboard upside down over an old newspaper, then shake it and give it a few firm but careful taps, still holding it upside down get a soft brush like 1 of the previous answers said and brush between the keys. You could also buy a can of 'Air Duster' they are available from office supplies shops, & do the upside down thing again but spraying the pressurised air into the keyboard at the same time. Of course you could  buy a new keyboard, they are really cheap these days.

A new paintbrush is a good answer already given, but some additional steps:
o  With the PC off or locked, turn the keyboard upside-down and bag it (not too hard) on the desk, rapping the four edges, as opposed to the keys.
o  If a few keys are particularly dirty, or dirt's gone behind them, popping them off is easy (other than the space bar, which has a pivot and is a bit trickier to replace). A fine-tip screwdriver or a piece of strong thread are helpful. Just press them back in place when done.
o  A new keyboard may be less than $10 US; if you get another few years out of it, that's not a bad investment.
Thanks for reminding me to clean my own keyboard...
BTW, don't eat or drink by the PC to keep it cleaner and to help it to last longer.

It's a video accelerator card - a very old one!
Around ten to fifteen years ago, if you wanted to play games as well as do work on your computer, you'd plug this card into your computer, connect it to your video card with a cable & then plug your monitor into it.
For 3D gaming, this card would take over & run your games.

It's actually a 4Mb PCI Gullemot Maxi Gamer 3D using the 3dfx chipset - virtually an antique, but no use otherwise!

You'll be lucky! A 60" LCD costs about a £1,000, Plasma about £1,500 to £2,000 and the wall mounting brackets cost around £200/250 just to take the weight.

You would be better off hiring one on a telescopic stand or a projector.

Try this:

1.  Unplug it from AC power, disconnect the cord from the PC.

2.  Remove the battery.

3.  Hold down the power button for 30 seconds to discharge all the capacitors.

4.*  Reinsert the battery.

5.  Reconnect AC power.

Try starting it now.



*If that doesn't work the first time, try holding the power button down for 60 seconds, and/or skipping step 4.



This is called a clean start, but if there are other problems such as the memory in it went bad, then it won't work.

Good luck.

You shouldn't be using IE8 yet. It's still in beta, and is not considered stable.

To erase it, go to Add and Remove Programs in your control panel. On the left, click Windows Components. There you can uninstall IE8.

Where did you get IE8? If you didn't download it directly from Microsoft's website, you were most likely infected with some kind of malware.

ok, do you have everything you want to save, on an external hard drive or cd, dvd, or something? if so, just get out your system restore disk, and clean that baby off and reset the whole compy.  do not download internet explorer 8 anymore, and make sure you don't have viruses, trojans, or worms, or adware and spyware, which could be causing things to go screwy.  if you do, get some software from a best buy or store of the like and install it.  i personally use free ware from pcdownloads.com [look for adware and spyware programs that will be free to use], but some ppl like norton and mcaffey.

When you power on your computer, tap the F8 key. Once your on the boot menu, scroll (using the arrow keys) down to the line which reads "boot with the latest known good configuration".



Another way....

When you computer is at the boot screen, tap the F2 key which will take you into the computer setup. At this screen you wil be able to disable "BIOS".



Once you have done this, save you changes, then re-boot your pc normally again.

Hope this helps.

How can I recover files from a broken external hard drive?



Recently my 500gb external hard drive fell onto the floor and now it is not working. Windows cannot detect it at all and it is making a loud clicking noise (I'm assuming that when it fell the head broke).



Is there any way at all to recover the files on it? Could I buy an identical hard drive and swap the disks around? There aren't any places that fix hard drives in my area so I need to know how to recover the data myself. Thank you.

Yes he should be able to find some hot-spot to connect. But he must be careful as it is easy for someone with the equipment and knowledge to hijack his connect by posing as a host. It has been done many times at airports and coffee bars. Once that happens, all his passwords and details will be compromised. Better to use a secure connection at a hotel and avoid sensitive transactions and stick to emails.

How much ram is recommended for running Windows XP Service Pack 3?



I've just updated my old computer as I'm intending on donating it to a local charity, a friend of mine says that I need to update the ram but I have no clue about anything like that. He has written down the specifications of my old computer, so I'd be grateful if you could tell me how much ram I need to put in, or if there is enough in there already. I can't seem to be able to buy RAM for this system which is pretty annoying, as one of the shop attendants stated it was "SD RAM".

AMD Athlon XP 1600+
256MB RAM  (Capacity is 2048MB)

Cheers for your help.

hi jason



windows xp service pack 3 is just a enhanced version of service pack 2,the main aspect is the hotfixes and updates have been compressed into smaller installations



however as for memory theres no extra memory required for windows xp sp3,and your current configuration is more than enough



as for upgrading your memory i personally think you need "ddr ram" however go to http://www.crucial.com/ and use the crucial online memory tool



this will scan your system and give you a precise report on what memory you need for your p.c,and since this information is produced from scanning your p.c its information you can trust



as for pc shop attendants they are a law unto themselves,you go into a shop with a faulty fan and next thing you know your motherboard is shot and you need a new processor



save your money and contact me whenever you have any problems,hopefully i can save you a few quid ,as i have been in the same situation myself



as for how much to install,well i allways say double your current memory,so 512mb would be a decent amount,however if you can afford the full 2048mb then go for it,the increase in performance will be amazing,and for 2 x 1gb pc3200 modules you are only looking at around £52(http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... thats for the Corsair 2GB PC3200 Value Select (2x1GB)



and thats another reason why it cannot use sd-ram,because sd-ram only comes in modules up to 512mb so 2048mb would need 4 modules



any problems let me know



good luck jason !

I'm running Windows XP Service Pack 3 on my laptop at the moment with 512MB RAM.

Best thing to do is just whack in another stick of RAM, it costs nothing these days. If you can go on the internet on your old computer, go to http://www.crucial.com/ and it will tell you what RAM your computer takes and you can buy more.

If you put in another 512MB, it'll be 768MB and therefore it'll be pretty quick.

Hi everyone, i've got a problem with my new laptop and old printer?



its a new Advent laptop pre-installed with windows vista home premium. i was hoping to run my old hp deskjet f380 (2006 model) printer using a usb cable. i tried installing the software however and error message came up stating that i would need windows xp/98/version 7 etc.  In windows vista network options it does provide an option to connect any printer using a usb cable and windows would 'recognise' the printer - again this didnt work. all that happens is a message appears 'printing in progress' . I've also tried the hp website but couldn't make heads or tails of it- please help.

First uninstall any of the drivers that you installed with the disk. Do this by right clicking on Computer, selecting properites and hardware manager.  Find your printer, double click on it and uninstall the driver.  If you loaded any other programs uninstall them too.  Now, unplug the printer usb cable and reboot your computer.



Next go here: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softw... download the package and install it.  Alsoo on the top of the page it has a button to check if your drivers are correct, you might want to try this before you unisntall the drivers.  It might tell you to plug in your printer, if it doesnt, when it finishes plug in your printer.  It should detect it and have the right drivers installed.  This should work, good luck.

Go to HP's website and download the driver for your printer. They prompt for your operating system, and I have seen Vista listed. Sorry just realised you have tried that. Try harder as it really is simple!

You'll need the vista drivers from HP.  go to the site and search for "f380 vista driver".
Failing that a Google search for the same throws up plenty of sites to D/L from.

When you plug the USB cable in does VISTA give you the option of finding the driver online?

Also try the HP website again.
Do a search for "f380 drivers" and see what pops up.
Look for the Vista drivers.

so a little light turns on , but nothing on the screen?

Try this little trick

Hold the Function key (Fn) and press the key with the picture of a screen/monitor
Tap it once, or twice see if it turns back on

Looks like this 
http://resources.online.nwtc.edu/mediase...

Might not work, but its worth a try

A clean start (ie windows reinstallation) will wipe ALL the files in your laptop

Pull out the ball and clean it and the rollers. This probably needs to be done once every week or so depending on how much you use your computer. Better yet, get an optical mouse.

Hi Will

Dual core means just that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. 2 x 2.4 GHz....Hyper-threading technology

FSB means front side bus and determines the speed of the computer . The Ram should match it as close as possible. Otherwise, what's the use of having this speed if you don't buy the Ram to push it.

Here is a good link to explain this...

Just to add to the above - the idea of cache is all about keeping things in fast memory so that when you need them again you don't have to go off and read them from somewhere else (which is slower).
There are different kinds of cache but it all follows the same principle.

a 2.4ghz Dual Core Processor is two cores running at 2.4ghz each. If it was a quad, then you will have four processors running at 2.4ghz each. Your FSB (front side bus) is how fast the connection is from your CPU to you motherboard. Cache is memory. So it can retreive data qiucker and helps the cpu function better. The same in principle with hard drives. The more cache the better and quicker.

It really depends on the ink cartridges... Some are easily refilled, with others it is hit-and-miss how well they refill.



I have used inks from http://www.inksupply.com on both Cannon and Epson printers with great success.  Personally, if they don't sell "generic replacement cartridges" (Designed to be refilled) for your printer, I've found it to be very messy and has a high incidence of "air bubbles" during refills.

Unless you are using a lot of ink (several sets of cartridges per year, I'd suggest buying them already filled.

Refilling is a risky proposition. Yes it can work for a while, but there is the risk of damage to your printer which is not covered under warranty. Read http://ccs-digital.com/refills.html for more info. If you want to save money, get new compatible cartridges. For Epson try http://ccs-digital.com/ink.asp



For other brands try ebay but make sure they are new cartridges, not refilled or remanufactured, that they include the chip (some dealers expect you to take the chip off your old cartridges. This often doesnt work) and that there is a money back guarantee if they dont work.

Are case fans supposed to come with a set of screws or is that something I need to buy separately?



I bought a couple of Yate Loon fans to replace the two prong Tricool fans in my Antec case, and since I was replacing them I didn't realize until now that there were no screws included and case fans have highly specialized screws I doubt I could find at a hardware store. Do they usually come with screws and should I complain or do I have to find somewhere to buy some?

I'm in the business and have bought 100s of case fans and never got any without screws. I went to Cooler Guys and it appears they want 36 cents for 4 screws thou. Guess those fans dont come with screws. Geez. Try this guy:
http://cgi.ebay.com/Set-of-4-CASE-FAN-GR...
You can buy 2 sets of 4 and shipping will still be 1.50. That's 3.50 total for 8 screws. Also has black for 1.25 a set. Probably spend more than that on gas and sales tax if you go looking for them.

Try this....cut two strips  of GI wire, about 6 inches in length or shorter. Insert the wire into the screw holes and bend the ends to hold the case fans...you save money and you do not have to worry where to buy those screws.

hit start, run, and type "dxdiag" then hit the "sound" tab and it should tell you the audio card your laptop has.  You can then take this info and go to the card manufacturer's site and look up your model.

Does the driver for HP LaserJet 1018 for VISTA provide toner depletion detection?



Well the old drive for Windows XP actually tells you when to change the toner and when the toner is close to running out. The new drive (for vista, not XP) does not seem to do the same thing. This is an issue for me, because how would I know when to change the toner, and when the toner is depleted? Answers are welcomed! The best technical answer gets my 5 points! Woohoo.

I think a clue would be when your pages print in faded black. But I guess with vista you can wait until they come out completely clear.
By the way, I bought a toner refill on ebay for $10 which worked perfectly. I had to drill a hole in the cartridge (I actually melted it with a soldiering iron).

Which is better ATI or Nvidia?



I have a AMD Dual core CPU on a motherboard with a PCIE 1.0 motherboard and I'm looking into thich graphics card manufacturer would be the best. I know what to look for in a graphics card but I don't know if a Nvidia or a ATI is better, ATI is owned by AMD so I would of thought it would be a better choice since I would think it has better compatibility with the CPU, could any1 help me in deciding whether to get a AMD or Nvidia.

I rarely game on my PC however the reason why i would like a Graphics card is because the built in one has some problems with a game I am wanting to get.

Neither is necessarily better, but I prefer Nvidia.

Right now, in my opinion, the 8800GT is an excellent card for most gamers, however Ati have just released the HD4850, which is only a little more expensive, and quite a bit better then the 8800GT.

What I'm trying to say is that its not like one brand is better then the other, they both compete with each other and are a better choice at one time or another. So you need to just make your decision off the cards and their performance, not the manufacturer.

Its the same with AMD and Intel, right now Intel is ahead in the cpu market, but not too long ago AMD was beating them.

So yeah, just check out the benchmarks on each card and judge by performance.

If you want my help in choosing the perfect card then please email me at kesava23@gmail.com

I'm sorry I'm new to stuff like this but from what I've read it seems that Nvidias are "brute force" cards and can run games at blisteringly fast framerates. But ATI on the other hand has better pixel shader and DirectX performance so it would be best if you run PC-hungry games on high quality. I still like Nvidia more because their cards are priced WAY better than ATI cards.

Any graphic cards that meet the games requirements will do.
I have 2 PC, 1 using the ATI and 1 using the Nvidia, I can't see any differences between them when I'm gaming.

Just get the one you can afford and meet the requirements needed.
So, if I were you that rarely game, I would go for the Nvidia 8600 GT or GTS. And in fact, I prefer Nvidia to ATI.

Since you have a mother with a PCIE 1.0 motherboard, you need to get a graphics card with PCIE 1.0 compatibility.  With that you can't fit any common day graphics card.



I recommend buying AMD's motherboard that has great integrated graphics card so you don't need to worry about the hassle.  Here is a link or you can just search 780G motherboard.



If you need more information then read up on amd's homepage.



Please make sure you understand your hardware before you go and purchase something that you then find out is incompatible :)

They are NOT ram cards!  They are memory modules.  If your PC has two slots and you want 1GB total,  you should purchase (2) 512MB Modules.



I would recommend either Corsair or Kinston brand memory for compatiblity and reliablity.  You didn't specify what type of memory you have like SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, so you will first have to identify what type of memory you need before you can get a price.



Check the site below if you need help selecting memory or purchasing memory from.

You need to know the type of RAM and speed. Best bet is to go to http://www.crucial.com and figure out what you need. Or download and install Belarc Advisor from http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html



Then try http://www.newegg.com, http://www.zipzoomfly.com or http://www.tigerdirect.com to see how cheap you can get it. Also check Sunday papers for BestBuy, Office Depot and OfficeMax. They have some good sales. Best brands are Mushkin, Kingston, Corsair, Crucial and OCZ. 
Upgrading your RAM will  really improve your system speed.

Go to the following link, http://www.crucial.com/uk  they can do an on line check which will determine which ram your motherboard supports. They will recommend the optimum amount. You can order on line and although they are not the cheapest it is worth paying for good ram. They guarantee compatibility with your motherboard and give an excellent warranty. I have used them many times and always been satisfied. Hope this helps.

How should I get started with DJing on my laptop?



I've been into DJing, mixing and recording for a few months now and have reached a dead end with vinyl and multitrackers.



What I'm looking for is a programme that will allow me to record tracks (using guitar, mics etc), mix and mash existing tracks and could even be used in a live club situation. I'm no IT-tech, so I'd need to be very simple and I'd probably need a hands on mixer/controller to go with it.



I don't want to spend a fortune (£150-£200) but I want something that's going to work and keep working! I have looked at Ableton Live LE and also the Novation Nocturn for starters. Are these compatible? Will they do the job?



Any help would be very much appreciated!!

Sure, in the past a lot of people switched to PC from Mac because they needed to run programs for work or school that were incompatible with the Mac OS. (this is not a problem now with Macs running Windows on Intel chips)

Also there have been some people who just didn't like the Mac OS and switched back, either they were too used to the Windows environment and couldn't adapt, or (god forbid) they just didn't like it. (again, not really an issue now)

<answer>



It sounds like one of your battery cells might have died over the 3 weeks. If that isn't the case, one of the 3 pins that connect the battery to the laptop might be loose, which won't provide the necessary power to power up your computer.

There aren't really ways of fixing this, unless you open up the laptop battery (recommended you don't). And if you do buy a laptop battery, you might want to know that a battery is left best in a room temperature of around 20-25 degrees celsius, at a 40% charge. That's right, don't leave a laptop alone on full charge, otherwise it WILL stuff up.

I'd say you're all wrong. Those numbers may mean 172, 16, 1, 254 in binary, but that doesn't necessarily mean "172 bytes". It just means "172" that could be bananas or square feet of carpet or feet of detal floss...

I believe the correct answers would be 1, 1, 1, and 1. Each of those strings is made up of 8 bits (a 1 or a 0) and those 8 bits together each equal 1 byte. It doesn't matter what that 1 byte is.

Dang. Mr. lci types faster than me ;)

And to the guy who said there are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte, well, THERE'S a question to pose to find out "who is good with computers". The answer is actually 1024.

You've got this all wrong. There are 8 bits in a byte so here are your answers:

10101100= 1 byte
00010000= 1 byte
11111110= 1 byte
00000001= 1 byte

Don't forget if the last bit (on the right) is a 1 then it's an odd number.
Do you know how to convert bin to hex?

WinAVI Video converter is fast, but I've just had probs with it and submitted a question myself. Video DVD Maker FREE is, incredibly, free (unlike most) and you can download it from their homepage videodvdmaker.com. It's slow and simple but I've had good results before with it. Once you convert the avi file you need a burner like Nero to make a dvd that will work on any normal player. Hope you get it sorted, I've been driven daft trying to work this out before myself. Hope this helps!

ok sounds like your screen resolution needs to be adjusted right click on an empty area of your desktop and select properties ....go to the settings tab at top right of the display properties window that will pop up and look for a slider that's called screen resolution slide it to the right until it fits your needs (i recommend 1024 x 768 for most people) also check your color quality make sure its set at least 16 bit then click ok at the bottom and your all set.

If you cant adjust any of these settings or they just keep reverting back you will need to reload your video driver you can find one at the manufactures website.

Hope this helps

The extra module you added may not be be compatible with your motherboard or with the other stick. This will cause your computer to run slower, and may even cause hard drive corruption. I would do a memory test scan with memtest '86, or some other memory testing program, and if you get a lot of errors, its a compatibility issue.. Usually when i buy ram for anything, I write down the part number of the ram that's in the computer already and then look that up online. This way you know its compatible.

Usually if the printer is cheap they make it up by ripping you off on the ink. Dell gives away their printers because they get you on the $40 cartridges. Lexmark has $29 printers which use $40 cartridges. So if you spend a little more on the printer, you'll more than make it up in ink savings.
 As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson CX5000 and have had no down time since.
All name brand ink is expensive, but you can get cheap new replacement cartridges for Epson (not refills which I never recommend) for under $5 at http://ccs-digital.com/ink.asp



I have been using these for years.
The CX8400 scanner/copier/printer was on sale at circuitcity.com for $60 with free shipping. It uses 3 colors plus black.
The NX400 which uses the same cartridges is on sale at Staples for $75.
The RX595 scanner/copier/printer also prints on DVDs. It uses 5 colors plus black and has even higher photo quality. It's on sale for $80 after $55 instant rebate.

Yes, just put your BT disc into your laptop and follow the instructions as normal. If you have wireless connection on your BT HUB and wireless on you laptop, then choose this option. But make sure you have the symantic security downloaded as well. That is if you are using phase 2 or 3 on BT broadband.

You will have to plug it in to your BT hub. Do you still have the BT Disc and code if so load it then call BT home help on 0800 800 154 and they will set up the laptop on auto wireless for you. once this is done you can unplug the lead and put it back in the PC. You will now be able to use both at the same time. Oops for got to tell you make shore you turn of the security on the laptop and don't forget to put it back on when BT finish or they will not be able to share on line

Hi J,

Laptops have been coming down in price steadily recently, which means you can get some great spec machines for a lot less than you would have done in the past. Around your budget of £500 you can get some very decent machines which would easily replace a traditional PC.

The one thing you lose with laptops however is the ability to upgrade the components after purchase as this can either be very difficult or very costly. While many would consider this a disadvantage, a laptop has so many advantages, such as size and weight, that can easily be overlooked.

As an example here is a very good laptop at £449.00:

The Toshiba A300D-13X is a powerful machine, it comes with the superb AMD Dual Core processor that has a 2.0GHz clock speed. It also has a massive 200GB Hard Drive and 2GB of memory making it perfect for a whole host of activities. This machine will happily perform the day to day tasks while giving you the ability to use high demand applications if needed.

It is one of the best sellers in its range and price.  Toshiba laptops are very highly rated and are great value for money.

Hope this helps you to find a laptop.  Let us know what you choose!

It just resets your BIOS to factory settings. FSB speeds etc. You'll notice no difference if you never played with it.

Drop your computer on the floor a couple of times, and it would be disabled. Will Youren taught me that method

*P.S. Other functions might also be disabled via that method, so think about it, but it is guarantee to disable the enlarging function

Also, u should wait for other answers or methods before you try this one. This should be your last option...

Hope this helps

Can you install a 2nd internal sound card in a Gateway M-Series laptop if the original is on the motherboard?



Laptop was plugged into an old mixer sound system via the headphone jack and although there was no big shock or anything, just a big hum after the connection was made, it blew our soundcard, even though everything is up to 100 with nothing muted and so on. We reinstalled drivers and troubleshooted to kingdom come but then realized the soundcard was shot. Original one is on the motherboard, so I'm wondering if anyone knows if there's a slot for a second internal one on the laptop and how to do it. Most informative answer gets best.

mentioning the brand and model of printer will definitely help!!!
2 things
1. did you remove the transparent plastic protector? delete all documents currently in queue and try printing again. if the same result, do #2 below then try again.
2. you may need the latest software/driver downloaded and installed. get it from printer manufacturer's website and make sure it's the version for your MacBook operating system. if you can't find the one for your MacBook then it's going to be tough but still doable. (let us know)

good luck!!!

How many prints can i take from one black cartridge of EPSON STYLUS C44UX ?



I have bought one cartridges from third party. I had printed about 50 pages. When i was printing i needed to unload the page and cancel the printing job. Than after my printer showed me red light which indicate that i had to reload new cartridges and i cannot print with only one cartridge. when i shake cartridge it leaks ink from it. do i need to bring new carridges? can any one tell how many pages can i print from one cartridges?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It will depend on how much text is on them! If you only print a page with two lines on you will print out more per cartridge than if you print full pages.  when a printer says that the ink is low this is not always the case as there is still ink left so only change once it no longer prints properly as you could be throwing away ink.

This usually happens on most computers, you just need to know how to troubleshoot it. first look in the system tray for the "remove devices" icon, click and remove them all, then unplug all your usb cables, then restart your laptop and when its loaded up, plug them all back in again, this may or may not work, but its just a fault with microsoft

Have you reset the ink levels in maintenance and sent them to the printer. If not the printer still thinks the catridges are still empty therefore it will not recognise the new ones.

I've answered your other question as well but having seen this one it is clear that you did NOT reset your printer -unplugging it is not resting it.



Try this:
1 Put the cartridge in again.  You will need to really force them in until they click - this takes a bit of force. You have to sort of put them in at an angle then straighten them up. It should then take the carage over so close the lid of it. It should then make loads of noises and stuff but should then stop and this can take a few minutes. If the cartridge is accepted it will be ready to work, If not, then start with step 2.

2 If step 1 did not work you will need to reset it.  Resetting is NOT unplugging it or turning it off.  If it needs resetting then there will be an orange light on over under the B button on the right.  The on/off light should also be on and this is green.

3 If this orange light is on then you need to reset the printer by pressing the SMALL button on the bottom row of  3 buttons. The resert button is smaller of the 3 and this has a red circle with a triangle in it and 2 black slash lines up above it.  Hold this button down until the orange light goes off.  Your printer WILL then be reset as that button IS the reset button.



4 If that does not work you either have a faulty cartridge or a faulty printer and if new or under a year old you will have to take it back to where bought for either a repair or a refund.

hi eric



not being a expert on webcams but on graphic cards the benchmark for seamless gaming or in other words when you cannot see the frame change is 50fps,so taking that into consideration i would imagine its about the same with a webcam



however in reality the human eye can really only handle around 35fps,thats alot of frames to get into one second,and is planty good enough for most webcams



so i would say between 35fps to 50fps



good luck eric

Dell Dimension 3100 Desktop PC?



My little brother is starting his BA Computer Game Programming after summer and am thinking of getting him a desktop PC.

Got my eyes on a mint Dell Dimension 3100 on ebay but not sure if it's good enough for the course. Can any experts out there give me some advise? Is this a very old model? With a 15" flat screen + mouse + keyboard, how much should it be sold?

Infos:
Intel Pentium 4 Processor 521 with HT Technology.
2Gb memory (2 x 1Gb Crucial cards).
a Philips 16x DVD+/- drive.
SigmaTel Audio soundcard
Comes with graphic card but only basic

If I am to use this as a base & upgrade different parts to an acceptable lvl (better graphic card + hard-drive etc.. any more?) about how much will I need to spend?

a million thanksssss!!!!!!!

Avoid anything with a slimline case, as you would then be restricted to half-height/low profile graphics cards, should you choose to upgrade...
The link below (Dell 3100 manual) reveals on page 65 that the motherboard does not have an expansion slot for a  graphics card.  Normally, you would expect to find a PCI Express x16 slot (possibly even two, three or four) or an AGP slot on an older machine.  The Dell 3100 appears to have only a PCI Express x1 slot plus two PCI slots.  This will be a substantial obstacle to a graphics upgrade - although PCI and PCI-Ex1 graphics cards are available, they will not provide performance on a par with x16 cards, and their scarcity will make them disproportionately expensive.

A purchase direct from Dell is likely to include a 19" monitor and not mentioned in your description - an operating system.
I'm only guessing, but I should expect that a current degree course would require Vista rather than XP.



I appreciate that it would feel good to spring a surprise present on your sibling, but I recommend that you canvas his views on the proposed purchase.



There may be some requirement imposed by the course which might otherwise be missed, and which might prove expensive to resolve after purchase...

Dell might be a good one-stop shop in the event that there is a requirement for a printer and/or scanner - but don't forget to compare prices immediately before purchase.



And avoid slimline cases - wherever you shop!

RAM is also called primary memory. It's primary because on the motherboard, it sits right next to the CPU (the brains of the computer).
When you open a program, the program instructions are fed from your hard disk into the RAM modules. These instructions are then queued up, like customers in a Macdonals restaurant, waiting to be processed by the CPU.



Video memory, or VRAM as it's also called, is memory that is allocated for rendering graphics and images (stuff you see on the screen, durr). Some computers don't actually have VRAM (VRAM modules are seen on Video cards), so they use part of RAM to compensate.
You may see some cheap budget computers that are advertised with "Shared Graphic Memory" or "Shared VRAM". This means that the some of its primary RAM is being used as VRAM.

Virtual memory is a computer system technique which gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous/continous working memory, while in fact it may be physically fragmented and may even overflow from the RAM on to disk storage.



Let's suppose you only had 25 megabytes of free RAM available. If you opened a program and it requires 50 megabytes of RAM, and you only had 25 left, the remainder 25 megabytes is queued on the hard disk. Thus Virtual memory 'fools' the program into thinking there is more RAM than there actually is.

Preferably not.
It probably wont effect you too much but the general rule is that the longer the computer is running, the more crap is shoved into the memory and it will slowly get slower (especially if you are playing games). If you turn it off at least once a day you will get a nice clean start.

Personally, if you are leaving it for more than an hour turn it off. It only takes 2 minutes to turn it back on.

To open a new window in Safari, you can either do [apple symbol] N (for a brand new window) or [apple symbol] T (for a new tab).



The [apple symbol] may not be on a new Mac; it's the square sign with circles on the corners.



To maximize the Safari browser window, you can resize it with the corner sizer (lower right), or just click the green button in the upper left.

Any window you click will come to the front. This is a nice trick: You can slightly minimize all open browser windows with function (fn button) and F9. Then click the one you want to look at.

This is only if you are using Safari, so if you don't have it you may want to download it: http://www.apple.com/safari/download/

If you want, you can download Internet Explorer for your Mac, and it will make it easier on you for internet tabs:

Help with cartridge changing on a Canon Pixma MP210 Printer?



I have just changed my ink cartridges on my above printer for the first time and the printer is not recognising that there are new ones installed. I have performed a printer reset to no avail. Any suggestions? I'd appreciate it.... Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks for your replies, can I add..
1. There is no official reset button on the MP210
2. Unlike my old Canon printer, there isn't an option in maintenance to reset the ink levels.
Thanks to both for the advice below anyway..

I have this with my Canon MP 220.  Turn off the printer and then turn it back on again.  If the little orange light comes on, this on your make will be above the B button, press the reset button until it goes off. If that does not work take the cartridge out and put it back in and then repeat. If that does not work call Canon who I found very helpful when I spoke to them.
Edit
Yes there is a reset button or something equivalent to it - on mine it is a little circle with a red triangle inside a circle! See the link below as it might help if not I will try to find more!http://printer1.blogspot.com/2008/04/res...

2nd Edit
This YouTube shows someone changing the cartridges and if you look on the right hand side panel at the bottom there are 3 buttons.  Two are bigger and are the buttons to specify what color you want to print in and the little button next to it is the reset button.  It is this button that you press for a moment until the orange light goes out.  That is how to reset them as I have done it.  If the taking the cartridge out and putting it back does not work Canon will be your best hope of solving this problem.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyT6JsD0o...

Have you reset the ink levels in maintenance and sent them to the printer. If not the printer still thinks the cartridges are still empty therefore it will not recognise the new ones.

i got the same cpu the lower the number the newer the cpu...basically its down to miniaturization

45nm is half the size of 90mn so it stand to reason there is twice as many microswitches in the 45nm cpu as there is in the 90nm cpu

hence twice the power.... typically 90nm cpus are dual core 65nm are high end dual/treble core & 45nm are quad core

These are the width of the circuits or highway lanes for traffic that Intels and AMD CPU's are. 45 nanometer width circuitry is the thinnest one available today and is used on Intel's newest and best processors. The reason Intel has moved from 90 nm to 65nm to now 45 nm is because if they still used 90 nm circuitry they could not fit all the processors inside their microprocessors in such a small area.

It depends on the spec of your laptop and printer.  If they both have blue tooth or wifi, then you can do it already.

If not, you can get a USB wifi module for your laptop then a wireless print server for your printer.

By DS I suppose you mean Nintendo DS - first off, this device wasn't really built as an MP3 player so you can't just put music on it without first buying some sort of peripheral. There is such a thing as a Nintendo MP3 player but judging by the reviews at Amazon, it isn't the greatest bit of kit around.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-MP3-Pla...
The alternative is to get some sort of R4 card as they are known (google Nintendo R4 for this one). This allows some level of customization including playing music if you have the right software installed. 
Personally I think you may be better off with a small MP3 player - they don't cost too much and will probably give you better quality sound.

The following sites all claim to have a Windows Vista driver for the Mustek BearPaw 1200 CU Plus scanner.

I don't have a BearPaw scanner so I can't comment on their suitability.  (Mustek themselves don't seem to have a Vista compatible driver.)

For sure you need to increase your RAM - top of the range games - at least 2 GB of RAM needed.

CPU processor could be faster too and a more up-to date graphics card - basically you need an overhaul.

It depends on what kind of games that you want to play.
1.60GHz is sad,512mb ram is kind of low & it sounds like a built in video card so it's not enough either.
Too be honest you need a new computer.
If you can't get a new computer a new video card with at least 256mbs of ram should help.
My vid card is only 128mbs but I have almost twice the processor & twice the RAM that you have & some games like COD4 still won't run on my comp.

Boost your RAM. You've got a good chance you can double operationspeed for a low cost if u go on ebay, even cheaper.

Frame Rate refers to &lt;b&gt;Frames Per Second&lt;/b&gt; a term to measure speed at which content is 'streamed' to your computer.
If this is the case, you may also find it beneficial to scale up your internet connection a couple of notches. Again, not very costly. Check with your ISP.

These are the steps I would take before expending any serious sums of money.

Hope this helps.

You're going to need a new motherboard, CPU, RAM and most importantly, a better video card.  No offense, but your Mirage card is basically crap.

If you've got an AGP8x system, you could get away with replacing the video card, however, that won't last you for very long.

I see flashes of light on screens that others don't?



Sometimes when I watch something on any type of screen (Desktop PC LCD, Laptop, Plasma TV, Car Screens) at certain times I see flashes of light. The colors are different every time and it lasts for less than a second but nobody else notices it. Is there something I should be worried about?

You may want to see an optometrist very soon because this could mean a defect in your eyes ( form cataracts to minor tumers ).

Generally TV's have a refresh rate, they flash at 60-120 times per second. If you look away from the screen then you can easily see it ( flickering ) in most monitors/tv's. It could be a minor issue in how your eyes perceive the image as well.

hi it sounds as though your seeing the screen refreshing, if you look or focus on something behind the screen then you'll notice the flashing or screen refreshing is more prominent, this usually indicates the screens refresh rate is set too low and can cause eye strain and headaches, and needs to be changed, more below on this

Inkjet printers use ink cartridges while laser printers have a whole bunch of different parts and basically burn the image to the paper.  Laser printers are more expensive to buy, and the replacement cartrigdes are as well, but they last much longer than ink jets.  What type of printer you buy depends on what kind of quality of printing you need or want, how much you are willing to spend up front.  The higher cost of the laser jet will pay for itself over time, depending on how much you use it.

Laser are cheaper to run if you have a lot of printing to do but cost a lot more if you want to print photos to any reasonable standard.

Inkjets are slower and more expensive but print to a much higher standard.

I use a Laser for letter and prints of internet pages and an inkjet for photos

So if you mainly print just a few letters then the inkjet is best for you.

INKJET:

Inkjet printers work by spraying small amounts of quick-drying ink through a nozzle onto a sheet of paper; tiny deflective plates alter the ink's path to create the desired shapes.

Ink is stored in disposable ink cartridges. Low-end inkjet printers use three ink colours (cyan, magenta, and yellow), and usually black as a fourth, compared to a "photo printer" that will have anywhere from a 5- to 12-colour ink system (e.g. light magenta, red, blue, or light cyan). Because a business user may print certain colours more frequently, single-colour cartridges have become more common, as you only need to replace these individual tanks as needed.

Pros and cons:

"Inkjet printers offer outstanding photo and document quality at a great value," says Justin Joseph, spokesman for Canon's printer division. "With features such as automatic double-sided printing and individual ink tanks to limit wasted ink, inkjet technology has really grown for the business consumer."

Another advantage to inkjet over laser is they can be used on all types of paper and enjoy quality that rivals your local photo mat; this is why inkjet printers are more ideal for photos than laser printers.

While inkjet printers are relatively inexpensive (as low as $50), be aware replacing ink may become costly as you'll burn through these cartridges faster than laser printers.



LASER:

Laser printers apply lasers to an area of a photoconductive drum. The electrical charge causes toner particles to cling to the rotating cylinder, forming a shape that will be transferred over to the printed page through heat and pressure.

Multi-pass colour laser printers use one imaging drum repeatedly for each CMYK colour (cyan, magenta, yellow and black). A faster solution, however, is single-pass (a.k.a. inline) colour laser printers that contain four imaging drums, allowing the page to be printed in just one pass.

Pros and cons:

Laser printers are ideal for producing high volumes thanks to the high-yield inks, plus they are faster at spitting out documents than inkjet printers. If you only need black-and-white printing, consider a monochrome laser printer over an inkjet printer. Other advantages to laser printers include high-volume paper trays, multiple finishing options, and more network options than inkjet printers.

But laser printers cost more than inkjet printers. A decent monochrome laser printer typically costs about $150 on the low-end (add another hundred or two for a good colour laser printer), which is considerably more than a photo lab-quality inkjet printer. It should be noted prices for colour laser printers have dropped considerably over the years.

An inkjet printer



Uses Ink to mark the paper, has to have ink cartridges. Is cheaper to run than Laserjet. Ink jet printers are best suited for home use.

A LaserJet printer



Uses lasers to mark the paper, has to have a toner which is alot bigger than cartridges. The toner is bigger and more expensive than cartridges but lasts longer. Laser jets are quicker at printing than ink. The paper is dry straight away. The laser jets are bigger printers and are best suited for offices.



I work in Staples and we sell many different types of printers and office Equipment. 
I would suggest Lexmark if you want it to be wireless.
If not go for the Epson DX8400 or any DX/SX series. The DX8400 can copy scan and print good quality photos.
The ink is cheap compared to HP and comes in individual cartridges meaning you can change one colour at a time. In the set there are 3 colours and 1 black all for £24. 
You also don't need to use the pc and can print Straight from a memory card.
We have had no complaints and I recommend Epson DX/SX series to all customers as it can cater to everyones needs. The DX8400 changes its price frequently due to demand, but it never goes over the £100 mark.

<question>



Printers have stopped working. Do I change the USB hub or cable?



For a few years I have been happily printing with 2 or 3 printers connected to a 4-port powered USB 2 hub at the end of 5 metre passive cable.

Suddenly, a couple of weeks ago (actually not long after I installed Nokia PC Suite 7) the printers decided not play ball. Prints would often fail completely or print out a line of gobbledygook or even print the top inch or so of a page before giving up and spewing out the paper. But the USB system still recognised that they were there and bleeped when unplugged.

One of the printers failed completely, so it has been replaced. I now find that if I connect printers directly (i.e. by avoiding the hub) they work - even by putting an A-B cable in the end of the 5m run. Connecting through the hub, neither of the printers wants to know.

Could I expect them to work if the 5m run were an active cable? Or is there a special type of hub that I need to install?

Incidentally I have swapped out the hub and used a different 5m cable (passive; I don't have an active one). I have even connected up to a different computer. It also makes no difference. Neither is there any difference if I go through an external hub at the PC end of the 5m run or connect it straight into the Mobo USB ports.

I am doing my nut because everything I have tried fails - yet the system has worked perfectly for a long time.

Is it hub? Is it cable? Or is it something else. Grateful for your views!

"PC" merely means 'Personal computer'

Your mac is in fact a personal computer. YOu mac runs on intel chips, it is no different than your freind's computer using windows (well, his isn't monopolized by steve jobs)

Assuming you meant mac vs windows. Well, they're both insecure and unstable, macs are slightly less so. "PC"s have more hardware options, and are lower priced. And if you're using windows or linux, you have more software available.

There are more than 2 games in town. There's hundreds of varieties of linux, there's FreeBSD, Solaris, and other unix and unix-like systems, reactOS, etc.

But anyways, which do I think is best? Linux. It serves me well, and I'm owned by no one

Hello,
It all depends on what will be your use.

I personally own a MacBook and I really love it. 
But in a MAC you wont get the freedom to choose different softwares and hardware which you get in PC.

I chose MAC because I wanted the power of linux and the multimedia experience of Windows at the same place, and I found a MAC to be powerful enough to handle my requirements.

Hope this will help you to decide which one to choose.

It depends on what you're lacking. If you have 1GB of RAM, you're fine on RAM. You can upgrade your processor to an AMD Dual-Core 2.4GHz for $60. You would see a huge difference there.

Where can a university student find a decent laptop?



I'm going off to university to do a computing course and I need a laptop with at least 2GB of RAM, roughly 2GHz of processor power and at least 100GB of hard disk space. An nVidia or Radeon graphics card would be a bonus too. Trying to spend less than £500. Anyone know of any?

Hi Neonxiv,

I would have to disagree with some of the people that have responded so far and say for £500 you can easily get a laptop that will feature all that you want from it.  Laptops prices have fallen greatly over the past year or so, and there are some great bargains around on new and refurbished machines.

For example the HP DV9823EA, it features: 2GHz AMD Turion processor, 3GB RAM, 160GB Hard Drive, NVIDIA GeForce 7150 Graphics Card and a 17" wide screen display. It is perfect for gaming, watching movies and will suit all your university needs as well and priced at £499.99 including delivery.

Or alternatively the Dell Inspiron 1318 is also £499.99 including delivery and features a 1.86GHz Intel Core 2Duo processor, 2GB RAM, 160GB Hard Drive and Intel Integrated graphics card. It does only feature a 13.3" screen, but can used with a TFT Monitor to get a bigger screen size.  The advantage of this is that at 2.28Kg it is lighter and more compact than the HP.

Both laptops are incredibly stylish and come with Windows Vista Home Premium edition, and of course they are both wireless enabled, allowing you to get online wherever you are.

If you are looking to spend less and will consider a refurbished machine we have some great offers on these but stock is very limited!

I hope this helps you make your decision, good luck whichever laptop you choose and good luck for your time at university!

Ok try to look for a good RAM(Random Acess Memory) higher the better for your graphics, depending on which games try to get a large video card, such as a 1gig nividia cheapp but still food at games like halo or whatever. Your also gonna want a good monitor and try not to get windows vista, it takes up much more ram than needed.

Along with ink hardening in the print heads which can really only be prevented with periodic draft prints and/or printer self head cleaning, very infrequent use can also lead to the ink hardening inside the ink cartridge as moisture escapes through the vent hole, to combat this you could try covering the vent hole(s) with a piece of tape or similar when it won't be in use for a long period.  Although I'm not sure of the ramifications of this it may be worth a shot if you'll eventually end up having to replace the cartridge anyways.

Just run a test page every three or four weeks. You could also run the head-cleaning facility at the same time.

Print something in BW and Color every week.  Run the head cleaning utility every other week.  You'll waste a little ink, but not as much as you waste by throwing out cartridges when they're only halfway through their normal yield.

If you go for another inkjet printer, you need to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the frequency of printing or you'll end up with the same problem again. Keeping the printer in a cooler environment might help.

Also if you leave your printer on all the time, you can create a scheduled task to print a test page at pre-defined intervals in order to minimise the risk of the nozzles/jets getting blocked, potentially saving you money.



Just open Notepad and enter the three lines of text shown below. Substitute printer name with the Windows name for the printer



REM PRINTS TEST PAGE 
rundll32 printui.dll PrintUIEntry /k /n "printer name" 
EXIT



Save the file eg as testpage.bat



Next open the Scheduled Tasks folder (in the Control Panel) and Add Scheduled Task. Browse to where you saved the file and click Open. Next choose Weekly {as most manufacturers suggest that you print something at least once a week} and then click Next. Select the time you want it done and on which day of the week. Click Next and you will be asked for the password for the user it is running under. Once completed click on Finish.

All of the previous suggestions are sound, however, if you get to the stage that you forgot to print test pages etc. then pop the cartrdge out, and with preferably a lint free cloth, soaked in WD40 (yes, the oil stuff!), carefully clean the head, as WD40 "melts/disolves" the dried ink, then ensure all the ink has gone, wipe it clean of oil, pop the cartridge back in, a test page or two, then you're good to go. Well, it works for me

Good luck in whichever method you choose

Did you say you have (two) ATI Radeon HD4870 ? Or (one)-2X ATI Radeon HD4870, cuz 2 would be overkill. Your mem is very good, the cpu could be a little better but def. good enough, power is very good and i would def. get 2 SATA hard drives and use 1 for gaming. Oh and make sure you have a very good and fast response time monitor or els it's all pointless.
Hope that helps, "and keep on gaming in a free world" Good luck.

It sounds great. A Dual Core such as a Wolfdale ( E8xxx ) can easily beat a quad core for gaming though. Since each core is faster by over  1.2GHz or so and most games don't know how to read quad cores so you should change that if you can.

Other than that it's fine, looks awesome.

[holds up big red flag]

you cant put two ati cards into a sli motherboard. you need a crossfire motherboard to run two 4870's.

So you might want to  revise the motherboard or look at nvidia cards to fit it instead of the ati's.

[puts flag down]

Also a better gaming cpu would be an e8600 or an e8500. Its a common misconception that a slower clocked quad will beat a faster clocked dual, but this is not true and by using the quad you will lose a lot of fps. That quad is only a good choice if you need the machine for tasks like video encoding. Otherwise, if your priority is gaming, the dual is the better choice.



Apart from that its a fine build.



best answer please.

I'm installing McAfee on my new PC but it only reaches a certain point?



After the process installs somewhat, it halts at a point where it says:

..Remove Incompatible Software

Then it lists one program, Norton Internet Security 2008

Ok so this is a new Vista computer and I'm used to XP. How do I remove the program? I have gone to Search - and typed in Programs and Features, where nothing appears so I simply type in Programs and then deleted Norton files.



Albeit, I can't continue with the McAfee installation (seemingly Norton hasn't uninstalled yet), why is this?

I don't understand Vista.



Please help trusty computer nerds, thank you.

Laptop batteries have a limited amount of cycles they can go thru until they start to loose progressively the amount of charge they can hold.

1 cycle = 1 discharge and 1 recharge. Laptop batteries are usually good for 1000 cycles, so depending how often you go thru cycles will determine the life of your battery.

I've heard Batteries Plus ( http://www.batteriesplus.com ) can sometimes rebuild laptop batteries. This might be an option for you. It will cost half the cost of a new one and will work like new.

Also Andrew H mention a memory issue, this is only true with Nicad batteries which you may have... However, nowadays, laptop batteries are made with Lithium Ion ( check the battery to see which kind you have ), if it's lithium ion ( should show up on the battery as Li-Ion ), there is no memory effect and you don't need to worry about it.

However just remember the cycle thing I talked about above.

If you charge your battery when it's half full all the time instead of waiting for it to be empty, your battery will die twice faster.

Also, one good advice to expand the life of your battery, when it's full and you intend to work for a long period of time, just plug your laptop to the wall and TAKE OFF the battery so it doesn't overcharge and die prematurely

The battery has a memory on it so you should always run it dead before you charge it. Lots of little charges makes the battery life go down and after a period of time the battery will no longer work. So yes its time for a new battery.

4gb of RAM to run 64 bit version of Vista?



Hello,
I was wondering if I really needed 4gb of RAM to run a 64 bit version of Vista.
I checked the Microsoft website & it said you needed to have 4gb of RAM, I mean this is a little over the top, anyone have personal experience with 64 bit Vista & less RAM?
The computer I'm getting has 2gb of RAM & I want a 64 bit version of Vista, will this cause some sort of conflict or make it run slow?
Also what are so advantages & disadvantages of having a 64 bit Vista compared to a 32 bit Vista? Is there really a difference at all?
Thanks.

Having a 64-bit OS will let you access the full 4GB of RAM.  If you only have 32-Bits, you can't actually use 4GB of RAM.  You can buy it and install it, but your computer can never store anything in it.  How much you can use depends on a number of factors but can be as low as 2 GB.

Also, if you want to use a 64-bit OS, you need to make sure your computer really supports it.  Most computers with Vista 32 on them will actually not be able to run the 64-bit version due to having only 32-bit chipsets on them (this doesn't mean the CPU which is likely to be 64-bit).

Microsoft lists 1GB as the required RAM for 64-bit Vista.

I have run 64-bit Vista Ultimate on 2Gb of Ram.  What I think the site is trying to tell you is your bes to get 64-bit edition if the computer comes installed with more than 4Gb of Ram, because 32-bit is only supposed to read up to 4GB of Ram.

It will work fine though.

You incorrectly read the specs.  You do not need 4GBs of RAM to run 64-bit Vista.  However, 4GBs of RAM will only show up as 4GBs (instead of 3GBs or so) if you're running a 64-bit operating system.

Currently there really is not advantage to having 64-bit Vista unless you have 4GBs of RAM or more so you can use all the RAM.  There are just no mainstream 64-bit applications out that can take advantage of 64-bit computing so you're going to see all the 32-bit applications running in 32-bit emulation on a 64-bit OS.  When 64-bit applications become more widespread, then you'll see a difference but right now the two are virtually the same.

dont take hte battery out.  When it gets charged fully, it stops charging and it relys soly on the AC Current.  and as long as you have a Chillmat under it, it wont hurt.

regardless of brand, make, model, type of computer, leave it on for as little time as possible. Use it when you need to and power down when you don't. In so doing you save energy, prolong life of components, and extend the period for which you don't have to maintain (clean) certain components (from dust, hair, fur, etc.). Also if your laptop is not protected from surges/spikes, turning it off and unplugging it from the outlet will decrease its chances of going to the grave sooner than designed.So if I were you I would not abuse it too much for trivial tasks as seeding, etc...get a desktop for that. Laptops are expensive so I recommend you take care of yours very well.

This will surely fix your problem

Please follow exactly and IN ORDER.

1. Turn off the printer and wait 10 seconds. Turn it on again

2. Let the printer print the test page.

3. After the test page is printed, disconnect the USB cable connecting the printer to your computer. DO NOT turn off the printer while disconnecting the USB cable.

4. Place the test page on the scanner glass and press the SCAN button on the printer. The ON light will flash as the page is being scanned.



5. Remove the test page when the ON light is steady.

6. Finally, turn off the printer and wait another 10 seconds. Then turn it on again. No more printing test pages! Yay!

(You may now reconnect the printer to your computer via the USB cable.)

Has this LCD monitor blown?



Hi,

A few days ago I was around my sisters house with my nephew and without anybody realizing, he was playing with the plugs, turning them on and off. My sister went to turn her computer on and the Asus LCD monitor doesn't work. Could this be that it's blown or just a fuse has gone? If the monitor has blown, is there a way to fix it or would it be too expensive and be easier to buy a new monitor?

Thanks for any help.



</question>



<additional details>



Fixed the monitor now. I opened up the plug and noticed the fuse wasn't pushed in properly, did that and connected it to my MBP to test to see if it worked and it was fine.

Thanks for all the help ^_^

Check the fuse first and put the monitor on another computer. If it still doesn't work then I would say you owe your sister a new monitor and the nephew grounded for a week!

Any monitor doesn't like it electrics turn on and off rapidly. It's the quickest way to blow them. And no it's too expensive to repair. Cheaper to buy a new one.

This may sound like a daft question but have you checked the plugs?
The Screen is probably connected from the mains plug to an adaptor, then from the adaptor to the monitor, then there is the VGA cable from the PC and the monitor to check as well.
don't just look at them, unplug them and replug them back in again, as daft as it sounds it sometimes works. what looks like a good connection is not actually good at all.
If it is not plugs then if it has an adaptor is there a green light on it? If yes and it is not lit you can get a new one, if no then you can test it with a multimeter if you have one. 
Set the Multimeter to 20V, plug in the adaptor. You put the live test terminal inside the mains adaptor pin (Red cable) and the Negative terminal (black one) on the outside and you should get a voltage reading of whatever the adaptor label says it should be. It maybe 12v, 15v, 18v they are all different.
Warning do not allow the two test terminals to touch each other when the live is inside the pin, you may get a shock, you will damage the adaptor and possibly short the house electrics as well.
you need to teach the rug-rat that playing with electricity will do more than just make his hair curl!

Can you explain these technical / brand names please?



I'm fine using computers, but I don't keep up-to-date with things like processors, storage devices, graphics cards and all that.



Anyway, I'm thinking of buying a new laptop (a desktop is not practical for me at the moment) but don't know much about processors and stuff. I'm looking to spend under 600GBP so nothing too fancy is necessary.



With all the models offering different processors (Celeron, Duo, Duo extreme, Core, etc etc) I have no idea what's decent. What sort of processor speed will last me 4-6 years? I use my computer for web browsing / movies / downloads / using my ipod / basic publishing / text docs and occasionally a bit of photoshoping.



Oh, and I'm happy to run Windows, so (sorry Mac lovers) Macs don't really appeal.

Recommendations / information please technically-minded folks.



Thanks in advance.

Well, I'm the same way as you. I generally hide myself away from the computing world then come back and do a marathon of research to find the parts I want.

To be honest, if you generally don't game, anything not extreme will suit you just fine if you don't want to pay a fortune. "Extreme" processors usually are the ones that give you an extra 5-10% performance boost in video games for an extra $100-300. Celerons are notoriously bad for gaming, but for most applications are fine. Duos are in between. Most of them should be dual-core, but for anything that doesn't involve gaming, you don't even need that either.



Good luck.

Any dual core CPU will do fine so ignore all those processor names...

A 7200 rpm hard drive will be the largest factor in making you laptop seem decent.

RAM is ultra cheap these days so 4 gig should be easy to find

What might be harder to find is a dedicated graphics chip but it's the next most useful thing after making sure you have a 7200 rpm hard drive. Run away screaming from any laptop with an Intel 3100 in it or an ATI 1250 or NVidia 7150 etc - they are all old and slow and use "shared memory" which steals RAM from windows to create a double whammy of a slowdown.

4 to 6 years is a bit optimistic I think for a budget unit. Batteries have a limited lifetime too. Some brands have a more solid construction to last that time such as Dell XPS line and Alienware and with the Dell Lattitude E6400 ATG being extra rugged...

4 to 6 years is also an eternity (like doggie years) in terms of computer specs. Laptops are already much slower and less performant in 2008 compared to desktop units so you are starting off that 6 year clock with hardware that is maybe 2 years behind current desktops. It's probably easier just to figure on 2 to 3 years but you could get more into the 6 year ballpark with a fully upgraded Alienware unit that would be a leap past your budget.



On the other hand they will still probably be trying to get you to buy 1998 graphics perormance 6 years from now in the form of an Intel 3100-Super-X-Extreme-Turbo that steals even more system RAM...

hi phil



there are two catergorys to consider when looking for a laptop,there is portable and desktop replacement



portable concentrate more on portability and uses less powerful components to extend battery life,however modern portable laptops still use intel core 2 duo processors but normally at lower clock speeds(1.6-1.8ghz)



desktop replacement laptops are a different story,they are designed as the name implies to replace your current desktop pc



so since a desktop replacement will be hooked up to the power supply most of the time manufacturers can afford to use more powerful processors and decent graphic chips,plus desktop replacements have desktop sized displays with 17" screens



however from your personal requirements you really need something inbetween these two catergorys,and a excellent example is the mesh ASUS F5SL (http://www.meshcomputers.com/Default.asp... is a allround capable laptop with the following specs :
 Asus F5SL-AP016C 
Genuine Windows Vista™ Home Premium 
15.4" WXGA TFT with ColourShine (1280x800) 
Intel® Core™ 2 Duo T5550 Dual Core Processor (1.83GHz, 2MB L2 Cache, 667MHz FSB) 
1024MB ATI Mobility™ Radeon® HD 3470 Hyper Memory Graphics (External 256MB VRAM) 
2GB DDR2 667MHz Memory (2x1GB) 
250GB Serial ATA Hard Drive (NB) 
DVD Super Format Dual Layer DVD Re-Writer +R/-R/RW/RAM 
Built in Multi-Format Memory Card Reader 
Wireless LAN - 802.11b/g (on-board) 
Built in WebCam 
Built-in Intel HD Audio with 3D Stereo Sound + Dual Internal Stereo Speakers 
4 x USB2, DVI, Line-in, Mic, Headphone, VGA, S/PDIF (F5SL) 
Free Carrying Case & USB Mouse 
2 Years Worldwide Warranty Parts & Labour - (Collect & Return in UK Mainland)



as you can see with a Intel® Core™ 2 Duo T5550 Dual Core Processor and 2GB of DDR2 667MHz Memory this is more than enough for the everyday tasks you will be doing



also you may consider the Gamer Xplorer X5-2900 Notebook(http://www.cyberpowersystem.co.uk/system... and as the name indicates this is in essence a gaming laptop



however i have recommended it more for its specifications such as the GeForce Go 8600GT 256MB graphics adapter and the : Intel® Core™ 2 Duo Mobile T5450 Dual-Core Processor



check the rest of the specs:
 DISPLAY LCD: 15.4" WXGA TFT LCD Display Max: 1280x800 Pixels
CPU: Intel® Core™ 2 Duo Mobile T5450 Dual-Core Processor @ 1.66GHz 667FSB 2MB L2 Cache 64-bit
MOTHERBOARD: Intel PM965 + ICH-8M Chipset Mainboard
MEMORY: 2GB (2x1GB) PC5300 DDR2-667 SODIMM Memory (Corsair Value Select or Major Brand)
VIDEO CARD: Built-in NVIDIA GeForce Go 8600GT 256MB Video
HARD DRIVE: 160GB 5400RPM SATA150 HARD DRIVE
OPTICAL DRIVE: 8X DVD REWRITABLE DRIVE
SOUND: BUILT-IN AC 97 SOUND



so which is better?
 i personally think the Gamer Xplorer X5-2900 Notebook has the edge however check out the links and do some research before deciding which you like



any problems or advice let me know



good luck phil !

Just a little pointer for you - if you get a vista machine, make sure it has at-least 4GB of RAM. What I mean is get a 4GB Dual Core. A 2GB has 1GB on each side which is not enough. A 4GB Dual Core has 2GB on each side which is the recommended minimum for running vista at a good speed.

Computer not booting/starting...?



Today I removed a plug from the surge protector the PC was connected to. This caused the pc to restart (WTF?!?) and it hasn't started since. It doesn't even make it to the bios screen.

About an hour ago, I got it to go to the bios and boot one HDD (I unplugged it then plugged it back in) with xp, but it wasn't detecting the HDD with vista. I kept switching the sata cables, (trying to get it to detect the vista HDD) and now, once again it doesn't boot into the bios or start to load windows. Unplugging and replugging doesn't work anymore.

HELP!
No beeps, HDDs spin and fans spin. I've tried removing the ram and using them 1 by 1.



</question>



<additional details>



I unplugged the excess HDDs and only had the working HDD plugged in. Now I got this "DISK BOOT FAILURE" error.



Okay,
Somewhat figured it out.
The vista HDD was causing it to freeze. It's hooked up but the bios and OS ain't recognizing it.



I'll figure what's wrong with that tomorrow.
Using xp for now.

yes. you can probably actually replace the screen and it should work fine. But if your laptop has an outlet to use as an additional moniter, you can easily plug it into your new computer or tv or another moniter and then connect the computers via network and transfer all the necessary files.

Well, what you're asking is complicated so unfortuntely you have to look into some of the 'nerd' stuff that comes with buying a computer.

Any computer nowadays is fine for email and surfing the web.  You can do that with any Pentium system currently sold.



Where you've taken the BIG leap into nerd territory is gaming.  Current games require insanely high-end PCs (especially to run in Hi-Def as you stated).

Here's a basic PC that will handle all your day to day needs (surfing, email, word processing):  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...

But HERE's the most entry level thing you could buy for playing current games (Crysis, etc):  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...

And the gaming PC I listed would still be obsolete in a few years...

The more powerful a computer, the more power it needs. If you get a very weak PC, you only need a small power supply. If you have a top-of-the-range one, you need a more powerful PSU (power supply unit). For those purposes, get a ready-built PC:

New computer with 3Gb Ram but only 4.5 Vista Experience score?



I have a brand new Packard Bell I-Media X2415 desktop with 3Gb ram (a 1gb and a 2gb). However my vista experience rating is only 4.5, based on the number of memory operations per second.

I have seen people with scores over 5 with only 2Gb ram - does this mean the PC is just loaded with rubbish components or is there an explanation? Maybe there are problems because the two rams are of different sizes?

And how reliable is Vista Experience as a means of testing your computer's potential performance?

The reason you have such a low score is due to your configuration.  I am assuming these are DDR2 memory, well in order to get the dual channel support you have to install them in identical pairs.  In other words you would have to install 2 1GB modules and 2 512 mb modules for your 3 GB, if I were you I would just buy another identical 2GB module to pair up with your other and take out the 1GB module.  This is the configuration you should have and most companies install when they sell 3 GB systems. You never put DDR2 memory in as single modules, you have just basically halved the bandwidth and speed of your memory because you have lost the dual channel support.

I know this from personal experience since I tinkered with different configurations of memory on my Vista computer and then did some research to find out why I was having the same problem.  Older memory that didn't rely on this technology didn't require you to install in pairs of course even older technology required you to install in quads. (30 pin simm modules)

It's not the quantity of the RAM, it's the quality. Just because you have 3 Gb of RAM doesn't mean that it's going to go super duper fast. You need to get _good_ RAM to go really fast. The clock speed and the timings have everything to do with the speed.

It might just be the fact of the computer and it's hardware.

Some computers do tend to perform better than others, even if they have the same or better stats. I have a friend who has the same stats as my PC (which is 1gb), but his is WAY faster than mine! It's probably just the hardware is not the most sophisticated. I could be wrong of course ;)

If your using 3-way SLI on the GTX 280 you need the bigger SLI bridge.
If you eventually run 3-ay SLI with GTX 280's you going to need a 1200-1500 watt power supply.

Using a GTX 280's in a 2-way SLI configuration is possible to. You would use the smaller SLI bridge

A toner is a fine powder used in laser printers and copiers instead of ink. Actually it is a form of dry ink. How to buy - write down the exact model of your printer (look at the information on the back) (do not try to remember it - one letter can mean a difference) and take it to computer shop. They will help you. A bit of warning - toner can be expensive (see my first link).



You WILL need to buy the toner for your printer. Before that (it will not help for long!!!!), try the following if you have to squeeze that few pages:
1) Open your printer (should be very easy, do NOT use ANY tools to do that) to get hold of your toner cartridge (rather large, black container), take it out without using excessive force (again, should be very easy to do) and shake it vigorously for a few minutes in every imaginable directions. Do NOT touch anything that is covered with a flap of plastic. Just use the handle on the package. Toner cartridge is light, so you will not have any problems with it.

2) Put your cartridge back, close the printer. This operation should give you a few more printed pages (maybe enough to last for a day or so).



CAUTION! If some powder spills (I have never seen that happening), do NOT use anything hot to wash it. COLD water is the best.

1.  Did you install the drivers on all 3 computers?

2.  Are they all running the same version of Windows?

3.  Did you try through Network neighborhood to go to the printer and right click on it and choose "connect"?

-- Will watch for additional details and will update then.

**Update**
I'm sorry for the confusion.



Personally I have found that if you download and install the printer drivers on each computer you have less issues than using the run command to print. (especially if you are running different versions of Windows).

When you go into My Network Places and you click on View Workgroup Computers.  It should show the computers in your home network.  Double click on the one the printer is attached to and you should see the printer (with the name you gave it). Right mouse click on it and click Connect (sometimes this automatically install the drivers if you are using the same version of windows).

Also if you go to Epson's support page it may have step by step instructions on how to set up your printer on a network--that is what I did when I was setting up a Vista Notebook.

It should simply work without the drivers, my external drive enclosure just plugs strait in and installed with the windows drivers and works.

just plug into the USB when computer is fully loaded, and then wait for it to install. a little tab and a icon should come in the bottom right 'windows has detected a mass storage device' or something like that. then just wait, it could take a while to install, just make sure it is powered on and dont disconnect it untill it is installed.

For general all round home use.  I don't expect it to produce 5,000,000 sheets a day, but I do expect it to still be working 2 to 5 years later.  There would be some photo printing, so consumables -especially ink cost- are a factor.

Hi Capt. Rachel,

With £100 to spend there are literally hundreds of different printers available and sorting the wheat from the chaff can be difficult, Of course while there are some that are not as good, there are also many that are very high quality.

Printer prices have seen dramatic reductions in recent months, but the one thing that remains constant is the cost of inks. This is the same across all brands, with some manufacturers offering individual inks while others offer single multi cartridges. The outcome of this is that they all cost roughly the same, with Epson perhaps a little cheaper for colour printing.

The Epson Stylus DX7450 Printer, Scanner & Copier. This all-in-one printer saves you space and money. It has a very high print resolution (5760 x 1440 dpi) has a digital card reader integrated and is Pictbridge ready so you can print straight from your digital memory card. It uses four individual inks, 3 colours and one black. And at £79.99 it very well priced.

Another option is from Hewlett Packard. The HP Photosmart C4280 is also an all-in-one Printer, Scanner & Copier, but also has the added feature of being wireless ready, meaning that if you have any wireless ready laptops, or PC's or even a wireless network, you can connect to the printer from anywhere in the house without a cable. It prints at a resolution of 4800 x 1200 dpi and also has a integrated digital card reader and comes Pictbridge ready. The HP uses one 'tri colour' cartridge and one black. The price for this model is also £79.99.

Both these machines are ideal for general home use a will deliver high standard prints in colour and black & white, while the scanner and copier features are handy and make it nice and compact. They also both come in under £100 making both great value for money.

Hope this helps in your search, let us know what you decide to buy!

If you reinstalled your operating system (windows ?) you will need to reinstall your audio drivers. To see if they are installed go to control panel then sounds. select the sounds tab then highlight one of the sounds with a speaker icon. the play arrow should turn black if it doesn't your drivers arent' installed if it does turn black and you have no sound when you click it, its your hook up

MP510 printer scanning help!!!?



hi, just today i was scanning some photos on my canon mp510 printer and saving it to my pc, i have about 5 pictures on my pc from everything i have scanned and are very small in size, but just today i got a message saying insufficient memory when i try to scan the images. its nothing to do with my computer because i have a lot of free space!

What do i do!

<answer>



Hi
Cause



Action



Output Resolution set too high.



Restart the computer, decrease the Output Resolution setting, and rescan.



For details, refer to the Scanning Guide on-screen manual.



Your computer's hard disk does not have enough available space.



When scanning large originals at a high resolution, an error may occur if there is insufficient hard disk space. Check that the hard disk has sufficient free space, and rescan.



When scanning large originals at a high resolution, the progress bar may stay at 0 % depending on your computer. Set a smaller scanning area or a lower resolution, and rescan.



You have multiple devices connected to the USB ports of the computer.



Try disconnecting all other external devices except this machine.



your output resolution may be set too high

Yes it matters you need to consider its power needs etc but most importantly you will need to know if it will fit on to your motherboard old boards dont have the slots for new cards..

Old mother boards usualy have an AGP graphics slot
Where as the new graphics cards are going to PCI-E slots

Yes

Your computer will need to have the right expnasion slot on your motherboard. I would assume that as the graphics card you are looking to install is quite new that it would be PCI Express, you need to make sure you have this expansion slot on your motherboard or you wont be able to plug it in

Also be ware, its a Dell!!! They would have dont everything possible to ensure that if you did ever want a new graphics card that you would have to go through them first

Your PC has an AGP 4X slot - the 8400GS is not an option.

Whilst there are AGP 4X cards still available, the graphic on the link below shows a peculiarly truncated card - it doesn't extend beyond the rear of the AGP slot.
I suspect that this is because if it did, it would foul the hard disk drive cradle. I'm basing this on the graphic in the second link, but you will be able to check this for yourself...

If there is a length restriction, then you could consider moving your HDD into the  floppy drive cradle... even if it means removing the floppy drive (who needs it?). 
IF (that was a big if) you can remove the HDD cradle AND that leaves the rear of the AGP slot unobstructed - then you can now investigate what AGP 4X cards are available...

[Edit]: OcUK have a 256Mb GeForce 6200 at £27.01
and a 512Mb Radeon 2600 Pro at £58.74
Performance-wise, these cards bracket the 8400GS, but the 6200 will make less demands on power - Dell's PSU (in keeping with the rest of the system) does not allow much scope for upgrading...

You can check the RAM from the system properties. Just right click on the My computer icon and select system information.

if you use your computer to perform basic operations, a 512 MB RAM is more than enough. If you are a hardcore gamer and have the need to run complex softwares, get a 1GB RAM and you should be all set

That sort of depends on your operating system. If your using Windows XP, 1-2 gb of ram is usually enough (unless being used for intensive gaming).



If using Windows Vista you could use 2-4 gb of ram to get it to run smoother.
Keep in mind, if your version of windows is a 32 bit version it will only run a maximum of 4gb combined ram (shared between video card, ram, etc) where as a 64 bit version will be able to utilize more than 4 gb.

Run the programs you normally have running (Outlook, IE, FF, Word, etc) or load your favorite game that may be having performance problems.



Click CTRL+ALT+Delete. Go to Task Manager. Click on Performance.

You want to make sure that you do not use more than 60 percent of your Physical Memory. So for me, I have 1.5GB of physical memory. I do not want to use more than .94GB used. Right now I am using .38GB so I am good to go!

If you go above the 60 percent, you will start queuing programs. Basically information will be standing in line to be processed by the CPU. Additionally, the program will start trying to push information to your page file (on your hard drive) which is 1000s of times slower than physical memory.

What are you doing when the computer is running slowly?



Surfing the Internet delays usually have NOTHING to do with your computer, they have to do with your ISP.

If you configured Norton wrong, it could be running a Full Scan while your trying to use the computer.  You should schedule the Full Scan to run late at night, right after you schedule Symantec/Norton to download new definitions.

By the way, Symantec/Norton is an EXCELLENT choice to use as your AV.  You want to use a Paid For product.  The reason why people think AVG and AVAST are because they are VERY poor at Real Time scanning!

Dell Inspiron 5100 Laptop turning on problem?



I was downloading  wireless software and I got an error and I shut off the laptop and try to restart it but since then I am having problem turning on the laptop. I turn it on and I hear noise and see green light but after 15 seconds I see a flash on screen and laptop shuts off. I have checked battery and AC adapter. They are ok..

Few days ago on someone's advise to check memory module at the back of laptop I just opend the cover of Memory module and I was trying to take them out but I could n't but when I press there I guess the chip and power on the laptop the same time ,my laptop turns on. Since then if I have to turn on the my laptop, I have to open it back and press memory module and turn on power it works.

I don't know much about the computers. Can I fix this problem without spending too much money?

Can someone help me with that?

That sounds odd, double check the memory modules are in properly and if there are any loose screws tighten them LIGHTLY. and avoid touching metal against circutry.

You can take it in for an inspection, they take maybe an hour or two and cost anywhere from $20-80 depending on the store.

i got warranty from bestbuy, and found out that it does not cover problems with viruses or computer meltdowns, i basically paid 400 dollars for nothing....if you do want warranty i suggest you get extended warranty from hp itself..good luck:)

Its simply not true that Macs don't get viruses. They are also about twice the price on a price per performance basis, and only have about 0.5% of the amount of software available for them that Windows and Linux do. Indeed if you use OPne Source, then they have almost no software available for them. Hopeless.

Which? consumer reviews rated all major brands and of the non Apple ones (Apple were indeed reliable)  IBM/Lenovo was the most reliable, followed by Sony, Dell, Toshiba, Compaq and HP in that order.

In fact HPand Compaq are the same company.



I have heard horror stories about Dell (from Dell employees). Most IT companies I have worked for will only use Toshiba or HP/Compaq.

The main thing with a laptop is to remember they are much less reliable than desktops, are vey expensive to repair - so it can make sense to buy an extended warranty. But buy it from the manufacturer, not the shop - its about 1/3 the price.

Most Laptops will last 4 years.  At that point the Motherboard goes. On a Mac, because the components are selected to run faster and cooler, it is not unusual for laptops to least 7-10 years

A lot of people make the mistake of when comparing  PC to a Mac of not comparing the correct hardware.  In truth, it you compare the quality of the parts and a PC (not a lot of people understand the difference in RAM for instance), you will find equal pricing.  If you couple that with superior performance, better Matte Screen and 64 bit OS that can use all 4 GB RAM if needed as opposed o 3 for Vista or XP.I think you have a winner with a Mac.  The most popular model is, by far the MacBook.  The top of the line is the MacBook Pro. Mac can run leopard and XP or Vista if you want.



Vista and XP run quite a bit better on a Mac than on PC with the OS pre-loaded.  It also runs multi-media much clearer than Window

On my  printing status it shows me all the things I wanted to print and it says-Printer Ready. And when I click resume at the top, but it says connection error.

Changing Pc keyboards?



Yeah hi,



How often do you change your keyboard? Do you keep the current one in good condition / clean or just buy a new one every few months?
I notice most keyboards (even the expensive ones) seem to lose their lettering & wondered what users generally do.



</question>



<additional details>



I’m really surprised at answers. I change mine every few months because I get bored of styling and everyone can pickup fairly decent quality boards for as little as £4. Interesting. Thanks all. Theres no particular correct answer so leaving to vote

I haven't changed my keyboard on any off my computers since i got them...
I try to keep it clean, by just using common sense really... i mean, it's not very smart to use it with greasy hands, or to drop crumbs or drink all over it...
And my keyboard letters are still in perfect condition and i use mine ALOT and have done for the last year and a half...

It could do with a bit off a clean though as there are some crumbs and stuff under the keys, but that only takes like ten mintues...

That's Argos for you!  I had trouble with printers from there.  I have this same model and mine works great but sometimes it gets slanted as I have loaded the paper in wrong.



Have you  taken the paper out, tapped it together and put it back in and made sure you have not overloaded it? If overloaded then sometimes the printer grabs more than one sheet and this then jams it.  So, tap it together, then fan out and re-tap it and put it back in, and, as the person above said, make sure that the page gauge is up close to the paper as this keeps it straight and stops it sliding about.  If it still does it take it back and tell them it is not fit for purpose and they have to either give you another one or a refund.

Go to here:
http://www.epson.co.uk/
You will find the drivers and support section on the right half way down. You can download drivers directly and install them from the comfort of your own home! I've used it before,it's dead easy. Just choose your make and model from the pop-up menus. I checked; your model is listed. (also, you'll get a newer driver than the original on the CD)

Is there such a Mutli Bluetooth Headphones?



I would like to know if there is such a device (as the idea just came to my mind and I would like to know if it is available in market or not,).



A device that transmits Audio wireless to multi headphones. This means, the device could be connected to any other device with Audio output (either analog or digital), so that more than one bluetooth headphone could be receiving that Audio. Example of that: five persons watching a movie, and each one using a bluetooth headphone, and all those headphones are connected wirelessly to one transmitting device, which transmits the Audio to all of them. The device could be connected to any device through the Audio output or some other plug possible.



Please, if you know any such products, list their names and links to them.

I had a logitec once but it was a pain to position anywhere. the cable was stiff and would move the cam.  Pick the one with the better mounting.  It needs a clamp that you can stick it on something.  Ones that sit will not sit where you want it.

What graphics card should i get?



I just got a new HP desktop, great specs all around, except the video card.  It's apparently an integrated video chip (Nvidia Geforce 6150SE nForce430)  I'm having trouble running games from Bejeweled 2 to Warcraft 3.  If it is the vid card (i'm pretty sure) what would you recommend that is functional for decently high end games but with a limited budget?  Also, how can I make sure I even have the slot for a new video card?  Thanks

Sad thing is that you need to have a power supply rated at 550W for most of the newer more powerful cards today, which adds to the budget thingy...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  This is a good card that doesn't require additional power...  Also it will fit very well in your HP case...

To make sure you have a slot for your video card, click the link below to see the slot for your video card. It should be a PCI-E x16 slot. I think that the ATI 4850 should be suitable for you , maybe the Nvidia 8800 or 9800 is suitable you too.

Installing E7200 Into Dell Dimension 9200?



So i had a Dimension 9200 w/ a core 2 duo E6300. Now i bought a new E7200 and want to upgrade it.



1. Can my Dimension 9200 use this E7200 cpu?
2. When i install it, do i need to go buy thermal paste? or can i just use the old one.
3. Anything else im forgetting?



Note: i tried to put it in without the old thermal paste really quick to see if it would boot up. Right when i tried to turn it on my Dell CPU fan blew at 100%(which it never does). So i turned it off right away. And noticed it didnt boot. So After i add the thermal paste to the cpu, it should work right?

My Portable Hard Drive will not be read?



I just bought a 500 GB hard drive and a NexStar.CX enclosure for it. I put the hard drive in like I was supposed to, the power works, the machine seems to be running fine, but when I put it into my computer nothing popped up. I put it in my G drive but my computer wont admit there is something there. I can remove the program safely (yeah, that stupid little bubble comes up just fine.) but I can't actually get into it.

if i were you, i'd keep itunes on your comp and keep the song files on your hard drive. perhaps you need the program saved on your comp since the external hard drive is only meant to store files and not play them as media files.



if it still isnt working right, then take your receipt to the guy that helped you and ask him to exchange it because apparently it's not working correctly.

If it was November 12, I would wish you a happy birthday. What's that go to do with anything?  Anyway, if you are thinking of upgrading your RAM, I would recommend looking at the RAM sticks that are already in your computer. Be sure you shut the computer down and unplug everything from it before you open it though.  Also, buy an antistatic wrist strap from Radio Shack, Best Buy or some computer store and wear it before you touch anything inside your computer. Don't want to fry any parts by shocking it with static charges you know.  Then, push down on the little white or black levers on both sides of the RAM stick and it will pop up.  Now you can see it better.  It should say the PC number, storage and frequency on the stick.  If it doesn't, write down the make and model of the stick and look that up on the maker's website.  It will tell you there what the specs of the RAM are.  Then, find RAM that matches the PC number and frequency.  You may find that you can get RAM sticks that are compatible with multiple frequencies.  These sticks will "downclock" to lower frequencies depending on what motherboard they are plugged into.  For example, some 3333 sticks are compatible with motherboards running RAM at 2700.  If you get Kingston brand, it will say right on the package what other frequencies it is compatible with.  With some other brands, you will have to check the website BEFORE you open the RAM package to see if they will downclock to the frequency you need.

No, there are many variations --  for DDR RAM there are 266 MHz, 333 MHz, 400 MHz and more 'overclocked' speeds.



There are also differences in physical size -- DIMM, SODIMM, MicroDIMM -- and in configuration of the memory on the module -- Non-ECC, ECC Registered, ECC Unbuffered, density: 4 chip vs 8 chip vs 16 chip, and other parameters.

Eh phones aren't made that well, especially the more complex.



You just have to do it, there is a problem with your firmware which cannot be fixed except for reset. Best you can do is transfer your files onto the computer if you can or to someone else's phone.



If the navi wheel is broken, then it could just be an actual defect in the hardware and it's broken.

What kind of fan for my graphics card?



I have a Geforce 8400gs with a noisy fan.  I tried using oil but it didn't help so now i need to get a new fan for it.



There are a lot of different type fans out there but i don't know what kind to get.  All i know is that mine is the type that clips onto the card.  I don't know about size or voltage i need which will be compatible with my graphics card.

DIMM Stand for Dual Inline Memory Module, And then there was SIMM, (which was the older generation of DIMM) which stand for Single Inline Memory Module.

Installing my radeon 4850?



ok this may sound stupid, but how do I install this card? my asus manuel doesn't give good enough instructions. I can't put the card in the pci ex 16 gen 2 slot. But how many power connectors do I have to hook to the card itself? The adapter thing that hooks into the  card turns into 2 power outputs to hook up to something. Is one just to hook up to the power supply cord, with the other one just being like an extension or something. Or does this thing have to hook into the powersupply twice?

no you need to plug 2 of those 4 pin power plugs in which are called molex connectors and the instructions your looking for should have came with the card not your mobo. the new GPUs use alot of just i had to use 4 of my molex to power my 9800GTX

Laptops are a real hassle to upgrade.
Your graphics cars might even be soldered to your mobo.
Check your computer's stats online... maybe you can get a computer shop to upgrade your graphics card, but you'll have to pay the price.

Yeah you can replace it,



just open up the computer, unscrew the graphics card and remove it, and then go and buy a graphics card, and insert it into the computer , then screw it in place and install the drives that are on the disc you get with it,



if you are after a cheap one get an ATI Radeon xpress 1250 or Xpress 200



if your a serious PC gamer then get an Nivdia Geforce Graphics card

My computer has suddenly stopped playing DVD's properly. Help!?



I've only had my comp about 2 years, all DVDs I've tried playing on it have played fine so far. I bought a brand new DVD recently, after not having played a DVD on my comp in about 2/3 months, I tried it out, I used about 5 different programes to try and play the same DVD but it started and than it stopped, flickered, smudged/smeared across the screen, paused for ages. I tried with some other old DVD's (that used to work on my comp) and a similar sort of thing happened. I thought the lense might be dirty/dusty so I bought a lens cleaner and tried it out, but no change, I also exchanged my new DVDs (just incase they were faulty), but no change. Somebody told me to try this (where it says "click here" under the quick solution) http://winhlp.com/node/10 and these are my DMA results: http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/9021/...



http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/9251/...



Those pictures above are only for the 'first' IDE channels, I also checked the others, and on the second option for the Primary IDE channel it said Ultra DMA Mode 5 next to the current transfer mode and on the third option for secondary IDE channel it said Ultra DMA Mode 2 next to the current transfer mode.



After all that, I tried a DVD again, and it seems to have worsened, now they won't even start, they just load and than the screen freezes and in the task manager the progam appears as "not responding".



I don't know what to do =( Please, try and keep answers simple and easy to understand, I'm not too tech savvy. Thanks in advance for any help, I will choose a best answer for the response that helps me solve this problem.

I had the same problem. For me it got so bad that it would not detect DVDs at all.  Try to put in a different CD such as music. Then whether it plays or not, try a software CD.  If the music CD and the software CD runs,  it is likely that your DVD lens in the drive was damaged.  For me, all the places I checked said that I had to replace my CD Rom drive.



I hope this helps.

It has nothing to do with DMA. If you leave a DVDROM unused for sometime, it develops that tendency not to read anymore. It simply needs a lens cleaning. Go out and find a good DVDTOM lens cleaner and use it.



And also try using this program.

vista doesn't recognize some Drivers like creative or ... , you have to go to Microsoft site and see the list of marks and if your webcam mark was in it , you have to download the driver. so it will be ok



the other problem that i guess you have is , i think you have some same drivers like TV CAPTURE CARD or ... . in this case you have to go to your program option and see input driver , and change it to your webcam driver so the blue Screen ( NOT GREEN) will be disappear and you will see your own face. That's it.



(But I have a experience , you know whenever i install my webcam , i have to be careful that it doesn't  interrupt or i have to close all programs. any problems or interruptions , can do something that it will never install until i format my system , and again install it.)



GOOD LUCK

USB 'cards' can be inserted into a motherboard slot inside the tower.  Then (after the metal plate is removed from the backside) the actual USB slots (or ports) will be accessible  in the back for plugging in the device.
The cards run about  $15 and up, with 3 or more slots.  Look in walmart for quick solution; internet for best bargains.

Like the others said, a USB hub is an easy external way of adding more ports.  In addition, make sure you get one that supports USB 2.0 if you are planning to use it for a high bandwidth device, like a hard drive, or flash drive reader.  This of course matters only if your computer supports USB 2.0, which is common for computers of about 6 years old and newer to have.  USB 1.1 is much slower and should be avoided unless its just a mouse and keyboard you're plugging in.

OK, so find your Powerpoint and open it. Plug in your flash drive. Then in the Powerpoint window go to File, then Click Save As. There will be a bar at the top of that little window that says where you're saving it to. Click on the drop down arrow and go to Removable Disk (and the letter of your flash drive). If you aren't sure which letter it is, just try all of them until it opens up your flash drive. Then  once it's opened and everything, click Save and you're done!

Do you a PC?  The USB slot is probably in the front of the CPU.  If you have a laptop, it'll probably be on the side. Slide the Flash drive into the slot and when you open up "My Computer", you should see an addition drive (usully F:).  Just transfer or save the file to that drive, just like you would transfer or save it to a folder.

1.  Any ASUS brand Motherboard
2.Quad Core Intel (AMD is way behind so stick with Intel)
3. huh?  graphics card?  sound card?  Get and Nvidia Card (8800gtx would be suffiecient for the games you listed)  soundblaster X-fi sound card.
4.  Samsung Touch of red 21" or bigger widescreen.  Got it and Love it.
6.  Power supply? DVD drive?  Cooling?  RAM? (get 4gb)  Hard drives?

well you cant just buy these random parts in the hope theyll be compatible, first of all youll need a case, the size of the case will allow you to choose a motherboard, the motherboard will then allow you to choose a cpu as only certain motherboards are compatible with certain cpu's, also the RAM will have to be compatible with your motherboard (DDR DDRII and then different sizes of that!) also you will probably need a new PSU, if you want a custom built pc i would reccomend you buy some barebones from a site like novatech or ebay, these will be mainly compatible and you can begin choosing parts from their.



reccomended specs:
dual/quad core processor- 2.6ghz+
RAM 3gb (more than enough)
Graphics card 256mb ati/nvidia
PSU 500 w minimum
a couple of high grade fans
asus motherboard ( you will have to check the compatiblility code in the description of the motherboard to get a compatible CPU)

Problem with DVD burning, help!?



I would like to burn .avi files to a DVD. Just as a backup, I don't want to play them on a DVD player, or anything.
I remember being able to do this perfectly well a few years ago with Nero, but now it wants me to burn them as an "image", then takes ages to "burn" when actually it doesn't do anything to the DVD, it's empty.
What could be the problem?



Shall I use another program? Which one?
Help!



</question>



<additional details>



Maybe it's soemthing to do with the writer? If I put an empty disc in, it makes tam-tam noises for ages and no window comes up.
When I try to drag-and-drop files to the DVD, they just appear as "ready for copying" they don't get copied.
Next step?

I found some people opinions about the troubleshooting of computers.



They are so quick to buy another when the problem can be easily fixed!
I don't understand the easily resolved problem being basically wasted and done away with.

Maybe you could purchase, repair, and re sell them.

Because the masses are ignorant, and prefer easy straightforward solutions that require very little effort or thinking on their behalf. It's not like most of them can't learn how to do simple things, they just don't want to. Besides they get suckered into "deals" and advertising, and the great American Consumerism lifestyle. It's a great way to make money though! :-)

If the card was not detected and the "Restricted Drivers Manager" did not offer to download a driver for it, try using the "Envy" script here to detect and download one:

Help with a  decent trance production setup?



im new to trance music production. although i know the sounds that should go into a trance music(after analysing pros like PvD AvB etc) i m not able to go to the full extend to produce quality sounds(please let me know of the good VSTis). I know of manual like Mixing Engineers handbook but i think that my sound card  is not adequate enough to support my DAW(Ableton live). i would like to know of a better yet economical sound card that could help me. Also i hv pro tools but u know its useless without a hardware (I got the cd from a junkdealer who was gonna destroy it).I think it would be wise to install a m-audio soundcard.my production platform is a laptop (no its not mac) so (soundcard) usb is a must. Also i would like to get into djing so the soundcard should double up for the same too. Please also let me know of entry level hardware(controllers, synthesizers, reference headphones {the place i live in is not so private}etc) for trance production. Also should i subscribe to sonicacademy's dance music production course to get an edge? Plzzzzz help

Ok Im a little lost on your question but I gather you had 1 40gig hd and added another expecting 80gigs.
If this is the case you need to setup raid if you can. If not then the second 40 gig would be more of a back up drive.
I hope this helps.

look up your parts on newegg.com and read the specs and see how much power each of them is drawing and tally it up. your processor could be anywhere from 75-125 watts. gcards about the same i would think and the ram might be a good bit. think about the mobo as well and any leds you might have in there take it all into accound and do a nice rough educated guess.

Slow buffering! What can I do about my internet connection speed?



I went to the dslreports website to test my internet connection speed but I don't understand the results because it all sounds like martian.  But I am pretty sure my connection speed is slow and I have buffering issues when I try to watch shows online. The results from the speed show my download speed is:  1271 kbs and my upload speed is: 389 Kbs



the latency is: 110 ms my line speed is 384 k but people who have tested in my area 1336 kb. I'm really not sure what all this means. Is my connection slow and can I complain to Verizon? I'm not sure what to say to them.  Thanks in advance.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You can always try complaining.



1271kbs stands for kilobits per second.  That's probably still martian to you.  There are 8 bits in a byte, so that 158 kilobytes per second.  Your probably familiar with kilobytes and megabytes so that should be a number that makes some sense to you.  Upload speed isn't that import since you rarely send large amounts of information out to the web (usually all you'll send it a small string telling a website which page you want to view).



the other number aren't important, at least in terms of buffering.



Your speed is fairly fast.  I'm supprised your having issues.  It could be that the site your connecting to is going slow.  Your connection speed varies a lot.  It could be that you just happened to test at a time when it was going fast.  Try testing it at at different times.



1271kbps sounds well within the range of DSL, but you could always trying complaining.  It can't hurt.



Your only option maybe be to pay more money for a faster connection.

Master/slave selection is due to one have the ability to take control of the system bus in order to send/receive information from either memory, or the CPU.
The master device which is connected by the same cable typically, will have the ability to take control of the bus away from the slave if necessary.

WINDOWS folder causing Low Disk Space Problem?



My WINDOWS folder keeps getting bigger, now it's taking up 30.9GB of my C: Drive. I already ran CCleaner to delete unnecessary files. I scanned my pc for some viruses but no malware/spyware/virus was found. I tried to defrag it but nothing changed.



I found out that WINDOWS/Installer is taking up more than 20GB of the WINDOWS folder. Is it safe to delete some files from it? I don't know what files to delete.



I really need some help about this problem , I need more disk space because I only have 250MB space left. (My drive C: only contains WINDOWS folder and some important files... My games/music/movies/etc... are in another Hard Disk)

Umm, windows is huge. When I do a full wipe of my system and reinstall XP, it takes a massive chunk out of my HD. What size is your hard drive anyhow? 250mb left?? that's almost unheard of these days, 30gb is nothing really for windows. I would highly recommend you upgrade to at least a 200gb primary hard drive.

Try this:
Go to your Disk Cleanup tool and delete old sytem restore files.



These take a lot of space also. And clean up all the others too. But DO NOT compress your files. Will make some room but will slow down your system a lot.

As for producing music, I would go with the Extreme Music, as it probably has better inputs for producing than gaming, which focuses on outputs to speakers. The Extreme Music will still sound amazing though.



Good Luck!

Your onboard sound card is probably fine.  You'd probably be better off buying higher quality speakers.  If you already have high quality speakers, and you have very good hearing, you might be able to notice a different with a more expensive sound card.



A sound card will only affect the way sound is played on your computer.  It will not help music production.  Creating or mixing of sound on your computer is the job of your processor.  Its quality depends solely on the quality of the software you using to make/edit the music.

there is a third option.
http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=...
just plug into a USB port and its up and running i have 2 different ones ,one for my laptop one so when setting up a computer i have sound with out hunting down drivers for sound card,something that can be done a lot later.



the sound card will not improve the quality of what you produce only make it sound a little better on local machine.its mostly the program that you use to work the sound files.

I have a NVIDIA Geforce 9600 GT and it has Shader Model 4.0 support but my computer indicate it is 3.0? Why?



So why does it say that it has Shader Model 3.0 when in the box of the AGP card it is written it has Shader Model 4.0 support. Will it be able to run games which require Shader Model 4.0?

ATI Radeon 4870 - Best motherboard?



Are there any disadvantages to using a P45 chipset motherboard as opposed to x38 and x48 cipsets for ATI HD 4870 cards?



ALso, can you recommend a board you've had success with?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I don't know about any of the difference between the P45, x38, or x48.  Google can probably give you good info about each chipset.



I use this board because it has the capacity for a second HD4870 so i can run 2 of them in crossfire when my system starts to get older/slower.

well there can be a lot of reasons but if you do all this it should help. I assume you have windows so first click my computer then right click your c drive go to tools tab and click error check and mark both boxes. and start then you will need to reboot to start it. after that is down go to http://www.cnet.com and download ccleaner, ad-aware 2008, and spybot search and destroy. run and scan with all of these along with your anti-virus to clean any infection. Update your video drivers as well and you can also put your windows disk in and do a repair of windows that will fix any corrupted files. Also getting a can of compressed air from and office supply store and blowing out all the vents and heatsinks and fans might help.

Computer sound through headphones ?? ?



Hi,
I've recently started to use headphones for my computer. Thought it was a lot better etc .. But when I plug them in, I hear a constant 'squeaking', can't think of a better word ... It's very annoying, when I open a folder, it stops for about a second. Than it begins again, when I scroll down a list in a folder, it stops. I stop scrolling and the sound begins again.



Conclusion, I'm getting unwanted sounds on my headphone that are somehow connected to the activities of my computer itself ?



Any help?



Am using c media high definition card
Tried using different headphones, doesn't work.



</question>



<additional details>



Edit: I thought it was my headphones only, but when I turn the volume of my big speakers (or whatever its called) up max, I can hear it too...

How do i know if my sound card matches the drivers I'm looking for?



I have a computer that was built for me by my neighbor.  When he brought it over everything worked great except I'm getting a message that says "no audio output device is installed"  He said he installed a Realtek soundcard but I've tried downloading all the drivers and can't get it to work.



When I type dxdiag and look at the sound tab it isn't showing a card.  Is there a way to check what kind of card it is.  I'm assuming I'm not installing the right drivers.

If its realtech im guessing its onboard sound (built into your motherboard)



go into your bios settings and make sure the option for onboard sound is enabled , or if it is a seperate card make sure the option for onboard sound is disabled.



you could always try and "search for new hardware" using the "add hardware" option in windows (its in your control panel) if it finds the card brilliant , if it doesnt its either faulty or just not there , take the side off your pc and see if you can see one



</answer>



<asker's comment>



I've been trying to figure this out for 4 months now and this is the first time someone recommended checking the bios onboard selection.

You will not see any major improvements in performance. If you are on a budget and want a noticeable change you should get a 9600GSO. Now mind you that upgrading from the 8500GT is only worth it if you are gaming and have low framerates. You can find the 9600GSO for $80 without a rebate here:

hey I had this problem before too
what is your processor if your processor is below 1 ghz and running xp then no suprise. but if your cpu is over 2 ghz then check your bios



some computer has a setting in the bios that changes your cpu speed and it may called something like power saver or something
anyways turn that off or change it to full speed



I had a dell witha P4 2.8 ghz then I found out that was the problem
but during then I already reinstalled the OS 3 times

Every dell machine is different. To find out, open up the control panel, then open up the device manager. Once the device manager is opened up, find the display/video adapter tab and expand it, your graphics card/processing chip will be listed there.

EyeToy as webcam for Windows Vista?



Does anyone know if a Namtai EyeToy will work on a computer with Windows Vista?



Also, EyeToys don't have sound hooked up, do they?
So, I'd have to buy a microphone for my computer, right?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



They work, but all the trouble to get it to work is not worth it. At least as far as I have seen.



EyeToys DO NOT have sound on them. PS2's were not able to handle sound easily in its' days, so EyeToys do not have sound.



Yes, you'd have to buy a microphone. No, it does not have to be the kind you wear around your head (although it's really useful!).
There are good quality microphones which stand on the desk, out of sight of the camera.



Source(s):



the Winamp eyetoy guide had like 10-15 steps.
I use a dang stand-on-desk microphone.

I have a Freecom Internet Phone for Skype and trying to install it.

My keyboard slipped off my bed and in picking it up I think this happened.



Any help?

If it's overall performance you're looking for-start with the RAM.  Get to at least 3 gb for a fast machine.



Video card comes second.



Gaming? Go with the nvidia 8800GT, it retailed at $450 brand new, now the new 9000 series are out, so this card's price has dropped to the low $200 range.  Any of the 8000 series from nvidia can handle DirectX10 gaming when paired with Vista.



Ram first, that is where the most noticable gains will come from.

You're going to want to know a couple of things. First, does your computer have an AGP slot, a PCIe x16 slot, or a PCIe 2.0 slot for the new video card? Next, do you want it for gaming, or video quality?
For gaming, nVidia rules. For video quality, ATI is best.
The nVidia 8800GT is a great gaming card. I've got one in my gamer now, and it outperforms the ATI card in my HTPC. The HTPC has an ATI Radeon HD 3650, which I'd never use for gaming, but has an awesome picture on my HDTV.
The nVidia card cost me $100+ more than the ATI. Both are perfect for what they're intended for.

First of all, don't play inside if you have no idea what your doing.
If its very dusty inside, clean it out with a thin brush, and a vacuum. Don't use a static dust rag cause ull break your computer, also make sure you get one of those static matts, so that you don't fry any components. If its not dusty and its still doing that, then you might have to replace the heat sink, i doubt the fan is totally broken cause ur comp wont run if is isn't on. For the best help go to a computer shop and see what they say, they are the experts. Also they will prob find the most cost affective way to fix it.
Worst case you will probably have to spend liek 30 to 50 dollars

It all depends on the market you work in. With a CompTia A+ certificate I've seen job offers that range from $11 to $35 an hour. If you live in Podunk Wyoming (apologies to Podunk) I wouldn't expect there to be much demand as opposed to a major city.

106,666 pictures can be hold on a 320gb hard drive if the pictures are 3 mb.



Bigger the hard drive you get the better. Right now you can get 1 TB for about $130. The bigger the hard drive the faster it will be and more pictures it will hold. Plus its a better deal.



Here is a list of external hard drives so you can pick the one that's best for you.

Ram is only one consideration of game speed. Processor speed, video card ram...etc, all make a difference. If she has a much faster processor or a lot more video ram, could be why.

Most of the new games speed depends on how much better processor and graphic+3d card you have installed on your pc.... If you have a higher quality graphic card and a faster processor you can run these games faster....

It all depends on your computer.



1. Amount of RAM installed. (at least 256MB)
2. Processor type (should be x86) and the speed.
3. Video card compatibility (128MB+ supporting DirextX 9c and Pixel Shader - only in ATI cards and nVidia GeForce 3 - 4 Ti)

Different games use different resources on your computer. Sims 2 only requires



* 800 MHz processor



* 256 MB RAM if Windows XP



* 128 MB RAM if Windows 98, Windows ME, or Windows 2000



* At least 3.5 gigs of free hard drive space



Depending on your RAM Processor and Video Card is how well a game is going to run on your computer. Every game is going to have different requirements.



Also you might be running other applications that take up resources (internet browser, IM, iTunes, ect) This will use up some of your resources and might cause lower frame rates in your game.



Enjoy playing Sims.

You need to de-frag your computer regularly and also do a disk cleanup
It helps my computer when it's slow, it helps almost straight-away
You go to all programs, accessories, system tools and then disk

It depends on if the mobo will support a dual core. Some motherboards are upgrade friendsly like ASUS where all it takes is a BIOS update. Some computers that are designed for a single core CPU at first, are only compatible with just that. You'll want to contact HP and find out for sure.

The motherboard in there uses a socket 775, which is an Intel socket (No AMD for you). Most of Intel's dual core processors will fit that socket type, but the online manual I found for that motherboard does not list anything above a Pentium D Dual Core as supported hardware.



Check the manual that you were provided with when you bought the system. If that's not an option, call HP, just to make sure. Or, you can take it in to a local shop and ask them if they carry any CPUs for that motherboard.



No point in buying a CPU just to find out it won't fit...

Make sure that the monitor's connection to the video card is good, a lot of the times this happens its because one or more of the monitor connector's pins are bent back and not making proper contact with the port on the back of the computer.



Also make sure that the video card is seated properly inside the AGP slot on the motherboard. Press it into the slot firmly, even if the card is just slightly not all the way in it could give you a ton of problems.



You could also try cleaning out the AGP slot on your motherboard with compressed air, just to make sure it is making proper contact.



Good luck! Hope this helps!

What is the difference between the DVI Cable types?



Alright, what I am trying to do is hook my computer up to my TV.



My computer's DVI port is 3 rows of 8 pins each.  On the end of it, it has the hole for the slightly larger connector (not quite a pin, but more square shaped), surrounded by 4 pin holes.  It also has a small slot going vertically through the horizontal slot.



My TV's DVI port is 3 rows of 8 pins each, but does not have the 4 pin holes around the larger connector on the end. It doesn't have the vertical slot, either.



Could someone please tell me which types of DVI ports these are and possibly where I could find a cable to connect them? Thanks.

There are 4 different types of DVI connectors. It sounds like your computer has a DVI-I connector and your TV has a DVI-D connector. In some cases it's possibe to connect these together, read up about DVI connectors and formats on this page to figure out if it will work for you or not: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Vis...

Flash drive compression?



a little while back i was reading that there was a file compressor that i could put on my flash drive, and i could compress the flash drive, but it would run the files in the drive without having to extract, and it could fit like 4 gigs or so on a 512 MB drive, if someone could get back to me on this or find the page that its on, i would be very great full

Putting the files inside your CD does not automatically copy or write the files into your CD. You have to select that option for your file to be written or burnt on the CD. If you just put the files into your CD, what you have done is to put the file into a buffer, you still need to write the file permanently into the CD. You can either use a CD burning software or you use the one that came with your CD drive.

Nero Copying disk problem.?



Pardon me if the problem seems to be childish. Okay, so I know that you have to click Backup and then Copy CD, but then my problem is in the select source and destination. I only have one drive that works so I choose the the same drive (drive E), but then the copy button is still disabled, so I don't know what to do.



Can it be because I've installed Daemon Tools, but I could copy CDs with Daemon Tools before.

A PCI Express card is the best way to go since on board video cards don't have the extra memory that you get when you use a separate video card. You could get a motherboard with a on board video card and a separate video card and if they are compatible you could crossfire it, I don't know the specifics, but I plan on getting a new motherboard myself with on board video so I can have something in case my video card breaks I'll still have the on board card so I am not computerless.



And also don't buy a cheap motherboard, especially don't buy from ECS. I bought my first motherboard from them and it died in 5 months, then they sent me a defective motherboard again, and it just wasn't worth it and I am under $70.00 now because of it and without my computer working, I have to use someone else's until I get the money for my new parts. So keep that in mind that sometimes paying more is far more worth it, otherwise you might get stuck with your computer not working.

ram 4 gb works only with x64, but your 2gb will b good enough
hard disk 160 gb will get filled up in no time, as for example, crysis, fear and other games each is around 9.5GB each!!!

It really depends on what you are doing. If your card reader does not support certain slipstreaming or your OS just cannot keep up, then it'll appear to copy slower.



Nothing you can really do for it, it's your system that is at fault. But as you should know copying anything over 4Mbs will make it go slow anyway...

Hi maximus
Driver Detective will maintain your system updated and optimized with the latest drivers.



Finding the correct and current drivers to update your system the fastest and easiest way possible is now provided to you with Driver Detective. This new version of Driver Detective has been built from the ground up and is an industry first in providing manufacturer specific drivers for your computer.



For example, if you own a Dell computer Driver Detective will recommend drivers specifically for your Dell computer. The improved interface makes it simple to find which drivers are out of date on your system, and to download available updates for them.



The Driver Detective can identify devices that are without drivers and identify devices that are not plugged in (cameras, MP3 players). The program has new improved interface and it's self updating.

Yup, the HD4850 will indeed work just fine on the P43 chipset motherboard.



The P43 board has just one PCI Express 16x slot, so you can use only one video card.



If you want to hook up two HD4850s to improve graphics performance, you need a motherboard with two PCIe 16x slots and Crossfire support.  That means you want a board with either the X38, X48 or P45 chipsets.  (Note:  P45 supports XFire, but only at 8x speed per slot, not the full 16x speed as on the X38 and X48 boards).



Hope this helps.

PC Card Adapter Problem?



I have a PC player in my Honda Civic.



In order to use the player, I have a 2 meg Sandisk card inserted into a 6-in-1 Sandisk PC adapter.  Everything was working great.



Yesterday, I removed the PC card so I could change out the songs I had loaded on the card.  I reinstalled the unit and got a "Card Media Error" message.



I had another PC card which I installed in the adapter and tried it again.  Same error message, so I figured it wasn't a card problem.  Is it possible the adapter suddenly malfunctioned.



I just ordered another one from E-Bay, but I wonder if the player could be the problem for some reason.



Any thoughts?

Yes, you can order an aditional hard drive.
You can plug it in easily using the provided cables and you will see all drives in windows. You will have to format it once it is installed.



Good luck.

Absolutely, you will have one as 'master' and the other as 'slave'
External USB drives may be better if you are going to have to pay to have the internal drive installed.

Best thing to do would be to simply buy a bigger (MUCH bigger :) ) hard drive and replace the 80GB with this, and reinstall Windows on this new hard drive, assuming you have the Windows installation disk. Using the new, bigger drive as an external hard drive is a pain - I recommend not doing this, least of all because of the slower speed it runs at...
If it's a new computer more than likely it supports at least 2 hard drives, probably 4 - just turn off your PC, unplug it, unscrew your hard drive and put the cables onto your new drive, exactly how it was on the previous drive. After installing Windows and checking it works fine, have a go at installing the 80GB drive again using the loose cables which should be found inside the case, then reformat it and use it as a backup or whatever you require...
640GB HDD's are probably the best value for money at the moment - try eBay for the best deal, if you have an account there already.



Hope this helps!

If disk space is running out you can get a nice chunk back like this:
Enable  'compress contents' and 'allow index service'. These help optimize file recovery speed & save disk space.
Start&gt; my computer&gt; right click 'c' drive&gt; properties&gt; general tab: here check both boxes & OK.
Don't freak out if it says 3 days (or more) to run!  This drops dramatically as the process advances; just walk away and let 'er run for the duration: it will self close when done. Depending on the files & sizes, it may take several hours to do (maybe do it at night before bed?).
When done, run 'CCleaner' & defrag.
This should be done to any new systems or HDD's when fresh, to optimize disk space over the life of the drive.

It depends on what type of drive - most motherboards are restricted to four IDE devices, if you have SATA available on the board then you can often have 2, 4 or 6 ports and connect as many drives as you have ports. Often with two SATA you can still get 4 IDE devices connected, but with 4 or 6 you often only get the option to connect 2 IDE devices. you can get add in cards that will increase the number of available IDE devices you can run but these are not always reliable.
In any case as most others have already suggested the best option is an external drive, you can get a 400 or 500Gb drive these days for very little money. The external device will connect via your usb ports but will need a mains power socket.

How do computers work?!?



Ok, so the question is very vague but what i really want to know, is, how do bits of plastic and metal (the hardware), make something so complex as a computer?! How does plastic and metal create pictures on screen? How does it store information? How can you make something lifeless, remember something? What in these chunks of metal makes it remember? I know I'm asking a lot but if someone could simply explain it to me I'd be really grateful!  I've been looking inside my computer trying to install a graphics chip and it's got me thinking about this...

The question if far to complex/time consuming for me to write up a couple hour explanation of everything. It's great you want to know though! Most people just use and abuse them without caring or thinking. Always ask questions and learn how things work and you will get far. I would suggest a book to answer your questions. Maybe:
ISBN # 978-0789736130



Or maybe a website like:

I first sat down at a computer when I was about 6 years old, I played games and mashed on the keyboard mostly at the beginning. Within two years my dad was teaching me how to program, and throughout my preteen and teen years I became obsessed with the study of logic, electronics, programming and all sorts of computer related topics.  I continued these studies throughout high school and college.



Today, 17 years later, having spent the majority of my working hours during those years studying computers and related topics, I still have more to learn about it and will continue to do so for years to come.



The question you're asking can't be answered in a paragraph on Yahoo! Answers, and in a lot of ways it couldn't even be properly answered in an entire book, at least not so that you would actually understand it.  You should probably start at Wikipedia, but I wouldn't hold out any hope that you'll have an understanding of how computers work from top to bottom any time soon.



Generally you'll want to learn about things in this order though:



1. Basic circuits / electricity
2. Logic gates
3. PCB boards
4. Microprocessors
5. Computer hardware
6. Programming fundamentals
7. Operating systems
8. Computer software

If you are NOT overclocking the E7200 CPU, why buy it? The Athlon64 X2's are cheaper, also Athlon64 X2 motherboards are cheaper as well.



The biggest advantage of the Core2Duo series are it's overclockability. Beyond that, there's still room for the AMD processors because they are really cheap nowadays.

Laptop trouble....? Help Please ... =$ x ?



Hi - My laptop which is an ibm t20 will not boot up. I am quite confused as it is usually very reliable. It goes on fine and the screen is working normally, but when i should log on the screen goes black. The only way i can actually log on is by going onto safe mode, but by doing this i cannot do everything that i can usually do on the laptop. I forgot to turn it off for one night and it wont log on since so maybe this is the problem. Anyone know what the problem is and how I could resolve it.

instead of re-installing windows, I suggest that you log in safe mode and do a system restore to a date when you laptop was functioning normally.



if you don't know how to do a system restore, follow these steps:



1.	Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click System Restore. System Restore starts.
2.	On the Welcome to System Restore page, click Restore my computer to an earlier time (if it is not already selected), and then click Next.
3.	On the Select a Restore Point page, click the most recent system checkpoint in the On this list, click a restore point list, and then click Next. A System Restore message may appear that lists configuration changes that System Restore will make. Click OK.
4.	On the Confirm Restore Point Selection page, click Next. System Restore restores the previous Windows XP configuration, and then restarts the computer.
5.	Log on to the computer as Administrator. The System Restore Restoration Complete page appears.
6.	Click OK.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Is it a macBook, iBook or Powerbook? The reason I ask is that even the oldest MacBooks shipped with Tiger installed, Panther stopped shipping with the G4's. It's important because the iBooks (and older Powerbooks) didn't have sudden motion sensors that parked the hard drive heads when they sense a drop. Without these sensors the hard drive could have been accessing when it fell, making it possible for the read heads to smack into the platters, damaging the surface. This may not be repairable, but in a drop it's more likely to be physical damage than a problem with the os. Best advice is to try the startup disk first to see if disk utility can isolate the damaged sectors. If not you'll need to take it to a recovery expert.



Sorry it's not better news

OK, do you see how this is not a question to be asking?



The #1 reason to ask this question is if the Asker is in possession of a stolen laptop.



The rightful owner of the laptop wouldn't have to ask the question, because they could just contact the company (LoJack or CompuTrace) and get help removing the software - for example if they were preparing to sell the machine.

you can pick up cables from your local electronic store that are made for your laptop, or, if you have a moniter cord laying around, you could hook that up to your tv and laptop. usually only HD tvs have this option though...

IBM thinkpad T61 laptop turns off wireless capability on its own?



I have an IBM thinkpad T61 laptop that for some reason likes to turn off its wireless capability on its own.  I'll be on the internet with no problems, and all of a sudden the connectivity turns off.  I go to the start menu and go to the "connect to" page where it reads the server cant find a wireless connection. When I click "diagnose why it cant find a connection". It responds by saying wireless capability has been turned off and gives me an option to turn it back on. I know where the wireless switch is at the front and have made sure I dont accidently flip it by accident or anything. Has this happened to anyone else or know any solutions?

Hi,



The cheapest way is the memory stick.



That has a usb connection, so you can just plug it into the usb port on your laptop.



They are similar to a camera card but in a stick form with a usb connection.



You can get them from most places and cost from about £8 - £30 depending on the memory size.

you can use a USB memory stick, but personally i'd invest in an external hard drive - the capacity is far greater, and if your anything like me years of photos will simply not fit on all but the largest memory stick - if you have a router you could even get and external hard drive with an ethernet or wifi connection and then any computer on your network can access this.

you could use a memory stick, say 2Gb, or you could use CD's 800Mb
so you would be storing less on the CD, alternatively you could store them on some camera cards. Copy all the photos from the laptop, then check to see that they are on the memory stick or bunch of CD's. then delete them all off your laptop, do a defragment and you will find your laptop works that bit faster

Hi, when you say loads of photo's are you talking 100's or 1000's?



I actually use an ext L/T Hard Drive (USB con).



This way I know my entire PC is backed up not just the pics.



It is a bit more expensive, but then again some photo's are irreplaceable.



Also saves heaps of time if you want to go restore your hard drive to an earlier time.  Someone else has already suggested a USB flash drive so it really is "horses for courses".



Good luck

If you have accumulated a lot of photos in a short time, take my advice and delete the ones that are no good.  Honestly, you want to be ruthless when you do this, otherwise in a year or so, you will get lost in your computer trying to sort and categorise them.  If you cant back up to disc, get yourself a card reader and store your pictures on the same format of card that your camera uses.  You can take both cards and flash drives into many superstore or photo outlets and print your snaps from a machine.

The cheapest way to back up your pictures or other documents is using USB Flash disk. There are 8, 16 GB available. Depends on your choice..



You might also want to try external hard disk. This is very convenient and you don't need to worry with extra space.



Hope this helps.

Someone above my answer mentioned getting an External Hard Disk Drive (EHDD) - DON'T! The reason for this is a EHDD is fairly expensive and big to backup photos. Even though there will be high Quality photos (which take up more space) a memory stick will be able to backup ever thing up and they are cheaper than EHDD's. If you have 1000's and 1000's and 1000's of high Quality photos you should consider a 4GB memory stick, but just for Future use I would get an 8GB.

Why would my system randomly freeze if its a brand new install on a brand new hard drive?



DETAIL:



My laptop was having hard drive issues before, so I took it out, put in a brand new one from newegg. I installed Vista, once it got to the desktop I activated it and installed the latest updates.



If I attempt to do something big like install office 2007 the system will freeze for minutes at a time.



Also, the system takes almost 15 minutes to boot up.. the screen is just completely black.



Specs:



1.8 Ghz Dual core



2GB of ram
250gb hard drive



only 7 months old.

Depends on ALOT. My main bet is drivers.



If you goto your control panel, and then get up the advanced volume control (the one with all the different dials instead of just one) that may all be greyed out and uneditable. If so, that means you have no drivers installed for it.



To find drivers for whatever you have, you need your initial disk that came with your machine, or the disk that came with your soundcard if you bought a new sound card.

I had that same problem when i put McAfee security in my computer. It would take it forever to start, for anything to load, would freeze on tasks, etc. Uninstalled it, problem solved. It is also helpful to clean out tracking cookies and temporary internet folders/files. Those also slow things down!!!!

Around $500. Be warned, however, that burning copies of the software would be illegal. Why don't you just delete the programs you want to use on your computer. Also, selling your computer has a risk of someone finding your personal data. I would recommend a complete reformat before selling it.

First off, you want to make all connections between your notebook and TV prior to booting your notebook. Once you've done this, you need to change the output destination from your LCD screen, to the source that is interfacing with your television. Often times this can be accomplished by using the "Fn" key + "CRT/LCD/SVIDEO" key. On my notebook (Dell), it appears on the F8 key. However, this may differ on your notebook. More than likely it is also on your F - Keys..

From one who started up in the era before the Sinclair ZX80 I can explain a better reason why.



There were many, many, and yes, many manufacturers of computer systems in the 60s through the mid 90s.  The boom did not get off to much of a start until the early 1970s.  Most of these early systems used their own versions of operating systems to work.  Everyone did not use MS-DOS.  There was a plethora of programming languages and a lot of early computers just had a keyboard and a few led based displays (kit computers like the first Apple didn't even have a chassis, only a bare board) This is in fact where Bill Gates got rich.  He would be commissioned to take some one's computer that they wanted to market (every one was marketing computers back then, even Exxon), and he would write the code to execute BASIC, one of the most popular instructive procedural languages, on that machine.  Later on we would call this process porting.



He did this on many machines to include the Commodore line and Apple lines.  If you don't believe me, search for the Microsoft easter egg that Bill Gates integrated in all his ports.



Data storage's expense has changed due to better and newer technologies.  The first hard drives built in the fashion we know of today were the size of brief cases, hold about 10 megabytes and dim the lights of the house when it spun up.



Competition has brought down the price. How many Intel capable motherboard manufacturers are there?  How many memory chip makers? The list goes on.



But the main reason why computers have dropped in price is standardization.  All Intel based computers can operate using the most popular OS today: Windows.

AHB is right. It's supply and demand and modern production techniques.



Computer technology was brand new. Not many people had the knowledge and skills to design a computer and there weren't really any specialized companies that made specific components, aside from CPUs.



Now, everything keeps getting smaller and faster and easier to make. It's expensive at first, then is quickly made obsolete and drops in price when something better is made.



Let's say you build a powerful system using new parts right now, and you spend $5000. A year from now you could probably build the same thing for $2000. A year after that and Dell is selling systems just like it for $800.



Mid range computers are cheap now, but I could spec you a $10,000 system with very little trouble, and without the latest and greatest technology.

They were not mass produced back then so the price was high. Nowadays its in huge numbers since it has a lot of customers. This age is computer age and people can't live without one meaning that a lot of computers are being made and sold.



Demand, mass production to meet the demand and competition between Companies makes the prices cheaper.



Another thing which I will put it simple for you to understand is that computer parts are made of tiny chips and those chips are becoming tiny and tiny these days, making the components less expensive to produce among other advantages.



Plus all the advances in Technology also play its part.

As technology gets more and more advanced, they find ways to make it cheaper but better.



At that time, computers are expensive because it was still new. People were so fascinated with computers that they sell it at a very expensive price. You are very lucky before if you had one and people get so proud about their new computers.



Computers before were very big and bulky. They use expensive parts.



Less companies create computers. IBM, Apple etc. Since that time is the start of the computer, it starts small.



Computers get more famous and as time pass, new discoveries and new breakthroughs are discovered and applied in computers that is why the computer is today.

Nope, U can't mix DDR & DDRII. Furthermore U can't use DDRII on a computer designed for DDR and vice-versa.



You can mix 512MB sticks with 1GB sticks as long as they are both DDR, for computers designed for DDR, or DDRII for computers designed for DDRII.

You need to find out first how many sticks you can put in your laptop. It might be only 2 slots at all with one available. Looks like you have 2 slots used already so you will actually have to replace them. It's always best to install same amount of memory sticks so if the dual channel is available it will work with it. For ex. if you have dual channel with two slots you will have to use 2 x 2 gb ram in order to make it dual.



Oh by the way, your computer has DDR2 already so it will be the same ram. DDR2 is faster tho

Go to the following link, http://www.crucial.com  they can do an on line check which will determine which ram your motherboard supports. They will recommend the optimum amount. You can order on line and although they are not the cheapest it is worth  paying for good ram. They guarantee compatibility with your motherboard and give an excellent warranty.They also give fitting instructions.  I have used them many times and always been satisfied. Hope this helps.

Not enough info. But if you are useing wifi disable your lan and whatever other connection possibilities you have, or vise versa. In other words disable the ones your not useing.Also alot of laptops have an internet on off button/switch, make sure it is accepting an internet connection.click on start, settings,network connections, Then right click on the icon to enable or disable the connection. If this doesnt work try restarting/reseting your modem and router. There is a button in a hole in the back of each, if not turn off then back on modem first,router second after the modem comes back up.

Seems as if this is a very common problem with no solution offered up by Microsoft (possible compatibility issues with SP2 and ATI) or ATI themselves.



The two most "common" solutions are to reinstall the ATI driver or, "Go to System Devices in My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Hardware, and locate the option, PCI standard PCI-to-PCI bridge.  Right click, and select the “update driver” option. Manually search and install the PCI standard PCI-to-PCI bridge."



Hope this helps.

hi bubble



the message "ati2dvag" indicates a bug that affects ati graphic cards and it causes a blue screen of death and in some cases a infinite loop error message



the usual symptoms of this problem include :
1) PC crashes without warning, sometimes the display shows weird patterns before the crash.



2)Resolution may revert to the lowest resolution settings upon restarting your PC.



3)The CPU temperature may shoot up prior to crashing.



4)PC may not be able to reboot back after the crash, unless you turn off the power supply unit of your PC and switch it back on again.



5)Your PC tells you (sometimes only) that the ati2dvag driver has failed to function.



do not worry about this problem as it happens to many thousands of p.c,s worldwide,and theres been many suggestions put forward why it happens including sp2(service pack 2) incompatibility,and hardware acceleration settings



as for solutions the two most common are :
1) Reinstall the ATI driver. You are advised to launch Windows in Safe Mode (press F8 before Windows boots), go to Windows Add/Remove programs and uninstall everything ATI. Remove the DAO/MDAC component as well. You can use the ATI removal tool utility which can be downloaded from the ATI website. The complete set of instructions on removing ATI can be found here on the ATI website.



2) Go to System Devices in My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Hardware, and locate the option, PCI standard PCI-to-PCI bridge. This could under other names on your PC, so contact your PC vendor if you’re unsure. Right click, and select the “update driver” option. Manually search and install the PCI standard PCI-to-PCI bridge.



the annoying aspect about this problem is that neither ati or microsoft have released statements in regards to this problem and this is one of the reasons i steer clear of ati cards,their compatibility with both windows xp and vista is suspect to say the least



anyway give these a go and let me know if you have any problems



good luck bubble  !

If you can get into safe mode then uninstall the ati drivers, then start in normal mode. Reinstall the up-to-date drivers for your graphics card/graphics chipset. That should fix it. If you cant get into safe mode then the only option is to reinstall windows im afraid.

Hello well this appears to be your graphics card driver.



If you are using an USB keyboard and mouse you need to change these to a normal PS2 mouse/keyboard.The purple and green port type.



Then restart and go into last known good config or safe mode you need to uninstall the ATI graphics card driver and reinstall a new one via there website support page.



You can uninstall the driver via device manager.



I hope this helps?

Buy or fix my own notebook/laptop?



i got a notebook 3 years old (its warranty is over already). i think there's somthing wrong about its system maybe affected by virus and spyware or something.. therefore, its hard to tell wat's wrong since i can't make it portable as it will shut down itself if it is moved. so i can not move it or shake it as it wiil turn off where as the power plug and screw, hardware all are tight and ok.
so, i'm thinking of is it worth to buy another one or try to fix my own notebook. i'm afraid that the cost of fixing is more or less than buying the new one which includes 3 years warranty.

You'll need to go to your Laptop Manufacturer's web site and download all of the drivers, and install them. All of your laptop's hardware (video card, sound card, touchpad, etc.) requires software drivers in order to function properly, windows come preloaded with some generic default driver which is usually enough to get most common hardware up and running, but the proper manufacturer drivers must be installed to gain full functionality.

Don't run any processor intensive programs. Anyway use it until it completely runs out, then when your laptop shuts off unplug it, then take out the battery ( should be easy with a little latch etc. ). Then leave it out for a few hours and place it back in, then fully charge the battery WITHOUT turning the computer back on, by plugging the AC in when the battery is snapped back in place.



This'll reset the processor basically, since you would be charging it when it's not completely empty etc.



Should work.

Yeah same thing happens to mine also but then i found out that it was the contrast if u lower the back light it should resist more and probably will not die as fast but if its not that then it´s probably your battery came out wrong and you´re going to have to change it or sometimes is because you are doing a lot of things at the same time that takes energy away from the battery well hope this helps

ok, if your performance settings are set at maximum your battery will run out very fast but you are able to change this on the control panel to a power saver mode which will make your battery last longer. Hope this helps!!

First you have to know what you intend to do with it. Desktops are cheaper than laptops for the same capabilities but if you must be mobile, then you need a laptop.



You should get at least 1 gb of ram and 2 gb is better. Get a dual core processor for best performance. Intel is rated higher than AMD.



Get at least a 200 gb hard drive.

It is s matter of preference (laptop vs desktop)...
Required spec depends on what you will be using it for:
home computer to do your homework 2GB+ RAM, 100GB+ HDD, any processor will be sufficient...
gaming computers need more RAM and better video card...
2GHz+ processor, 2GB RAM, 100GB HDD are fairly standard these days
The above configuration will suite most purposes...

It depends what you want to get out of your machine. If it's going to be used for gaming, you're going to want a good graphics card and CPU. If you're using it primarily for emails, youtube videos, casual internet browsing, then you'll want to focus on RAM. Maybe you're an artist, and like playing in photoshop. If that's the case, you want good RAM, a good CPU, decent graphics card.



Next, on to the Operating System. I would suggest Windows XP Pro, but most computers come standard with Vista. The unfortunate thing about Vista is it hemorrhages RAM. With Vista, you want atleast a good 2GB+ of RAM. Great graphics cards cost $100+, but are completely optional if you're willing to accept onboard video cards which generally aren't.... all that great. Most good hard drives have 200+ GB.

Computer graphics problem?



My laptop has recently been having some troubles. While on my desktop or in mozilla firefox it is working fine, when a more graphical intense display comes on it will freeze. Example : Aurora Borealis screensaver in Vista. It doesnt do this all the time but when it does it is a real hassel. I shut it down and try to start it up and what comes to the screen is a gray and black display with strange patterns.



http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2012/1975...



Looks kinda like that. But with less white



I then try to restart it again and the same thing comes up.
Does anyone know what is going on or how to fix it and how much it would cost?



</question>



<additional details>



No I cannot update drivers, because It does that from startup automatically, no way to stop it (tried f8) and I cant leave that screen. Also for the second post, I have had vista running on my machine for about 2 months and this problem just happened today. Happened in World of Warcraft today and I have ran that on my computer for 2 years.

Can you enter the BIOS?



If you can't enter safe mode anymore or otherwise boot to change/update the drivers, can you reinstall Windows?



What GPU does your laptop have? If it's a GPU made by Nvidia, you may have a defective GPU.



http://www.techcrunchit.com/2008/07/10/n...



Nvidia has claimed that only 8400M and 8600M GPUs are affected, but there are reports that the defect extends to 7, 6, and even 9 series mobile GPUs.



Your laptop's problem seems to be hardware based. If so, regardless of whether the GPU was made by Nvidia or any other company, considering that most mobile GPUs are integrated onto the laptop's motherboard, or worse, into the chipset itself, it may be impractical to have it serviced if your laptop isn't covered by a warranty anymore since the only quick fix is to replace the motherboard.



If it's that far gone, you may be better off buying a new one.



Hope you get it working again though.

Well, I think your problem is your graphic card. If you have a good quality of a graphic video card, then the better the graphics. Or You probably need to install some Graphic Drivers.



Ask a computer technician, I bet you need a graphic driver, it's sorta like a disk you install to improve(or update) your graphics video card. Hope this helps.

Get a macbook or wait?



Recently my lap top's battery meter says about 30 minutes on a fully charged battery. I only have 20 GB left on my HD, I only have 1Gb of RAM, it takes my computer three minutes to come back from sleep mode, and I can't stand seeing that stupid windows logo one more time so I am extremely thinking about buy a new Macbook. I use my computer for only the basics like e-mail, school, and web surfing. But my problem is I'm not sure if I should go ahead and buy a macbook with my hard earned money from my summer job or wait until I go to college to buy a new computer. Any suggestions?

Don't listen to the PC fangirl, the new generation of Macbooks are out and you will have no problem running your basics on a Mac. Everything that you do on your current laptop can be done on a macbook. Here are some examples.



Internet: Firefox or Safari (Firefox is better if you like lots of addons, otherwise Safari is really easy to use.)



AIM: iChat (also does bonjour, jabber, and Gtalk)



Yahoo Messenger: Yahoo! Messenger for mac (It's the same.)



Email: Mail.app (If you switch and use Gmail or pay for Yahoo's Plus you can pop it right into your inbox. Otherwise just like normal thru a web browser.) or Mozilla Thunderbird. (Found at mozilla.org)



Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint): I'd reccomend to anyone on Mac, PC, or Linux to just download the OpenOffice.Org suite in a heartbeat over office (it supports the same file types.) But if you feel like shelling out cash for microsoft office then there is a version for mac at your disposal.



Windows programs (for the PC fankids.): There are a few options.
1. Anything involved in the WINE project. (WINE lets you download the dll's the programs need and the fonts to run them. WITHOUT INSTALLING WINDOWS.) This includes:
1a.Darwine (free)
1b.Crossover for Mac (little pricy, but offers more support)
1c.Crossover Games (a little cheaper, but is only for games.)
2. Virtualization software. (So installing windows in a safe virtual machine to run on top of os x) This includes:
2a.VirtualBox (free)
2b.VMWare Fusion (Pricey)
2c.Parallels Desktop (More pricey)
3. Dual-Booting (Use apple's built in program Boot Camp to boot into windows natively)



So as you can see, you'll likely enjoy your new Macbook, as ANY computer would top the one you have.

you should wait until you think it will cost its lowest and then buy, but if you get a windows, you can get the items working correctly and still use you're programs, if you chose the specifics, it could be cheap.

Don't wait. Get one of the new aluminum MacBooks now. You'll learn to use it and you'll get the education discount at Apple. Odds are there won't be any newer models for at least a year.

It depends on when you will be attending school.  Sometimes it is best to wait until the last minute to buy a computer in order to assure that you have the latest technology, but not if your first day of classes will be fairly soon.  It would probably be nice to have a few days to tweak any defaults that annoy you and shop around for extra software that you might want to install.  You are wise to go with a mac by the way.  The irony of owning a macbook is that you can multi boot it and run windows better than any PC of equal specs.

Boy you outta be REAL happy when you find out all your software wont run on a mac hey? Danboy, you can talk BS all day! Fact, apple finally produced a mac that could run windows. What do you suppose the reason was? Maybe compatibility? Loss of sales? Makes perfect sense to me, I'll go buy a mac, install bootcamp and buy windows so it can remain compatible with existing software......now I have already spent far too much for a piece of garbage, then spent more on windows.......now I have a mac thats compatible with windows and it only cost me three times what a comparable windows based system woulda cost in the first place! What would you call me? Not very brite? Yall go on watchin them dumass mac ads, spend your money,  I've been into computers since long before a home pc was dreamed of! BS yourself!

apple isnt going to change their prices, so its up to you what is most cost effective.  I had a problem just like you except even worse situation, after hearing all the problmes with vista, i switched, i got myself a black macbook and couldn't be happier.  The bottom line is, if the computer you own is simply unusable, which in your case, 30min is not a laptop ne more, then spring for the new computer, sure the apple brand costs a lot more than similarly speced windows systems, but you are paying for the operating system basically.  And if you cant stand seeing that stupid windows logo one more time, go for the mac.  Sure you'll need a new office suite, word and stuff, but there are free alternatives if you want.  Macs come with most of the stuff you really need, so you wont have to go out and buy very much software.  From one switcher to a potential one, go do it, plus, the new macbooks look sweet, can you do four finger gestures on your windows box?

How does a laptop power cable work?



Physically, I want to know what the cable looks like around the part that plugs into the laptop. I have a kink in the cable around that point, but don't know if cutting it and soldering is an option, depending on how complicated that part of the cable is. The rest of the cable is really simple (positive and negative) but does it get complex at the end?



Note: I'm only talking about the cable, not the laptop jack itself. I'm talking about the end farthest away from the brick, that plugs into the laptop. I wanna know what that looks like, and how easy it would be to repair.



</question>



<additional details>



You guys are great, let me clarify a little more. The problem is clearly in the cable, right before the end. It's not the end itself that I would be replacing. I'd just be soldering the part right before the end piece. So should it be any different than soldering any other part of the cable?

I have an HP and it looks like any other cable(ac adapters)  it has a hole where it connets to the laptop.



it is not complicated, it just haas the negative and positive cables.  Headphones' cables are complicated, charger cables are not.



Take a look at this picture, I am guessing you are trying to replace the damaged connector.  http://www.1powershop.com/images/product...



If that is what you are trying to do,. just make sure you get one of the same size.  =]



EDIT: hour:32 minutes:



OK!!!  Then there should be no problem.  Just cut the cable and solder it again.



ie.



lets say this is the cable:



"END__DAMAGE HERE_____Start"  Cut whre its damaged and solder it.



You shold get somethng ike this&gt;&gt;:

When you write on a hard drive for the first time, you're writing on a clean surface. However, things stay on it when you delete them, but permission to write over the item is given.



If you delete a picture, it stays on the hard drive, but next time something needs to me written, it might write on top of the picture, deleting it forever.



Just because you deleted something doesn't mean it is gone forever. It is still on the hard drive until something else writes over top of it.

All the recycle bin is is a special folder where the "deleted" items go - they're not deleted at that point.



When they're "permanently" deleted, the computer simply deletes the record of where it is on the hard drive so even though it has been deleted the actual data can still be there for some time.



You can get special software called disk cleaners which "clean" the empty areas of your hard drive by writing the same character over and over again "rubbing out" the previous data.

when you 'delete' a file, it is not deleted, it just goes to the recycle bin. The file doesn't change a bit, just the location. When you permanently delete it from the bin, the file remains but its space is 'available' and the directory entry is deleted (not the file's content, just the entry that tells the computer where the file is).  So basically, whenever your computer needs space for anything, it considers the space where the file is located as usable.



If you need to get that file, the longer the time has passed since you permanently deleted it, the higher the chances that the OS used the space for something.  There are applications that scan the 'available areas' of the disc for content that can help you recover the file (or at least part of it).



If, on the other hand, you want to make sure the file is totally gone, there are applications that add a 'shredder' to the bin, so they overwrite the content of the file with 0s and then delete the file.  Someone suggested defragging, but this does not guarantee the file content will be erased.

No it doesn't delete it permanently,the Windows delete function does not clear the space where the deleted file has been located but only marks an entry in the directory (folder) as deleted. All data and information about the file still remains on the disk and can be restored!
now there is a program that i use all the time to make sure my deleted files r deleted for good and it will not mess with any of your good files,it will only erase the empty space and since you deleted files and the computer sees the space as empty it will erase that empty space too on your hard drive.the link to it is below,give it a try.need more help email me.

deleting only removes the .exe, .htlm or what ever other Extension the file has, this allows windows to over write the file as it sees it it as blank space. even then traces are still left behind.

My pc drivers are stuffed?



I just got my pc upgraded. I got a new cpu (intel dual core 2.5 ghz), I got my motherboard upgraded, and i got a new graphics card (NVIDIA GTX 280). I got these put in and connected up by a professional. With the graphics card i didnt have the cd, so i think the professional guy installed the correct drivers onto my pc from the internet. I got home, plugged the pc in, it started up fine. But when i play need for speed prostreet i tried to change the graphics settings but then my pc crashed and so i left it. Then 30 minutes later the colours were all messed up and there was a message saying that the display drivers didnt function normally. So i restarted the pc and it started fine.When i played bioshock i played it on highest detail settings and it ran smoothly. But when i paused it and clicked "Exit to windows" the display drivers stuffed up again. So i went to NVIDIA.com and downloaded the latest drivers for the GTX 280, when i installed them correctly it required me to restart the pc. So i restarted it and now everything on the screen is big and zoomed in. When i right click on the screen to go to properties so i can change the resolution it doesnt do anything, then the colours go weird and theres all these massive pixels and weird colours and it just stays freezed like that. So what do i do? I cant contact the professional because hes not available on the weekends. Please help me! Im stuck and my stupid pc wont let me do anything to fix it. Any suggestions?
Thanks any help is greatly apreciated!

I am thinking about getting a Macbook Pro?



I go to school at Kardinia International College and everyone has a laptop. It's compulsory. You are supposed to buy them through the school but they charge nearly AU$4000 for them!!!! So when i upgrade my laptop at the start of year 10 I was thinking of getting a Macbook Pro outside of school. They are cheaper than the laptops at school and I think they are better. I was wondering if they are any good for study and work and things like that. I was also wondering if it comes with Garage Band already installed on it. I play guitar so I was wanting to make my own music. Sorry this was so long but I really need advice on this laptop.

Speaker problems with laptop..?



o I bought a new set of Logitech x540's, with the intention of just plugging them into the normal 3.5mm jack on my laptop, and hitting the matrix button on the speakers, which according to the guy from DSE would create a "fake 5.1" sound which is all i needed as I only wanted it for the intention of listening to music.



This all worked good and fine for a few weeks, until my mom bought this VHS -&gt; DVD converter thing, which is actually some sort of cable thing which allows the VCR player to be plugged into the laptop via USB, therefore you can capture the image and burn to dvd. Now I was playing around with the settings for this, and after I took my laptop back to my room, found out that my speakers arn't working anymore, and all the sound seems to be directed to the 3 front speakers and the sub, almost totally omitting the other 2 speakers. The other 2 speakers are now just producing a tinny version of whatever I'm playing, and ends up sounding very mono?
any help would be appreciated, as I have no idea, thanks in advance.



Maybe there's a way I can just restore all my audio settings back to default?

I have a problem with my laptop battery charger.?



Hi



I bought an acer laptop the last year Aspire 5520 G, the charger of the battery was caming with it; after 6 months, the charger stopped working, so i bought another, and again after 4 months it stopped working again so I bought a third one and yesterday after 2months it stopped working again. I don't know what is wrong, if it's my laptop or the charger because even the one that was caming with the laptop stopped working. Please help me to find a solution, or if it's a problem with my computer. I asked Jumbo, in Dubai (UAE) because there is from where i bought it and they told me that maybe is because i let it on when the laptop is off, so i started to remove it from the light when it's off, and again the 2 chargers stopped working...

I have never had this problem but then I have never had an Acer Aspire laptop, my partner did and it lasted 3 months before it failed critically and blew its own processor which I remember was an AMD one rather than the far superior Intel.  I would say that if you use your Acer for long periods of time and leave it plugged in while away from it then this probably the matter.  I think that most laptops do not enjoy this sort of treatment as they are designed to be on when used and off when not as that is their purpose.  Acer seem to have problems with building a decent mid or low end laptop at the best of times because of their high number of battery and processor problems.  Their high end laptops and desktop replacements seem to have fewer problems which is probably because they cost so much more.  I would look in to having the charger connection port looked at or even the whole powerpack as it seems to be a problem with these burning out, you could also plug your laptop in to a circuit breaker to prevent problems from power surges in your area.  I have mine plugged into a circuit breaker and the whole of this section of the house is on its own circuit breaker so that it gets isolated thus causing minimal damage to electronic devices in other parts of the house.  The whole house is also on a central circuit breaker so that if their is a power failure or a power surge the whole house is protected.  Try and get this sort of system set up in your house to protect all of your digital equipment.

Do i Have the 'Blue Screen Of Death"?



one day my laptop was going hell chunky when i was on bitcomet and i held down the off button to turn it off. when i turned it back on a black screen with options safe mode, last good config. and all those options came up. i tried them all and every time i choose one the computer resets and a blue screen comes up. ive tried booting my cd from the windows xp home edition cd (wheich is what is installed on my laptop) and it says everything is good.



it took me ages 2 copy this down cause the blue screen only appears for like 3 seconds so some of this might be wrong but ive double checked it and this is what it says.



A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.



If this is your first time you've seen this stop error screen, reset your computer. if this screen appears again, follows these steps:



disable or uninstall any anti-virus, disk defragmentation or backup utilities, check your hard drive configuration and check for updated drivers



run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption and then restart your  computer



technical information
***STOP: 0x00000024 (0x001900203, 0x82396788, 0xc0000102, 0x00000000)



how can i follow these steps if i cant get onto my computer? any help would be so good, best answer goes to first answer that works for me.



thanks guys ;)

Here's desktop vs laptop.
Desktop:
Desktop can be upgraded a lot more than a laptop.
Desktop can have a faster processor.
Desktop can have a better graphics card.
Desktop can have a better sound card.
Desktops can have faster memory.
Desktops run cooler usually. Giving you more life out of it.



Laptop:
Can be taken around with you.
Smaller.
Weighs less.
Great for school/office.



Also, there are not more choices for laptops. I say this because I build desktops. If you build it yourself or have someone do it for you, your options are unlimited. Plus I could build a desktop with the same specs as a laptop for less than half the price of the laptop.



All comes down to what you need. Do you really need the mobility?

Depends on your situation:



Portability is a quality of a laptop, but if you don't have wifi it's not that good.



PCs are not portable but they are very very customizable and easier to fix.



Also if your PC dies, then you get to keep the screen and PCs can be amped up due to more room while laptops are limited in memory and RAM. ;)



I recommend Dell or HP. Both are strong competitors and offer the best choices in both laptops and PCs for the price.

I have both desktop and laptop. I enjoy my desktop more because it give me more pleasure of sitting behind my computer desk. I can lay back in my chair and rest a bit while surfing or doing something on it.



Desktops are better than laptops performance wise, they can also be upgraded easily and at a better cost than laptops. Repair cost for laptops are very high compared to desktops. Upgrading a laptop can be extremely costly and often requires qualified repair techs and not from any average next door Pc nerd .

well it all depends on what you'll use it for. if you have to have it for something where your always on the move, than you should get a laptop, but if you dont really need to take it anywhere besides home, than a pc would be a smarter choice. pc's basically are not mobile and cost less money, but are probably just as good or better than a laptop. plus it's more sturdy. but a laptop costs more money, and is mobile and isnt as sturdy. pretty much, if you bought a laptop with certain specs, than if you bought a pc with the same specs, the pc would be cheaper. idk, i like laptops too, but the smart choice would probably be a pc if you dont need to take it anywhere really. but ya, www.alienware.com is a computer website, and they have really good computers. they have lots of gameing computers, but you can customize them, so you wouldn't have to get a gameing one, but ya, thats a good brand computer

The only advantage of a laptop is its portability, but if you need portability that's a huge advantage.



If you don't need portability, you're going to use it in one place, get a desktop.  You'll get more power and features for less money and it's much easier to upgrade pieces.

Will there be a big difference between 6mb or 1mb L2 cache?



Will there be a big difference between 6mb or 1mb L2 cache? I'm thinking of builind a pc and am considering 2 different processors.  The main difference is the L2 cache ... one at 6mb (and $50 more expensive) and the other at 1mb.  I'll be using it mostly for internet/school work/watching DVD's/etc ... with some casual gaming. I do game though, which is my main concern.

MacBook Pro graphics (gaming) capability?



I am thinking about buying a 15" MacBook Pro and I'd like to know how capable it is for gaming. It has 256MB of integrated graphics and 512MB of dedicated graphics that can be used in conjunction (I think). This would mean it could potentially have 768MB of video RAM... How well would this MacBook be at running high-end games such as Call of Duty 4? By the way, does OS X Leopard have, or support DirectX 10? And yes, I will be installing Windows STRICTLY for gaming because 90% of computer games are for Windows... Any computer gaming gurus please advise. Thanx!

Why do Windows users automatically jump on anything that puts Mac and Gaming in the same question? I've been gaming on Macs for years and with intel cpu's and bootcamp I can play both Mac and Windows games, in many cases faster than comparable Windows machines!



On paper the numbers look great, it doesn't quite work out to equivalent to 768MB of onboard, as shared RAM is never quite as fast, but assume &lt;roughly&gt; equivalent to 714MB or so of onboard (still pretty sweet though). Also the shared is only used by the secondary graphics processor (mmm, dual graphics processors...)



I also know that the MBPro runs Vista faster than most other laptops (I can feel a thumbs down or two coming for that comment) which implies faster gameplay too. I can't give a good answer on COD4 (I'm more into RTS so I haven't tried it) but the potential is there. COD4 is available for Leopard and even the slowest MBPro surpasses all the recommended system requirements (and the Mac version uses openGL, although you likely knew this already), what this translates to in actual gameplay I can't say without having tried it.



OS X doesn't support directx (directx is win specific, and directx 10 Vista only) but if you're installing Vista anyway it's support will make Leopard supporting it irrelevant.



Bottom line is the MBPro is a great portable gaming platform but I doubt you'll find someone on YA that's tried high end gaming on one. One option is to head over to Best Buy and ask the Mac expert to demo it (it's a $2600+ laptop, they might risk it to make the sale)



Sorry that doesn't totally answer your question but I hope it's at least helpful.

You make me laugh! You can only use 512MBs and DX is Windows ONLY. Mac can NEVER be as good as Windows for gaming because Mac uses X.org or X11 that pumps graphics through APIs. Windows can run functions directly off the card, so no game can be as good.

I have had good luck with Western Digital.  They honor their warranty which is always a good thing.  I've had a couple of WD drives for a few years now and they have been reliable.  Maxtor is a solid brand too.



A few tips... If you're using XP, run the disk clean up utility and disk defragment utility.  That might clean up some clutter.  Before buying a new hard drive, I would suggest reinstalling your operating system.  A fresh install can do wonders for a drive that feels clunky.  New PC's come with tons of extra junk you don't need and a new OS install can help.  Stay away from registry edit programs.  Not the best value IMO.



Good luck, Your Highness...

I have used a number of Western Digital over the years, found them very reliable. I usually change computers every 7 years, never had one die on me.



Seagate was one of original makers of hard drives, but their reliability had slipped a few years back. But they may have improved over the years.



Are you sure you don't just need to have it cleaned up good and defraged. This could could help it run better.



It goes places it shouldn't or has a mind of it's own, it may have viruses in it. Easily picked up off the web. You then will need a good virus scanner.



Good Luck!

You will probably find only a few brands to choose from:



Fujitsu
Hitachi
Samsung



They are all pretty much the same.



Concentrate on cache size, (bigger is better), access times - (smaller is better), and drive capacity - oh and price.

Can I take my Laptop back after this ?



I currently have a 15" Toshiba Satellite L305-S5865 it's running on vista Home/Office Edition I bought it back on the 28th of August. The reason I want to bring it back is, because the charger outlet is broken it works sometimes. But I have a feeling it's going to stop working all together. I also didn't realize how heavy it is, and I have a back problem so it's not really good for me to be carring something that heavy around for a long period of time.Saying that, I also want to trade it in for a lighter laptop maybe a Gateway or Dell somewhere in the same price range.



</question>



<additional details>



By the way I purchased it for Wal-Mart would I bring it back to Wal-Mart or the Toshiba company?



(Wal-Mart has that 15-day refund thing I'm not really sure exactly how it works)

If it falls under the return policy yes, otherwise the only thing you can do is take it in to repair the charger. In the future it would be wise to research laptop, before you buy them.



UPDATE: to added details.



Since the return is only 15 days, Walmart will not take it back, also for repairs you will have to contact Toshibia. Which the charger should be covered under the warranty.



I know hp has a thing where you can trade in your laptop for another one, so maybe toshibia has that too, but you probably still would have to pay some money towards it.

My guess is that the vendor is under an obligation to check out the charger outlet under the warranty - but not swap the hardware.



Basically you have changed you mind about what spec of machine you want. That will not be covered under the warranty. They will say you should have thought/researched more before spending your bucks.

There is no possible way to tell without knowing atleast how old it is. I guarentee it doesn't have windows mobile, and most likely doesn't have windows 3.1. There is no such thing as windows server 2003 so I'm venturing a guess that it has windows xp or 2000 installed. Also if you have the laptop go into the control panel, Then system, and it should tell you what it has installed on it.

If you can get an AMD, they have much better performance for less cost. Intel is overpriced, just ask the salesperson at the electronics store or look up intel on google.



Cross Acer off your list, it is a low end budget computer,



Dell and HP are great.



Toshiba is good depending which type you get.

I'd say go with the HP.
It has more speed, better graphics, big HDD capacity, and in terms of experience, very good. I own an HP myself and it's been my best laptop yet.



Don't forget, with the HP up there, you can also add on a built-in Verizon EV-DO card, so you can have Internet access anywhere that there's cell phone service. I own one of those, too, and I love it as well. It's just as fast as DSL, and well worth the money.



Hope this helps you out a bit.

I've worked in retail for quite a few years now and our place sells alot of laptops, we have sold Acer in the past, but stopped due to reliability issues, Dell, i can't really talk from experience, but most people who get them seem pretty happy with them, we currently sell HP, Toshiba and Fujitsu-Siemens, i hope to god we stop selling Fujitsu-Siemens they are terribly unreliable, must get about 1 in 30 back as faulty, HP used to be good but seem to be loosing some of their build quality maybe 1 in 50-60 comes back, and Toshiba, well we've sold more than 400 and only had 1 back (that wasn't user error), which speaks volumes.



Anyway, of the list you have there i'd have to go with the "Toshiba u400 Core Duo 1.8"  these little 13" laptops are great, they're powerful and yet due to the small screen size they have pretty impressive battery lifes too



And for all the "MAC RULES" coments, well, the Mac OS is very stable, and has it's uses (mainly business), but if you want to be able to walk into a shop and buy a printer without having to ask if it's Mac compatible, then Mac isn't for you, if you want to be able to buy a game without having to check it works with Mac, then Mac isn't for you, or buy a webcam... the list is endless, and frankly it's a pain in the ***...



however, if you're only going to use it for checking e-mails, listening to music, viewing photos, and doing school/work stuff on it then it might be worth thinking about, but you will have to part with alot of money for such a fashion item...



Oh, and for the ill informed, Intel has been beating everything AMD has to offer for a few years now, the Core 2 Duo blows the AMD processors out of the water, especialy when it comes to games and media
The ranking of processors goes like this (worst performance first)
Intel Celeron
AMD Sempron
Intel Pentium
AMD Athlon
AMD Turion (laptops only, energy efficient chipset and components, paired with an AMD Athlon, for better battery life)
AMD Athlon 64
Intel Centrino Duo (Laptops only, energy efficient chipset and components paired with a Core 2 Duo, for better battery life)
Intel Core 2 Duo



The only test an AMD processor will beat an Intel chip in (the same class) is energy efficiency (by which i mean an AMD Athlon 64 Vs Core 2 Duo, or Centrino Duo Vs AMD Turion)

Will the new Macbook match my current (older) Desktop for gaming?



Hi. Right now I've got a Macbook (old intel one with gma integrated graphics) and a windows desktop I use for casual gaming. Its specs are as follows:



-Pentium D 2.8GHz
-2GB DDR2
-ATI x1300 pro 256MB
-Windows XP SP3



This desktop runs games like HL2, TF2 and Civilization 4 pretty well with medium to high settings. Other games like Bioshock, COD4 quickly become unplayable even with low settings. Basically, DX8 games run well, but anything else you can forget.



It's cumbersome having to manage 2 computers, plus I'm moving to a smaller apartment, so I'd like to sell them both and get one of the new aluminum Macbooks with the GeForce 9400M integrated graphics. For the specs, go here:



http://www.apple.com/ca/macbook/specs.ht...



I'd likely go with the 2.0GHz model, with 2GB DDR3 RAM. My question is--will this new Macbook be as good as, or better than, my current desktop for the type of games I've listed above using bootcamp and WinXP? I don't do anything too hardcore, but I'd like to run games like Civ4, Simcity4, HL2, TF2, and maybe some other FPS games on low settings... as long as the frame rate is decent.



If it will be the same, I'll probably pick one up. If worse, I'll have to think of something else.



Thanks!

If your CD is stuck inside the driver and you can not get it to eject.  Get a paper clip and straighten it out so you can poke  in the small hole in front of the DVD driver..That will cause the driver to open.

The disk is in your drive.



It sounds like the DVD drive opens & closes so there is no need for the paperclip method.



Try this:
open the drive, carefully turn the computer upside down, close the drive, turn in right side up, open the drive & it should be there.



If that doesn't work. unplug the computer, open your computer case, remove the DVD drive from the case, unscrew the drive, carefully open the drive (this will most likely void the warranty by the way), remove the disk & carefully put it all back together.

you should take anti static precautions before starting
for the soldering make sure the joint is clean and free from old solder (you can buy solder braid for this is suck up molten solder) then just apply solder and the iron at the same time let it flow don't over do the solder and everything should be fine

Dell laptops come with a restore partition to restore it to factory condition. When you see the dell splashscreen when you turn it on press Ctrl+F11. This will bring up the restore program. Just follow the intructions and when its complete turn off the computer and leave it till christmas.

Click on the start button and in the search box type:



c:\windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep
.exe
(type the above without any spaces and exactly as shown)



A box will appear, under system cleanup action choose "Enter system out of box experience"



And on Shutdown options choose "Shutdown"



This will then reset your laptop as new. Do it once to test so you can make sure it works. Be very careful what instructions you follow on this post as you could damage your computer.



Dont open your christmas present again, its not nice your mum has worked hard for this present. Just wait and appreciate it.



Charli - Use my option, its called sysprep. There is no need to do a system restore this can often miss out drivers therefore giving you away. All my option does is tell the setup to run again on the next boot.

ebay, that'd be your best shot, but it may be like refurbished(meaning there was something wrong with it and it was fixed) or used. Or you could just buy a refurbished one for like six hundred bucks. They can't be that bad and maybe you could get a bit of warranty in case

X-box 360 and Laptop. Can I connect them?



I would like to know if I can connect my laptop to my X-box 360? The laptop is connected to a wireless router. I tried to connect the two by using a ethernet from the X-box to the lap top with a usb. My laptop did not recognize the device. And my X-box did not acknowledge the connection. Microsoft support was not supportive. What a surprise! I have Vista home premium as an operating system. Can anyone help me out?

alright, connect the Xbox 360 to the router with an Ethernet.  then make sure the laptop is connected on the wireless.



after that go to Media Center on your laptop.  go to settings, then "add media extender".  after that go to the "media" thing in your home menu on the 360.  follow the instructions on the computer & 360 and you'll be all set.

You can use the media center built into Vista to connect the two for media files, but they both have to be on the same network.



They can be connected by any wired/wireless ethernet combination, as long as you're router can handle the bandwidth.  The Media Center Extender will explain the bandwidth during setup.



Open up windows media center on your laptop while both the 360 and the laptop are on.  Scroll to tasks, then add extender.  At this point you will need to get the 360 into the media center mode, by selecting media, then media center (I believe)  You will eventually be given an 8 digit code from the 360 that you need to type into the laptop.  You then have to setup preferences such as allowing the files to be viewed, etc.



After this it should connect.  You may have to try it twice.  When you get into the media center on the xbox you may not see any files.  You can add media to the media center through either the laptop or the xbox.  Entire folders can be added under Tasks, Settings, Library Setup.

There are two types of MacBook Pro's. The first generation, which is all silver and the new generation, which is silver with black keys.  However, if you are looking for a price on one, the best idea is to check apple.com. If you want one that is cheaper, you can find refurbished and discounted ones on

Acer Aspire 5100 Start up question..?



Okay, so.. one day while surfing the web my computer decided to freeze, I didn't find a restart button so I pushed the Power button..
then.. I go to restart it back up.. it asks me to check the C drive so I said okay and waited, overnight it still hadn't left 0% so I said that was useless and tried re-booting it again, skipped the disk check (i tried a few more times) and went on to where it gives me options;
safe mode
safe mode with usb crap etc etc
start windows normally



or start windows with the last settings that worked.
I tried them ALL nothing worked, it just ends up restarting itself NEVER bringing me to my desktop / computer screen.



SO I read the manual, and it says to enable eRecovery on the main menu (f2) on the acer screen which I did, then it tells me to follow the instructions on the eRecovery menu after pressing alt + f10 at the acer logo on start-up.
WHICH I DID,



THEN



it keeps freezing at 18% while im trying to recover my computer to acers default settings.



Acer doesn't come with any CDs and To phone in for help costs a minimum of $35 ..and i'm at a loss..
PLEASE IF YOU CAN HELP that'd be more then wonderful!



Thank you for your time.

it needs room to breath.. sometims i just set it on one leg, so the air can circulate where the fans and stuff are... also they sell laptop coolers, this way you can set it anywhere and it will stay cool. Basically, the answer to your question is, it will overheat due to lack of cooling.

Would it REALLY make a difference to switch from 7200rpm to 5400rpm HDD?



Well you see, for details that are quite complicated and are not really needed for this question, I am only able to buy a laptopthat only comes available with a 5400rpm and not 7200rpm, everything else about the laptop is nearly perfect. However, this 5400rpm makes me hesitate to much on whether to buy it or not.



Please help me in this one problem on what would really make a difference and what choice should I make. Thanks.

Higher speed equates to faster read / write time.



Whether it makes much difference depends upon what you do.  If you do a lot of storage heavy types of applications it can make a difference.  If you do not do storage heavy application, you will not notice it.



Let's say you do typical e mail messages (mainly text), word processor documents, small spread sheet work, little to no photo editing or graphically intense work - then you will not notice the slower rpm hdd.



Even if you do heavy applications, you will not likely see this as a deal breaker.

RPM means rounds per minute. With 7200 rpm you get faster reading along with faster writing to your hard drive. And yes there are 7200rpm laptops hard drives. I wouldn't worry about that, the difference is almost unnoticeable, then you can always exchange your hard drive later if you won't be happy with it

It doesn't make too much difference. 5400rpm is not bad at all from 7200rpm. A little difference in speed. As for battery usage 5400rpm is advantageous because it consume less power than 7200rpm.

I think all laptop drives are 5400 to conserve battery life. It takes a lot more power to run the drive spindle motor at the higher speed.



If not all then almost all. I wouldn't worry about it.

you laptop should have a 'service tag' it's just a white sticker with a series of number+letters in it. you can use that to find all the parts that has been put into your laptop from the manufacturer, in this case Dell



1st link below shows helps you find your service tag



2nd link is the place you want to type that tag into and find out about your laptop's original configuration

Just got a wireless router and laptop...how do I get online at home?



Hi,



I have Comcast for my home internet service provider (this is a cable set-up using a cable modem that hooks into the main home computer using an ethernet cable)...I just recently got a laptop that has a wireless N card built in and I was told I just needed a wireless N router to get it online wirelessly at home....I am having a hard time though because I just assumed I could hook the router (netgear wndr3300 is the model) to the computer and then hook the cable modem (which is a motorola if that matters) into the router and then plug both into power...when I do this, however, I end up getting a "limited or no connectivity" connection on the main computer and cant get it online...and then, obviously, I also cant get the laptop online...



please tell me what I need to do. I am very frustrated and have lots I need to do on the internet tonight. Thanks!

I reset my rotor.
I've cleaned up my laptop.



I have tried many differnt things. On my laptop, when I click the botton for it to go wireless, it remains blue(which means its off)
When it is able to go wireless or the feature is turned on its red.



Right now... no matter which way i turn the button, it remains blue (off)



I can still connect to the internet through my home computer.

could be the hard drive has developed an issue - boot from your windows cd - go to the repair / recovery console options, type LOGON to access the Windows installation, type CHKDSK /R to check for disk errors and repair, might take a while depending on the size of the disk - this will confirm if the hard drive has problems and attempt to repair

Question: Why don't you trust online shops, Dell and HP's online stores are secure, unless you have a virus on your computer, there's nothing for you to loose.



Anyway, again, you can't get future proof, there will always be a new machine that's better, processor speed doubles every 18 months.



It's all what you need, if you need email, word processing and web surfing, a cheaper system would be fine. If you are looking for gaming or video encoding, i'd go higher end. It's your personal choice, and as you don't like to buy online (again, I don't see why you should - a Visa card protects you from unauthorised purchases), go to your local PC world and look around. If you need to buy games you will be spending more, but otherwise go and find your deal.

I have a Shuttle G30S2 PLUS w/C2D E6600...and I am thinking of upgrading the CPU. I am most interested in the E8400/8500/8600. Do you think the impreovement in speed is worth the extra dollars over the E6600.

Before buying a CPU you need to contact shuttle about wheather a 45nm processor will be recognized with your motherboard.  Also ask if there is a bios update that will let you upgrade to the 45nm processors.  An e6600 would do well in games if you just had an upgraded graphics card.  That would give you the biggest performance gain per dollar, and like the other guy said, if you have at least 2gigs of ram if not 3 or 4 gigs...  http://us.shuttle.com/Scgsupport/Sys_Sup...

a Spyware and a Virus check and nothing
And im not going to get any virus's because my vista isnt connected to the internet at the moment

Computer Keeps shutting off?



Hi,



No this is not a virus question. I have a sager N2090 laptop with 2.4 ghz intel centrino, 2 gig ram, and an Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video card.



For some reason I can't play any of the new games on medium settings. I tried mass effect(low settings), Fable lost chapters(medium and this is an old game), and red alert 3(medium) and my computer just shuts off literally.



I meet the requirements for those game and the hardware seems adequate. Any suggestions why this is happening or how i can fix this? Or is my computer really too crappy for those games.



Thanks

You could have a faulty motherboard if it shuts off, faulty psu, gpu, i would guess psu as it happens quickly, put the laptop under stress and see if it does it still like, try running 3dmark06 and benchmark and see if it crashes, if it does it will prop be psu as the card isn't gettign enough power.

the CPU looks good BUT you should NOT get stuck with (2) 9500 GTs & only 2 gb of RAM because those would be your system bottleneck. Having to settle with 2 9500gt is setting yourself up for a bad investment (in a good gaming PC). I suggest you take out the 2x 9500 and aim for 1x 9800gt or gtx (if you are on budget) at least you can always upgrade it later for SLI. Also 2 more gb of RAM is not expensive at all. If you can choose make sure you KNOW for sure your PSU will support SLI so you wont have to buy a new one later.



9500gt is not 'good gaming' it's actually 'very average gaming' and for the sake of future proof and expandability, get 1 single good card instead of trying to get SLI with 2 average cards.



If you ever changed you mind about nvidia there's always the ATi graphic option open for the Intel x38, x48, or p45 chipset mobo with ATi 4850 (very affordable and VERY GOOD IN CROSSFIRE X) or 4870 (even better :)

There is no Q9450, just a Q9550, and a Q9400, but i'd go with the Q9550. With good cooling you could over-clock it to 3.8Ghz. The memory is fine. I wouldn't go for a dual 9500GT, i'f go for a XFX GTX260 XXX. It's way better. The soundcard is fine. But the motherboard is absolute crap! Get a Asus P5Q Pro, when doing that you could have 1066mhz RAM memory modules if you wish.

Is is possible to use backup disk after restoring system to manufacturing specs?



It was necessary to restore my computer to manufacturing specs'. The dsl modem was replaced with the computer working really well for a day..then it would not connect to the server..the modem checked out and I was advised to contact the computer support team.



To make a long story short..after hours of working with the support team and speaking with three different technicians I was advised that the only thing left to do was to restore the computer to manufacturers specs..



Is it possible to load the back up disk that contains photos that I've lost, or will this attempt, or action, create more problems?

No. The Windows backup disks are useless. This has been the case since Windows 95. This is because a certain software OEM that starts with Micro chooses to employ people with limited common sense. Furthermore. they choose not to do any real research & development (R&D). The world at large is their beta tester.



Your question needs to be prosed directly to Microxxxx.



The good news is that there are programs that fill this void. They can restore your system back onto a clean hard drive as it was when you ran it. The most notable, and the first, is Ghost. The reality is that most people actually learn this the hard way.

Have you tried to installdrivers for this device? if not this is what you need to do! go to the sony support section and download the drivers for it. Now install them. Your floppy drive should auto detect so check it is set up in the bios to do this.



If this does not work then unplug everything from the back of your computer and unscrew the back keeping one hand on a metal part of the case(this will stop electro static discharge) check all the cabling is fitted properly and has not come loose. If this is all fine then put your machine cover backon and turn it on again. If this dont work you maybe looking at a new dvd and floppy drive.

How to make pen drive as ram?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Adding system memory (typically referred to as RAM) is often the best way to improve a PC's performance, since more memory means more applications are ready to run without accessing the hard drive. However, upgrading memory can be difficult and costly, and some machines have limited memory expansion capabilities, making it impossible to add RAM.



Windows Vista introduces Windows ReadyBoost, a new concept in adding memory to a system. You can use non-volatile flash memory, such as that on a universal serial bus (USB) flash drive, to improve performance without having to add additional memory "under the hood."



The flash memory device serves as an additional memory cache—that is, memory that the computer can access much more quickly than it can access data on the hard drive. Windows ReadyBoost relies on the intelligent memory management of Windows SuperFetch and can significantly improve system responsiveness.



It's easy to use Windows ReadyBoost. When a removable memory device such as a USB flash drive or a secure digital (SD) memory card is first inserted into a port, Windows Vista checks to see if its performance is fast enough to work with Windows ReadyBoost. If so, you are asked if you want to use this device to speed up system performance. You can choose to allocate part of a USB drive's memory to speed up performance and use the remainder to store files.



Hope that helps, you must be using Windows Vista!

I wouldn't use a vacuum, but you can use compressed air.  Computer stores (as well as some non-computer stores) sell compressed air cans for cleaning electronics.  Just follow the directions on the can and  you can blow the dust off components.  If your system is extremely dusty, take it outside so the dust doesn't settle around the room.



For the memory card issue, it could be dirt related but not very likely.  If you can test the card on another system or use another card to test on your system, you can figure out the more likely cause.

Nothing to do with dust here, yes you can clean it sure..vacuum etc...You have a RAM issue here and nothing else.
1.Upgrade your RAM
2.Defragment your Harddrive to compress files and make more space.
3.Perform Disc clean up (Sytems maintenance) for now until you have your new RAM, the disc clean up will delete temporary files which are stored in a temp folder, but it will not hold for long then you have to do it again.

There could be a problem with the video output in the computer. Usually this posed a problem with CRT monitors and trying to make them do things they can't do. If this is an LCD monitor, then I would think it would be harder to damage them. It's difficult for me to believe you are having this much bad luck with monitors. I think there could be a chance that you are having video output problems.

Both are technically the same. Pentium D was the first attempt of The Dual Processor. As it eveolved the Dual Core came into play.



Both are still Dual processors. Just the D is the older child of the Dual core and not as advanced as the Dual core.



as for if it would work with your mother board. Probably yes, since they should be backwards compatible. But your better off getting the newer Dual core rather then the D.

Better do research before you use SKYPE. I've read too many articles that they can and do monitor and retain conversations.

Need other opinions on upgrades?



I inherited a work computer and it is a mess. It has 2 hard drives in it. It has an 80 gig and 300 gig. It has 512mb of RAM. The hard drive is almost full on the 300 and it is hooked to a security system. I can't even run a defrag (xp) on it b/c it's so full. I can't get on the internet anymore with it. The request just time out. I was thinking to solve this problem I would get a bigger hard drive and add RAM. What else should I do? Do you guys think this will fix it?

I do not think that will fix it. I recommend that you reinstall Windows, even if you have to buy the Windows XP software.



The second solution would be to search for extremely large files that are unnecessary and delete them first. Delete the temp files and uninstall some programs.Then Defrag.

Ram will definitely help your computer.  Upgrade the Ram to it's max and what you can afford.



I would not bother going with new harddrives, just clean up the hdd's that you have.



After you have done all that, make sure that windows update is run and up to date.



after all that is done and you have rebooted.



Run Crap Cleaner on it to help clear out some of the old junk:

Okay, in my opinion, I think that you should try to see if there are any better PCs or laptops available because I think that you've got a dud job here. I too was able to get a laptop for free due to the placewhere I got my old one fixed decided to replace it rather than try to fix it; in the end, the new one was awful and I am currently having to work with slow maintenance and performance, which frankly sucks. If you're going to try to fix it at all, see if you can wipe the hard-drives if they have nothing to do with you, I would also suggest upgrading to a suitable anti-spyware program such as Norton or AVG. I would also suggest that you do not upgrade your system to Windows Vista because although it may look flashy, smart and fast, in reality, it is slow due to the flashy things that have been used and it takes up more room on your hard-drive.
I hope this helps you x

Which cpu is better, AMD or Intel?



Can someone please explain which cpu is better and maybe a couple reasons why..  Such as running temp, speed, etc.  Im thinking of getting a new comp, primarily for gaming and media...  Im wanting to spend around 200 on the cpu, and I also want 1 vid card, probably an nVidia 9800, or maybe even an ATI 3870, or even a 4870 if I can afford it.  Please give a reason as to why you think the cpu is better, if possible, other than just "Intel is better!", thanks! Also, is it necessary to stick with ATI if getting an AMD proc?

Ugh, thats like asking which is better, ford or chevy!!



To be honest, it doesn't matter all that much.  Both companies make quality products, and each company has its fan boi's.



I personally prefer the Intel processors, why?  Three reasons, one, I buy retail boxed processors, these come with a intel fan assembly, which is usually high quality, and I won't be replacing it during the life of the computer.  Second, I like the thermal protection that intel processors have built it.  I have yet to fry a intel chip from overheating.  They will turn off the computer if it gets too hot, protecting the CPU from damage.  Most AMD's now have this feature, though I do have a stack of bad AMD chips, as opposed to one bad intel chip sitting next to me.  Third, the 3 year warranty on a retail boxed cpu.  If that chip fails after 3 years, I'm ready for the new computer by then, if it does happen to fail under warranty, no sweat, everything is covered (CPU wise)



As far as sticking with ATI if you go with AMD, it doesn't matter a great deal, but I have found ATI usually works better with AMD, but I have systems with them both. Intel and AMD with ATI video cards.



If you do purchase a NVidia video card, try to find one with a 3 year warranty.  I love NVidia, but at my place, I have had 3 cards fail all in the same amount of time (bout 16-18 months).  From what I can find this is a manufacturing issue, but after 1 year, nobody wants to help since its out of warranty.  Since the video card is usually more then any other part in the computer(for gamers), I'd want to protect that investment.

thanks.  Almost perfect, except you didn't ever tell me which one YOU thought was better...  hehe...  thanks for your very thorough answer, though...  I definitely will look into getting an extended warranty if the regular one isn't long enough.

If tou want the best CPU, choose Intel, if you want a regular use CPU, use AMD. Both companies make excellent CPUs, but actually the faster CPU was made by Intel, and Intel`s Quad Core CPUs are faster. Intel CPU`s are aldo good because produce very low heat compared to AMD`s. AMD coolers are also a lot noisier than Intel. If you want a gaming PC as you said then your best choice is Intel, specially if you want a Quad Core. A good one is the q6600, which i think is like $180

Vista not booting most of the time?



My Windows Vista Home Premium has not been booting most of the time whether in safe mode or not.  Sometimes it does though.  On top of that, these wierd images pop up then freeze my computer.  When I ran the boot sequence, it stops while loading crcdisk.sys. I just installed an old usb 2.0 port along with a relatively old disc drive.



I then removed those and it seems to be fine.  Any insight would be extremely welcome!

It's what is trying to load after crcdisk.sys that is causing the problem.
I've seen this issue before & in that case it was also resolved by removing a hard drive.



Seems the problem was that the power supply lacked the juice to feed everything. Max out the power supply and Vista will not run properly.

Hi,



I would suggest you wipe the computers hard drive with the disk that you got with the computer when you bought it, Then install all your other programs that were previously on the computer beforehand. I have had the same problem with vista home premium and this worked for me and i'm sure it will for you also.

Problem with my Media Center?



I have a Gateway computer from 2006. It has Windows Media Player on it. I've been burning CDs on it for 2 years and it's never given me trouble. The other day I burned a CD, and it worked just fine. I simply turned off my moniter and went to bed. The next morning I went to burn another CD (using songs I've used before) and it said it was a "data disc" however it was the same brand of CD I'd used the night before. I didn't think much of it but the CD dosn't play on any of my CD players. I thought it was just a dud but it's been a week and I've tried 5 other CDs and the same problem. It's so bizzare. Why all of a sudden is it not working??? It's very frustrating, I need help!

Sounds like a settings has been changed in your burning software.  You need to be sure you are burning an Audio CD and not a Data CD.  This can be changed in various ways depending on your software.



An Audio CD can play music in an conventional CD player, but a Data CD will burn the songs as mp3s that can only be played on computers, DVD players or some CD players.

I have a S6500nx Compaq Presario built in 2003 and I would like to do some light gaming but I've got to make changes and I don't know what I need to change or if it's worth it. The computer is running ok so that should not be a problem. I bought a game called Test Drive and it said I needed more memory so I added 1gb. Then it wouldn't display so I put in a graphics card I already had (Radeon9600se 128m) and that gave me a picture but you couldn't really see it. But that card causes the computer to some times not boot up. The power supply is 250 watts so I assume that is a problem. So, any recommendations. I guess I need a better power supply and a better graphics card, but will I still have something not good enough. The specs on my computer are:

Given your system is limited to the AGP video interface, it might be time to think about an upgrade.  There are decent AGP video cards for gaming, but most of the newer games will run much better with the newer PCI Express based cards.  For light gaming though, you are in that "tough decision" zone.  Upgrading your video card and memory should get you all but the more graphic intense games.  Unfortunately t his doesn't mean you'll be able to run most games on high or medium settings.  You may find that you are running on low to medium on some games.



** Edit **
Alex - Unless the asker needs a mobile computer, recommending a laptop will only increase their cost compared to an equivalent desktop system.  Laptops are less flexible and often have limited video card options (which is a primary factor in gaming performance).

Processor Speed?



Honestly I do not like Windows XP Home Edition, I Windows XP Pro, it is designed for Pictures and High Quality. Good for Gaming. It could be your Processor, it it 3GHz? That'll do for Light Gaming.



Just let me know the Speed of your Processor, RAM, and more about your gaming card.



It could be that just your motherboard can't support everything. The Power supply would do for Light Gaming.



P.S.  I have a 2.8GHz Processor, and only 960 MB of RAM, I should have more Ram like 2gb but It works alright.

If your a light gamer then you can upgrade you Graphics card because test drive needs 256mb and also you need to upgrade your processor to at least  2.5GHz processor with about 2mb or higher cache and you might need to buy a 2Gb ram card

Will 4-pin CPU 12v power connector work in 8-pin?



If i get a motherboard with an 8-pin CPU 12v power connector, will a 4-pin connector from the power supply work correctly if i plug it into the 8-pin only using one side of it? http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as... (link to motherboard)

Yes, according to your motherboard manual located here http://www.asrock.com/mb/manual.asp?Mode... on page 36 it says the 8-pin cpu connector is backward compatible with the 4-pin power supply connector and shows you how to connect it.

Your should really think about upgrading your power supply as the motherboard you link to is very modern. PSUs should run you $30-$50 and will give the appropriate voltage to your CPU, memory, etc. etc. Look for PSUs from Corsair, Antec, PC Power & Cooling and OCZ.

Yes, it will work just fine, just don't expect a good overclock with only 4 pins as opposed to 8. Also make sure to plug the 4 pin into holes 1,2,3 and 4 and not 5,6,7 and 8 or there will be problems lol

No, this will NOT work. You are basically reasoning "Hey, this has half as many pins. I could just use half on the board." No. The board was made for all 8 to be used. You risk damaging multiple things if you try this, plus it flat out won't work.

You can change your startup music (sound) to what ever WAV file you want.



In theory I dare to bet this sound from the game is probably in some MP3 type format.  Really all you would have to do is Convert the MP3 to a WAV and then put that as your Startup Sound.



You could search the internet for a wav format of that sound.  I had a bunch of Simpsons sounds that I use to use back in Windows 3.1 days.

Go to settings/system/device manager and delete the sound device and shut down. reboot and you will get the message "new device found" with the option to insert disk or install from OS. Select install from OS and see if Windows has the file in the system, if it is you can install from the OS, if not you will need the driver file

Please Rate My Rig!!!?



Hi Guys



Man i am sooooo hyped just  finished my first ever build and its running like a beast, I just want to see what other people would rate it out of 10, although it isn't completely finished yet its still flying but i havent played any games as i have not got a very good graphics card in yet (dont get paid until Friday)



:-( lol.



Ok Here Goes these are the parts i currently have:



Antec 900 Ultimate Gamers Case



ASUS P5K Premium Black Pearl Edition



Intel Q6600 Quad Core running at 2.4Ghz



(not sure how to overclock yet so left it alone for now)



4GB (2 x 2GB) OCZ Reaper HPC PC2-8500 RAM 1066Mhz



Silencer 610W true PSU



Windows Vista Ultimate 64Bit



Here is what i have left to buy:



1TB Samsung Spinpoint F1 HDD



2 x ATI Radeon HD4850's running crossfire.



I wont lie it has cost me quite a bit of money but its well worth it for the results and i would have been charged a hell of a lot more trying to find this in any shop/website.



Thanks for all your votes people!!!



</question>



<additional details>



ok?? a bit better then ok lol



its a bit late for me to buy different parts now but the reason i purchased the Quad was because i do a lot of multi tasking and this is handling everything i throw at it with ease, but i may look into throwing another 4GB RAM in not sure yet, and Vista hasn't cost me anything so im not bothered about that but i will be getting the new windows when it is finally released.

It's pretty good but I hate Vista and since you're only using 4Gb of RAM, I would go with XP. Besides the newest Windows is coming out sometime next year.



I also wouldn't go with a quad core since no applications can utilize anything more than a dual core right now so it's a waste of money. Get a 3.2GHz dual core.

XP.
Thing is Microsoft is forcing you to buy vista because new games needing directx 10 (which vista supports) is required. Such games requiring vista are Halo 2 and the pc version of GTA4. besides that XP is the btter choice. Alot of people i know use XP and play their games

For new games you will be required to have DirectX 10, which is only on Vista, go premium or Ultimate. 64 bit is good too :D

Well Vista has DirectX 10, but I had a few compatibility problems with some of my games using this OS. Sometimes it will freeze or crash. Windows XP is more stable, but it only goes up to Direct X 9. Also, there is no 64-bit XP.

Well between my family, and me. I would have to say XP. My mom uses win 98, my step dad uses linux/unix, my best friend (like a bro to me) uses vista, I use XP, My wife uses millenium, and my wifes dads now ex fiance used Apple, which he used also. My personal opinion is XP. I say this because Vista is soo glitchy and you need a minimum requirements to run it properly or it glitches. My friend has Vista also and he can't play games really. That and all the good games aren't compatable for Vista. My friends Vista won't install my Halo and it won't work at all, Neither will the first guild wars. So I would so stick to XP, even if they make new games for vista, their still compatable for XP. At least until Vista updates and the bugs, crashes, glitches are all worked out. My friend is a gamer, and he's had to reformatt his new less than 6 month old Vista about 3 times cause of it's errors. Not worth it to me. I've used the same XP hard drive and never had a problem. Unless I was sick of seeing everything and did a reformatt, but that's different. I just like reformatting XD. anyways, XP defenitly.

64bit Vista. It's over 10% faster than 32 bit. XP and DX9 are yesterdays news in extreme gaming. I have 2 extreme gaming rigs, one with XP and one with Vista. My XP gamers colllecting dust as everyone plays Crysis, Lost Planet, Bioshock etc in DX10 on the Vista rig. If someone has an old or wimpy tower XP would be a better choice but you won't have any probs running it on the rig you plan on buying. DX10's where its at in gaming mostly because DX10 runs Shader 4, DX9 only Shader 3.

They are both very good and the specs are similar, processor speed 2.4GH on both and price is ok.



You should compare the main things 1st which is:
-Processor speed 2.4GHZ dual core (both got them)
-RAM on ACER is 2x1GB incl.AND max is 8GB and supports DDR2 ( Fastest)
-RAM on HP 3GB incl.max doesent say and no support for DDR2.
-HardDrive on Acer, 2x500GB ....TOP.
-HP HardDrive only 1x500GB ok.



I personally have had since 7 years Acer computers and they are great, I would go for the Acer one, fast,powerfull,hardware upgrade easy to the latest Technologie so no need to get a new Motherboard which supports DDR2 RAM for Xample.



Hope it makes sence

It depends on what you want to do.



The Acer has a slightly faster CPU and twice as much storage space which looks like it may be a RAID-0 (makes data transfer on the hard drive fast; ideal for video editing). Both have pretty lame graphics cards tho with neither being significantly better than the other, while they could play a lot of modern games they are far from ideal. However you could always upgrade the card to something better.

Well, it is all good, except for that really crap graphics card.  The latest ATI 4870 is miles better than the one that you get with that machine.  See if you can get in touch with them and get them to change the graphics card, you will be dissapointed if you keep that pile of poo in the case.

You question makes no sense. What you should be asking, is it better to dual boot with Boot Camp or as a VM using Parallels or VMware.  VMware and Parallels do the same thing, run it in a Virtual Machine. Your not "dual booting".



That all depends if you want to stay in the OS X operating system while your running.



And if your asking which one you should use. Personal Preference. I have heard good things about VMware Fusion 2 though.

You don't download better sound, and it is not Free.  Do what the first answer said  and go into the bios and disable the onboard sound.  It usually isn't all that good, you are right.  Don't forget about your speakers-  the best sound card is worthless with lousy or inadequate speakers.



What he is saying to do is to buy a sound card.  Also understand that you may not want the best there is and/or have the money to spend on it.  Go to a computer store and listen to what they have, but BE CAREFUL and remember that they are out to sell you something and may not care what they have to tell you to do it.  Better yet, find one of your friend's machines and see how it sounds and go from there.  Also get a friend that knows how to install the card do it if you don't know how.  Don't do it by yourself the first time if you can avoid it.  It is not hard at all to do, but if you do it wrong it could cost you more than you were planning on.

Probably not an issue at all. Whenever you plug in a USB device or turn a printer on the computer makes a noise to notify you of the presence of a "new" USB device. Also makes a sound when you unplug the device or turn the printer off. A "low-high" tone when you plug it in and a "high-low" tone when you unplug it. When you have a USB device like a cam plugged in there is a icon on the right of the toolbar that says "Safely remove hardware" that you are supposed to click on and choose whatever youre going to yank then it gives you a notice that it is safe to remove it. If you haven't done that disconnecting your cam you may need to reinstall the software for it. Could be simply changing the configuration of the software you use for the cam.  I assume the "thump" you're referring to is coming from the tower not the printer as you said it makes the same sound when you plug your cam into the tower?

doesn't sound like a problem and to get your printer to recognize when your camera is plugged in try reinstalling the printer and the camera driver if it came with one if that doesn't work uninstall the driver and reinstall it and it should work again



but the thump isn't anything to be concerned about it may just be the print head hitting the side of the case while it's going through its cleaning process

Did it always thump? If not then i would take it to a computer repair shop
If it has always thumped then probably not a problem



Could be (if its a laser printer) the heating bit hitting against a big roller it uses
This isn't a problem

My pc drivers are stuffed?



I just got my pc upgraded. I got a new cpu (intel dual core 2.5 ghz), I got my motherboard upgraded, and i got a new graphics card (NVIDIA GTX 280). I got these put in and connected up by a professional. With the graphics card i didnt have the cd, so i think the professional guy installed the correct drivers onto my pc from the internet. I got home, plugged the pc in, it started up fine. But when i play need for speed prostreet i tried to change the graphics settings but then my pc crashed and so i left it. Then 30 minutes later the colours were all messed up and there was a message saying that the display drivers didnt function normally. So i restarted the pc and it started fine.When i played bioshock i played it on highest detail settings and it ran smoothly. But when i paused it and clicked "Exit to windows" the display drivers stuffed up again. So i went to NVIDIA.com and downloaded the latest drivers for the GTX 280, when i installed them correctly it required me to restart the pc. So i restarted it and now everything on the screen is big and zoomed in. When i right click on the screen to go to properties so i can change the resolution it doesnt do anything, then the colours go weird and theres all these massive pixels and weird colours and it just stays freezed like that. So what do i do? I cant contact the professional because hes not available on the weekends. Please help me! Im stuck and my stupid pc wont let me do anything to fix it. Any suggestions?
Thanks any help is greatly apreciated!

<answer>



Some "professional"...  Anybody can say they are a professional or an expert and we don't realize to the contrary till after we Pay them.



I don't know everything, but where is the Driver CD that should have come with the Video Card?  Not only that but there are boxes, directions and antistatic bags that come with it too.



If You bought the stuff yourself then it is up to you to make sure the cards and everything else is compatible with the motherboard.  You also need to make sure that the card(s) can handle the software you want to run.  Understand that a computer is a SYSTEM (a group of interrelated parts, and they ALL must be compatible with the motherboard).  Normally a piece of software will tell you the minimum specs your computer needs for it to run right.



IF the Professional bought all the stuff then be aware of the following:



Some "professionals" just keep driver cd's, manuals and other stuff cuz they know most people don't know enough to ask for them.  If they are dishonest they  also do it because your drivers could get whacked for some reason, so you call this professional back and tell them what is going on.  He tells you he needs to see the machine and to bring it in.  Then he says "something broke that was not under warranty" and charges you for it when all they did was to reinstall the drivers from the CD they should have given you in the first place.



I hate to say it but if you don't know how to upgrade a machine then you are at this person's mercy.  There are also a number of reasons you could be having problems:  the card could be bad, either one or both downloads could be corrupt (not very likely but it could happen), you could have a virus.



You can always take it somewhere else and get another opinion.



The bad thing is you will have to pay for it all over again and the second person may not be any better than the first.  Don't tell them that another company did it.  Just tell them you had a friend do it and they are on vacation or something.  IF this second opinion starts bad-mouthing your "friend" then that is a big red flag right there.  Never trust any business that asks you who did the work the first time.  If they are honest they will not ask you that in the first place.



One thing you can do is to turn the machine off and remove the video card.  Put it in an antistatic bag temporarily and turn the machine on.  The pc will beep and complain because a machine will not boot without video.  Turn the machine off and reinstall the card.  When you turn the machine back on windows should see the card and at least install standard vga drivers for it.  Try it like that for a bit just to test basic functionality.  I would find the Driver CD for that card and not use the downloaded ones.  The only other thing to do is to test the card on another machine with the correct drivers.  Before you do that read the motherboard manual for your upgraded machine and make sure you bought the right type of card (some boards require 1.5 Volt cards).

Neither. Go with the just released ATI 4670. It destroys both those cards bad and is only $79. Unlike the 1650 the 4670 supports DX10.1 in case you have or ever put Vista in. Here's a review of the 4670:

How can I take programs off my old PC and install them on my new PC.?



Can you ghost an image of a hard drive and put that image on another PC and expect it to work (different components etc)? I have an old PC with programs on it and I want to copy the system onto a new PC so I can use the same programs. Or can you use a program to extract the programs in some way? Alcohol 120% ?

Ghosting will just destroy the new system as it will load all the wrong drivers causing blue screen failures. You can not just copy programs over, as they also need several library files and many registry entries to run. This is why they need installers.

Yes, actually that is the best thing to use for cleaning thermal compound.  Heck I don't know why that other guy is answering in a hardware section if he has never cleaned thermal paste...  The major thing with the thermal paste is to be sure, very sure you do not get any on the pins of the AM2 processor.  If it gets down at the bottom of the chip and makes 2 pins get connection via the thermal compound it will short the cpu forever, because there is no easy way to clean between the pins...  And do not touch the pins with your fingers.
Here is the way I install my CPUs in an AMD machine.  Take your CPU from the AMD package and install it into the socket on your motherboard.  Then butter the die with Artic Silver 5 compound using a razor blade to spread it evenly across the die.  A credit card will work good as well, but need a good hard strait edge.
Forget that 5400 upgrade, go with this
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as... AMD 6000 89Watts and 2mb L2 cache.  That is an upgrade if you are going to take the time to change CPU's.  You will tell a differance between the 1mb L2 and the 2mb L2.  Because 3.2 overclock is all you will achieve with any AM2 CPU anyways, that is about the wall for overclocking their CPU's... Not as much overclocking headroom as intel has on their chips...

Please, refrain from answering unless you are definite your answer contains legitimate information. He could have dunked the processor in water and let it dry and it would work properly. What he did was fine.



Yes, your motherboard will be compatible with the processor. Your processor SHOULD include a stock heatsink, so don't worry.

From what I found, your computer will support AMD AthlonTM  64 X2 dual-core CPU's so you should be ok on that. However, Cleaning your mobo with alcohol??????? Are you serious??? You put a liquid on an electrical item?? That's like throwing a hair dryer in the bath tub. First thing to try is using the old CPU to make sure it fuctions. I would put a fan on the empty socket and leave it for a few days to properly dry first.

If you hear beep sounds (visit below link), probably there is a problem with your hardware, otherwise your system files might be corrupted. Try if you can boot in safe mode and fix anything from there by running your anti-virus, popup/registry cleaner applications, then restart.

USUALLY, but not always, a machine that restarts randomly has a bad power supply.



Before I forget, be very careful HOW you clean a machine.  Do NOT use a regular vacuum cleaner; they make antistatic vacs and/or used canned air.



If the machine is plugged into a surge strip then take the surge strip out of the loop and plug the machine into the wall directly.  You could even go so far as to test the outlet with a voltmeter.  If one of those two are bad then you will tear your hair out  if you concentrate on the machine itself.



What you have to do then is to remove each component and replace it with a part that you are sure works.  Do this one at a time, part by part, and restart the machine each time.  IF THERE IS ONLY ONE bad part then this process will help you find it.  Most people assume there is only one bad part and sometimes that gets you in trouble.



You could try each part in another compatible machine as a double check, but go for the power supply being faulty first.



Assume nothing.  Suspect Everything...

If you have a lot of programs on your computer, chances are there a lot of services running in the background too. Go to Start Menu &gt; Run &gt; (type in) msconfig. A dialogue box will open with some tabs. This is your Microsoft startup program list - all the programs that begin running as you start up Windows. Go to the 'Startup' tab and uncheck all the programs you don't use often, and even programs you use often but can open yourself. After that, open the 'Services' tab and turn off any services that you don't need from YOUR programs, not the Windows programs. Click 'OK' at the bottom and reboot. A message box will open saying you have changed some properties in the Microsoft Config file, just check the box saying not to remind you again and thats it!
Your computer should run a lot faster after this is all said and done.

Are your virus definition files CURRENT??  Scans do you no good if your definition files are outdated.



Check your startup programs and programs that run as Services (Start/Run/MSCONFIG...)



If that is not it did you install new software on your machine, do other people use the machine without you knowing it/could they have installed something that you don't want???



Get a Good Registry Cleaner and use it.  FREE software is not always the best answer.  A bloated Registry will slow a machine down fast.  Talk to your friends and see if they have had the problem and what they used before you talk to someone who has something to Sell.  They may tell you anything just to make a sale.  Remember that you cannot return software once it is opened and get your money back.  All they will do is replace it with the same thing and you are out the money.



If that does not do it then Defrag the hard drive.  If you have never done it then do it before you go to bed and it should be done when you wake up.  The first time you do it does take way longer than you expect.  You are not going ot gain a ton of speed from a defrag, but not doing it will definitely slow your machine down.



Did you add any new programs lately?  That includes Windows Updates like Service Pack 3...  You need to know what is running in the background (progams that take up resources and slow your machine down and you may not know they are there).  Certain antivirus programs like Norton really slow a machine down cuz they check and monitor everything...



If you added new software are you sure you have enough RAM?



Try those for starters..

You need to provide more information. Tell us what happens, how far into the installation does it get, what part do you get stuck at, any errors that pop up. You say it reads the disks, so where at in the process does it not work. By disks do you mean the hard drive or the CD.



IF you mean disks as in the hard drive and you are having problems booting from the CD. Make sure in the BIOS, under Boot Order CD is before Hard  Drive.

Did you partition and format your hard drive if it is new?  The don't come preformatted like floppies used to.  I always partition and format my hard drives first so I don't remember if Windows will do it for you.  The other answer is right in that you need to give us more info as to exactly what was on the screen, what the error messages were and what step you were on (what steps completed correctly and when did it screw up)??



The possibility exists that the copies are bad or the windows itself  is no good.  Ideally you need to have another hard drive to test it on, then you can say if it's the drive or the copy.  Remember that certain copies of windows will only install so many times.  People also like to play practical jokes on others thinking they are getting something for free and they purposely disable the software by deleting certain critical files.



Are you sure your CD/DVD drive is reading the media correctly?  If the drive is not working right then it does not matter what you are trying to install..

If not then look for a phone number that you can call to ask for a replacement CD.

Basically imagine an old 3D game, now all the walls will have jagged edges right? Anti Aliasing layers over ALL edges and smooths them out.



This can be a graphics intensive option and usually only higher quality graphics cards can produce flawless AA.



There are different levels of AA such as 2x 4x 8x 16x.



2x/4x are what most games can add on automatically in 'high' settings etc.

In digital signal processing, anti-aliasing is the technique of minimizing the distortion artifacts known as aliasing when representing a high-resolution signal at a lower resolution. Anti-aliasing is used in digital photography, computer graphics, digital audio, and many other applications.



In the image domain, aliasing artifacts can appear as wavy lines or bands, moiré patterns, popping, strobing, or as unwanted sparkling. In the sound domain they can appear as rough, dissonant, or spurious tones, or as noise.



Anti-aliasing means removing signal components that have a higher frequency than is able to be properly resolved by the recording (or sampling) device.

Please Help Me Decide on a CPU Upgrade?



I have a Shuttle SD30G2 PLUS, running 4Gb RAM, with a PNY 8800GT. It does work with 45nm chips. I currently have a C2D E6600 in it. I would like to know which one of these options would be the best return on investment:



1. Keep the E6600
2. Get an E8400.
3. Get an E8500
4. Get an E8600
5. Get another Intel Processor (note: This box won't handle quads.



</question>



<additional details>



oni-kun: Thanks, but I don't overclock or overvolt. My little Shuttle PSU would not like that. LOL I need to know about stock speeds...3.0, 3.16, 3.33. Thanks.



Flack: The money isn't a problem...and I would just relocate the E6600 to another box. I am sorely tempted to get the E8400 though. A hundred bucks or so more is a big chunk of change for a one-step multiplier, don'tcha think? LOL



Plus, this particular Shuttle has just been discontinued (I have no idea why they would stop selling their best selling model, but... I need SFF for a few of my computing needs...so I can only upgrade to another C2D.



F3J BIOS...no problem.



I am running an E8650 in my other Shuttle (the twin of the one I want to upgrade, so 1333 is no problem.

I'd get an E85/600 or funny enough get an E2220. The E2220 can clock up to 3.6GHz on air ( I have, most chips are good ) and it costs 1/3 the price.

If you want to save the most money, keep it.



Get a E8400 if you want to upgrade a bit as the 5/600 are quite similar but costs more.



The best investment when it comes to technology is waiting, provided your current hardware satisfies you.



Good luck!

Has it always started in safe mode or did it start when you got ME??  You do know that ME was so bad that Microsoft RECALLED IT??  If you can, borrow something like Windows 98 and see if it runs.  Normally safe mode means there is something wrong that is bad enough to keep the OS from starting properly. It could be a number of things, so have some patience cuz it might take a while to pinpoint the problem.  Did it ever run correctly?  That might be a good starting point.



I would not hesitate to go back to Win98, but don't go back to WinSE.  It is not much better than ME.

their is nothing wrong with ME. ME is nothing more then 98 up dated. get yourself another harddrive and load it. it sounds like you picked up a nasty bug. if you still have the problem, it hardware, not the OS. if everything is fine. hook up the other harddrive, drag off what you want to keep. if its hardware you will have to figure out what is causing the problem. the FAT file system is really only good to 30gig's. check out e-bay for a good used drive.

What can I do? computer won't boot up in normal or safe mode.?



I was on my toshiba laptop and accidentally hit the power button, which put my computer into hibernation. When I turned it back on, it sent me to the "we apologize, windows could not boot up correctly" screen with all the options to boot up the computer. But none of the options worked. I tried safe mode, normal, and every other option possible. When I'd chose a option, such as safe mode, it'll flash the start windows logo screen, then quickly flash a blue screen with a bunch or white writing ( I have no clue what it says cause it's only visible for a second) then back to the black and white "we apologize screen". With every option I chose it just repeats the same process. Does anyone have any helpful advice, other than to take it to a professional?? Thanks

Your hard drive is failing, but you may be able to do a repair install to fix it. To do a repair install boot from the xp disk then choose repair after the eula agreement then follow the prompts. If that doesn't work you will have to format and install the operating system.

Why Would My Desktop Pc Refuse To Start Up?



My faithful desktop pc finally did it. I left it switched on sunday night and when i came down monday morning it was switched off and refused to boot up.



I checked everything i could but i could not find any problems. I tried switching it back on but the orange light flashed on then off and nothing happened.



I have since borrowed my brothers pc but when i tried to put my hard drives into his tower it refused to boot up off my hard drive. It booted up fine off my his hard drive though.



I have a few questions cos different people tell me different things. What would cause a pc to just fail like that? Is it just the power supply or the motherboard that's packed up? Should i be able to take a hard drive from 1 pc and put it into another and make it work?



Thanks in advance.

sounds like it was a short out, if so, most likely it could be ur motherboard thats fried, but if it is from a power surge, it should b under warranty so don't fret. the other thing is that the power supply could have taken the hit, so it could just be that shorted out, easy $100 fix.

Your power supply needs to be replaced, buy a new one which wont cost more that £10. DON'T try to bring it to a technician because power supply is a dangerous thing to repair and its safer and cheaper and less time consuming, JUST replace it.
Nothing to do with your motherboard at ALL, your pc is not getting any or enough power to start up the BIOS, so 100% its the power supply.
Of course you can take out your harddrive and put it in to another pc, just make sure what is the MASTER (main) hdd and the SLAVE (yours) one.
Every PC technician will tell you the same thing what I've written here.



Good luck

In regards to what can cause it to happen.



Could be a virus or some form of spyware infection.



When you go to power it back on, you said you get an orange light & then it goes out.



Assuming that is the Power light on the front of the PC tower, it could be 2 things:



Power Supply or Mother Board.



Which seems that you may already know that.



With the Hard Drive question.  You should be able to move one Hard Drive to another PC.  Just keep in mind, that when you switch that Hard Drive to another PC, you will be hooking up to another Motherboard.



The reason why it may not be Booting off that Hard Drive, is that it is not recognizing the Motherboard it is now hooked up to.



I believe if you reformat the Hard Drive (Reinstall Windows, ect...), that should work.



I ran in to this before & after I reformatted the Hard Drive, it worked.

Sounds like your power supply.  Realize part of what happens during the Boot Process.  One of the first things that happens is when you turn the power on the power supply checks itself for to see if it is operating correctly.  There is something called a Power Good signal, and that is the power supply's check to see if the electricity is within the proper parameters/boundaries (i.e. is the current good/stable?)  If the power supply does not pass that test within milliseconds the supply automatically shuts down to prevent damage to itself and the computer.



The bad thing is that the last time you started the machine it worked fine at startup but then developed problems, some severe.  The other thing is that there often is no warning when a power supply will fail, and when it does there is no guarantee  that it will shutdown and not ruin anything else.  Whatever is connected to the supply (the motherboard, the ram, any drives, any cards like a network or video card, the cpu) could get fried too.  It all depends on how far the problems progressed before it shut down.



I hate to say it but it could have ruined most of your machine inside.  Hopefully not, but...



The only things you can do is to first have the power supply tested outside the machine, then if it is bad replace the power supply and hope it did not damage anything else.  If it still does the same thing then you need to check each component in your machine in another machine.  I would use a machine that you don't care about if you have one.  It sounds like the power supply failed and took out at least the hard drive, but you have to check each component one by one.  If you don't have a spare compatible machine you can either assume the machine is toast or take it to a reputable tech and let them test it.  All you will want to tell them is "my computer won't start"...  They will know what to look for.

32.5 GB on my computer? C: Drive help?



Hi everyone.



I need to make at least 12 GB on my space due to a computer game, and I was checking how much space my computer could hold, and I was surprised when it said 32.5 GB! So I've been deleting a few things, but the problem is, when I delete things, it doesn't change!



I deleted one other game, it gave me 3 GB and it showed. But I deleted more games, too, and it didn't show, although now, it says this:



Used Space: 28.8 GB



Free Space: 3.73 GB



Total Size: 32.5 GB



Um...WHAT?!  Why won't it show I have more space now? Help please?

When files go over i think its 2gbs as a whole they dont go in the bin they are just deleted so if you deleted the other game thats why you say the space right away. So check your recycle bin

your OS is using the FAT file system. 32.5 is the max it will see. check the drive you have to see what size it is. run the part number on the web it will tell you. reload NTFS. 2000 or XP.  98 or ME your out of luck.

if you do not have enough money for a new computer do you have enough for a new hard drive?



You could easily get a 60gb hard drive for less than AU$50.



And instaling a new hard drive is about the easiest computer upgrade you can do... need to connect 2 wires and set it up in windows...



just a thought...

Check other answers too.  One thing you need to know is the full capacity of the drive on the drive label.  An OS will only format so much drive space, and 32 GB is one of the limits.  What I am saying is you could have more space available than what your Operating System says you have.  The drive could have room for more partitions to give you more space to store stuff.  You need a utility or OS that can see past the 32GB limit if that is the case.



If your drive is actually 32.5GB then you either need another hard drive in your machine in addition to the one you have or a larger drive to replace the 32.5.  If you get something like an 80gb drive you may have to divide it up into 32, 32 and 16 GB.  It will all still work but you cannot install everything on the C: Drive.  It all depends on how much the Operating System will recognize as far as drive space.

Not a easy question to answer. Its all dependent on the program really. As some hide usage in the registry or some file located within the program folder or the programs .exe file or somewhere in the user accounts documents and settings application folder. Like I said its not easy to explain and it depends on the program itself and what is installed where. You need special tools and plenty of familiarization with the operating system. It's not easy.

Can anyone recommend a good laptop for..?



A 14 year old girl? I am asking for one for Christmas, but I'm not sure on what exact kind. I want something that's not like really difficult to use, something that I could use Sims2 on (lol :D) maybe one with a camera, not necessary though. Also, something around $400-500 or less if possible. Thanks!

If you could pop down to your local/favorite computer store, look around, ask one of the guys there for advice, they should find you're perfect one. But if all else fails, just go to Dell.com and get a Inspiron laptop.

I strngly recomment The "Asus eeepc" It is the smallest laptop on the market to date. It is not that small that you can barely push the keys with your finger. It is a perfect size for a teenager taht goes to school. It varies between $250-$400, take a look at it it is nice. I also recomment you put more memory in it for the best experience! Its nice and fast.



Hope this helps,

well that depends alot on the T.V. some LCDs have a VGA or S-video but those don't carry sound. If you laptop has a HDMI port then that is what you want to use since it carries sound as well as video. There are adapters you can buy also but without knowing what ports your laptop and TV have it is hard to say.

Laptop mouse going nuts, help please?



Ok so I have a packard bell easy note laptop, and the mouse on it is driving me bananas,
all was ok till about 3 weeks ago wen the mouse just stopped working for about 20 mins, then gradually started doing as it was told, just about.



ever since then every ten mins or so, it will only move up and down, and will shoot up and down the screen on its own:(, it is driving me mental. If i close my Lappy, then turn it back on it will work again straight away, but only for the next 5-10 mins, sometimes less. I have run spy-bot, nothing, virus check, nothing and cc-leaner and I still have this problem. I don't know what else I can do, I know I can buy a plug in one, but I really dint want to do that as my laptop just sits on my knee so that would be awkward. Sorry for the long post, but if anyone has any advice on what could be causing it and how to fix would be greatly receive before I officially crack up.

usually laptops have separate drivers for operating the mouse/touchpad. so try updating yours. Dell laptops have a separate support centre program installed dat makes dis very easy, there should be a similar program on your one too.

Okie dokie, This happened to me but every time I touched my Trackpad the cursor went BALLISTICK and Malfunction, This was because I recently installed a program that had malware and Malware can harm your computer and change your setting, Have you installed anything lately. Do you think you could have maleware? If its not that you probably have to update the driver. Go to your COmputer manufacturers site and search Mouse Drivers, You will need to download the driver and install it. Then you should be fine I hope.

It looks like it is hooked up via IDE so if you find a 2.5" laptop/Notebook hard drive that uses IDE then you should be golden.
