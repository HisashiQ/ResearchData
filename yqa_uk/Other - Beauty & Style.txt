I LOVE my eyelash curlers. They are my secret weapon hehe. I love how they make my lashes look longer and thicker. I definitely recommend them to anyone!



To make the best of your curlers, ensure you replace the pads every two months. A quick tip for great results is to gently heat your hairdryer (not a hot setting, just warm) and point it at your curlers for no more than five seconds.
Or you can even buy heated eyelash curlers! A bit more expensive than regular ones but with great effects!

I think i'm a shopaholic?



Haha, it sounds kinda dumb, but I think I need some advice:
I go to the mall as often as I can, even though my parents are always too busy to take me, I find friends that can take me.I don't necessarily spend A LOT of money, but since I go to the mall often I feel like getting a few shirts each time I go is piling up... Also, if I leave the mall without buying something I feel empty, and end up going online to search clothes when I get home. Which makes me want to go to the mall again... and I think the reason I shop so much is that I know that i'll always have money left over. Help?

I used to be just like you. But if you don't kick the habit in the butt now, once you turn 18 you'll regret it. Credit cards can help you afford your shopping habits temporarily, until you find yourself in so much debt you can't get out. That might seem far away.. or not so far away, but do yourself a favor and stop now. Learning to live frugally is going to be so important when you are in college and beyond, living on your own, having to pay rent. Its okay to spend money sometimes, but try to limit your spending, and try to start a savings account. You will thank yourself later, when you enter college, and you have extra money to spare, rather than a bunch of new credit card debt. Whenever I look back on the things I bought, I realize just how much money I could have saved to this day if I hadn't bought all those crazy things that I maybe used or wore only once in my life. And when I studied abroad my first semester, my spending habits left me almost penniless without food or support from family that was thousands of miles away. You've got to learn to control your spending when you're young!

Its kinda infused into ur skin so it takes its own time to fade off..the most that i can think off is washing ur hands(with soap) more than usual..but even then it takes a few days to fade off..



If u really cant be ssen with henna tattoos then u can try putting some foundation on that skin area to cover it up..

i got a henna tattoo once and hated it... i would leave lotion on it for half an hour or so and then exfoliate the area. keep doing that as often as possible. henna usually only lasts a couple weeks, tops, and exfoliating with oils makes it come off a lot faster. (:

It actually depends which one you buy.



I had the one which "scans" just 1 hair (the cheapest one, costs around £90) and that was truly awful. It burnt my skin and was just generally rubbish. Who has time to do one hair at a time?!



I now have the one that can remove 60 hairs at a time and that is really good. Also, once you've pressed it on your skin, you hold it there for a bit and then it leaves a little cube on your leg (or where-ever you plan to use it) so you know not to go over that patch again, the mark goes after 10 minutes or so.



Get one, try it, if it doesn't work as you expected, send it back!

Girls pout because it makes their face look slimmer, and it accentuates cheebones. I have been guilty of this crime before, but I try not to. It's a bad reflex, it truely is. I hate it when I see girls pouting, too. Haha it really does look like a puckered bum hole! lol you're very observant xD

I know you said not to say anything about your age but in saying that i think it might be too early to tell since you're still maturing and still growing. Other than that you seem very lovely and naturally pretty.

It appears that you have a neutral complexion, possibly even warm. Use this color pallet as a guide, on the right collumn it suggests colors that compliment a warm skin tone, on the left colors that compliment a cool skin tone. Since you would be more on the right you'll want to avoid all the colors that are intended for a cool skin tone because they will make your light-medium complexion look more pale and washed out.

Is my boyfriend out of my league? pictures included.?



Hi there. Um I feel a little silly doing this, but for ages now I've felt extremely insecure with my boyfriend. He did a makeover of himself and I've been noticing the different ways I no longer measure up to him. We're important to each other and wouldn't dump each other over small things like looks, but it still eats me up inside. I would like to know if there are ways of improving myself also if I look like the odd one out. Feel free to rate our appearance if it makes a good example of your point.



And please be honest. I know I'm not 'beautiful' or anything like that, and white lies would be a waste of our time, although I really, really appreciate the thought.
me. I was red riding hood for halloween, ha.

Well...No offense to your boyfriend but you seem a little higher up on the scale than he does. Your appearance is more kept up, he looks a little scruffy. But that's just my opinion.



In all honesty, looks should not matter. You should have common interests and common goals, if you do then you are compatible with one another. Looks are just the icing on the cake.

Do you hate your body? I hate mine. I want to be skinny! Argh.?



I have a weird relationship with my body. I don't really understand my body, if that makes sense. I am 164cm tall and I wear a size 10/12 Australian. (UK size 8/10 and US size 6/8 respectively). Also, my shoulders and hips are the same size and my waist is 10 inches smaller. I am quite proportioned, but that still doesn't stop me from disliking my body. I am really 'meaty' - I have big boobs and a big butt. I would love to be really skinny. It will never happen because my frame won't support it, and I don't have 'skinny' bone structure. I hate the fact that I am so resoundingly average ... I want so badly to be skinny!!! I have an idea in my head that I am really 'big' - big boned, big featured, and I feel embarrassed because I think when people look at me all they can see is boobs and butt. I wish I was more confident with my body but I don't know how ... I am aware that I probably seem really pathetic, but I am in a low mood and I just want some advice if you think you can give some ... thanks!
I am a 21 y.o caucasian female.

Why do girls look sexy in red?



I have no idea why, so I am asking you.  My friend told me today that there was a study, and it was actually proved that people though girls looked sexier when they wore the color red.  I think it is too, but I don't know why.

Red signifies blood rushing to various parts of the body, and occurs in a variety of animals (including we humans), especially during mating, and also makes for an eye catching display. It's a very primal connection, red and sexuality, that probably lingers from our earliest existence as a species, and may also be at least in the male mind associated with a woman's menstrual cycle, and thus fertility--and signify the readiness to have children.



Basically, it sparks some tiny synaptic firing in a guy's brain that suggests mating...and well, men mostly have two moods--horny and hungry. Our lives are spent doing those things which alleviate those feelings or which will allow us to alleviate them more often in the long term. Hence all the hunting and gathering and fighting giant cave bears in order to impress the ladies, which now resembles something altogether different. Somehow, the red connection just stayed with us.



Could also be that a woman wearing it stands out in a crowd (because it appears that she's flaunting the aforementioned primal sexuality) and says "bold, daring, and confident," which is always attractive to guys who want an exciting partner (show me a guy that's ever said he preferred a non-exciting partner...).



Of course, color is a very deeply psychological context in the individual's brain, and let's face it...if red doesn't look good on you, you'll be worse off trying to wear a red dress than if you go with some other color that makes you look every bit as sexy for other reasons, such as making your eyes jump out in a guy's mind, to use one example.



To a lot of guys, red is a turn off and can be associated with prostitutes and prostitution, as it suggests gaudy, blatant, and easy. You have to be careful with making blanket statements about red being universally sexy, even when science suggests it may have a universal effect. Emotions are electrical responses to moving atoms, chemical reactions and so forth, which are weighed against an individuals personal experience and to a lesser degree against evolutionary responses...and then those emotions cause their own chemical releases which depend on the physiological makeup of the individual and then have an impact on the body of said individual...who then reacts to their own reaction yet again by expressing it in some way.



That's a whole lot of room for interpretation and error. The mind is incredibly complex! But studies suggest that a significant portion of men get to that final reaction somehow finding a woman attractive because she wore red. Just don't assume it means EVERY woman and ALL the time. Context matters.

If you go to a Sephora, Ulta or a Mac store, they will do it for you for free (make up anyway).  You will have to buy one of the products they used on you, though.

How long have you had your hair for? Long time?



Look at your face. Determine your face shape, and ask your family/friends what they think. See a professional stylist, and pick your hairstyle, then get it done. You don't need to go to the stylist after though.



Anyway, change your image. Do you wear tight jeans and a tank top all the time? Change that. Try a loose dress or something instead.



For make up, see those salespeople in the malls or find a specialist.. or ask a friend!

Definately get a makeover, I highly recommend it!
Take your time to work out what you what.. what cut or colour of hair, plucking eyebrows.. teeth whitening, contact lenses to bring out eye colour.
If finances are a bit thin, you can do some of this yourself in your own time, you don't have to do it all in one weekend.  unless of course you want to.
My advice, look around, what style is attracting you at the moment?

Ladies... I have a question about body sprays...?



Does anybody know if you can still buy Mary-Kate and Ashley Tropical Burst Vanilla Sugar body mist anymore? I love love love it, and I'm almost out but haven't been able to find it. If not, do you know of a good alternative? I love the vanilla smell, and body sprays are lighter than perfume, which gives me a headache. Thank you.

If you live in America, I cant help you.



But if you live in the UK, Boots do a body spray in their "natural collection" range which is vanilla.



They do body scrubs, bath cream, body lotion to match too.

I don't like that style at all.. But nevertheless it's a style.
I don't know, I'm kind of bored with it. I mean it's the same stuff. Skinny jeans, basic tees, plaid, graphic hoodie.



So the answer is: You dress typical for that style.. emo, scene... whatever.. let's not put labels.



So yeah, it maches, I guess the makeup is right, and you dress fine. But my opinion is that you narrow yourself down to the people to appreciate your style. But I guess that's what you want.

I think its rice bran or rice bran protein.I think this because i have a organic 'natural quenching face mask' and on the back it explains the ingredients and it says
Rice bran protein:
Countries like korea have long used rice for beauty preparations,crushing the husk and grain to use in cosmetics and bathing.This extract contains proteins which work to bind in moisture.



And its a runny,watery type of liquid



I could be wrong though

Do you hate your body? I hate mine. I want to be skinny! Argh.?



I have a weird relationship with my body. I don't really understand my body, if that makes sense. I am 164cm tall and I wear a size 10/12 Australian. (UK size 8/10 and US size 6/8 respectively). Also, my shoulders and hips are the same size and my waist is 10 inches smaller. I am quite proportioned, but that still doesn't stop me from disliking my body. I am really 'meaty' - I have big boobs and a big butt. I would love to be really skinny. It will never happen because my frame won't support it, and I don't have 'skinny' bone structure. I hate the fact that I am so resoundingly average ... I want so badly to be skinny!!! I have an idea in my head that I am really 'big' - big boned, big featured, and I feel embarrassed because I think when people look at me all they can see is boobs and butt. I wish I was more confident with my body but I don't know how ... I am aware that I probably seem really pathetic, but I am in a low mood and I just want some advice if you think you can give some ... thanks!
I am a 21 y.o caucasian female.

No one is 100% completely satisfied with their body.  Boobs could be bigger, waist can be smaller, legs could be slimmer, etc.  Everyone has their gripes.



My advice is to flatter the thing you are proud of.  I have a very tiny waist so I wear shirts that flatter that.



For example, If you have a nice butt, wear leggings or skinny jeans.  Or if you are unhappy with your arms wear a shirt with flowy sleeves.  Just dress to flatter your body!

Don't feel so bad. We all have our imperfections, or what we think is considered "not normal". If your bust and hips are within 1.5" of each other then you're an hourglass, the waist has to be at least 9" smaller and yours is 10. I don't see anything wrong with that. Yes, it's hard to fit because all the clothes nowadays are made for stick/boy figures and pear shapes. There is nothing made for the "ideal female figure" anymore. My top is considered a 10, my waist a 0 and my hips a 6, but I have a perfect hourglass according to my measurements (those were all USA sizes). I just learn to accept it, but yes I do hate it because nothing ever fits me - I'm 23. We always want what we don't have.

go ahead and force yourself to be skinny but you will still think you're fat even you become skinny because you have no love for yourself. i'm really skinny with no boobs and no *** too! lol but i like how my body looks but i would love to gain weight and be curvy since i'm hispanic so i feel that i should be curvy but i still think of myself as beautiful. so learn to love your body and learn to remember you're really beautiful like you. don't ever compare yourself to skinny women because you'll make it worse. from what you describe your body, you're very curvy and i would love to have your body! look at celebrities who are curvy such as rihanna, beyonce, eva longoria, jennifer love hewitt, and many more! they're really happy with how they bodies look because they knew nobody is prefect so are you. think positive, stay beautiful.

Help...I think there's someone living in my attic?



I hear sounds from the roof at night, sounds that don't seem like an animal.. heavy objects being moved, slow but heavy footsteps etc but not only that, at night I have heard whispering... almost like a one sided conversation of vague mumbling coming from the roof.



and on Halloween I woke during the night from the sound of knocking on my window, it was dark in my room and I swear to God that I saw a person's eyes through the vent in my ceiling.



I'm freaked out, and can't make myself go to the attic, what should I do?

I dont think someone is living in your attic but however you may have a spirtitual being in your attic, dont get upset, this is pretty damn cool!  If it makes you uncomfortable just go up there and tell them that they are dead and go away! I know it sounds wierd but just do it! Or embrace it and see what this being has to offer you!

Wait... how old are you? Do you live alone? My friend had a homeless woman living in her house for 3 weeks and she got really freaked out that she never noticed. Eventually she caught the woman because she came home from school early and caught her going through the closet where they keep all the food. I don't want to scare you but the best thing to do is call the local police and ask them to come over and check to see if there's anyone in your attic. If you don't want to get the police involved then get three to five friends (preferably strong) to go and check out your attic with you. Hope this helps... good luck!

do you live alone? if you do, then during the day you should invite a friend over...a guy if you can and have him go up there and check it out. if he doesn't find anything then you should have someone spend the night with you maybe even for a couple of nights so then if its real they will see it too and more people will believe you. maybe you should even tell the police because it could be a stalker or something like that. normal people don't just hide in other peoples attics.

i believe that its your body and you should be able to do whatever you want to it but also keep in mind that when you get older you might not want it. i think that the any of the piercings you want would look good. just keep in mind if you get snakebites and later on you don't want them they don't close up that easy.but your parents are being ridiculous by not letting you do what you want to.

You can get and artificial sculpted toe nail created out of acrylic put on. It's actually more popular than you think and you can't even tell it's a fake nail if it is done correctly.

Do you want a big toe nail? Do you want to paint it? Do you want a fake one so someone will see it's fake and laugh at you? What are you going to do today? If you are going to be at home with nobody, leave it. If you are going outside, put a sock on it, or a shoe, and keep it there. Because, no such medication for something that is not important exists. All you need to do, is not to forget to breathe.

A couple of pics I think you look about 13,  and then others around 15.
The posy dressed up one,  maybe 16/17.



I prefer the natural pics myself.



I don't think you need to improve your look,  really,  I think you look young, fresh and natural.



If your hair has grown,  then you could go a bit shorter,  I like the length in the pics,  but that's just my opinion.  You do whatever feels right for you.

I'm that size too, and i shop at Kohl's for my bras (weird!)



I DO wear padded bras because i feel uncomfortable w/o it.
I always buy push up bras only because it has the support i need.



If your bras are too tight or too loose, try changing your size.

I think your eyes are ok. Honestly, we could've judged them better if you showed your hair. Hair accentuates the shape and adequacy of one's eyes. In my country, 99% of the people are born with dark brown eyes so I would say that seing Blue, Green, Grey and even heterochromia-induced eyes are interesting.

you're really pretty and i think you have a lot of potential
especially because you already look great
but i think its also the coloring of the pictures
the grey/brown coloring makes the pictures seem dull and boring
liven it up!
if i'd rate your beauty i'd give you a 9
you're very attractive

Wedding hair help!!!!?



I'm getting married in June; i know i know, 7 months away, i shouldn't be freaking out, but i am!! I know i want to keep my hair down, or at least *mostly* down. curly too maybe? I don't know. I have hair that's a few inches past my shoulders and will NOT be cutting it before the wedding, so it'll be a few inches longer. Any ideas? If you have pictures to share, that's great. If you find links to pictures, that's great too! ANY help ANYONE can offer will be appreciated!!

I think that it would look good to get all of your hair curled
and ask them to pin up part of it on top of your head
so you have most of it down
and then you have the top part in a small updo
if you're hair is just past your shoulders, it will be a reallly nice length for this by june
you can also play around with how the side of the pulled back hair look
you can get it twisted and maybe put some kind of jewelry in your hair if you're into that



http://www.women-hairstyles.com/images/w...
this picture is kind of what i mean
only if you want
yu can have less hair up and more hair down
or the other way around



http://www.loredanahairstudio.com/2008bl...
she also has part of it up and part of it down



i hope you figure out the perfect hair-do to have!
congratulations by the way!

In Columbus, Ohio pink and white costs $55 as do Solar nails which are similar but hold up better.  In Ft. Myers Florida pink and white cost me $65, in Indianapolis pink and white cost me $60.  Gel nails are less expensive but, in my opinion, do not wear as well and after several balancing, look really ragged and dirty.

Working out can help some, but the rest is in the person's genes. Some people just naturally have very shapely legs, and others don't.

NEED SUPPORT!



PLEASE HELP US (TWINS) SUCEED IN OUR MODELING DREAM!



PLEASE VOTE FOR US IN THE TEEN QUEEN BEAUTY PAGEANT



Hello, people we’re Fiona and Zoe. We are 16 year old twins. Thanks for viewing our question. You might not think of it much as a question but it is. We need all the support we can. We have entered a beauty pageant called Teen Queen and have been chosen out of thousands of girls. We have been for a photo shoot at fair light studios. 80 girls get picked per month out of thousands we have made it to the next stage on the website ready for voting. We don’t know how we have got this far but we think it would be really fun to make it to the finals.



So we have created this question to get as many votes as possible. We are going to start handing out leaflets and posters asking people to vote for us. Our family and friends are behind us and we need your help to help us get to the finals.



Modelling is our dream and we have had experience before but not much, we have starred in our own photo shoot for sugar magazine before and we really want to get in to the world of modelling so please be generous and support us! We can’t imagine doing anything else and those of you who have dreams know what it feels like. If we did win this beauty pageant not saying we will but we would donate some of our prize to charity (not that we don’t already)



SO PLEASE VOTE FOR THE TWO OF US BECAUSE WE’RE TWINS AND WE WOULD NOT GO THROUGH WITHOUT EACH OTHER! =]

ah. i can't think of anything really positive. the health risks, the self esteem issues, the cost, the beauty standards... there's positives to plastic surgery??
Maybe if you were burned in a fire or something like that plastic surgery would help you to feel better, or a breast implant for a woman who had breast cancer.



Most plastic surgery is so superficial tho... "my boobs are ONLY a C cup... WAHHH!" ahahaha

Personally I dont think that is true. I am 5'7'' and dating a guy who is 5'11'' but really come on....girls just dont date a guy because they want a tall guy.



Did you ever think that she likes him for more? To you it might seem that all girls want really tall guys, but thats not true.
So no its not at all weird to me...

Some people just have it in their genes to be large but you can still slim down through exercise and dieting! Unless you do have some sort of a disorder and then you would have to consult a doctor for the best advice.

its just you... you probably just have a slower metabolism.



and try eating healthy foods.



eat a little bit all day long. the worst way to lose weight is to cut out snacks, because when you dont eat for a while, when it comes to breakfast/lunch/dinner... you end up being so hungry you eat way more than you need to. have a small breakfast,lunch and dinner and healthy snacks throughout the day. also, excercise! you should do a little bit every other day. after a couple weeks, switch to everyday. dont over do it though!

well are their other people in your family that might be overweight because it could be genetic? Do you have a fast metabolism to break down foods quicker?



Best advice is to talk to your doctor and ask him/her what can you do to lose weight, and lose weight the right way. The only reason why I suggested going to the doctor is for the fact that a lot of people dont know about their health status. They might assume they are healthy but thats not really the case all the time. You might have a thyroid issue that you are unaware of.



Just go to the doctor is probably the best advice I can give you

She speak to dentist and then they'll refer her to a local orthodontist. The orthodontist will usually do a free consult, make an impression of the teeth and go over how long the treatment will last, what the finished prouduct will look like and cost. I must worn you, this does cost a few thousand dollars! So make sure your friend can afford this. Most orthodontic offices have different types of financing available, but it depends on her credit.  I'm sure once she goes in, they'll be able to ease her fears and give her the smile she wants.



Good luck!

They definitely don't look too big for your body and they already look very toned so it may be hard to slim them down. . not that you need to anyway, you already have a great body.

it depends how strong the sun is.
me&my friend did it abit ago and it took about half an hour.
but we only had a light tan,
so do it 15mins first, then the next day half an hour.
but make sure you dont burn because it will really hurt.



or you could try spraying water on you every 15mins, i heard that helps you get a tan too :S

Its too mild. So I don't think it will make you tan so much. Why don't you use Sun (blocked) tan lotion. Its safe and effective and smells pretty cool.

I have dyed blonde hair too,and i wanted to dye it darker,so i went out and bought light brown hair color,it turned my hair black!So i would stay away from that.It took a month of dying to get it blonde again.



I think you should get some cute highlights,a few shades darker than the color of your hair now.



Just my suggestions:]

All eye colors are gorgeous, more so the more unusual ones, but it doesn't really matter so you shouldn't really concern yourself too much with what eye color guys like chicks to have.

You're just a kid.  Seriously, you look fine to me, and no one is going to know how you will turn out.  Remember the ugly duckling?



And you know what?  I am not exactly attractive, and I manage to date some very attractive girls.  Simply because looks really don't matter. And that's me being honest.

To be a catwalk model, you have to be at least 5 foot 8 inches tall.



For glamour modelling, you have to have a bust of 34 inches, a 24 inch waist and 34 inch hips.



For commercial modelling, height is not as important.



For modelling in a catalogue/magazine, you can be petite, average or plus size.



Flawless skin is needed, too!

You have beautiful eyes but the eye liner throws them off.  If you don't mind me saying, try a lighter color eye liner to accent the beauty of your eyes.  # 6 is very nice.

1. This one is okay, but your freind dominates the picture.
2. This one's nice but unfotunetly your freind isn't :P
3. How much eye make-up do you need?
4. It's blurry
5. No-one likes that "pouted" look - stop doing girls.
6. See above.



So overall, I'd say number 2.



P.S Don't worry about being called ugly over the internet, you don't know these people anyway - plus, you're a cute girl.

Where can I buy thongs and knickers that are VERY low rise and skimpy?



I'm really short and petite, and I find all the 'small' or 'size 8' or 'low rise' thongs and knickers I see in shops and catalogues come way above the waistband of my trousers, even if I'm not bending over or moving around. They're all just cut wrong - too high, more suitable for someone 5 foot 6 or taller. La Senza used to do some thongs that were basically a bit of dental floss! but they don't do them any more. Marks and Spencers used to sell a range called 'Skimpies' but I can't find them any more. Help please!

No, it's not dangerous.  In fact, if you want to make your feet softer, put a heavy load of lotion on your feet, then put on your socks when you go to bed.

Everyone farts, he'll get over it.
He's probably already forgotten about it.
Don't let a little incident like that ruin your relationship.



Answer his calls.
He probably thinks you don't like him anymore.

Answer the phone and forget about the incident. Everyone farts. If you fart, just say "excuse me" and forget about it. If he calls you names for being human, tell him that unless he never farts ever, he can shut up.

Hun, farting is normal its just so happened that you farted the wrong time. Tell, him I'm sorry but playfully because to be honest boys actually think thats cute at least he knows you're not some kind of stuck up girl who pretends like she's perfect and doesnt fart. He would definitely understand and to be honest its not worth losing him over. Once yall learn to be around one another then your farts wouldnt even be an issue.

I think that if he loves you (and if he's human) he won't care... after all you're not six years old anymore.



Relax and keep in touch with him. If he does mock you, he's an asshole.

Even the Queen of England farts and poops, lol.  Everyone has done it at a time they wish they didn't, but it's no big deal.  It's obvious that he still likes you otherwise he wouldn't be calling you.  He may think there's something seriously wrong and it's not worth breaking up with a really nice guy because of a little tiny oops.  It only shows you're human.  And if he jokes with you about it, just smile and claim "I only fart perfume!"  If he's a good guy he'll think you're funny and sassy and like you even more.  ;-)

ok i'm seriously laughing out loud right now. Sorry babe. Ok EVERYONE FARTS! Honestly, guys especially ( I have 5 bros ... n 3 of them sleep in one room n guess what it smells like? Jeez you need a gas mask just to walk in to tell them something) Anyhow just laugh at it and get over it, I'm sure if he truly loves you, he isn't going to break up with you just because you farted. Just learn to laugh at embarassing things you do in life, makes it WAY more fun!! heh

He is still calling you so the fart could not have made him not want to be with you anymore. Call him back or just answer the phone when he calls. Let him know that you were embarrassed because of what happened. Farting is natural and there is nothing you can do about it. Are you going to let your relationship end because of a fart? If it happen again with him or someone else are you going to keep not answering the phone when he calls. What if he had farted and did not answer the phone when you called him? Yes it is embarrassing but it happens.

You look sad....but I would not say ugly.  Besides, the concept of ugliness is completely subjective and the level of your self-confidence helps you appear more attractive to others.

Native Brazilian Indian: Brazilian: Kind, thoughtful, very green.

OK you want the truth in its purist form?  Ok here it is.  If all things equal, and if we looked at this from a spiritual point of view, I would say that we are all beautiful no matter what our fleshly suits look like that house our eternal spirits.  Why do we spend so much thought, time and money propping up our aging piles of flesh when the eternal spirit lives a lot longer than the 70 to 100 years that our flesh is exposed to.  Want to know real joy?  Take your eyes off the temporal and keep them affixed on those things that are eternal.  Food was for the body as God's word is for our spirit which does live a zillion years longer than the flesh can ever live.  You look beautiful to me from this side of eternity!



And the best news is this...God tells us to get obese in the spirit through His word.  Man, what is better than that my friend?

I dont know but don't google it/. You are going to get many sites that say they give free stuff but they make you fill out stuff for other companies, and they requet either money or your Social Security number so watch out.



I dont know when it changed here in the USA but free is free not strings attached.

Well, there's a difference between freckles and sun spots. I think freckles are cute, but sun spots... not so much. I have a couple of freckles underneath my eyes but they are very faint & not noticeable. I have very fair skin but I'm not the freckley type.

why? because you can play connect the dots? wow sorry lol im just playing. yeah sure, i guess it does, but i agree with the other girl that when ur older it is gonna kinda look like sun damage. im not saying like 40ish or anything but when u get around 50 and on. I dont think it makes u look younger tho. take the same person who takes care of thier skin and is like 45 years old, one has freckles, one doesnt. i dont think one will look younger than the other. but if it did id assume the one without freckles would look younger, just ya kno being that age, it makes u think of sun damage. but whatever you think thats ALL that matters, not what we think.

yeah i have freckles as well. I am 20...nobody ever believes I'm 20. Most think about 16. So wow that 4 year thing you say is strange.  My mother(45) on the other hand looks about 10 or more years younger, everyone who firsts meets us thinks were sisters because they don't think she is old enough to have a child over 10.

I don't have freckles but I'm glad because it is just sun damage you know!! It shows up on paler skinned people (they don't have as much melanin in their skin)



People with oily skin also look a lot younger.. My Mum is 50 and she looks about 38 because she doesn't have one wrinkle on her face!!

my favourite one used to be lynx africa but now its the new one that Keeley is helping to promote lynx sharp focus its to help you lads on pulling girls!! it also makes good girls bad. the advert is kind of cool as well you must have seen it the weird man with his eyes going round in his head.



My least favourite is the chocolate one not the smell that gets us girls going!!!

<question>



Why is pink such a popular colour with the ladies?



I mean what is its appeal? Is it just because the media portrays it with such enthusiasm or is there something about the colour pink that makes it simply irresistable to the ladies (old and young alike)?



I guess what im trying to ask is why do you personally like pink?

I read somewhere that way back at the start of time, women would have to search for berries - thus being drawn to the colour pink. That's the reason why we all like pink.



Personally, I'm not convinced, but it seems cool!
My favourite colour is red.

It's popular with the ladies because it was pushed onto them by popular media long ago, and since then people have just adapted to the general standard that girls like that color.



Much like the color blue for boys.



Personally, I like bright pink because it's a warm, loving color, and very energetic. :)

Because most girls are generally happy go lucky and peppy. The color pink helps to portray that happiness. Or they use it to seem happy when they are not. I don't like the color pink, i wear black. Says alot about my personality, right??

Yes I love pink, but not bubblegum, pepto bismol pink. I love hot pink, mauve, clay and I also love reds, especially burgandy. I think those colors have a lot of sexual energy. Some pinks are ugly, I agree, but other shades can be gorgeous, especially when accented by browns and grays.

I think people like ANY color because of the way it makes them FEEL when they look at it.  Take yellow for example, my favorite color to look at.... I would not buy a yellow couch or wear yellow shoes, but when I look at the color yellow, I feel happier and more optimistic.



For some females, pink may also be a favorite because its sort of a gender enhancer. What does a tranny wear to feel like a woman? Girly ruffles... and maybe PINK! They can claim it as their own and it then meshes with their identity, so to speak.



Plus its an expression of youth and vitality in our culture. If you were to see Oprah wearing a bubble gum pink dress on her show, it might mean that her show that day was about women's issues, breast cancer, or fun lady stuff like fashion or hair. She's always coordinating her outfits with her show topics.



Interesting topic.

These types of questions end up with two answers: yes and no. If 100 people tell you you're attractive and one tells you you're ugly, you'll only be paying attention to that one negative comment.



With that being said, if you want to improve your appearance, get a hair cut.

i love this advert, it shows what we see in magazines, adverts etc is actually edited. nearly all fashion shots are edited by some degree, whether it could be to remove the odd spot of make someone look a size smaller. i once saw this image of an old woman that had been edited to make her look 18. it was shocking how real it looked. people need to realise that was we perceive as beautiful is all computerised and this advert puts that across beautifully

This is a very true comercial. it makes me angry because the media sends out messages to our young girls that if you don't look, dress, or act a certain way you are a no body. And if you buy certain products and clothing then you'll be beautiful, i'm only 16 and I definetly feel the influence that the media puts in to my head. my little sister is 10 and she's bone skinny you can see her ribs and she can't even make her legs touch and she's trying to lose weight cuz she says that she's fat! i'm sick of feeling like i have to look a certain way to be accepted.

well i don t know about you guys but i see in my country girls my age struggling to look like girls from ads.thik layers of foundation diets extentions.all fake. i mean heavens sake ur in ur late teens ur body will never look better. self esteem is a major issue and this sort of campaign is more than welcome. women should look like women not like plastic.



it s a 10 out of 10. the idea is not revolutionary but the message is very much needed to be send

Would a lip piercing look odd on me? (I'm half Oriental)?



Hey
I want a side ring lip piercing- left lower lip.  This is me:
http://s50.photobucket.com/albums/f346/k...
I'm 19 so I don't need parental consent etc.  But I don't want to look like I'm trying to be a Western emo/scene kid.  And because I have questionable features I don't want it to look ridiculous, you know?
Should I get it done or not. It'd be on MY left lower lip, a ring. Would it make me look less oriental?  I've never seen an Asian with a piercing



oh btw my hair is black with pink streaks right now but the streaks change colour A lot x

FAKE EYELASHES.! Girl, I swear by them. I have very short and straight eyelashes that points down. What I do, is after I apply all my makeup, as in my eyeshadown, eyeliner, mascara, I then curl my eyelashes. You grab the fake eyelash and cut the outward end to however long your eye is. Then you take the eyelash adhesive and apply it evenly along the lash of the fake one, then you let it dry just a little, enough to be a bit tacky but not too much. then put it on top of your lash line AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET IT. All my friends always ask me to do their eyelashes and I wear them every single day.

I'm sorry to hear that.. :(



When you say they wont curl, do you mean that they just don't curl naturally? or that they wont curl with a curler? If you haven't tried one then I highly recommend you do :)
If this doesn't work you could perhaps get an eye lash perm professionally, and an eyelash colouring but this may cause an allergic reaction in some rare cases.



I hope you find a way!!

okay eyelashes are natural you can't make them grow but you can find a way to make them look pretty by using mascara or black make-up on it to stand out more maybe light eyeliner on eyes and darker mascara or something like that on your eyelashes. hope this helps!

You're just putting yourself down now, Zne.  What about having your music played and appreciated internationally?  Does that not count as fame of sorts?

It means that the customer can't buy the cheaper cap top lotion bottle and then use the pump from the more expensive product because the sizes are different, or the threads are different.

It appears the pump you have been given doesn't fit a "cap-top" lotion .... maybe the pump fits a "screw-top" lotion instead.  So perhaps the lotion comes in different bottles/containers.  Only a suggestion.



Like buying light globes ... Was it an "edison screw" or "bayonet" fitting?

pretty.."cute" is usually



the word to use when you're expected to compliment someone but it is difficult to do so, because you don't find them strikingly beautiful..in other words, if someone is not pretty but you feel the need to compliment them, you will probably end up saying "you're .. cute" .. it doesn't mean this all the time, but in many cases.

This all depends on the person you are trying to impress. If you are trying to impress everyone then.. Good luck you're on your own. But if there is a particular person you like try to sway towards their interests and wear things they like and their favorite color so they think that they are like you. :D Don't worry Everyone is special :) XD

Almost any girl can look hot and sexy - we all know `plain` girls who are hotter and sexier than some good-looking girls.  Sex-appeal is a subtle and indefinable thing - tho mostly it`s born in you.



I`d say look around you and study closely those girls who seem to easily attract the attentions of men - then do whatever it is they are doing!

Well that depends on who you're trying to appeal to. You're "hotness" would be what the person whose attention you're trying to get thinks. Generic answer: about B-D sized boobs, round butt, nice smile, straight teeth, good hygiene, dress nice, and try to stand out(in a good way).

you're too young to be hot...youre only about to be 13 not even in high school yet =/ dont try to grow up so soon you'll have tons of time to do everything you want i promise.  besides, being "hot" means having confidence and feeling comfortable in your own skin.. so if you have to ask how to be hot, chances are if you don't consider yourself attractive, no one else will.  work on that and everything else will come easier.. believe me when you're older you'll wish someone would appreciate you for your personality and not what you look like.  I'm not being rude i think this is the best advice i can give you because i would have loved someone to tell me this at your age! good luck =)

I suspect a hunky dude has caught your attention?



If this is the case, totally blow him away! walk in chin up (guys always like a challenge) I'd add a few highlights; and gently give it a brushed look with your fingers. My mom is a cosmetologist. She uses hydrogen peroxide 40 volume, and sits under a sunlamp to activate it. That's a whole lot cheaper than a 10 dollar box of Loreal. i RECOMMEND A TEST STRAND. try www.beauty.com They have directions.

New swimming costume fading.. ?



on the tag it says "rinse thoroughly with fresh water after use so it doesn't fade"



does this mean as soon as i get out of the beach water that i should rinse with water? or when i get home from the beach?



and.. the tag also says "some colours may fade in sunlight" .. my swimming costume is black.. if i go in the seawater then come out into direct sunlight, will my swimwear fade?

How do you get the blades out of razors?



I'm not talking about changing the blade, I mean like getting the actual blade out of the razor.



Also this is not so I can cut myself, I'm just wondering.

When you live in Milan, Italy you get to know fashion pretty well. Italian Designers all do the same thing... The only realatively innovative Italian designer is Missoni. However, in my opinion Ed Hardy is a great designer he has so may fresh new ideas and I just adore him! Although Dsquared isnt that bad either...

there is no such thing as good permanent hair removal cream. if you are using hair removal cream you may just as well shave as it gives you the same results and there is no chemical burns and takes less time.
by the way laser is not permanent. electrolysis can but it is a fortune.
wel it is up to you.

Is it hard to put in and take out contact lenses?



I've worn glasses since 6th grade and I'm now in college. I have a power of -8.5 and also minor astigmatism. Glasses never bothered me before but I think I'd look a lot better without them. I'm thinking of getting contacts. But the notion of popping something into my eyes and then having to take it out honestly scares me. Is it hard? How long does it take to get used to it? any suggestions would be appreciated...thanks :)

It is not very hard, you get used to it.
The optometrist will teach you for your first time and then when you have to do it yourself you've got to be patient but after a while you can get them in and out in less than a minute...
It doesnt hurt unless they are dirty and they will irritate you eyes or if youve got the wrong lens in the wrong eye

It's not hard, but the first 10 or so times, be careful- really. You might not be used to it AND IT WILL IRITATE IF NOT PUTTEN IN CORRECTLY AND THERE'S A CHANCE YOU CAN HURT YOURSELF! Just be careful and finally you'll get the swing of things :) I'm in 10th and I have wanted contacts like forever but my mom wont let me have them b/c I tend to be a little careless and clumzy so this year Im trying to show her my "grace"so next year I can get contacts.

It takes a little while to put them in quickly, just take your time and be sure you're putting them in the right side. It'll feel weird at first, as if there is something in your eye but it won't take long for you to get use to it. Always have clean fingers when handling or putting them in your eyes. Once you do it a few times it'll be just as easy as putting on glasses. :)

In my opinion, yes. It was so difficult for me to put them in that I just said, 'Forget the contacts,' and I just wear my glasses whenever necessary. However, I am near-sighted, so I don't need my glasses ALL the time.



On the other hand, my older brother also needs glasses, and he pops his contacts in with ease. It takes him less than a minute.



In the end, I'd say it's different for everybody. I guess it's a skill that you will getter bet at with time and practice if you have the patience :D

If you decide to go for contact lenses, your optometrist/optician will usually take a few appointments to teach you how to put them in and out and will help you out as you have a go.  Chances are they will also give you a trial week with some contacts lenses to see if they're ok for you.



When I got my contact lenses it took a minute or two to get used to them and afterwards I didnt even notice them.

spin a quarter, flick to keep spinning; the first person to not keep it spinning has to put their fist on the table and gets the quarter slide into their knuckles by the last person that flicked the quarter; this technically called quarters. otherwise just beat each others fists and the first to bleed losses (oh and that applies to both games).

How to look attractive...?



Hey.



I'm 15 and male.



I use to be obese this time last year (110kg!!!!!) but I'm not down to 95kg. It still sounds like heaps but I'm really really tall (as in 6 feet 2)&gt;



But for my BMI to be healthy I need to get down to about 86kg.



Sometimes when I see myself in the mirror I look alright, sometimes I look ugly as like today haha.



I have a bit of acne on my neck like near my chin at the moment.



My hair is getting a bit long too.



I want to look hot for the ladies lol, so what can I do?

Besides the obstruction on your face, you look pretty cute to me.  Personally, I think swagger is the key factor in attractiveness when your raw material is already good.  My boyfriend can always make me laugh, smells good, and is a snappy dresser.  It was more his attitude that drew me to him, although being cute to begin with is pretty helpful.  Always smell good, keep your nails clean, and carry yourself with confidence.  The ladies will be all up ons : )

There is no perfect rule to be attractive but you can try this one.



To be attractive you should be clean and well dressed.
You should wear correct sizes of dress and pants - pairs that are not too tight and not too loose!



You should also consider spraying light scented musk depending on some occasions! Many girls like musk scent.



Then you should also speak and act with a manner.



This is all I could suggest for now.

For the health thing, I also suggest going to a doctor,
but you don't really look like you have problems.



Remember, self esteem and confidence is key.
Accept yourself. Be determined that you want to be better if you don't think you're not good enough yet.



By the way, I believe you're not gay.
You're handsome. :]

yes, do for it.  No, do not post your picture on yahoo answers.  Think about all the people who post ridiculous questions and answers because they think they are funny, do you want your photo subjected to that?  Try hot or not for your photo, that will give you a better idea of what pics look good or not.
And yes, go for modeling.  In 30 years, it will be too late, this is your one shot, while you are young.  Do not quit school to do it, but, give it a shot.  There is only one moment in your life that matters, and it is this one.  What do you want to do with this one moment?

Of course your family and friends say yes :-) I really don't see the point in posting pictures on Y!A... everyone is SO judgmental and they don't even know WTF they're talking about anyway.



But I guess it's up to you, if you wanna post pictures, go ahead.

Well you may not get honest answers.  If you are really beautiful some girls might be jealous and tell you that you are ugly out of spite.  Then you have people that will feel bad if they tell you that you aren't very pretty so they will lie and tell you that you are pretty.  Then you have the people who think you are just fishing for compliments.  Then you have the perverted guys who are going to stalk you.  i wouldn't.

I'm not sure we can really judge whether you're suited to become a model since modelling isn't all about looks. Besides, if your family and friends agree that you should, then why not give it a try? That is of course, if you want to.

watching next top model and those shows I don't think it's about good looks anymore, you just have to know how to pose....so start practicing in the mirror and maybe try out!!!! but honestly, the ugliest girl won canadas next top model last year, so if you have that passion don't let anything stop u!!!

I think you should post your pics up on Y!A, but I don't really think people might be truthful. I mean, they could say your ugly because they are jealous, or say you are beautiful just to get the best answer. Anyway, it sounds like you have loads of support from your family & friends so I say go for it anyway! =D

Sure you should go for it.  Do whatever your heart leads to you do.  The funny part is that it doesn't matter how you look it is whether you have that special something.  It does help if you are exotic looking, 5'10", and skinny.



Models wouldn't be concerned about what people say about posting a picture.  Models post pictures because they want to be seen.  Post your picture and keep posting pictures.

go ahead, post your pic but i should warn you that there are a lot of people out there who'll stop at nothing to get you down. If you're really serious about modelling, send your picture to a modelling agency instead of posting it on Y!A.



By the way, how tall are you? Runway modelling requires you to be at least 5'7 but if you're short like me, you should just be in print ad modelling.

do not post your picture on YIA, it wouldn't be a very good platform to start from. plus yeah, read above answers telling you all the reasons why you wouldn't get a fair rating.



most of the time it's not about how you look exactly, as long as you have even features of course, it's about having your own look (agyness deyn is on top of the modeling world right now, she's unique and she has fun with it) and knowing how to pose. try getting a professional shoot done and judge for yourself if you can handle it. or you can get a friend who's into photography do it, cheaper, lol.



it's a hard career to go into, and it's not forever, so if i were you just do it for fun right now and don't drop the rest of your life for it. and see if you can handle the possible rejections and pressures that go along with it. if you're deadset on it, try sending some of your shots to agencies and see their feedback (the good, professionally done shots i mentioned of course). who knows?

Shaving is fast but your hair grows back thicker and blacker than ever.
Waxing is good because it lasts for a long time and your hair doesnt grow back yuck.
It depends on how much time you have at the time. I recommend you to do a combination of both waxing and shaving depending on the time you have.

not true about thicker darker hair on everyone, my leg hairs are really light and very thin still and i'm 35 yrs old, I can go a week (or more) without shaving and you can't see it or feel it (unless you look super close), shaving is way less exspensive but it does dry your skin more and you risk cuts so you have to decide what you like best and weigh the pros and cons of each. good luck on your decision (now starting to wax your eyebrows, that is a whole nother story)

I'm 13 too, but I wax & I have only evey shaved once. Alot of my friends shave, but when the hairs grow back it grows back thicker, & not as soft. I would wax, but try shaving, & if its works well for you keep it up. Oh, & remember... put cream on your legs once a day, when you get out f the shower & exfoliate in the shower.



Ohh & one more thing, if you dont like to wax go to a beautition or the cheaper why, the chemist!

it depends on the fabric.  you can use acetone but if the pants are nylon it may effect them.  try it on the under cuff or inner pocket.  nail polish remover may not work but pure acetone should.

It depends what fabric the trousers are made of.  Usually you can use acetone, nail polish remover.  If you go to a manicurist ask what they use to remove false nails and that may work also.  Be careful because some solvents can also remove color from the trousers.

You look really cute, but I think the Ray-Bans look better with longer hair.  I think you'd look good with a little more length.  I don't usually notice the watches that people have on when I see them briefly, but I do notice fit on clothing so make sure your shirt fits well.

No !  I do NOT think freckles are ugly.  In fact . . . .I've ALWAYS thought they were really different and ATTRACTIVE !  I think what you're needing is more self-confidence.  Try to take classes like karate and build on that.  It will give you a good contact with the opposite sex and teach you defensive skills and confidence building, too !



By the way. . . . .one of my most favorite actresses has always been DORIS DAY !!!  And she has TONS of freckles !!!!!!!!!  And she was/is cute as a "button" !!!!!!!!!!!

Red has contritubed to our society for many decades dating all the way back to when the britains who were referred to as the "red coats" wore this color with pride but ultimately led to their doom due to the extremity of these colors clashing with the woods they were trying to hide within. Red also has a histroy in cars..think about a ferarri which is usally best suited in a red..facts show that cars are more likely to be pulled over if they are red. also take a moment to look at our society as well and the rules within..heavy traffic rules are enforced and are helped by red stop signs and lights because this color does attract the most attention. so in a sense yes i agree with you that red is the essence of power and i suppose i could vouche for the sophisication part as well since the british were known for there wealthy kings and warlords who often sported the red coat...and dont forget that "lady in red" song lol and red lipstick as well it just attracts attention

definately bright colours and bold prints - i'm guessing you're american by the way you have spelt colour (hehe) so not sure if you will have heard of a British singer called Kate Nash...
She has similar skin tones and hair colour to what you have described - perhaps you could take some ideas from the way she dresses...

Hi have copper blonde hair and I always look good in dark colors such as black, brown, deep purple, etc... Stay away from yellows and beige colors as this will flush out your hair color and skin tone. Hope this helps.

<question>



I'm so confused. I've just found out i'm almost 4 months pregnant and it's not my boyfriend's?



my boyfriend and i have been talking a lot about having sex and i was finally ready to have sex with him on his birthday which was about 4 months ago. When I went around to his house on his birthday I found him with another girl having sex. This girl was his best friend's girlfriend and I can't stand her and she can't stand me and treats her boyfriend like dirt.



I told her boyfriend everything i'd seen and he broke it off with her and i broke it off with my boyfriend. I ended up having sex with him because I was angry and upset with my boyfriend who I only started going out with again a month ago because he'd grovelled so much and he friend who I had sex with encouraged me to go back out with him because he was going into this downward spiral.



I took my best friend's advice to tell my ex bofriend I was pregnant and he got angry and hit me when I told him it wasn't his. He's been calling me a slapper and a **** and telling me that I sleep around. I know it's not the best relationship but he did say sorry afterwards and did make it up to me. I'm scared if i break it off he'll go back into this downward spiral.



I'm not healthy enough to support a child in my body anyway. I'm hospitalized every year and christmas because I get so sick.
I have a terrible weak immune system because I was born at 6 months. If some one has a mild cold around me, I get the flu. I have to get a flu shot every so often I think it's yearly I dunno. I have to have my blood taken every six weeks to see if it's all ok.



I'm pregnant and so confused I don't know what to do anymore. I either abort it (I don't believe abortion is wrong. It's not alway's the woman's fault she get's pregnant. It could be rape or anything.) or put it up for adoption because I'm not ready to be a mother. I was angry and upset and I know I keep this baby my boyfriend will hurt me and the baby because it's his bestfriend's and he can't control his temper.

first off most places wont perform an abortion this far along unless for a medical reason such as your baby having a birth defect - in your case most doctors will refuse to do it - as its sick!



secondly you dont seeing anything wrong with killing a baby at 4 months prgnant!!!! you will start to feel your baby kick you soon - yo might even feel it alredy - does that mean nothing to you?!



pregnacy week 16 (4months)
Because her muscles are developing, she can make some faces now. Your baby is able to squint, frown and open its mouth. There is enough calcium in the bones that they will show up on an x-ray. Your baby's fingernails are well formed now and the legs are longer than the arms. Because your baby is moving well now, you may begin to feel his movements!



so you want to get rid of this beautiful formed baby and keep your cheating abusive jackass boyfriend? thats crazy!



did your doctor say anything about the fact u have a low immune system will affct the baby in any way? ive had flu and chest infection in my pregnancy and i have a low immune system but my baby is jsut fine!



stop making excuses and take responsibility for your actions! if you kill this formed baby and stay with this guy who cheats and hits you - you are the lowest of lows...get rid of him and focus on this baby !

once a hitter always a hitter, trust me they always say sorry they didn't mean it but in the end they will end up doing it again. trust me my best friend gets hit by her fiancee and i mean to the point where shes black and blue and alli can do is call the police, she leaves but ends up going back anyway.
the pregnancy..hun if you physically cant carry a baby because you get to sick you may want to seriously think about abortion ( yes i believe its wrong but depends on the circumstances though) and seriously if you continued the pregnancy and had the baby then the chances are you both would be sick all the time and that will be a physical and emotional drain on you.. adoption i dowt you would be able to handle i know i wouldn't be able to handle it..carrying it for 9 months giving birth then handing it over, no i wouldn't be able to do it one day that child's going to want to know who his/her mum/dad are and your going to always wonder and want 2 one day meet him/her as well... yes bringing up kids is hard im a single mum of 2 boys aged 11 and 6 and im finding it hard as they have terrible attitudes swearing etc.
anyway instead of me rambling on which im sure u and 100 others aren't going to want to read all i can say is ,  you know the answer, its lays within yourself and only you know whats best. if you ever want to talk just send me a message.
take care of yourself hun and all the best and i really mean that xox

i do wish u the best of luck in what ever you decide to do and i hope you stay safe

Well you have a lot on your plate at this time' and need to soul search and see what will make you happy.If you cannot carry a baby you need to go to your doctor' to see your options asap as your getting bigger and more pregnant' and 4months is too late to abort already.If you knew this you should of used protection instead of making everyone including you suffer  My sister had a baby which she was to abort but in her drug stooper she forgot' and left him in the hosp as baby boy doe.My mom and me went to get this angel boy as it wasn;'t his fault so why should he suffer' for their ignorance.My mom died so now he is with me and i thankGod daily that he lived and is in my life.I lost my baby at 4 months as he had no heartbeat ' and it took the life out of me' and i never had tried again; for a child.God brought my boy to me' and he calls me mom ' as my sister is dead now' and left 3 other kids motherless' behind them damn drugs' as she was murdered.Please do the right thing' and if you can carry the baby full term' give it to someone who will cherish' and love them forever.

I can't access your photo... it won't let me.. Anyway, it doesn't matter what others look like. It's your life.. just choose to live it the way you want. Life is too short to worry about what every other bozo looks like. There are two types of people in this world:



1. Those who are beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside, and
2. Those who are ugly on the outside and nice on the inside

Do girls like guys who dress nicely and care about their hair? ?



A lot of guys don't seem to care about their appearance, i.e. they have short hair thats easy to look after, boring clothes, don't shave etc.



I do care but would this make me look gay and unmanly?



Thanks.

It might be because you are so young.  At this age, this shouldn't concern you.  You should love yourself no matter what others think.  Also, you can't trust everyone out in the world.  Especially on the internet.  I'm sure it was reported to protect you.  You need to be very careful on the internet.  You should never post pictures of yourself or give out any personal information.  Be careful!

Because all the children are pretty.When they become teenagers,They are concerned about their looks.They are also pretty but not so confident what others will think about them. You must be confident about yourself.It makes you more attractive.At this age you should not worry about looks but you could learn new things.

no its just that if you sleep with them [why would you do that?] or just keep tighter ones in for a long time. then your boobs wont have as much growing space and it will slow the growth rate down so you will end up smaller

Not true,
Ive always worn padded bras in my teen years, I even slept in my bra. I was small chested and Im now 19 and 34E so I dont think theres any truth in that.



But wearing the wrong bra size can cause an array of health problems, so get fitted regularly

What can happen is that pushup bras do the work for your muscles beneath your breasts so they become weaker and your breasts appear smaller.  They don't actually shrink, though.

I need some confidence.?



Ok, so, I have come by girls who are 'big' size, or some who have petruding bellies wearing really tight clothes, or sleeveless.



I really admire them for not giving a damn about what others may think of them.
And, yet, I am not fat, nor do I have petruding belly. But, I am not thin either. I'm petite, of average size. I long to wear sleevesless, and some more revealing clothes,but I am afraid others may think I'm fat. I kept thinking I have fat arms, so I usually wear just t-shirt.
I really need someone to tell me that it's ok to dress up a little. I need the confidence to dress up. I'm so worried of how others will view my arms, my belly, my hips...

Don't worry about how others view you, as long as you feel good in your skin, then wearing anything will make you look fabulous. Plus, you don't have a pertruding belly and you mentioned that you are not fat so it is okay to dress up a little and boost up your self esteem because you have the body, so flaunt it!

Tall dark and handsome? ?



I'm quite tall, my skin is normally pale but I've got a tan, brown hair, brown eyes, and some people tell me I'm handsome. Apparently this is a good combination on guys but I hate my dark features, and I put suncream on even in Autumn to stay pale. I also hate the colour of my eyes sometimes, but I'm fine with my hair colour.



It's getting really really irritating, it's like I can't accept myself.



Here's a pic of me:

I like how you use the term handsome, it seems very old fashioned and more sincere(don't come across that often these days). anyway on to the issue. I think its perfectly natural that you are never satisfied with how you look especially when you're young. So if you're not happy, change it up every once in awhile. Get green contact lenses, and on days you feel like you hate your eye colour, put them on for a change. Highlight your hair if it will make you feel a little happier. What you have to come to terms with or to accept is that you're never going to totally happy with yourself and that is perfectly normal AND it keeps things interesting if you're willing to change your looks every once in awhile. I go through that same thing every month lol, when i was in my teens i got blue contact lenses, and im asian, suffice to say it wasnt a good look but it made me happy for awhile. So I'm content with just changing my hairstyle now heh. So point is, if you're frustrated with your look change it, the big plus is if you don't like it you can always change it back :)

Not from what i have realised....by the sounds of things you normally wax so your hair is probably fine and lighter....using hair removal cream for a while will not change your hair growth dramatically....and after the baby is born you can go back to using wax again....

I would definetly not suggest using a hair cream when your skin is this sensitive, if anything it will be more harmful than wax although it wont make your hair come back quite as dark as when you shave.



I find that the creams dont work as well as they make out also , and often leave me with a rash afterwards due to all the chemicals and i dont have very sensitive skin.which could happen to your skin.



your best option probably is to shave

hmm, no it is not like that, when your hair grows back it can be stronger but not actually thicker like on shaving its almost like the same as before you use the hair removal cream...
but try to that after you're baby has born, you might get side effects on doing that, you never can tell what will happen...
well then, congratulations your having a baby...

Please! All you really beautiful, big eyed girls out there, I need your help. People already tell me I have big eyes, but I don't think they are. I want to have big beautiful eyes. Is there anything to eat, or any exercises or makeup tricks? PLEASE! I beg you. My formal is soon, and I want my sweet heart to look at my eyes and tell me that they're beautiful.

False eye lashes definitely help. I've never been told I had big eyes until I started wearing them. I wear pretty long ones too, and people constantly tell me I have big eyes now.



But if you're not into false eye lashes, a good make up trick is to apply eye liner or shadow around the outside corners of your eyes, and a lighter shadow on the inside corners.

use eye liner and eyeshadow that is the similar shade to your eyes, they not only enhance your eyes to make them look bigger but they make your eyes sparkle more too.. Shades that are opposite to your eye colour will make your eyes look smaller.

Using eyeliner, you can tight-line your eyes on the upper eyelid making your lash line more dark and closer together, using eyeshadow, use brighter colours and be sure not to use dark colours because they will only make your eyes smaller and wispier. Curl your eyelashes, and then apply several coats of mascara to give your eyes a brightening, open eyed effect and it will give your eyes that extra oomph! An easier but slightly harmful alternative is using colour contacts, or circle lenses (which could potentially harm your eyes).

2)take a black or v.dark eyeshadow and blend it into the outer eyelid as to create a smooth transitiion between colour n black.

i have big eyes, depending on what im doing i change my make up. definately keep away from black eye make up, put a white eyeliner on the bottom inner lid and it really opens up your eyes and brings out the whiteness in them, make your lashes long, either with a 2 step mascara - the one where you put white on first with microfibres that cling to the end of your lashes and then coat with black that just colour them, instant false eye lash effect, or if your comfortable donning some fake eyelashes try those, but have a practise first as you dont want them to hang off half way through the event!



sometimes i do put smokey colours on my eyes to make them stand out in a different way but if you want the big eye effect then keep with your white eye liner and a nice pastel colour on the lids.
white eyeliner is a must have and a great trick, plus drink loads of water just keeps your skin fresh, so will reduce any darkness under your eyes which again will make them look fresh and lovely.
hope this helps xxx

How do I color my synthentic wig to a lighter shade ?



I bought a synthentic 3/4 cap fall to blend in with my own hair color and it is just way to dark. I'm wanting to know if there is a way to lighten this wig to be a better match with my own hair color.

Getting a lot of 7???????



If I am getting a lot of 7 and sometimes 8 when people grade my face on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being highest, does that mean I'm just average looking? A 7 is just a so-so right?

Hell no! A 9/10 only comes once in a lifetime for every person, and the 10/10 is the person they probably end up marrying. A 7 or an 8 is just short of that. For most people a 7 or 8 is stunning.

Sometimes,



If it a strapless top then yes. In winter when I'm all covered up then no.



My ex preferred me hairy, he said it felt a bit dirty (in a playful way) when after removing my clothes he found that I wasn't perfect. This also applies to my legs. In winter when they're covered and I can't be bothered then I probably don't shave but when it's warm and I wear skirts then I do. If the next man doesn't want me to shave then I won't. It saves a lot of time. If, on the other hand I'm making a first impression with a new man I start off shaved and then see what he likes.



It's all about preference, not cleanliness. Showers take 5 mins to have and can be done in the morning and before bed. With shaving time, it takes longer!

YES! I am not going to be like my aunt, and I'll tell you I will not hug her while she is not wearing something with sleeves!! I'll get lost in the jungle. I leave it longer in the winter though, maybe only a once or twice a week then. In the summer, every couple of days.

Get your nails done french style instead and leave them neutral with the white tip. I don't think black nails are nice anyway, so I don't think they are good for a wedding. Silver is good with anything other than silver. You could go with something bold but I think you should just get them done with french tips.

I think a deep red color would be perfect. Some of my favorites come from Essie, a brand that mot manicure places (and even some drug stores) carry.



Here's a link to all of their red polishes; my favorites are A-List and Wicked (looks almost brown on the website, but it really a dark blood red):



http://www.essieshop.com/index.php?cPath...



Also, OPI (another brand a lot of manicure places have) has a tool where you can see how each of their polish shades will look on your skintone (though some of the reds look more pink online than they do in person):



http://www.opi.com/opi/opistudio.aspx



Another good color is Chanel's Shanghai Red.

its so boring, its natural jsut a mousey brown, i have dyed it blonde in the past but never darker and in the last few years ive just had it natural.



My hair style does look a bit different now form those photos, its a bit shorter and has a side fringe but theres not much else i can do with the style as my hair is naturaly very thin and straight and flat.

Some layers would add volume and bangs are all the rage right now. I think you'd look great with a side swept bang and some high/low lights. Your hair is a very pretty color though so you might feel better with just a new cut. Very dark hair wouldn't compliment your skin tone, in my opinion. Good luck

I'm not a teen but i think i know how i can help. Ive put a site this is where i get the lotion to apply to my skin after I wash it. I have the same sore red spots. I clean my face with clean and clear oxgenating fizzing cleaner. one a week i apply this mask on called got 2b in your face groovy peelin masque the flavor of it is cucumber chamomile mango.



It took about 2wks of constant use for me to see any results. the lotion starts working in like a day to keep your skin silky smooth and nice looking. if you have any questions just contact me.

It's only normal if you are in a band like My Chemical Romance or Fall out boy.

that is kind of weird. he may be veeeeeery metro sexual. or just gay, and just hasn't told anyone yet.



But yes some guys don't like the macho man look and just like looking slender and "petite" but not necessarily like a girl.
he may just be a little confused also.

u don't look either, not fat, not buff...Increase your weight, you should reach "muscle failure" to increase mass.  Meaning do your lifting until you can't lift another thing, and your muscles feel tired and a little shaky.  This is how the army supposedly trains their soldiers...I don't know for sure cause I'm not in the army but that's what I've heard from 2 of my friends who were.

Beautiful girl.  The only thing I would suggest is getting your eyebrows done.  Dont let them take too much off though..just tell them to clean them up a bit.

Smart sharpen and use curves on an adjustment layer, then ctrl+j to duplicate the layer and apply a Gaussian blur and erase around the eyes and lips. :P (graphic design joke, just kidding.) ;)



But in all seriousness, you don't seem like you could improve much, I like your hair, and you have nice skin. Personally I don't care for nose rings, but that's your own preference.

and i know you don't want people to go on about how "looks shouldn't matter" bla bla bla, because we can't lie about the obvious, people DO judge other people on how they look, and thats just that.



but seriously, just have a little more confidence in yourself. your a very pretty girl, but being so unsure of yourself gives off a bad vibe to people around you. When you know that your as great as you are



(with out being to cocky lol) then everyone around you will know it too!

You are gorgeous! But to be honest, you'd look better without foundation because I can see your perfect skin underneath, then there's like a powdery blotchy colour ontop (foundation). And I agree with the other chick, you're too pretty for him... but you'd make such a cute couple! &gt;.&lt;

Celebrities are bombarded with people competing for their affections and trying to get their attention.  You'll expend a lot of energy not being yourself - better just be YOU in all situations and see what wonderful people you will connect with, see who will truly treasure you for who you are.

i love your eyes!! ur lashes are so dramatic! if heavy makeup around the eye is your style then go for something sparkling or metallic but if its really bold go a little less heavy to balance it out.



try adding some volume to your hair but keep your hair color to get a razor cut messy look that will complement your eyes or grow it out some but keep a lot of layers to make it choppy and interesting looking.



to balance out ur bright makeup wear some more casual clothes so u dont look like a neon goth... go with some off white shirts and pale tank tops pair with normal jeans and flat boots.

Oh. My. Days.



So, if you aren't happy with your face can we swap 'em? Seriously, you're stunning! You have really striking features... and nice legs too (if you don't like those, I'm 5'2" and can do with the extra height).



I think that you actually look better than all those celebs you have pictures of... Though yes, those hairstyles would suit you. And thank God your make-up isn't like that all the time. On a night out, great! 9-5 working day, best to tone it down a tad.



Style-wise, just shop around in places like Topshop, H&M, River Island, etc. Also check out Camden Market and go to second-hand/vintage stores.



And have a bit more confidence. You'd look wicked in a bin bag. But don't try that - might be eco-friendly but you'd be committing social suicide.

You are actually a very pretty girl and you seem to have great style.  Your skin is perfect.  Try some light bronzer on your forhead nose and cheekbones to tone down the pale a little.  You have really nice eyes (blue/grey?) that would look great with bronze/copper colored eyemakeup.  If you want a bigger change I think that a chin length layered bob with side bangs would great on you too.  the more voluminous curls in the passport picture look really nice.  I wouldn't go too much darker than the passport picture with your hair since your skin and eyes are so light.  You could always add some stand-out highlights to brighten things up a bit.

well no offense but you will never lok like them... yur face shape/chin/cheeks/bone structure isnt the same as those girls therfore you wont be able to pull off the look...
hannah beth (the girl in the second pic) is a Metalhead and you cant look lik her...
your makeup and hair is already almost exactly lik hers if you dont see it...
the other 2 girls are wayyyyyyyy darker than you... thefore their faceshape and features are different and you wont be able to get the same look....



i love your eyemakeup but what i can recomend is some bronzer/highlighter/blush (it'lll make your whole face brighter and more alive)
heres a video on how to use bronzer/blush/highlighter

You're very pretty!! (and btw I love your eye make-up in the first picture!)
Anyway, about your question...
I think a hairstyle like Katy Perry's would look great on you, maybe something like this : http://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa117... for a night out and a style like her's in the 'I Kissed A Girl' video for everyday..
It looks like you've got the hourglass figure to pull off a vampier clothing style like Cheryl Cole's or Kim Kardashian's. I'd add some leopard print in, it would look nice with your hair color!

You need to love your body. This is the body you were born in, you need to start appreciating its beauty. You have a great skin tone, awesome body and fabulous eyes. Start looking at the positive, stop focusing so much on the negative. Trust me when I say you are beautiful. In my experience, however I may look prettier with more makeup on, I don't feel pretty. Looking pretty and feeling pretty are two different things. I feel like I'm not myself with tons of make-up on. Have you ever gone natural? Or just wear mascara? I love feeling natural, it makes me love myself. When I'm wearing tons of make-up I may look prettier, but I don't feel prettier. Why don't you try not wearing so much make-up and enjoying your natural beauty. I love your pale skin, I think dark hair and pale skin is very pretty. Plus your blue eyes makes everything just pop. Start to love your body, and the confidence will flow. I know I may not be the prettiest girl in the world, but I feel confident enough to see my own beauty and appreciate my body. I hope you can do the same.

You're obviously quite slim, so this isn't a matter of there being too much fat on your body. You really should do some weight lifting.

hmmm, can't remember when I last had an itch down there but I'd bet sitting down on a bench or chair and wiggling a bit might work....
I'd say if it itches like crazy then you have to itch it with a purse or book or something...making it look like nothing...
I'd say go see a doctor if it is common...it really doesn't sound ... healthy....
good luck.

Do you think that big noses are a masculine trait?



I know silly question but I guy on youtube that I'm subscribe to was talking about Alek Wek. He said the reason why she is unattractive is  because of her big nose. But at the same time said that actor Dijmon Hounsou is masculine and handsome even though he has a big nose.

Women that have softer features such as Iman Bowie are perceived as more feminine and more attractive?

<additional details>



No a small nose doesn't equal European she is Somali and has Somali features. I have a small narrow nose and I'm west african we can have all sorts of features.



I do agree that the western societies definition of beauty is limited though.

I think you have a good figure, and your legs arnt chubby. I wouldn't worry to much about it now as it will change alot over the next few years as your body develops in different places.



Just make sure you eat well and get regular exercise and you will stay in good shape x

i think your cruvey and shouldnt listen to what other people say and
ask yourself do you think you look good in a binkini?



i think you just got to tone up abit
but beside that nothing wrong



we all want to have the perfect body to wear a bikini, from saving us from embarresment but if you look around at the beach...there are people that are much more worse than you...



sometime we compare our self to celebrity



and feel ashamed or not high rated as them....



but celebrity got people looking after them and its their jobs to look all skinny



you just got to remember there are guys out there but love curvy women, and if the world was full of skinny people it would be to boring



and you don't have any big marks or scares on your stomach so thats another good point

Do I have to shave my face if Im meeting my inlaws for a fancy dinner?



I figure I'll ask this in the beauty section. Realize that I'm going to comb my hair though AND wear a tie.
Would this be enough or will these clowns think I'm disrespectful for not shaving my face before meeting them for dinner?

Yes, you guys look cute together.
But who cares?
It's about if you two love each other or not.



Inside compatibility overpowers looks ultimately.
I'm in grade 9, and theres so many couples at my school who look strange together but when you see them interact, it's as if they were ment to be all along.
You should NEVER change yourself for a guy. I know you already know that, but if he loves and respects you he won't care if you have a bad hair day, or decide not to wear make up.



Best to the both of you! :)

What should I be for Halloween (pics)?



Usually by now, I know exactly what i'm gonna be for halloween, but this year i'm stuck. Last 2 years I was a scary witch and the year before that a pirate (i'm not a cute pirate). This year I wanna go for something scary, but sexy. Here are a couple pics of me so you can see what would look okay on me. Thanx, no rude answers please.

A song sorta like this came on the radio when me and my friends were in the car the other day and my friend said, "Hey, a song that sounds like all the other songs on the radio!"
It's good, but it's a little predictable. Add a surprise ending. I mean, if "she" stole "him", then you should steal "him" back.

we can trade. i hate my freckles. I'm not covered in them but still i hate them. you can have them. PLEASE DONT SIT IN THE SUN FOR HOURS!  it can cause sun damage to ur skin (brown spots wrinkles skin cancer) but if you really want them and you burn easy dot them on with brown eyeliner. its a grantee of not damage to your skin anyway.. =P

you'll be fine. it takes a day or two for the skin where you waxed to get back to normal and lose the redness.

Don't worry - I'm 14 as well and have waxed my bikini line several times. Irritation is normal after you wax - little red bumps may come up and the red will go away in a couple of hours (4-5 hours for me, it depends on each person). Unless it really really hurts, don't worry if it's red.

And no, it's not too soon. If you have hair, why not wax it? Especially if you're going on holiday and are going to be wearing a swimsuit/bikini.

Good luck! Hope I helped :)

first you're not too young! i started getting my bikini line waxed 2 years ago when I was 14! and even though its your first time you'll be fine, it'll be a bit red at first but it goes down within 2 days so you'll be fine for putting your bikini on on the first day of your holidays!

i never knew there was an option for numbing...
i have mine done, has been done for about 6 years now.  it didnt hurt that bad.  i'd say a 2.  it hurts AFTER when it starts swelling, but not everyone swells.  i swelled so badly that i couldnt eat for 2 days.  my best friend didnt swell at all.  it hurt a lot less than my navel piercing, and i think it hurt less than my cartledge.  they just take a pair of forcepts that have holes in the end, hold your tongue with them and stick a needle thru the middle, then use the needle to guide the piercing into place.  done in like 30 seconds, if that long.

I had mine done, and i stretched it.

There was no numbing involved.



On a scale of 1-10 it was  1.



I didnt feel it at all.

If you get one, watch out for gum recession.. If it looks like your gums are deteriorating, TAKE IT OUT. otherwise youll have to have surgey to fix yoru gums. The dont grow like regular skin does.

numbed? that's an option? i've never heard of that...

the piercing it self does not hurt.
it's afterwards that is painful but it all depends on the person. I'd give it a 4.5 because it swelled up for a few days and i couldn't eat hard foods or make out with anyone. lol.

Yes, definitely. Its amazing what a professional can do, even if you think they're messed up. Worst case scenario, you have to draw them in a little bit until they grow in some and someone can fix it for you.

Yes, if you can afford it- they will color them in how they should be and then have them take a poloroid picture or something that you have so you can do your brows like that until they grow out- that is what my friend did and she looked soooooo much better!

I've actually heard that if your eye brows don't match up (such as patches missing) that if you use hair growth products such as rogaine and what not it can make your hair grow back. Just use a qtip and place where you need hair and just let it grow out.

Get them waxed, and then pluck the stray hairs, and those only when they grow back.
Leave the shaping to the professionals if you can't do it.

I have a couple of bald spots on my eyebrows, so I just put a light line of brown eyeliner and the smudge it with one of those makeup sponges.

I'm a beauty therapist and what I do is draw the shape I want and then pluck under that line. Don't pluck anything from above the line. You can't go wrong then. Just don't forget to wash off the line. Do that while it starts to grow back.

You're actually really pretty (:

I think you should wear less eyeliner...just a bit of it should look nice, and then sweep some mascara on and you're done, I like the color of your hair..So I think that looks fine enough (: But maybe if you'd like, darkening it wouldn't be too bad

ur cute ... dont change ... the only thing i would suggest is .... it might just be the picture so sorry if i cause offence... but your hair colour is a bit brassy and yellow so im assuming its not ur natural colour (unless ur strawberry blonde and its not very clear) so why dont you go a ncie brown colour ... or dark blonde ... you dont have to go really really dark ... a hair dresser would be able to advise you of a good colour... it would bring out your eyes (green/blue i cant really tell) and look nice and natural and just get it cut to a style suiting ur face ... enhance the cute u have now!!!  .... Love the hairband :)



So stay beautiful :) 
Good luck xxx

<question>



What are some ways to make you look older?



anyone know how you can make me look like im 17? Ok! im 11 years old and I wanna go see this movie called the Mummy Returns. But they wont let me see since im under age. I told my mom if she can go buy the tickets, and she told me im too little for that movie.



Ok so heres my idea! I really wanna go see that movie. But I need to look a little older to get in. Does anyone have any ideas of what I can put on , what the things I need as well to make me look taller? And most of all make me look OLDER!



I have my mom's clothes, and I have my big sister clothes, but she is 16.



What should I do????????????????

I would suggest waiting till you actually get old like the rest of us, and enjoy your childhood!!! Once you get older, you can never go back.  Or wait til the movie comes out on DVD and have your older sis rent it.

if you're going to see an R movie, don't make the mummy. find something worthwhile. and also, if you're 11 it's going to be very, very difficult to look convincingly 17 and if they ask for an ID you're in trouble. just buy the tickets off of fandango, buy the tickets to another movie and sneak in, or accept what your mom says as reasonable. i didn't see my first R movie until I was 14. don't worry about it

Very pretty girl, maybe a side fringe, you know like sweepy to one side and graduated.  Eyes are beautiful, be care full how much you put on, how you have them are really nice don't cake it on anymore though.  Lips lovely - however the pouting isn't a good look - that is my only criticism.

Let you eyebrows grow a bit longer as they look over plucked and when you do that for a long time they stop growing...doesnt look bad when you are young but once you get older it looks shocking! A fringe might look really pretty on you as you have a high forehead...but you are very pretty.

I think side bangs would look really good on you.
If you don't already have them (I can't tell if you don't or if they were just pushed back).

I dont know if such a thing exisits and even if it did ... computers only analyze data ... they dont understand personality or personal taste... i think if your wanting advice on make up go to a department store like debenhams and pick a make up counter ... eg MAC or Benefit or in the larger Boots stores go to the No7 counter which is a little cheaper and ask them to advise you on make up ... they will be able to match the right colours and give you techniques and a make over ... as for hair .... buy some hair magazines a pic a few different styles you like ... take it to ur hairdresser and ask them which one they think will suit you best and which they think you will be  able to maintain!!!



Its trial and error but its something you need to do not a computer!!! Good luck xxxx

If you want to be thought beautiful, stop worriting about makeup & all that malarkey and start thinking about other people.
Begin the day clean & tidy, of course. Then, when talking to someone, REALLY listen to what they're saying; when among friends, REALLY take an interest in their interests.
This will show in your eyes, body language, subconscious gestures, etc., and  well you can have a face like a bag of spanners and still shine!

there is a website which allows you to upload a picture of your face and try different hair styles however you have to pay for it and i cant remember the name (something like the hairstyler). its quite easy to get used to the make up for your face. first of all assess the shape of your face - round, square, triangular, oval etc. The "ideal" face shape is oval so you can make your face appear more that shape by cleaver use of highlighter and shader. for example shader ca be used on the jaw of a square face to make it softer.
if you google "face shapes" you should be able to find something to help.
there are so many ways of applying make up like lip liner and eye shadows to produce different effects that it would be a long answer to write them all down.
if you cant find an answer on the net message me and ill see what i can write down for you. you may also want to check out a make-up application book which should give you all the info you need.

Its not chavvy. Go to a professional piercer though its better for healing. Bar is better, less movement and heals better. I would give it good 6 months before changing it, cartilage piercings can be a pain.

i think they are good
but they defiantly look better with a bar.
this piercing takes in between 3-6 months to heal properly
so really, you can change it after a month if your lucky.

wear jeans that have more of a straight leg and that will hopefully make you have longer legs, so it gives the ilusion that you are taller

Skinny jeans are the answer! Because you are petite, they will lengthen out your legs and will even out with your longer torso:

PLEASE HELP!! facial mole removal!!



ok, iv got 3, fairly small, flat moles on my face but they look so unsightly. i found this website, which gives natural home remedies to make them fade away/ vanish/ fall off

http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/home...

can anyone tell me by experience any natural treatments i can do at home to make small, dark, flat facial moles disappear/ fade?? honey? potato? garlic? tea tree oil? anything! and how long did it take, are results good? i dont want any scars

thank you. plz dont waste my time telling me to go to a gp/ dermatologist and get it frozen or lasered off. im only 17 so those arent really options. genuine help needed.

Telling you to see a professional is not a waste of time, and actually the genuine help you need. You can not remove or fade a mole yourself. The only way to get rid of moles is to have them surgically removed as they are part of your skin and a sensitive part at that. As someone already pointed out, skincancer often start in moles so be careful what you do.

you can buy a nail polish that you can put on and it tasted really bad when you put it in your mouth, so it will stop you putting your fingers in your mouth. not sure where you can get this from, try google or something.

If your nails are painted, or you have a manicure, it might make you stop biting them so they stay nice and clean.

Wear nail varnish and when you chew them it tastes horrible. You can also get a little pot with horrible tasting stuff in it and you put it on your fingers and it is specially made to stop you biting your nails.

sorry you can't really go smaller unless you want severely painful leg surgery where they break your legs remove sections of bones and pin the bones back together.  lol I don't think that's what you want to hear.



Try standing with heavy books on your head for as many hours as you can.
Kidding!!
You could look smaller by being skinny i guess?  This is not to say you're large or fat but being skinny makes you look smaller.sorry that's all i got.

No. You probably stop growing at age 16 or 18 I forgot. But I think girls stop at 16. Doesn't matter if you grow fast or not. I think guys stop at 18. So they'll be taller then you hopefully by then. (:

Modelling?



I signed up to an agency that helps you break into the modelling world, but i realy didnt think that anyone would get intouch with me, but 2day they rang and said they want me to travel down to London for a four hour photo shoot in about 3 weeks time. I have to take my own clothes too, does this sound dodgy to anyone at all?? I'm waiting for a info pack to arrive in the post too. And i really don't think i have the guts to do it as i'm quite camera shy but everybody has been telling me to do it for years now. Just wondering what people think? Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks guys, no the company are not asking for any money and i will be going with my bf but trouble is he doesnt like the idea of me being a model and is not 100% behind me which is puttng me off! And when am around people that i know i become more relaxed around the camera, so am not completely camera shy!



MADSKAT - i already have a beneficial career, i am fully trained and qualified support worker for people with learning difficulties, i am 24 years old with a two year old daugter so am not a naive at all, modelling is just something i am interested in. Thanks for your answer anyway

Well done that you got picked!
 i would go with a friend or family and take all the clothes and things, it should be good and if you want to get into the modelling world its a good place to start. 
If it is a fake deal, it doesn't matter spend a couple of days in london anyway..and try somewhere else!

That doesnt really make any sence seen as yooh have to BE infront of the camera - thats part of the job !

If they're asking for any money from you then I'd say it was dodgy.  Make sure you take someone with you if you do decide to go.



Maybe you could get back in touch with them to get more information and just to clarify that it's not glamour modeling or something else you weren't expecting.

Take your own clothes, thats odd. I've done a few photo shoots and they always brought the clothes. If your shy you might come outta that after being in front of the camera few times but I don't know about your agency, sounds weird to me.

google the agency name to see if you can find any info on them.
take someone with you when you go, and if you feel uncomfortable with anything they ask you to do (if the suddenly tell you to take your top off) then stop the shoot.
only do this if its something YOU really want to do, dont just do it because other people are saying you should.

You will be fine and once you have been in front of the camera for a little while it will get easier. Just make sure they are not asking for any money from you as modeling agencies will do you a portfolio for free. And take someone with you to be safe. 
Research the agency on the internet to make sure they are reputable.



Good luck!

If it's something you want to do, then take a friend or family member with you down to London, and make sure your parents know all of the details from the agency and all trips so you are not exploited.

But are you doing this modelling thing because you want to or because everyone else thinks you should? If it's not something you want to do then don't spend another second thinking about it - cancel the whole thing and devote your time to something you do love.

2 weeks ago, my friend was also told the same.
and i dont care what they've told you up until this point, they WILL want money from you.
there are so many "modeling agencies" out there, because there are so many nieve young girls, that think ...someone told me to be a model, so "i should do it"....
Find a more rewarding and beneficial career to start, something that actually benefits others or the world, and please dont waste your time.
If you want to do something in the field ,for fun, do it with an agency right in your own area

ps, you dont mention your age, ...unless i missed it, 
but if you and your bf are serious, listen to him.

Oh and my friend? yes, after doing 3 hours of photo shoot, they wanted her, she met with the company owner, the whole nine yards, then wanted thousands of dollars to get her in the business. I've seen and heard it many times.

It's best to inquire as to the legitimacy of this "agency".  If you have a consumer protection agency or a licensing authority, inquire within.

And your boyfriend is probably afraid of losing you.  Now if modeling is your calling, the decision to go is up to you and your parents, not your boyfriend.

Why does age difference have to be such a big deal?



- Does it really matter if you are both in love with eachover.
- Some people are 10 years apart . so what?
- 14 yr old dating 16 year old . so what?
- 15 year old dating 20 year old. does it really matter.

Because when you look at from your twenties it seems fine but why?

20 yr old - 26 yr old
20 yr old - 28 year old

Who else doesnt mind age difference to a certain extent?

Interesting comments, but only few i agree with



I understand that 13-16 year olds can be thinking of nothing else but the *s* word but me for example if i was to be in a relationship with someone in there 20's at the moment i would always let them know where i stand and not to have me knickers around my ankles because i am definalty that way incliend. Also i understand why the majority think that because this generation is really appauling the amount of people i know who have had sex at 13 and 14 is unbelivable and i thing that is why sometimes girls tend to go for the older man so that it might impress there friends but

what if you are somebody younger and not thinking of the relationship for just sex?

I don't but when you are younger I think the age difference is just bigger looking because you don't have much experience and I wouldn't date a guy if he was 17 and I was 13 it just sounds wrong

A five year difference doesnt mean much when its 40 and 45, but when its 12 and 17 or 15 and 20, guys at those ages are after things young girls often dont understand. If it werent for generalizations, there wouldnt be a problem, but it happens all too often.

It depends, because if you're younger and there's a large gap, there is going to be a greater difference in maturity level/goals/etc than an older couple would have.  All in all, age isn't a huge factor...unless you're talking about a 40-something-year-old dating a 20-something!

because..all ppl over the age of 20 are mature enough to be dating  ppl who are older than them.  but a 14 year old isnt nearly as mature as a 17 year old..thats why its frowned upon..  when you are younger, ages are very distinct.
15 and 20 year old?  if they were to do anything...romantic..it would be considered rape. and they could be charged with that in court.
it will make sense when you get a little older.
when i was 14 i dated an 18 year old, at that time, it didnt seem weird to me, but now that i look back on it...not right...and i thought i was "in love" with him...try "infatuation"...or hormones.

14 dating 16 doesn't really matter no.
But 15 dating 20, yes it does really matter. The maturity difference between those two age groups is huge. It's a child dating adult.
A 15 year old no matter how mature they think they are, is not like a 20 year old, they're still a kid and lots of problems tend to arise. I've seen it happen over and over.



20 with a 26-28, they are both somewhat at the same stage. Most importantly they are both adults.

I don't mind age differences as long as its reasonable. 15 dating a 20 year old I do not consider reasonable.

It matters because a 115 year old thinks a lot differently than a 20 year old. It is very easy for the younger party to be swayed in there thinking by there older counterpart. You are also transitioning into different parts of your life at 15 and 20, freshman/sophmore year of highschool and freshman/sophmore year of college. Your question leads me to believe that you are a young girl wanting to date and older man. You would be so much better off dating someone your own age.

Age doesn't mean anything to me. It is a number and nothing more.
I'm 16 and the love of my life is 20. We've been together for over 2 years. 
I think the real problem is under age sex. Two many young girls are having under age sex and are falling pregnant by older boyfriends. And then most of the time their boyfriends leave them.
You need to know and trust AND LOVE your partner before you hop into bed with them.

Good question by the way.

i'm an older guy 37.. and i have lots of friends who are female 17-23  yrs old.. i'm married .. have been 14 years .. and so its not some sort of pervy thing.. i'm just a "good" friend..  my wife is 3 years younger than me.. we met when she was 20 and i was 24 ..



however.. if i was in 9th grade and dating her in 6th grade.. someones balls would have been chopped off... (mine!)



age shouldn't matter.. its compatibility.. do you get along.. do you care for each other.. do you respect each other... do you trust each other.. if yes.. then .. thats a healthy relationship..



if its an older guy say 25 and he's dating a 15 yr old.. thats a guy taking advantage of a girl... thats where the line is "drawn" .. can the younger of the couple "see" manipulation that the older of the couple would more expertly wield .



the sad thing is.. in that range.. 14-18 yr olds.. guys.. are stupid.. immature.. and self centered.. (most, not all) .. and THAT is why girls in that age group look toward the older males.. cuz they've grown up a bit more.



sorry if that was long winded.

That's because people are (don't want to be banned) with no understanding that humans are animals. We've stigmatised sex and made it taboo so that we torture young adults once they reach puberty by not allowing them to do so.

The moment that someone reaches puberty their thoughts are primarily based upon mating. That's a general truth. They may not understand it at the time, if you force it upon them it's rape, they have a right to say no at any time, but it's a general truth. Of course, it's also illegal.

I don't mind age difference in the slightest, love is love if it's from 13-20 or 20-27. Not that the chances of a child being abducted and raped aren't higher. Or being tricked or controlled. But that's a seperate issue entirely.

I believe the saying "age is but a number" to a certain extent. I think you should date whoever you want as long as it's for the right reasons. My boyfriend is 3 years younger than me and literally everyone around me gave me **** for it for a while but now that they see that we really love each other (we've been dating for over a year), they've come to accept it and support us :)

i agree with one of the girls saying its illegal i mean 15-20 seems like a huge gap. if u think about it a 15 year old would think so differently to a 20 year old. theres so much of an age gap, this isnt necessarily true all the time but a 20 year old has probably experienced more in life at that point and is more mature, what would be the point when the girls still a kid (do u understand what im trying to say?) theyr not going to have a lot in common plus hes probably jus gna be using her. Me, personally i wouldnt want so much of an age gap but i understand what ur trying to say. think about it this was though when the 15 year old was born the 20 yr old was alredy 5! ok that doesnt sound as bad as this when he was born her mum was 14!!! my frend told me her mums like 14 years older than her dad and even she finds it a bit odd!! lolxx

I believe that age is just a number, unless of coarse it is someone older dating someone in their teens. I know it probably isn't what you want to hear, but being the age I am now, I know it wasn't right. I dated older guys as a teen, and it only caused problems because it's hard to date someone older. Being young, you think a lot differently than an older person. I had so many arguments and conflicts with ppl I dated at a young age because I saw things differently. Looking back on it now, it really was dumb of me. If you feel that it is right though, I mean totally go for it. It will teach you things in life that you can learn earlier than other people have to learn later.

I think alot of the time it depends on wether it is the boy or the girl that is older! People dont really comment if 18 year old boy is going out with a 16 year old girl but if it is the other way around and the girl is older i think people find it weird ... I have been going out with my boyfriend for 3 and half years ... i was 16 and he was 14 when we started going out .... now im 20 and he is 17 and i know it sounds weird ... but a) he doesnt look younger ... people who have never met us assume we are the same age and b) we love each other to bits and have a great time so it doesnt matter what other people think.

Where sex is concerned i understand the difficulty cause obv its illegal under the age on 16 ... but i would hate to think that that is everyones first thought when they get in a relationship regardless of what age they are... the point of a having a bf/gf is to have someone who makes you feel special and who you can spend time with and rely on!! Sure sex eventually comes into the picture in some way or another and i will not judge anyone in a relationship having sex straight away ... i would just hope that if a 14,15,16....20,21,22 year old was having sex they would have the COMMON SENSE to protect themselves!!! I know too many people who have been stupiud about it!!!



The thing that bothers me about people who have sex at a young age is they dont always use protection and i hear the age old excuses like im embarressed... its too expensive... if u just pull out we'll be fine ... NO YOU WONT!!!!!!! most people are having sex so dont be embarressed ... you'll be even more embarressed 9 months down the line!!!!! Go to a family planning clinic and its free ... same if u go to the docs and its all confidential!!!

I think sex has too much focus now ... and people forget about the other things that are important about relationships ... regardless of age difference!

As long as you care about each other ... age difference if irrelevent ... its other people who make it weird ... and they are normally the people who dont have bf/gf!!!!

(comment from the U.K) It’s all about maturity and also the legal age of consent if you’re under 16 your still a child no matter how you feel about that. So a 15yr and a 20yr got together that’s wrong. I’m with my boyfriend and there is a 10yr gap im 21 and hes 31 but are maturity level is about the same so it works and I also didn’t go out looking for someone older we just got talking and we realized we had a lot in common. But if i acted like some people my age it would’t work.... its a toughy. Also my friend got with her boyfriend when she was 17 and he was 23 , at the time I thought that was a bit weird but they have been toether since and are now engaged so each to your own I guess…..

I'd like to say something, if you don't mind. Beauty shouldn't be a competition, everyone looks better than someone in SOME ways. You both are beautiful, so don't sweat it.

I can tell you one thing. I can see a lot of fun funky personality in your face.

I can see attitude, and a serious personality in your friends face.

Which sounds better?

You have to remember that people only put others down when they feel insecure. My best friend does that too. She always talks about how pretty she is and always makes fun of other peoples looks. I really didnt know why, and one day she just broke down for some reason and told me she was insecure about herself and she said that she was so self absorbed because she had to fake her confidence.



Well anyways, personally i think you guys are just average looking. You're best friend looks more dirty(slutty), not pretty.

WAYYYYYYYYY too much make up for a KID...

you want "opinions???"  attention and compliments is more like it.

The first pic sucks, all you see is a big flash pretty much.

youre an average looking kid who is trying to look older with gobs of make up, sorry, in fact, you look downright trashy.

16?? not a kid?? you ARE A KID at 16, and a very immature one at that.

No but really, maybe you could start a modeling thing for REAL women who are 5ft5 not 6ft.



But since you're only 12, I'm sure you'll grow taller and you probably have puppy fat (maybe not?) so don't give up :)

you must be pretty model like to be spotted twice :D!

You're not really slim.  I'm ten years older than you and at least five sizes smaller than you and I'm also 5"5'.  Six or eight is kind of big for a person who is only 5"5'.  Unless you're talking about children's sizes, and then you're right, you are slim.  And 5"5' is also too short to say you have long legs, and too short to be a model.  When modeling agencies scout you, it's usually a scam to get your money.  It happens to lots of girls, and they get all excited and stuff, but once you get there, they want to build a portfolio for you and that costs thousands of dollars, and they want to send you to classes which also cost thousands of dollars.  There's a lot of problems with agencies scouting girls that I wont even get into.  I'd stop worrying about trying to be all good looking, and focus on more important things that are actually realistic like school and boys.

You can get a list of all the UKs reputable agencies from:
The Association of Model Agents, 11-29 Fashion Street, London, E1 6PX (send a large envolope addresed to yourself) or call them on 09068 517 644

Send a couple of pictures of yourself - one head shot and one full length - to as many agencies as you can.
 If the agency likes what they see, they'll make an appointment to see you. Take a responsible adult along with you. They might pay for some test shots to be taken - but never pay for these yourself.
 If the agency still thinks you've got potential then they'll start finding you work! Good luck!

Models have to be a minimum of 5"7 but ideally the taller the better. However it depends what sort of modelling your interested in because that height restriction applies to proffesional modelling (supermodels, catwalks, designer clothing), but catalogues will hire a variety of people as long as they advertise the product well. To get started though you need to have a lot of professional photos taken, and them form them into a portfolio. Then get into contact with modelling agencies and they will get you started from there if they think you have what it takes and can get you jobs.

Your unoriginal. 
So many girls are walking around now with their newly dyed "scene" haircuts and skinny jeans, slapping on the eyeliner like its cleanser.

Just stop.
Go wash your face, and quit being like everyone else.
And although I don't know you, chances are your a poser, most of the people who dress like you do are.

ummm the first person that answered needs to be quite bcause she's the annoying one, it don't matter if you right it under neath different names, she's the one stalking you and answering your questions so tell her to shutup lol. I think you should well nothing you are beautiful the way you are. But if you must change I would say no eyeliner, and to dress prepy like these following outfits:

1.http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=10969...

2.http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=11181...

3.http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=11343... (I put three outfits together for you on this one)

4.http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=12722... (three outfits in this one also)
 I think you would be such a pretty prep lol, wear like natural make up if you truly need to wear makeup. (i don't think you need to because you are really pretty trust me. I hope I helped.

i'm guessing you got kinda that scene kid look going on, so i would recommended maybe growing your hair out and dying it darker, because no offense, the light color kinda washes you out.



also, easy on the eye-liner!! i mean i know it adds to the whole emo look, but just take it down a notch; it kinda make you look too.... fake.

I thought that Madonna look went out, or never did catch on, about 30 years ago.  You could use some improvement on your eyes, the left one looks like it is about to fall out, and all that eyeliner can't be good for your pores.  The hair looks ok, just a little thick/top-heavy.

You're fine and you already know that. If your mate can get more girls and you are not maybe because you to shy which the girl really don't like it.

You don't look young for you're age, but do something else with your hair and don't open your eyes that way, change those two things and you wouldn't look like a drug user (no offense, if you are/aren't).



But if you do your hair differently, you'd look better. But you're fine.

Look dude, you look OK, the reason your mate gets the girls is because he is probably funnier or cheekier or more confident than you, the upshot here is only shallow chicks go for that ****, all the best chicks are attracted to the quiet interesting guy in the corner!!

yep as everyone else has said.. less gell in the hair go more natural scruffy hair - same style basically but different product... smile and you're hot to trot...

the only thing I'd say is perhaps wearing plain black tees is a bit boring... so spice that up a bit... and yeah relax... and ask some chicks out!!! :D

I'm not gay or anything, but I've seen some real ugly people your  definitely not ugly. Try some protein powder, it gives muscles in like month or so. Girls dig men with muscle, and they "get" complements, which leads to girls making the move on you. Try some its a man-thing.

Dude you look fine. Don't worry about your friend and his relationships. That has nothing to do with you. You aren't ugly. And so what that you look young? Personally, I find that as a good thing. (You won't be an old creepy looking man as fast! LMAO j/k).



Just focus on being confident and if you get a girl, focus on them and don't worry about how you look or whatnot. If they sense insecurity, that will be a huge turn off!

your face can basically be awful (not that yours is its pretty!) and it will be called interesting what I'm saying is it doesn't matter really about your face but about your height and bones structure. You can't see that in your photo but my friend wanted to get into model and she made an account on this site http://www.dieselmodels.co.uk/lowbandsit...
it's about helping people break into modelling. If a photo of yours catches their eye they will contact you and ask you to come over to london to do a photo shoot and if it works out well they might even pay to use a photo of yours in one of their stores. They will offer you your shots but they cost and this will help you start up your own portfolio to help you on your way! Hope this helps!=]

YOU'RE GORGEOUS!  i hope i look like that when i'm older.  you could easily model if you grew out thebangs and maybe straigtened your hair.  You're a 9.  your air is absolutely beautifl, and you have great facial structre.

they are basically the same thing. But cute is more boyish, and handsome is more manly, i think. so cute is better for teens and stuff, and then handsome is definitely better for adults.

black skinny jeans so the teachers dont complain about uniform colours. Then just wear crazy coloured shoes or something. maybe 3/4 trousers and colourful socks long or short.

white or black blouse with short sleeves. then maybe wear a long sleeved coloured top underneath. or lots of coloured bangles or something. you just dont want to be told you cant wear something cause then its complete waste of money so try and stick to uniform but accessorize.
you could try and get away with coloured cardigan or jacket too. jackets you can normally just have them as whatever you want.

bags look cool with lots of badges on them, you know the small round ones. they dont even need to say stuff on them

When I was 15 I was asked to do modelling. At the time I weighed 7 stone and was stick thin. It was in the 'Twiggy' days which was then, I suppose was quite natural. But then again, in the 60's it was 'quite natural' to be thin. Today's models are told to lose weight, alter this and that so that they look good for a camera. There are no limits. You are what you are. If you are happy with the way you look, why should there be any limits?

I model part time, its a great way to get a bit of extra income, its a lot of fun and a great way to improve ones self confidence.

I earn £50 to £200 for a shoot depending on the length and level, personally I do not tend to pose above uk mag level.

For make up I suggest:
Lip Gloss
Mascara
Cover Up ( when needed )

As for straightening your hair it wont ruin your hair too much if you use heat protection spray and if you only straighten your hair twice a week!

Also make sure you look and feel confident.

And be yourself!!

I'm sure you look nice already! But if you're looking for something natural, I would work with what you have. 
*Try new hairstyles- there's so many choices out there! If you're feeling daring, get a bold haircut. Trust me, guys take hair into consideration a lot more than we think!
*Perfect your complexion- try to aim for a near blemish free and smooth face. That means take care of any acne or skin problems.
*Work out. Self explanatory :)
Hope this helps :)

for your makeup you dont even need a lot, to look nice all you really need is lipgloss, eyeliner (i love eyeliner!) and mascara.
there are TONS of things you can do with your hair to make it pretty besides straightening it. ever tried mouse? if you have frizzy hair you can try frizz control and your hair will look amazing! :)

use bronzer! All my friends think i never am wearing any make up but think i look really perky and bright! No one will notice your wearing just apply it to your cheeks! If you want to looked even more tanned apply to chin nose tyop of head and jaw line lightly. I can't ever be bothered to put make up on for school but espically in winter bronzer makes me look so much better and healthier! Straightening won't be too damaging to your hair so long as you condition it and use heat protection spray and dont striaghten it too often. I only straighten mine once a week if even for school! Also you musnt be that old looks aren't everything i know lots of girls that when they were 11/12 everyone thought they were nothing special now the guys are all over them. Just because they wear make up doesnt mean they are good looking, older guys like a more natural look but young boys see make up and think they MUST be pretty as they are wearing make up. Don't wear make up due to being attractive to boys wear what ever makes you feel comfortable. (P.S when your going out with your friends a little bit of eyeliner goes a long way!) Hope this helps ya!

I think eye make-up can dramatically change and enhance the way you look. Try just a thin line of a dark eye shadow under the outer part of your eye. They will look really good without too much effort or make-up

i have hazel/green eyes and usually what works best for me is a dark brown eyeliner on the bottom then i use brown mascara, and a medium colored green eyeshadow, but i also noticed that i if i blend the green with some light brown eyeshadow that makes my eyes pop alot more. but it depends what kind of hazel your eyes are too. Another thing that worked for me was if i did a light purple over the bottom of my eyes, just a thin layer of it and just black mascara. Don't be afraid to experiment =]

Your bf should cut his short and just stick with whatever his natural color is.  Yours looks awesome blond, but part of that is the cut and style - frankly any color would look good.

Do eyelash curlers REALLY work?



I've noticed a lot of women using them, but I can't see how they work considering they aren't heated. I know they make heated ones, but I also think a lot of mascaras that are for lengthening only stretch the lash out so I'm wondering if the ones that aren't heated actually work...

Also, don't you use them before putting on the mascara?

yes, eyelash curlers REALLY do work. you may have to curl them a couple times depending on your lashes. and use them BEFORE you put on mascara because if you use them afterwards, you are prone to pulling out some lashes

Are you speculating or did you take a test?

It seems like you're relatively new to the whole period thing, so the skipping could be natural. But take a test.

It all depends when you slept with the guy and the timing of your period.

Good luck.

well first of all next time you decide to have sex, use a condom.
second of all try just being honest with your parents or tell your best friend and ask her for advice you could get an abortion or have the baby and give it up for adoption. 
or keep the baby, you got yourself into that problem and it's your fault so you should take care of the baby.
and about the guy, if he won't talk to you talk to his parents or get your mom to.

Wow. You should definitely talk to your parents about this. This is entirely too young to be having a child. You are still a child! Maybe, HOPEFULLY, it is just your period being irregular. It took a little while for my period to get regular. Have you taken a pregnancy test yet? You should take a test before you talk to your parents. If you aren't pregnant, you should talk to your parents about birth control. It's young but if you're going to have sex then you might aswell be protected.

Your mom won't kill you. You have been a stupid immature girl, but the damage is done now and you can't turn the clock back. You will have to tell your mom. Sit her down and tell her you are in trouble and hope she will help you. Leave it to her to tell your dad, moms are the experts at breaking this kind of news to dads. But please don't try to keep this to yourself, you need your moms help like never before. yes she will flip, but when she calms down, she will help you, if she is any kind of mother. The longer you leave it the worse it will be and much harder. Good luck.

you have two choices you could get an abortion and your parents dont have to find out.
or you could tell the truth if you want to have the baby,
and you could put it up for adoption if you didnt want it.
maybe going to a clinic just so you could talk to someone who could help.

All this 'dubious' advice given after the event is probably making you feel really good... not!.
Idiots on here!... can't you ever hear cries for help without judgement, you should be ashamed of yourselves...truly.. you should.. do like Bill Hicks advises media advertisers to do and make the world a better place.

any.. Depending on the relationship you have with your parents only you can decide on the approach... this is advisable in all cases even if anger is obviously going to happen, it will pass with parental thought, 
though if you are religious in any way, you would be keeping the child and stress isn't a goo d thing. (this is why many details are needed to make evaluation of the situation you're in).. My advice would be if you cannot approach mum or dad or family member then CAB or a social worker/teacher you can trust with YOUR welfare and not that of what is seemingly politically correct... whichever you WILL need help for yours and the child's health.

Good Luck in your future.. lessons learnt are the ones passed on. You might be a really good mum if  like our own.. mistakes are not always bad ones. people opinions, unfortunately are.

because you're young, you probably wouldn't survive having a baby...

it very well could be an irregular period

You are going to have to tell your mum and then you can think of a way to tell your dad together. My cousin had a baby at 13 and I'm not going to lie, she has a hard time. But now she is 21 and has a decent job, a lovely boyfriend and an amazing 8 year old boy. People will judge you but rise above it, so you made one mistake? You can make up for it for being a good parent. If you do not want the baby it may be too late for an abortion as you say you are 4 months late, but you could always consider adoption. It is a lot to take in but I'm sure once your parents have come to terms with your situation they will help you make your decision x

its a difficult decision between number 1 and number 7 as to who is prettiest. The rest i don't even find good looking particularly number 4 who is absolutely hideous! Number 7 is easier to judge because number 1 is wearing a hat. Number 7 is pretty with nice eyes same as number 1. But overall, i would go with number 1 because i prefer the black hair and she has very nice eyes.

^^I also agree with the answerer that said you looked like Anne Hathaway.

I did a celebrity morph with your picture on MyHeritage and these are the people they named, Kimberly Williams, Natalie Imbrugila, Vanessa Marcil, Alyson Hannigan, Amy Weber, Katie Holmes, Winona Ryder, & Jang Nara.

You should go to this link & try other photos of yourself & see which celebs. are named in other photos of you.

Body doubles fill in for the parts that are not as up to par or great looking as they need to be. Like in pretty women julia roberts used a body double for the poster cover. They are also sometime stand ins, like if an actor has a no nudity clause in his/her contract and a scene calls for nudity they will use a body double, ever seen the end of boogie nights? That was a body double.

An example.

In Kylies video there is a double for alot of the shots. Sometimes big stars don't have enough time to attend all video filming sessions due to other commitments, so they use a double for parts when their faces can't be seen.

When an actress/actor has like bad legs or some body part, they can get a double, or if there is a nude scene, or they have to show their butt, and they don't want to, that's when they use a body double, it's not always the "full" body

Well first things first, if you say you can write/type properly, do it, people will take you more seriously and actually try help to you.

Also try putting a search into google for what it is your looking for, it should show you loads of images of what your looking for and also, get yourself some fashion mags, that is what they are full of!

Good luck!

Its obvious that one of the people in the picture is YOU.. if i did a picture asking am i pretty or who is prettier etc, i would get called for it, yet you get away with it.. BAN these stupid questions.. thought these werent allowed.. Just to amuse YOU.. no 3 is the nice looking one.. 1, and 2 are ugly. Just hope you are no 3 lol..

Ive seen your reply to me.. i dont mean to sound nasty.. just fed up of these same questions.. im just being honest. I hope i havent upset you..

Confidence?



Ok. I'm Not Crying Out For Sympathy, And You Probably Think, Here We Go Another Gimp, Grow Up Or Something. But I Have A Few Moles On My Face That Are Getting Me Down A Lot. I Am Going To Have It Removed In About 4 Months Off Bupa (Private Treatment) And I'm Having Laser.
But A Lot Of People Have Always Taken The Mickey Throughout my childhood and teens and its not fair. I know this is gonna sound so jealous, but all my friends are getting boyfriends and all the boys fancy them and it gets me down because I cant even get a boyfriend myself. They look at all my friends and think omg there so fit, omg there so hot and then it comes to me and there like, eurgh the ugly one and they laugh and its not because im just saying it because ive got low self asteem, i actually know it. I Cant find inner confidence and I dont know why. I Do make an effort with my hair and makeup and I always get comments, people saying I dress well and my clothes are gorj e.t.c but its getting me down! 
Help! xxx



</question>



<additional details>



They are my friends of course, we are all really good friends but I feel like i dont fit in because there so pretty. I feel like they hate to be around me because Im the ugliest one. (even though they dont act like that at all).

I had the same problem. Don't compare yourself to others. Just know that some day, you will find a man who loves you the way you are no matter what and thinks you're beautiful. A few moles aren't going to stop you from living your life.

Would I look okay if I were to go scene?



Okay, I'm not saying I want to, I'm just considering the look because I'm kind of bored of dressing the same way I have been for the past three years. I'm already into the music and the rest wouldn't be too big of a change, just a different haircut/makeup.

I'm bored so I felt like asking. :)

I think you'd look fine, but just dress how you feel comfortable dressing, and dress in a way thats fun for you and makes you feel good about yourself :)  It's okay to mix and match styles, you don't need to officially label your style as "scene".  but just have fun with whatever type of style you choose! :)



</answer>



<asker's comment>



I decided to incorporate parts of the style into my look, like you said. I like this answer because it encouraged me to go with what feels right. :)
Right after I got these answers, I went in my bathroom and cut bangs. They look so adorable and I'm so thrilled with how they turned out =]

Yea you would look really cute scene!
You would need to have straight hair though which might be hard to straighten on a daily basis because of just how curly it is.
You would look good with all the eyeliner and the poofy hair though.

First Time Getting A Bikini Wax?



It's my first time going for a bikini wax. The thing is, I don't know what to ask for. I want everything off apart from I don't want my backside waxed. What should I ask for? I know it is going to be very painful, but I'm gonna give it a shot. What should I do to prepare? I would love some help off experienced people, it would be much appreciated :)
Also where can I find a good bikini waxer in the area of Washington, Tyne & Wear, UK that anyone could recommend. Thanks!

wear comfortable sensible underwear, cotton, to the beauticians because your skin will be very sensitive afterwards.
Oh and wear a dress/skirt not trousers, as you still get a bit of cover up that way....i dont know, i just feel less exposed that way!

By sounds of it you want a full wax or hollywood...
and normally they ask if you want your bum waxed, if they dont, when they say "if you could roll over on your stomach" just say you dont really want that part done....but they always ask you first anyway.

The pain really isnt that bad, its always blown way out of proportion, you'll flinch at some bits but wont cry! 
The first time is always a bit more uncomfortable because the hair is longer, but if you go regularly it wont be so bad.
You can get some lotions in boots that prevent ingrowing hairs, but its good to keep the area moisturised too.
At the end of the day, its worth it and a million times better than shaving!

Btw i am pale too naturally but i have just been on holiday !

Oh For rashes use E45 && talc that works 
If your wearing a dress why don't you try baby oil on your legs (: 
Also don't feel so self consious alot of people wont even notice your uneven skin tone ! But i know it's mainly about you being more confident D: I'm like that sometimes (:

The cream that I have found to work on most rashes (I work in healthcare) is aqueous cream. Not sure if I spelt it right but you can but it from the chemist, boots sell their own brand of it, and use it as a moisturiser, you might be able to get it on prescription. It comes in a big white tub usually. Hope it helps

Well you could try and get a REALLY light spray tan. I'm not sure how to help you there. BUT, about the little bumps. I have have the same thing. I don't remember what it is called, but there is a type of lotion stuff that makes them go away. They'll go away eventually but the lotion stuff really helps. I don't use it, but I have before. You can also try using some baby lotion because that works for me also. If you don't apply the lotion everyday the bumps will come back. I hope I helped. =]

Use a good pair of exfoliation gloves, you can get them in Boots or Bodyshop.  When in the bath or shower, use the gloves with a moisturizing shower gel or soap, and exfoliate well.

Once out the bath and dried, apply E45 cream.  It take away the little red dots and keeps them smooth and clear.

I'm also very pale and hate the feel and look of fake tan, so I make sure that I scrub well to get rid of dry skin.

You should deffinately try E45 cream. It works really well on rashes such as eczema or sore irritated skin and can really help dry skin too which can make your skin appear a lot better. Use it a few times a day, including morning and night. Hope it helps =)

firstly you should only exfoliate every other day not every day, what your describing sounds as if it's eczema? If so its very common and quite a few people have this! You can go to your doctor and he may be able to prescribe cream for it. But what you could do in the mean time for this dress is you could could go to your a pharmacy preferably a larger one, or even better a store like debenhams and ask for body make-up or coverage. It's like a heavy moisturiser which hides impurities, you won't even be able to see the blotchy skin! The woman at the counter will help you find the right tone for your skin. I have a  rash like thing on my hand which isn't actually a rash but still looks awful! My mum bought this type of product and it completely hide it, not that i wanted to i just tried it out and it seriously works! It just blends into your skin and you cant even notice it, hope this helps you=]

You'd see results soon enough, you'd start coughing and get your throat blocked up and stink of it everywhere you go, plus your teeth will become yellow. Don't smoke, i can't bare the smell of it around people. Try a bit of exercising for weight loss. Plus, if you think all you want to do is start and loose a bit of weight then quit, it ain't gonna happen, you'll get adicted and be very sorry you started.

People who smoke and are trying to lose weight just have a ciggie when they feel hungry it doesnt really help with the hunger though and even if it did work when you came to stop - People who stop smoking often find they put on weight because they eat when they have cravings, and at some point you would have to stop so i'd say its pointless, besides why risk your health in so many other ways?!

Don't even let the thought of that enter your mind !!
Smoking just makes you lose your appetite.
Quitting at the end of it will be a lot harder than trying to lose the weight now.
Don't bother. It's foul.

To me it's an old wives tail. I have been a life time smoker of 39 years. I have been quit now for 2 months. I have never lost weight with smoking. I have always maintained my weight by a few pounds + plus or - minus. No, it's not true.

The only reason why smokers tend not to be fat is because they have something to put in their mouth and don't have to eat, my dad gained a good 40 lbs after I helped him quit, so the smoking itself does NOT make you thin

Yes , and just a couple weeks.
Just reach for a smoke instead of a snack.
YouTube is a great place to keep track of your progress , and socialize with other smokers.
You can document your progress and recieve tips from others who love smoking as well.

Assuming you are asking a genuine question...

Smoking supresses the appetite so some people eat less when they smoke.  But not everyone.

Of course when you develop cancer and can't eat because of the tumour in your stomach and the medication, chemotherapy and radiotherapy you have to have you'll be even thinner!  WOHOO!

Where were you when common sense was been handed out??

What is the point in using one addiction to stop another??
IF you do manage to control your diet how are you going to stop smoking and what happens if you do not stop because you can not properly control your eating then before you know it you will look 10 years older with clogged skin and arteries, spots, ashtray breath and never smell clean.  What would you do then but be in a more worse state than you are in

Smoking does not help you lose weight...the reason why some people say they smoke to lose weight is 1. because they smoke when they feel hungry so cigareetes serve as a hunger suppressant and 2. because it gives them an excuse that sounds logical to ignorant people and it makes them feel like their behavior is justifiable

Smoking is not a good way to lose weight.  Nicotine's effect on the appetite is minimal.  Ever notice how many over weight people smoke?

Diet and exercise is the way to go for weight loss.  Try jumping rope or jogging.

Look up photography agencies in you area and give them a call. They probably charge a lot though! Ask some of your friends if they are good at taking pictures, sometimes these can turn out better than a professional! Friends seem to know you so much better, and sometimes they know what will suit you better!

You look at portfolios you think are good and ask who the photographer is. Then you make a booking to have your pictures done.

It is important to make sure you get the photographer whose pics you liked and not just another photographer working for the same company.

that actually is a really good question.
i'm also having struggles starting on that also. 
i found the best thing to do is to trying to find a photographer near you who will do a photo-shoot with you for a reasonable compensation.
there are places that do it, but most of the times they charge around 250 to 300 dollars per hour/session and i personally don't have that kind of money to spend. 
you can go on sites like one model place or model mayhem and search for photographers.



oh p.s. most photographers prefer you to be 18 because of legal/liability issues :]

You might be lucky, some photographers (especially ones just starting out) are willing to do work on a TFP or TFCD basis.



TFP means you allow the photographer to use the photos they take to put in their portfolio, and in return you will get Prints free of charge.
TFCD just means that the photographer will give you the photos on a CD. TF stands for Time For.... i.e.- your time!



Try looking for adverts, or just ask any photographer local to you. Of course, its always a good idea to get a friend to accompany you - be careful & good luck!

I'm all for any model who promotes brunettes or redheads with curly hair, she has beautiful luminecant skin, nice bone structure, nice expressive eyes. What stands out to me about her is she has an ageless beauty. She could fit in with the 15 year olds as well as the 30 year olds. I like her, she's a very pretty model.

I kinda wonder if she really wears a size 4 shoe.

Hi!
Thats not a soap, its a face mask with tea tree, mint and little scrubby bits for exfoliation.
I used to use it religiously, its pretty good and the little pot lasts for ages. 
It dries quite quickly and goes very hard, so I wouldnt recommend it for very dry skin as it could make matters worse.
Buy a little pot and use it sparingly the first time as not all skin can take tea tree oil.
Whilst youre in Lush, pick up a couple of think pink bath bombs..they are pretty expensive but smell divine! x

Lush have amazing cosmetics that are a godsend. 
It works really well and helped me a lot! smells soooo good and the exfoliator gets rid of all dead skin cells and keeps it all fresh. Keep it in the fridge also.
One of my favourite masks by them. Great for spots :D

Hey, your alright (:

but be warned, if you want to be a kate moss like model, people will ask you to do drastic things;
like losing wieght, getting lip suction and others..

its also a harsh job in the modelling world, so be warned, it can be a tough place out here.

Hair straight looks better.

But if you want a professional opinion, create a photo portfolio (have your friend take the pictures so your shots look better, also a good camera helps)

Then send your portfolio to various modelling agencies, they'll tell you if you're up to their standards.

a package of  KNOX unflavored gelatin in a glass of water once a week. avoid painting your nails,  nails are hard skin cells, skin cells have to breathe, when you clog the airways of the skin it gets weak, just like make up, if you are one that doesnt wear make up or very light make up,  and one day you put on foundation that you normally wouldn't wear,  how does it make your face feel, like its sealed in rubber or plastic. same goes for salon, acrylic nails, have you seen the damage left behind from those things.  sorry for such and extended example hope some of this is of help, the knox gelatin works even with the smothering polishes. LOL, have a nice day

When I first started working in hospitals over thirty years ago nurses were VERY sexy. Now... not so much.

I don't know what happened except that I got older, they got older, the uniforms were better (for guys) then.



Probably just that I got older.  :-(

Is it worth going all the way into London to work for abercrombie?



I have an interview with abercrombie, London to work as a 'model' meaning just a sales assistant I guess. I live in London but it would take me about 1 hour and a half to get into abercrombie.. is it worth working there? What are the hours like part-time weekend? What is the pay like?

omg, NO, it's not
abercrombie is such a cheap brand, and it's so overused and EVERYONE wears it, it's so boring & old now. not to mention that all their clothes always look the same all season.
i use to wear that stuff for 4 years, and it got boring, and i was even going to start working at hollister.

the pay is minimum wage, and the hours suck. most times you have to call in and ask. they over hire, and they fire alot for fresh new faces. they discriminate against workers, even though they don't want to admit it, they hire pretty, skinny people. it isn't worth working there. if you have a brain & talent, work somewhere else!

the pay is minimum wage, and the hours are very little, in here U.S they only give 15 hrs a week for part time, so it won't really help you to save up some money if you have to travel that far and then also pay for lunch, all your money will be spent right away for lunch and transportation, so not worth it in my opinion, the only good thing is that you get employee discount tho

<question>



IS 24 too old to start modelling?



I am 24, in great shape, I am 5'8 and recently modelled for a gorgeous clothing boutique. The pictures were so good that the woman wants to book me again ASAP and also she has had about 20 years in designing clothes and she says I am one of the most photogenic people she has ever met! I am truly excited now. She told me that I need to apply at some modelling agencies.
I have heard though that 24 is "past it". Is this true?
Sad that I have to ask this question I know!
But all help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

It depends on what sort of modeling.

For glamour models their courier is almost over by that age.(silly i know)Unless they are lucky.

I don't think that 24 is too old to start modeling.
You might have to look around a bit for an agency, but if you truly love modeling then I don't think that anyone can tell you that you're too old.

It depends if you have lost considerable, if not dangerous amounts, it may be out of concern for your health that she is doing this.
However, if that is not the case it may be that she just enjoys sweets and other things and as a friend she might want you to join her.

Hey Tilly, I answered your question about the dress about 10 mins ago.  New Look and Bay Trading have some lovely little small cardigan's in and they won't blow the budget.  Good choice too, turqoise will bring out the little flowers on the skirt!

PS:  I like the dress so much I may buy it myself.

If your on a low budget, i'd say try Primark, Next or Vero Moda- they've got pretty good quality cardigans at cheap prices. But if you want a long-lasting item, check out Gap, Mango Urban Outfitters, etc.

Fake tan only works at first attempt...?



I have applied many a fake tan to my face and for the first few times it works brilliantly...I look so bronzed. After that tho it gradually does nothing and while I never return to being pale I never reach a great level of tan.

Is it to do with moisture in my face?

You could try a different type you can get mousse one's and wipes too. It could be because your skin has got used to it i dont think its anything to do with the moisture in your face maybe try get a darker one. Or put abit more on a couple of hours later xx

Yes I believe so... I use fake tanning lotions and stuff all the time and sometimes I just don't get tan at all, and other I turn bright orange. I've figured that what best works is to first take a warm shower, then tap my face (or legs) dry and apply the bronzer 15 minutes before going to bed. The next day you'll definitely see changes, and the tan will last longer (for me at least). maybe because when you sleep your skin is less stressed and is most likely going to absorb anything you apply to it then. 
Anyway, hope this helps!

I'm a girl and I personally like nose rings on guys. But you have to have the right style to pull it off. Like a few days ago I saw this REALLY attractive guy (probably in his early 20s) with a labret and a nostril ring. He has a kind of punk/hippie/laid back look and the sweetest smile. I think you kind of a need to be comfortable in your masculinity to pull it off.

Exfoliator and moisturiser are essential- love Soap and Glory products :)
Intensive conditioner on hair at least once a week. (keeps it in tiptop condition)
Self heating Clay face masks (they feel amazing and do wonders for your skin), you can get them for 99p in Boots
Mascara- the most amazing beauty product ever created- particularly Dior Show
Lipgloss- love it, especially Dior. Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent ones
Fake tan (a good one, to accentuate my tan- one thats not cheap and nasty)
Burts Beeswax lipbalm, makes your lips all tingly :)

I don't use anything on my face ever. I don't believe anything anyone says about peels and masks and stuff. I wash it with water three times a day and put sunscreen on when going outside. I also use Dove Cucumber Green Tea moisturizer before I shave my legs and it works great!
Also I use a chapstick with SPF 20.
Dancing makes me feel great too, it really helps me stay toned.

I feel better when I straighten my hair. Also, I use black eyeliner and volumizing mascara because I want to make my eyes stand out better. I wash my face every night with an exfoliating scrub that really keeps my face clean and clear. Tweezing eyebrows is something that every girl should do... oddly enough, eyebrows can really make a person look beautiful or terrible. So keeping them nicely shaped really does make a difference.

Always exfoliate and moisturise. Then wear sexy underwear no matter what you wear on top. If you feel sexy from inside you'll look sexy outside. Control tights or pants I have to admit. Im not that big but my tummy is flabby and need tucking in. I don't use much make up on my face, but I take great pride in how I do my eyes.

Okay so this guy he isnt neccesarily my boyfriend because we live over 200 miles away from each other but we met at this camp thingy, fell in love and he told me he cant spend another day away from me even though its been a week since we left the camp and he is coming to my hometown to see me anyway...I invited him to stay at my house and my mom being the strict german she is only let him sleep in my bed in my bedroom and I have to sleep on the floor in my sisters bedroom! to be honest my bedroom is a dump and its so plain...what can I do that would impress him or a question to guys when you see a girls bedroom what impresses you? I have a double bed and its more of a rectangle room then square! and also he is a bit punk rockerish and emo but not too much so what can I put in the room and decorate it so he would feel cosy and be impressed?

just make sure its clean, if a person is going to be attracted to you, it doesnt matter what you do/dont have in your room.  to come from 200 miles away, this boy must truly like you for what YOU are, it is to be near you that will make him feel just fine. a girl once told me, it didnt matter if we were just sitting in a field together, what mattered to her is that she was close to me.

Don't wear pants!  You don't get many chances to really get dressed up so take advantage of it.  Don't wear white or black.  Get a cute cocktail dress.  Oh and remember you shouldn't look better than the bride!  Its her day...

Where do you live, the UK? If so try Monsoon, they do really nice dresses, can be quite pricey, but alot of them are lovely. Go with colours that suit you, I would generally steer clear of black though, its not particularly wedding colours really, but then I suppose it depends on what you accessorize it with. Also Oasis or Warehouse do some lovely dresses. I'd definitely go with nice summery colours though, seen as its the summer, well unless your in Oz or a few other places.

In my job as an events organiser i have seen many wedding and i must say i have seen some desgusting outfits,most of them people wearing black trousers. You should go for a dress, most shops have a sale on at the moment go look around, try pink or blue, its a chance to get dressed up so take it!

Be in the front, they'll notice you if you scream loud and say sexual remarks. The Fillmores actually quite small after all it's just a theatre not an arena so there won't be thousands of people, just a few hundred.

Are my teeth that bad?What can I do to fix them(no braces please)?



I have yellow teeth and some on the front look big and on the bottom they're small and some are very yellow,others are white-yellow,I also have a slightly crooked tooth.And the top part is not straight with the bottom part it's much more advanced.I've always known I don't have perfect teeth but never really worried about them as everyone seems to tell me "you have a gorgeous smile".Now so much people say that teeth are important in general looks and can ruin your whole face,and my best friend is making fun of my smile and copies it and says you always smile like this haha,it's making me self-conscious and I'm scared to smile again,even though my smile was my favorite feature,people always told me how beautiful it was...Now some guy told me "did u know that colgate existed?"after I smiled...I do brush them twice daily obviously...http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c12/fa...

you have a BEAUTIFUL natural smile, and that guy was acting like a jerk on purpose to make you feel bad. Seriously. If you don't acid strip your teeth, they're going to be natural color, which won't be pure white. I also don't whiten my teeth, and sometimes people ask me what brand of cigarettes I smoke...  but I don't smoke. never have.



(I did drink a lot of coke as a little kid, though. I try to stay away from it now.)

Anyway, be grateful that you have such a beautiful smile! From your description, I was expecting a typical british smile, but no.



also, you can always tell if someone had braces as a kid. Your teeth are very nicely laid out. Gratz.

Several points and I talk from experience. If you feel self concious then do something about it. Also your smile is very important to your confidence and if your "friend" is being like that then dump her. A true best friend would never be able to see any faults like that!

You do appear to have an overbite but is is not ugly and I would not feel bad about it if I were you. Your teeth are straight and nicely aligned. When I was 28 my wisdom teeth came through and made my already crowed mouth even more crowded. I was self concious and went to see an orthadontist. I wore a brace for 2 years (there was a lot of work to do) and now I have very good teeth. (Now it is possible to get braces that fit to the back of the teeth and are invisible to others. A good orthadontist will give you a new bite and bring your lower teeth out)

I found that using the new sonic toothbrushes (Braun) made a big difference and made my teeth whiter. I would reccomend it to everyone.

You can't make them grow back faster - take a slanted eyeshadow brush and dip it in an eyeshadow color that matches your brows and extend and thicken your brows with it - it will make them look denser and/or longer - I do this when I over-tweeze.  Good Luck and don't worry - they grow back very fast!

as for growing back
all you can do is wait

but color in your eyebrows
what i do sometimes, is i get a clean mascara brush
and get a pencil eyeliner and kind of lightly color in the mascara brush with the pencil eyeliner
(just rubbed the pencil eyeliner all over the mascara brush)
then i use the mascara brush and style and brush it on my eyebrows

kind of swipe it through

theres not really much you can do until they grow back

Hmm well what i recommend is get an eyebrow pencil and shade them in a little heavier and don't pluck for awhile so you give them time to grow in.. Also if they are really that bad , cut yourself some bangs so you won't be able to tell!

Eyebrow powder,
you go and get the powder,
not the pencil,
yeah i know it's temporary but it makes them look real.
you apply it with an angle brush.
I don't know anything that make them grow faster..

get BrowFantasy by Revlon, this is a eyebrow pencil that you can just fill your brows in or make them darker, then the other end has a gel to keep the nice and tidy. other than that you will just have to wait until they grow back and learn from your mistakes.

You can try using an eyebrow pencil to gently draw in your eyebrows/even them up, but use short and light strokes of pencil to avoid unnatural look.
Also, have your fringe fall over your eyebrows to disguise it more until they grow back.

Okay well you should  not of shaven your eyebrows they will just come back thicker and darker and possably ingrowing ones may appear. 
Untill you can pluck them again just draw them on with eyeliner and brow pencils that you can buy from cosmetic shops, just untill they grow back then when they have you can pluck them normally.

If your strungling any more go to your closest beauty shop for some advance im sure they will be happy to help you out.

I am an expert with eyebrows and took the smart move of never touching mine. In this case you have kind of placed yourself some where that you really cannot do anything.. Shaving hair such as your arms or eyebrows is a bad move. It will probably grow  back thicker, unfortunately. Try going to a salon to get it waxed, that should do the trick to fix it for now. 
NEVER DO IT YOURSELF AGAIN, IT'S WORTH THE MONEY.

1. Don't use mascara unless you need to, and always take it off at night.
2. Try to use a non-waterproof, unless you have very oily skin.
3. At night, put vasaline or castor oil on your eyelashes. Just a little does the trick. It will condition them and stop them from falling out, so they can grow longer and thicker and healthier.

Hope I helped!!!

oh yeah, and also remember to curl your eyelashes before and NOT AFTER applying mascara, or else they could break.
I'd reccomend any mascara by neutrogena. They have one made from olives that works well and is also really good for your eyelashes, lol.

I too have average length eye-lashes and what  I do to give the illusion of full, elegant lashes is:
1) Apply clear mascara first.(at least 2 strokes) Cover Girl Clear Mascara or Maybelline Great Lash Clear Mascara works nicely.

2) Then apply the darkest mascara you can find.( I personally find L'Oreal's Telescopic Mascara in Blackest Black outstanding. It's lightweight, non-clumpy and elongates the lashes.

3) After letting the mascara set and dry, you can always use a lash comb to remove any excess residue and Bam!  Hope I've helped.

I read Teen-Vogue magazine.. I'm not that girly myself.. but I dress smart, you don't need to dress girly to like girly things, but don't dress all scabby.. just wear something nice, like, your favourite colour top, with jeans or a nice knee length skirt..

Start off with a simple check list as follows;
Step1: Go on a girly shopping spree to your local shopping mall
Step2:Wear a lot of pink especially if your known for being a tomboy
Step3:Go to the cinema and watch a film all the girls are going mad about e.g Angus thongs and perfect snogging or Wild Child
Step4:Wear skirts a lot try to keep them short and show off those legs you've been hiding 
Step5:Flirt a lot around where you hang out if possible find the boy right for you
Step6:Search through your parents draw and slap bam on the fake tan
Step7:Wear a lot of make-up but not OTT
Step8:Get yourself a fashion idol e.g Colleen Rooney or Cheryl Cole
Step9:Last but not least go to your local newsagents and pick yourself up a couple of mags e.g Heat, Bliss, Sugar, Mizz, Now, O.K, Closer that sort of thing

ino this sounds wierd but it does work x



put a bit of vinegar on a nail polish remover pad, or just put some on a bit of cotton wool, & dab it on.



or, for a less smelly option =) use peanut butter. rub it on, leave it for a few minutes, then wash it off.



hope this helped :)

It doesn't make you look fat but I don't like the dress, it washes you out and makes you look pale. That dress in a hot pink would be better for your skin tone.

No it doesn't but I can see where you think it might. 
The full skirt part of the dress is too high. If it were to your hips, it would elongate your torso for a slimming effect.

It is not a flattering dress.  You have a nice slim figure.  Don't hid it in a potato sack.  But don't go all skank.  Color is great on you, just wrong dress.

It doesn't show off your waist line, that's for sure. I think it does make you look fatter. Get a dress that clings to your waist without a sash going around it.

I wanna dress pretty sometimes, but every time I try, I almost always get frustrated. If you would see how I dressed you would think I never put any effort! LOL But on the serious side, I dont know how to be sexy. I gained a few pounds (more like 50) over the last 4 years, and I dont feel hot anymore! Any tips, oh yeah how the heck do I put on eyeshadow? Everytime I try I look like a complete clown. Oh yeah can I have the rules about matching, what goes together and what doesn't? Thanks, I really do need help.

lol, dude, I gained 40lbs in the last three years, but I'm still sexy as hell and I know it. There are plenty of men who love a nice, thick woman, so don't stress that. Everyone has their preferences. Like Sophia Loren said, "Sexy is 50% what you've got naturally, and 50% what people think you've got."..In other words?It's not just a look, it's an attitude. If you're confident in your own skin, then you will ooze sexiness and people will notice.

Being sexy isn't just about how you dress.  The most confident women are confident and it shows in how they carry themselves.  It comes more from the inside than what is on the outside

I have to disagree with the other answers.  Other glues not made specially for eyelashes can be dangerous.  You may not have a reaction, but they can be extremely harmful to your eyes over time and cause damage directly to your eye.  It is not worth the price of harming your eyesight to put on false eyelashes.  In the future, make sure you have an extra glue onhand just in case you loss one.  Go without the lashes until you get the proper glue for them.  Better to be safe and have your sight, then to be sorry and suffer later.

I seriously think it shouldn't matter. Just because some celebrity does it doesn't mean you should. Do what you are comfortable with. Most of them go to the salon and get waxed, you see pictures of them heading in/out in the tabloids.

personally I prefer girls who have jet BLACK or red hair .a slight tan is good .I also like piercings especially tongue ,nose, nipple and bellow button.as far as clothing doesn't much matter as long as they have a look a bit slutty without being slutty.I like the bad girl look and clothes.mini skirts ,half tops. clothes that show off there bodies without being indecent.IF they have a small mouth and full lips that's a plus.I like very sexual sensual girls who know what they want and how to get it.

Help with nail polish ?



Hi,

Is there actually a nail polish that suits you? I wear usually red or purple (and sometimes pink!), but I wanna know if there is actually a suited varnish for me? Or am I just being stupid???

I am blonde with blue eyes, fair skin.

um, sometimes.  I had an issue as a child and I pulled all my eyelashes and eyebrows out - some sort of nervous tick.  They grew back, but they're not like they used to be.  Every once and a while, I'll get some that pop out in random ways all over the place and some spots where I don't get any at all.

That was really not a smart thing.

The school sent my boyfriend's dad a letter of absences? (we were both skipping!) help!?



okay so me and my boyfriend skipped school two times
and the absence letter says four, which is not true of course

and tomorrow his dad is going to the main person to talk to about the absences
what could my boyfriend tell or do so he doesnt get caught?

please dont say " o well you shouldnt of done it" thats not the question, i need to know the ANSWER not what your opinion is

thank you

an easier way to put it is, what would you do?

if his dad finds out i will never see him again
we are seniors and have been together for 4 years

First of all remember that confidence makes a girl sexy!
and if you're comfortable, you're confident so be happy with how you put yourself out, don't be fake.
If you have long hair make loose curls, and a wavy side fringe or something.. and wear eyeliner and dark lipstick to look older:)
Be stylish with what you wear... that's what magazines are for:)

You sound great, but tips are what you're asking for so tips I shall give! I know EXACTLY what you mean about looking young. I am 20 yrs, and nobody believes it when I first meet them. Oh, and with no make-up on, forget it! I look about 15 without it! But, you will love that you look young once you hit 30! Try wearing some powder that matches your tone (I personally don't like foundation), some blush, a little bit of eyeliner on your bottom lash, a soft lilac eyeshadow (looks great on people w/ brown eyes), and some volume mascara. Something as little as getting your eyebrows waxed can make a huge difference on your face! Try places like Love Culture and Forever 21 for clothing for a fair price. Good luck! xoxo

use eye liner around the eyes but not too much. practice for a light look that is natural yet makes the eyes appear larger. Kohl pencils are good but careful not to apply too much. It can be repaired with a cotton bud. At night use the thickening mascara for extra affect. There are lots of makeups that make the skin appear a more even colour and give it a velvety texture. Makeup sales have experimental products that you can try. Nothing too heavy or it will feel uncomfortable and look fake. Lip liner helps to outline the lips and apply a little lipstick inside the line. If too heavy can be blotted out a little with tissues. Applying makeup does take practice but it is well worth the extra trouble to obtain a glowing healthy natural look without skin imperfections and colour variations that sometimes appear (nose too red etc) 
With clothes go for the tailored clean look as you are short---- nothing frilly or too busy. You don't need a lot as better to have a smaller range but of good quality.

First of all if you want to look more your age, why not opt for a hairstyle around shoulder length.You can look at hairstyle books and choose the one you like that will accent your face shape.Make sure you shape your eyebrows.Go light on the makeup.If you dont know what's quite right for you remember you can type questions on the internet and match your body type with what's best for your body.When a person is short solid colors and same patterns are better as it doesnt "cut' the waistline making you appear shorter.Also, up and down stripes are best.stripes accross make you look shorter.You can usually get advice at clothing stores,by finding someone who is willing to help.I hope this helps.

Why would you want to do that? There is no way to do it with out surgery.  You should be happy to look the way you are. You features are of you ancestry and you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to change them to look anything other than what you are.

<answer>



It's normal to want some changes on your physical appearance. I mean, when a white person has surgery to get rid of some of that nose bridge, nobody is telling her to "remember her ancestry" huh?

My advice to you is to take the first step: really examine the reasons WHY you want your nose higher. Don't just say "cos I don't like it"...You'll be surprised how many reasons there are, and if you can tackle the root cause of your insecurity, you may realize you don't need painful and risky plastic surgery at all.

Now if you're adamant about it and 100% sure you want something done, you can try those silicone injections (I'm not sure how you call it). You can search "nosejob without surgery" in youtube or Google and you should find some info on nosejobs that don't require surgery. Basically a doc can inject a substance in your nose (after numbing it of course) and "mold" a bridge for you using his fingers. This is a fairly new technique, less invasive, worth looking into if it's your first time and do not want to have actual surgery.

***

I should add, that new method may not give you obvious results. It may not be able to "raise" your nose bridge considerably..it's there to shape your nose and create an illusion of height or narrowness, not actually add height. Also, this is not permanent, it could last from a few months to couple years. Pls talk carefully with your surgeon abt this.

all the best.

I love a guy that can have a joke, makes you laugh, and won't take what you say too seriously.

A sweet smile does it for me , and a sweet personality too.

Also a guy that will happily spend time with you instead of his mates all the time, and most importantly not ashamed to say your his girlfriend.

Hope i helped :)

You asked for opinions from girls and I'm not one of that tribe so you don't need to consider mine. (Opinion, that is).  #1 clothes
#2 jewelry
#3 makeup  & 
#4 savings account, to get started early on one.  By the way things are going world wide (USA, United Kingdom, Europe, etc) you may need savings in the future.  Take care, now and happy trails.

Ok, instead of spending it in bits and bobs, why not treat yourself to a nice designer coat/jacket for winter ? Or maybe a really hot dress ?? Think about it, it's your chance to have a really cool piece of designer gear that will knock everyone off !!!
Invest on it and it will pay for itself.
I recently bought a gorgeous vivienne westwood trench coat and i LOVE IT !!!

Put £200 in a decent interest savings account (ING pays 6%) and spend the £50.

You want the "spend" buzz but you will get it just as good from a £50 spend as a £250 spend, but you will still have £200 for the future!.

Heyy I was at a party the other night and there was lots of drink there ( i know, i'm underage blah blah ) but the parents allowed it!! 
Anyway, I had a bit too much to drink and got a bit emotional, and this boy I like came over, and he was trying to comfort me and he started rubbing my leg and thigh and moving my hair off my face

Then my friends came and he left....
So what do you think? Was he just being nice? Or do you think he likes me? Thankss!

Yes, and the color of lipstick looks childish, rather than sophisticated. Try something more subtle, and try a more natural tone of eyeshadow, that also looks childish.

Yes, you are very pretty and should wear less! I would recommend a lighter shade of lipstick/lipgloss and lighter eye shadow.

Whats wrong with dark skinned girls?



why is that light skinned females are seen as BEAUTIFUL and dark skinned girls are seen as UGLY?
im dark skinned and im finding it difficult to see what beauty is which is really bad. because all other friends are "brown" or a fair complexion of black / mixed / white etc. don't boys, men find dark skinned girls attractive? or is it only a teenage problem?

Honey, dark skinned girls are beautiful. Infact some are models for example Niaomi Campbell. Girl, dont let nobody tell you ANYTHING about being attractive. I'm not dark skinned so i cant compare to you but girl dark skinned people are BEAUTIFUL and all of them men who aren't intrested have their own insecurities. Just because your not the stereotypical blonde hair, blue eyes, it doesnt mean you arent beautiful. You wear your dark skin with pride and confidence! & SNAP girrl, unh-huh.

I think all skin tones are beautiful in their own way. dark skinned girls look hot and exotic, paler girls look more fragile and elegant. you know what I mean? I use to hate having light skin but I've found the beauty in it and you should do the same. I'm sure you're gorgeous!

I don't think dark skinned people are ugly at all! We're all equal, so don't listen to what every other racist person has to say out there.. In my opinion, most dark skinned people are good-looking, and quite a lot of light skinned people are good-looking too..

be proud of your dark skin!!! why do you think all these white girls pay hundreds of dollars to get fake spray on tans??? bc they are jealous of dark skinned girls like us.  they wish they had our gorgeous skin, so they spray on orange paint to try to look like us.  trust me, they do not like being pasty

I don't see light skinned girls necessarily beautiful , though some of course are.

And I don't see dark skinned girls as ugly some are beautiful others are not so.

Skin tone doesn't make you beautiful or ugly..

Some dark skinned girls are incredibly beautiful! And light skiined! So don't worry  !

Pale skin is generally more attractive...sorry..but most of the faces of make up being advertised such as rimmel and maybelline are pale skinned.

Pale is the way forward and i love my pale complexion so i'm not gonna agree with you and say dark skin is better than pale because in my opinion i prefer pale skin and i'm glad i have it..
Dark skin isn't seen as ugly, it depends on the person and how prominent their features are.  Pale skinned girls tend to have more delicate features and therefore can appear mroe pretty...
But just love yourself for who you are.. if i was born dark skinned i would just make the most of it, i mean you're wayyyy less likely to get skin cancer or anything and i'm sure you are very pretty!. :)

there is nothin wrong wit darked skinned girls they are just as important as any other girl. no one has the right to discriminate against dark skinned girls. dark girls probably have a better personality, and thats wut guys should be focused on not how light or dark you are. just find someone who accepts u for who u are and youll be just fine dont let light girls put u down or discourage u KEEP YUH HEAD  UP HIGH. im light skinned but i feel just like any other person

You look like an English Rose with the curly hair, but too much make up.  Your eyes are beautiful, you don't NEED the eyeliner, k?
The last pic (straight hair) is my favorite.  You look beautiful, natural...but rethink the pink lipstick...go for something glossy without color.
You look like a beautiful 16 year old girl.

I mean I can understand like changing your hair cut, because then at least you don't look the same old boring person, but people then are like trying to loose a bundle of weight, getting their nails done, changing all their make-up, their style. In the end they look totally different, but only actually keep it up for a week.

How can I make myself hotter?



Okay I'm trying to make myself, ideal, for my boyfriend. So I need honest opinions from you guys. Be as critical as you like, and don't worry about hurting my feelings. I wont get offended by anything you say, I just want to know what I can do to make myself attractive.



Here are my pictures....

<additional details>



Yeah, but my guy checks out tonnes of girls every single time we're out in public....not to mention, he's constantly chatting up girls, flirting with them, making sexual innuendos, goes through girls on myspace to see whose hot, is addicted to porn, has more pictures of hot celebrities/famous porn stars on his computer than of me....

And I have done literally almost everything I can think of...I mean, I have more lingerie and sex costumes than a freaking store does....

So obviously there's something wrong with me here!?

You're already attractive and your boyfriend wouldn't be with you if he didn't think so because males are visual 'creatures'. 
Plus the pictures aren't really good quality.

You're okay looking.  You should go see a therapist to discuss making yourself look ideal for someone.  It means that you have low self-esteem.  That said, a different haircut, better makeup, sexier clothes and losing a little weight will do the trick.  But you're fine.

definitely smile more...
you look as if you both have a rock sense of style (which is totally awesome, i wouldn't change the style that you prefer!).. I would a few new sets of lingerie..

Look through a magazine of your fav celebs and pic out a new hairstyle that you like and go to a salon and go for it!

Go to the mall and get a few make up tips from a make up counter...

Not saying that you should do these things (Because i think you are already hott!) but if you are determined to change things up i would go for it!

AND you need not worry about loosing weight! Your size is JUST FINE... you would be too skinny

The only thing wrong with you is that you are making an effort for a guy who is clearly not worthy of you and he has the problem. He sounds like an immature f**kwit and the way he acts is a blatant disrespect for you and your feelings. The fact that you want to please him as opposed to dump him for his poor BF behaviour is sad and pathetic. A perfectly beautiful girl like you can do much better and I suggest you do. The problem is not with you it is with him and he needs a reality check. If you continue to date him and this is a taste of his disrespect you can expect that sooner or later he will move onto another girl who like you will be stupid enough to let him get away with this. Dump the loser and find a guy who wants to look at only you. Any one else is not good enough for you.

I use solid perfume for touch ups of my spray versions. i think they're mostly for convenience and layering with other scents.

apply it to your pulse points such as wrists, elbows, behind ears, throat etc and it might last a little longer. apply it to the back of your neck if you're wearing your hair down, the scent will transfer to your hair slightly too.
if you have dry skin, put vaseline or baby lotion on your skin before you put on perfume, it will help the perfume stick on your skin.



dont overdo the scent though! you dont want to drown in it! :)

It's pretty hard to get into modeling. Even if you are 5'11", it's quite hard to find a place in the modeling business. With your height, it would be much, much harder to find someone to look at you, especially at your age.

Fashion models are super tall. I think you can do some other kind of modelling, but not fashion.  Normally I think they are around 5'11, but definately nothing under 5ft. I wanted to model too but I'm 5'3 and I can't get in.
Have you considered doing acting insetad?

Do I come off as trashy? Why aren't guys interested?



ok so I no this is really shallow but I'm seriously wondering. I've never had a boyfriend and I don't think there is anything terribly wrong with the way I look, but based on this discription what your thoughts? I'm 16  I. Have blonde hair and blue eyes I'm 5'10 weigh 150, I'm like size 7. I have size 36dd boobs but there not gross or anything. I have clear skin normal bone structer, I go to a really small private catholic school, so most of the people in my class have known me since kindergarten. My question is why don't people find me attractive is there something wrong?

damn you're only 16 so relax first of all.  a lot of people at 16 haven't had gf's or bf's, i didn't till i was 17.  noone on here can tell you you're attractive based on a written description, btw.  anyways, you go to this small school where everyone knows each other.  when you go to a bigger school, in college or whenever, things will be very different.  you'll find a boyfriend and meet new people, and you'll be more grown up and ready to actually have a bf.  for now you really shouldn't worry about it.  things will happen in time, and worrying is very pointless.  i'm sure you're a nice looking young girl and i promise you things will be fine.
also, i gotta say...double d's at 16 eh?  damn

well i think that maybe guys are not interested because they know you for so long, I mean kindergarden c'mon! They probraly feel like your family by now.. I think you should meet your guy friends friend or go somewhere else to meet people. Like the mall, birthday partys and thats basically it but wait til ur 18. Then thats gonna change trust me! good luck!

There's nothing wrong w/ the way you look from your description. don't listen to the people sayin 5'10 is "gross" or whatever, in fact, to be a runway model you must be 5'8 or taller, so being tall is actually "beautiful."  Anyyyway.. again 16 is young. I think the main thing is about personality.  Maybe check your attitude and make sure you are sweet and personable if you worry about maybe coming off as trashy.  Or another thing could be the way you dress.  If you show a lot of cleavage or skin people may call you trashy.  Just try to dress your age and keep your chin up, the right guy will come.

How to do a bestie makeover?



i have a good m8 whose a dude.  I think he would be really hot if he got a makeover. hes got a good body even tho he doesnt work out and stuff, and nice shirts look really good on him. me and my other bestie have dragged him to malls b4 and forced him to try out stuff but he just wont buy them or let me. how do I get him to go along with a makeover?



I"m not trying to do anything tooo drastic, just a new haircut and some nice comfy shirts and pants that are well cut instead of the huge oversized trackkies and things he wears.



i also know i sound interfering, but hes trying to get a job and stuff too. ( hes one of those super clever intelligent scientist nerds who used to live in labs while they were doing their pHDs and now needs to face the world)

You look really young so it's hard/weird to say how attractive you are 1-10.. but. I think if you want to look pretty you need to dye your hair, the blonde chunky streaks are not workin at all. Go to the salon and have them dye it brown or light brown with natural looking highlights and dimension.  Also wear eyeliner and mascara it will make a difference.

I agree. It does smell delicious and I, too have naturally curly/wavy hair. It didn't make an impressive difference but I think it calmed the frizz down a notch and was better than the Palmolive stuff I used to use.

The perfect person is not a person that everyone agrees on. It is the person that is right for YOU. You probably have little idiosyncracies that may drive some people mad. Your true mate might have some too. The question is: do you see each other as perfect? If you do, you have found the perfect person!

What should I wear to a wedding?



My boyfriend's friend is having a wedding on October 24th, and I was invited also. I have never really been to many weddings, only family, and I was able to ask them how to dress. But I don't really see my boyfriends friend and I have only met them a few times. The invitation is quite fancy (white with gold raised fancy writing, and a meal card and rsvp.) The wedding is in a church I think and the reception hall is large and beautiful (a real hall, not like a fire hall or anything). I am very unsure of what to wear. Please help! Thank you!!

Well if the invitation says formal or black tie, you'll need a floor length dress.



If it says semi-formal you should wear a cocktail dress.



If it doesn't say anything, go off of the time of the wedding. If it's a day wedding, a day dress would be fine. If it's in the evening, go with a cocktail dress or a top/skirt that looks like evening wear.

Just pick a classic dress that is pretty neutral. Nothing in the colors of the wedding and def. not white or creamy. You can also wear a pant-suit that looks nice (not Clintonish) with a pretty top. But personally, I would go with a very nice looking dress that is quite long. Silver is also a good color or shades of brown. Compliment your boyfriend's outfit. Go with the same color scheme to coordinate as well. But go with a classic longer cut. Just a long as you nice and classy then you'll blend right in. Have fun!!!!

Dirty lil secrets from the Pro's....?



Why is it that everytime I see either a makeup pro, or one who's going to school, or the chick behind the counter; they all seem to have perfect looking/flawess faces?! What do I need to do to get the same look?  One girl behind a makeup counter told me that their supposed to tell ppl that their using the line that their trying to sell, and in the same sentence, she whispered to me that she had on a different completely different makeup line, and pointed me in the direction to the tinted gloss she was wearing....
My Birthday was on Tuesday and a friend wants to take me to buy me a gift.  I was thinking of getting a new foundation but am not sure which line I should go with....I'm looking for some suggestions and am interested in a product review. I'm 25 and have light/comb skin and live in South TX where it's usually hot and humid.



Any advice would be helpful!

Acrylics are ok but they make a mess of your natural nail as they're stuck on with super glue.



Gels on the other hand (no pun intended) let your nail breathe underneath, are very hardwearing, don't chip or crack like nail polish, and last for weeks. Try CalGel at a salon.

they are both good, but if you do a lot of cleaning or your hands are in water alot, I would suggest you get acrylic.
I have had both, and I am a hairdresser, the gel peeled off from my hands constantly in the water, but the acrylic is more damaging to your nail bed, as they file away the top layer..
Good luck

you are definitely pretty, and, you'll be even more attractive once the braces are off.



some advice: in some of the pictures, it looks like you are fake smiling. in the future, try to think of something funny when a picture is being taken of you, or just practice until you get your smile to look genuine. it took me SO long to learn how to smile, haha.

you look plain  ... why do plain girls ask this so much
you have no poise



all your pics look the same
your face is the same in each pic
no fashion no flare ..nothing
just the girl next door



do you even know about the modeling industry?
do you know  that you need a modeling agent to represent you get you gigs etc. al
most ppl dont know crap
i took classes on stuff you need.
its not just like "hey look at me i want to be a model"
and they hand you it
and are you prepaired to get denied and criticized over and over again and turned down? you think you can handle all it
its not a assuring career because they dont choose everyone
or every girl that said "i want to be a model" would be one now wouldnt the?



also if you dont like what i have to say
the saying goes your critics are your best friends
listen to them... to improve yourself ..
i didnt say anything to be mean
its just the truth
and if you cant handle it
then dont ask

You are pretty. But I agree with others who say that you need to have a  bit of variation in the looks. Most of your photos look the same.



I think you should try. But it isn't easy. As it was mentioned earlier, you have to take a lot of criticism. That isn't easy. I don't know if you are strong enough. A good test would be to judge your own reaction to the first message :) If you get upset after reading it, you need to toughen yourself up mentally before even thinking of getting into modeling.



I wish you the best for your future.

Right... here is my thoughts,



You are pretty but what i think lets you down is your hair and fringe. I think you should get more of a side parting and put a sharp side fringe in it and get more layers and maybe some lighter Highlights in your hair =)

wow i feel like i know you i've answered your questions so many times. i really don't like the first and second pic, but i love the look you have in the third pic. maybe a little make-up is all i can see you need to do to improve. i like your hair the way it looks in that last pic. so much better than in the first 2. you're gonna get all kinds of responses because everybody sees things differently, but i truly believe your naturally pretty. The main thing you need to work on is your self esteem.

pretty sure ive seen these pictures before, but regardless.
i would say get a heavier side fringe, it would help frame your face and reduce your forehead, as it's high at the moment.
reduce your amount of eyeliner that you wear and go for a beachy make up look (very natural), using a little foundation in your skin tone to get rid of redness and some mascara to make lashes extra long.

You want to make sure your nails are smooth, clean and dry before you paint them.  So try lightly buffing your nails before you paint them.  Use thin coats.  The thicker it is the faster it will chip.  And if you are going to wash dishes you need to wear gloves.  Only use one coat of top coat then like every other day you can apply a new layer for about a week.



There are also products that say they prevent chipping. I know OPI has one.  IDK how well it works though.

Important Note About Exfoliating



While exfoliating can be an excellent addition to your beauty regimen, there are also times you shouldn't exfoliate. For example, if you have an undiagnosed skin rash or condition, please check with your doctor for diagnosis and treatment, since exfoliation can actually aggravate some skin conditions. Additionally,



you should not exfoliate:



skin with cuts



broken skin



sunburned skin

YESSS it is slutty. i have always hated that label. it exposes too much of your body and its "streetwear" (meaning its ghetto). i dont know why it makes you feel good about yourself, because i would be embarassed to dress in their clothing. "ghetto-ho" has something to do with the fact that you said you like to dress 'sexy'. thats another word for scantily clad. you should respect your body and force guys to judge you for your brain and personality rather than looking at you like a raw piece of meat.

its pretty gross!
i know fashion and that isn't it.
baby phat is like playboy in the way that they are both showy and poor quality. it is what i call ghetto fabulous as it is a cheap way to try and look classy though end up looking worse of then they started. irony really.



please don't thumbs down me for the truth and sorry if i offended anyone.
bye.=]

You're body is awesome, your face is flawless, and your hair is perfectly flirty casual!



When you're in your 30's, your body isn't as perky and your face is showing little lines, you're gonna look back at this, and think you were crazy to not see how amazing you look!

Your are very attractive to say the least, Italian, between 13 and 15 years old, a 7 in my book, the other 3 points are not for free, those can only be had once personality is established. But as far as looks, i guess your a 10, personal preference, not the age part, but is meaningless without a good head on your shoulders, beauty is only skin deep.

Hey Pal,



Do not ask anyone about what hair style would look good for you.



Style your hair the way you want to, be confident and tell the world that it's YOUR new STYLE!



According to me, style is what you believe in and NOT what others think/say/talk!

Your going to be there for a long time if you just use hot water hun! Do you have acrylic nails on that were applied by a nail techician? Gel nails? Or stick on ones, you did yourself? Ideally you should visit your nail technician to take them off, but I know this isnt always ideal. So get yourself some acetone and soak your tips in there for as long as you need to this can take upto half an hour. Dont try to pull them away from your nail bed as you will take off layers and be left with soft weak nails. You can use and orange stick to scrape off any soft top layer once you have soaked them for a while. It also makes it easier if you flie your nails right down, then there is less to soak off.
Once you are done dont forget to treat your nails to some moisturiser and if you have one a calcium treatment topcoat!



Good Luck it does take some time, but its better than broken nails!

Soak them in Acetone for 10-15 minutes, maybe a little longer, Then nail should soften and you can lift up,or push the softened nail off, with something like a orangewood stick.

Heading into the real world wearing...what?



I am going to be graduating with a degree in psychology this December meaning that I'm going to have to start going to interviews to get a real job. I understand what appropriate work clothes are but what should I be wearing keeping in mind that I need to make people feel comfortable talking to me. I don't want to be overdressed but if I'm under-dressed then I won't be seen as a professional. What do you think? What would you like to see a counselor wear? Any other information like things to avoid, tips, good colors etc. would be very helpful. Thank you!

really nice black trousers. find a pair you love.
a great material. and a cut that flatters your shape. they are a hugggee staple..
you can wear them with more casual but still work suitable knitwear. such as a jumper with a nice neckline/sleeve detail.
nothing low cut or short though :D

People are only as ugly as they allow themselves to be. If you think you are ugly, people around you will only agree. Self-confidence can be one of the most critical traits when judging attractiveness...



So in short, quit being a ***** and letting people call you ugly.

How often should I wash my hair?



I have thick, shoulder length hair. After it's been washed it feels dry, but after about 2 days it gets extremely greasy. I usually wash it whenever it looks oily, so every 2-3 days. Should I be washing it everyday?

I would say.. wash it once a day with moisturizing shampoo and no more than once a day since you stated it feels dry after. And just a little side note.. Always wash your hair after you get out of a chlorinated pool, to keep it healthy and to keep the texture nice.

My hair is the same way and I was it every 2-3 days as well.  The natural oils that your scalp produces is good for your hair; also,  washing it every day tends to dry out thicker hair.

my hair is about the same as you described yours and since i've stopped washing my hair everyday it seems to be a lot healthier to me, i only wash it about every 3 days. it's now less dry, my color dose not fade as quick, i save time on getting ready and because i don't have to straighten it everyday it is now far less damaged than before.

The more you wash your hair the more greasy it gets. Try buying a shampoo designed specifically for greasy hair, and try to wash only once a day.

If your hair is getting greasy afte 2 days, Try washing it every other day...If your hair is getting greasy by the end of the first day you wash it, Wash your hair everyday, and use a Shampoo for Oily hair..ALWAYS condition it though.



Just to make clear:
If you wash your haireveryday, when you have naturally dry hair, You will wash the natural oils out of your hair, which makes your hair dry and frizzy.



If you have naturally oily hair, Shampoo will not strip the oils out of your hair, because your hair produces too much oil for it all to be washed out, and nor will it make your hair more oily.

you should wash it every other day coz doing it everyday could make your hair prone to hair fall. This habit could make your hair healthier. Trust me. My friend recommended this to me and her hair looks like it has been rebonded/hot oiled when it wasn't. Also use cool water instead or hot

when you wash your hair every day, it takes away the natural oils in your hair and it will make your hair dry for a little while, and then your scalp will try to make the oils again, and it will make your hair greasy. what i do is wash it every other day but beware, while you're changing your washing routines your hair will react, and it has to have about a week to get used to it.

Every other day is usually good. Most people honestly don't need to wash their hair every day. People who style their hair with a blow dryer do this, but really most people don't need to

How bad does getting your eyebrow pierced hurt?



I was going to get it done 2 weeks ago. I did not because a family member was in the hospital. I have to wait until I'm 18(2months) I want the barbell not the ring.



1)how much does it hurt?
2)does it get infected really?

I just recently got out of that business so I might know a little about it.



It hurts a little but not as bad as a bee sting, The needles that are used should be sterile piercing needles which are designed for one use only. they are extremely sharp and they are hollow so they make a nice hole very easily.



Your jewelry should be made of solid gold or certified 316 LVM surgical steel or greater. You can usually tell by the price if the metal is good or not but not always, so ask because the biggest cause of infection is cheap jewelry. For an eyebrow ring, or a curve or straight barbell the gage should be 16 which is standard or if you want something big 14  is about as big as you should go for an eyebrow.



Eyebrows aren't usually that dangerous, but tongues and some other body parts have nerves that if you pierce the wrong place can paralyze your face or cause nerve damage! so it is a good idea to have a trained professional do your piercing, if you do it yourself know what you are doing first.



After you get it done it will be sore for about 3 days, it is best to just wash new piercings with soap and warm water 2 or 3 times a day for the first week and turn it when you clean it so it does not stick or form a scab, if the jewelry is high quality the chance of infection is low. some jobe will not let people wear body piercing so you might ask about a plastic retainer that you can wear if you have to take the jewelry out because eyebrow piercings close up much faster than pierced ears, they can close up in as little as a day in some people.



Hope this answers your question correctly!



Good luck!

I cant paint my finger nails cause I chew all my nails off, so any color looks horrible on me. I would suggest for you to paint your nails a pastel color, or something not so bright. Bright colors make your nails, and hands, look a lot larger than they really are. Try a pearly color, kinda off white and with some great shimmer, and the monochrome look (changes colors when you move it in light). Other than that I cant think of anything else. Just be sure to stay away from neon colors!

WTF? why are there increasing questions where people who are quite  pretty put their pics online- not the safest thing to do- and fish for compliments?

You'll need more than a pretty face for that!  But judging just on your face id say give it a go.  Get a Professional photographer to take a couple of good pics of you and then send those to some agencies.  (tip: your best look is slightly from the side, and stop holding the camara above your head and then pouting, you look like a ****).

A. This person is obviously the Plain Jane. Evidences are minimal make up, simple jewelry and such. If you ask me, there is nothing wrong with being plain. No one is plain anyway. "Simplicity is beauty." As long as you're you, the people around you will see through you and know the beauty inside you. Do not discourage yourself. :)



B. Trendy much? These kind of girls are nothing but -sorry for the word- whores. They simply beautify themselves with make-up and pathetic clothes to seek the attention that they have not been blessed with.

Reading your descriptions, I am guessing you think girl A is a "Plain Jane" while girl B is "Trendy."  Girl A sounds like an everyday average girl not plain because we cannot tell her personality by the image description.  The description of girl B sounds like she could be slutty not trendy because of the words "plenty of makeup", "fancy dresses", and "attention grabbing."



You should not label yourself or others, and just improve on yourself to be who you really want to be.  When you become who you want you may feel life is more fulfilling.

No, it doesn't go with your face shape.
You have a little round face, and a full bang would make your face look even smaller!  I don't suggest it, really, but you are a beautiful girl=] Take it from a hair styler...

hahaha! wow. well i can't just make my hair grow, and i'm sorry that you think it's too short? i didn't ask if it was too short though :) i asked what i could do to it.



secondly, i like simple dresses, i don't want to look gaudy.



i asked how i should do my hair, not if you liked my dress or not.



also, the picture is in black in white so you obviously can't tell but i actually am wearing blush, and eyeshadow... and my hair isn't as blonde as it looks in that picture.



i do condition my hair and i do shape my eyebrows



once again, i didn't ask. i asked how i should do my HAIR.

With your type of hair I think that you should lift your tips,curl it or if you can get deep brown highlights.Also some other tips are to use some creme to pump it and blow dry after selected style.Before use a deep conditioner and a light shampoo.Also try another type make-up like blush and do something to give your eyebrows some shape.
Hope I helped!-M*LO23:)

I'd say I'm low maintenance when it comes to looking good.  I splash out on a manicure every few weeks,I  like nice clothes and good shoes, I moisturise every day -  but  I feel it is more important to feel confident in your skin, and from that you look good naturally.



Some women seem to spend hours and hours doing themselves up to look worse, or no different.



Having said all that it is great, and almost necessary for me as a woman, to be complimented.  I don't know why I need this, my logic tells me its not important but my female hormones take over and nearly demand it.

Well, I'm 35 now.  My feelings have changes so much since I was a teen.  When I was a teen, I was obsessed with looking good.  I spent at least an hour and a half getting ready for school in the morning and more if going out.



I was very attractive though.  I'd worry about one little pimple like it was the end of the world.  I had to have all the right clothes.  This continued on into my 20's but now things have changed.  I now worry about "Do I look old?" all the time!  Body wise, I look more like 25 but my skin is starting to make me look older because I spent way too many hours in the sun or in the tanning beds.



I'm not as worried now though about how I look when I go out.

5'7"? If you're going for runway, or any serious fashion modelling, you're much too short. Short models usually begin one or two inches taller than you. Also, you're very plain, and not in a good way.
