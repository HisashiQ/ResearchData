I have a new tank (set up 3 weeks ago) and one of my minnows has died? Help!



He (a white cloud mountain minnow) was fine for a week and the other 4 are fine, he was always a loner and stayed on his own, the other 4 are always together. Maybe he was ill when I got him? After he died he wasn't floating he was laying on the bottom. Any ideas? Think I've done something wrong or bad luck?

I bought 2 Gouramis from my local pets at home. One died in the first 2 days and the other lasted about 3 weeks. the second one lay on the bottom and we asked the guy in pets at home and he said that it probably had an internal problem as there were no visual problems. If you live in the Uk you can get you aquarium water tested for free in pets at home so this would be a good idea as you may have a Chemical imbalance in the water.

He probably was about to die when you got him or it's possible when you set them in there new tank he may have suffered because to adapt to the water temperature you put him and the other in the water in the others in the water in there bag so the temperature can change (leave for an hour) He may have suffered a heart attack if this was why.
So basically you cant just move them from one to the other immediatly because it makes them ill.

Hope this helps

Is my goldfish dying?



He keeps swimming in circles at a sideways angle, over and over again. He looks really off-balance. 
And he looks like he has something stuck in his bum, it's pink and sore looking - I'm presuming it's an infection. Is there anything we can give him to help?

Constipation
while, this is not a disease per say it does have to do with what you are feeding the fish. if you notice that your goldfish is trailing feces behind him, then he is probably constipated. This means that you are not feeding him the right kinds of foods, perhaps his diet is too fatty or just not varied enough. Just like in humans, you can remedy this by giving him more roughage. Try feeding him spinach, peas or even tubifex worms. You should also soak dried fish foods before letting your goldfish feed on them and this will help with his digestion.

swim bladder problems...they are more common in goldfish as they tend to swallow too much air when eating, and apparently this affects their swim bladder. Some swim bladder problems sort themselves out on their own, but their could be a number of different causes of the same condition. Try getting a fish book? mine has helped me no end!
or searching the net?

Sounds like a swim bladder problem. A good idea would be to get a treatment from the pet shop and also some aquarium salts (yes even freshwater fish need a bit of special salt in their water)

Also it may be worth getting a good quality sinking food that will go to the bottom of the fish tank and stop surface feeding which can cause to much air to be taken in with the food.



Go and ask for advice at your nearest fish specialist- it's free and they will help you out quicker than asking on here.

Help! neon tetra disease????



how can you tell if a neon tetra has neon tetra disease? i purchased nine tetras from pets at home (which i wont be buying from again!) two days ago. yesterday i noticed one wasnt swimming with the others and today he has turned pale and lost his colours, i have just taken him out of the tank as i read  its very easy to infect other fish. does anyone know what i should now do with the infected fish? does it sound as though he has it?  i have some small clown & dojo loaches in the tank that i have had for about 5 months, what are the chances of them being infected also?

p.s the other tetras seem fine at the moment but if one was infected, will the rest be as well?

</answer from>



<answer>



HI, I am no expert but we have lost one or two neons when we have bought a few at a time, mabe he is just a weaker fish sometimes they pick out the weak one and bully them, is there any nip marks on him? it could be fungus if he has any white cotton wool like stuff growing on him, you did right to take him out the tank i think you should take him back to pets at home, they will know (or should know) whats wrong with him, Also if you notice any of the other fish getting ill treat them with a anti fungus or relevant medicine, you could take a sample of water to a aquarium to be tested if you dont have any test kits yourself just to be on the safe side. hope i helped, katie.

Using anti fungus treatment in a community tank that has kuhli loaches, will they be okay?



I want to use an anti fungus treatment that contains malachite green and acriflavine, it says it you are using it on loaches etc to use it at half strength.
It's the other fish in the tank not the loaches I want to treat though, will it injure the loaches at full strength, or would it still be effect at treating fungus at half strength?

Or will I have to attempt the impossible task of catching the five slippery loaches :)

Treat the tank at half strength as you have been directed by the instructions on the medicine bottle.  If the fish you are attempting to treat are not better in 3 days, put them in a hospital tank or clean bucket and treat them away from the rest of your fish.  You can use the dip method of treatment which is to double or triple the amount of medication but only leave the fish in the dip water for an hour or two.  If your fish show signs of distress, that would be the time to put them back into the main tank.

Bristlenose plecos are not considered scaleless fish but they don't have a high tolerance for malachite green and acriflavine.  If your tank has a lot of algae and you treat the tank, the malachite green and acriflavine will be absorbed by the algae and when the plecos eat the algae, they could over dose from the medications.  Use the dip method if you only have a few fish that need to be treated.

While goldfish are not as hardy, bettas live almost up to their full life span in a bowl! There are just for starters, like yourself. The males (which are the most colorful) average about 3.69 at Petco and 3.49 at Petsmart. I will give you a few tips on taking care of them.

Betta Splendids live in Southeast Asia and are bred in the US. They are the labyrinth fish and they are able to breath the air on the surface of the water, they live in small places natively, like rice patties and small puddles. All 27 betta species are aggressive and may kill and eat some fish.

What you'll need

(1). A bowl (it can be under 1 gallon no matter what the half-wits say, but the bettas perfer bigger space)
(2). A small net
(3). "Betta" commercial water conditioner
(4). Betta food (pellets are good)

OPTIONAL:
(5). Rocks and plants

Now that I've told you everything you need, here's what you want to do:

(1). Change water AT LEAST once a week. Rinse rocks.
(2). Feed about 2-3 pellets or flakes every 2 days
(3). Do not put another fish of any kind in the bowl unless you gain more experience on this or you plan to mate. 
(4). NEVER use soap to clean your betta's bowl

Gold Fish!!!
They are easy to take care of. Any type of gold fish. It doesn't have to be those boring looking ones from the carnival. They actually have very pretty looking ones with fancy tails. I have two. I also kept a carnival fish for a year and a half. So it proves how easy they are to take care of.

goldfish are alright, but i don't think you should get it the first time. 
generally people think they're the easiest to take care of since they're given out at carnivals and all that, but in fact they need a really big tank (like 20-30 gallons for 2 of them) and they can grow to be like 10 inches and you need a filter and you have to be careful with the temperature of their water.

so yeah, not that.
i have a betta which my mom has tried on several occasions to murder with her noobish fish ideas (changing all the water, decycling the tank) but so far it's survived all this and i think it's a keeper.



plus, they're very pretty and come in all sorts of colors, and have very nice floaty fins. :D

i'd recommend that. oh and one more point, they're okay with smaller tanks. like a 5 gallon is fine.

If you're wanting to ADD fish, it doesn't sound like you're a first timer.
No goldfish.  And since black moors or a variety of goldfish, none of them.
It depends on the size of aquarium you have available.
If smaller than 20 gallons, forget fancy goldfish, that's only big enough for one.  If smaller than 29 gallons, forget common or comets.  Since they can get to over 16", 29 is big enough for only one.
Contrary to some of the answers, goldfish are generally more difficult to care for than tropicals.  They require a 30% + water change and tank cleaning at least once a week, more often in less than a 20 gallon aquarium.  Yes you can 3-4 babies in a 10 galon container, but they grow pretty quickly, so that's not a good idea.
I'd recommend 6-7 White Cloud Mountain minnows in a 10 gallon aquarium.  These are cold water fish, so don't require a heater.  One paradise fish could be added if only 6 WC's are in the tank.



There are others, but as mentioned, these two species don't require a heater.

I would say :
1) first cycle your tank
2) when the cycling is finished (after at least 3 weeks but preferably longer) you can get one of this:
- platies, swordtails or guppy
OR
- ONE betta male (never put 2 together, they kill each other)
OR
- small tetras (schooling fish, you need at least 6 of a kind)(you can get 2 or 3 schiools of different tetras if your tank is big enough)
OR
- tiger barbs (schooling fish, you need at least 6 of a kind)
OR
-zebra danios (schooling fish, you need at least 6 of a kind)(can be housed together with tetras or swordtails-platy-guppy)
AND
-corydoras catfish (they can be added to any of the combinations above)
Be careful not to overstock. For small fish like the ones above, you need 1 gallon for each inch of fish. For example a one inch guppy needs one gallon of water for himself, an emperor tetra of 2 inch needs 2 gallon; let's say you want 5 emperor tetras, than your tank must be at least 10 g; ALWAYS count the size the fish gets when mature, not the size at purchasing.

Stay away of plecos and goldfish, they grow big and they are 'water pigs'. Not good fish for first timers.

If you are a first time fish owner, do the research. Go out to the store and look at the fish you like. As a beginner I would steer you towards the tropical community fish. They stay small and are less dirty than other fish. So write down the ones you like and then buy an appropriate tank. I work in a pet store and hate having to tell people that they can't have the fish they want because they didn't buy a large enough tank. Anyway, take the tank home and set it up, and let it run for about a week. This week gives you time to read up on the fish you want to buy, and learn more about aquariums in general.
Definitely stay away from goldfish- They get huge, and are dirty. Only get into goldfish if you are ready for a 20 year commitment.

I started with one goldfish and 1 black moore, of course they will require a 20-30 gallon tank. These fish are hardy but do produce allot of waste...be sure to get a filter that is really exellent. Guppies and mollies are also a popular beginner fish for those who want a smaller tank. These fish require a warmer tank than a goldfish, so with this choice, invest in a heater. Snails and shrimp are also a good beginner for bottom dwellers for you. Good luck

Good Q!

It depends on what you want.
Start with tank.  what size?
rule of thumb is 1 gallon for 1 fish an inch long

best tank size is 20-30 gal.



after you get your tank you need to let it sit for 4-6 weeks to let the tank stabilize..  then you need to start with a small number of fish... like 2  to start the breaking in process.

I have stowaway snails in my aquarium and no idea how to deal with them!!?



I'd bought a few plants for the aquarium about 4 weeks ago - they seemed perfectly clean with no problems so i went ahead and put them in. now i find i have 4 snails wandering around and boy are they growing fast!! thing is, i don't mind them being there but i don't know the first thing about them - what species they are, whether they belong in a coldwater tank, how big they can grow, what food they live on and whether they can be harmful to the aquarium environment. they're eating the plants slowly but thats the worst i've seen them do so far but they still look quite 'young'.

anyone got any advice? I know one answer is take them back to the store i got the plants from but like i said, i don't mind them staying if they won't be a burden to my aquarium



</question>



<additional details>



if it helps to know i currently only have 5 white cloud mountain minnows (i think thats the right name, the little ones for coldwater?) and one beaufortia borneo loach. i'm hoping to put a pair of shubunkins in soon - it's an 80 litre(UK) tank.

They will reproduce like crazy.  They create a lot of waste and eat up your plants but if you don't mind them then that isn't a problem.  Once you have them in your tank it is almost impossible to totally get rid of them.  They lay eggs in little jelly masses on everything.  They are also almost indestructible so no worries about special care for them.

Oh dear, they will overtake and pretty quickly too.  There are three ways you can go about it.  Put some fish in your tank that eat snails like clown loach (if you have a tropical tank).  Or you could get a snail trap and put some lettuce inside or you can get snail treatment that will kill off your snails, interpet do one.



They will multiply like you wouldn't believe so whatever you decide you better do it quickly.  Good luck

Well the others have some good advice, I recently encountered the same problem from the same source. Snails are very hard to see, mine traveled from New York in a wet napkin! 
The plants looked clean, but I've already got about 10 in just 3 weeks time. They will reproduce like crazy and possibly upset the balance in your aquarium. These tiny snails, I dont know what they are called either besides "pests". I recently saw a product at my local petsmart, it's called "Had a snail" The name intrigued me, but I have not yet purchased it. It says it's safe for plants and fish. I will be investing in this product as soon as I get some extra cash. 
Man you know the economy is bad when you cant even afford some "Had a Snail" lol. 
Good luck with them, I suggest getting rid of them though, much like the others mentioned.

What fish do you have in your aquarium?

There are many fish that eat snails and consider them prime snacks with no harm to the fish.  Goldfish, betta included.  It may be the fish will solve te problem for you.



In the meantime the generic garden variety snails like this will eat the plants, the scum on the plants, the algae on the rocks,... you won't need to do much for them but keep the water levels up.

If they start breeding out of control, you may want to look into a fish that eat snails to keep the population under control- its better then chemicals or stripping your aquarium.

Good luck with the little 'stowaways'

Keep em!
Snails, whilst they do make a lot of waste once they have gotten around to reproducing (again and again and again), are great for cleaning algae off the tank.
We would recommend snails for this purpose, and it is a really good, organic (non chemical) way to keep the tank free of excess algae. Because they feed off the algae and other waste matter, you don't have to feed them either. I have never seen them bother fish or vice versa, so just keep an eye on how many you have and maybe remove some if the waste gets out of hand.
Remember to do some regular pH/kH testing to make sure your water quality is still good, and still give it a regular clean. It just means that you wont be scrubbing the sides of the tank anywhere near as often as you usually do.
Good luck :)

dont worry.. pose no threat to your tank.. they help to clean the tank from the algae.. most of them dont really feed on living plant.. what u see is they are eating algae on the surface or the plant or eating the dead plant material..



they are useful but but their number can multiply in no time..too many make your tank less attractive.. they are active at night/ in the dark so you will notice most of them early in the morning or after u switch on the light but then most of them dissappear as the hide especially inside the substrate.. you could control the number by simply hand picking/ netting them.. do this in the morning after you switch on the light.. no need chemical to deal with snails.. save environment and money :)



once you put shubunkins, it will help u to deal with the snails.. but the shubinkins will snack on the plants as well.. so you might want to get other type of fish if you want to keep a good planted tank..

what type of snail do you have? rounded shell or cone shell? some cone shell are a good indicator for water quality.. if the water is not suitable for them, they will climb up your tank.. if u find a lot of snails leaving the water.. thats mean its time to check the water quality..

consider yourself lucky.. some people buy the snails but you got them for free...

Yes they will eat them, but they are lacking  plenty of proteins and vitamins the fish need, and shouldn't be used as a food source.
Also if any form of sprays, weedkillers, and fertilizers are used near your source of ants (even at neighbors house) they could contain pathogens that could kill the fish,

Goldfish care...starting a new tank?



I have several (3) tropical community tanks and have been doing upkeep and care for those for about 2 years. I am interested in getting some new fish. My 4 year old loves goldfish ( especially the ryukin goldfish). Is the care the same for goldfish as freshwater? I have a 40 gallon tank ready and just want to know the basics. Thanks.

I think you will be pleasantly pleased by how fun goldfish are to take care of. It is easy to care for goldfish. You sound like your all set up to add a few fish to your lot. Goldfish do not require a heater, just an excellent filtration system. What kind of filter does your tank have? I recommend Aqua clear by Hagen. Goldfish also need the same diet variety that tropical fish do. They love veggies, blood worms, shrimp, and flakes. Have fun!!

It's pretty much the same!  As they are also freshwater fish, just coldwater freshwater fish :) they DO tend to require more cleaning and upkeep though,so be prepared!!  IMHO they are a bit more difficult, but not by much.  As a faily experienced fish keeper, I think you'll do fine!

There are some things that need to be taken into account however with goldies.

If you are getting fancies, you will need 10-15 gallons per fish at least.  15-20 ideally.  I wouldn't put any more than three fancies in your 40 gallon as goldfish grow and they grow fast.  They also produce alot of waste since they don't really have a stomache and release alot of nutrients into the water.

Filtration needs to be higher than that of a tropical tank.  Buy a filter that's made for double your tank size AT LEAST.  Filtration is usually the most expensive thing to buy when you're starting up a goldy tank.  if you buy a good filter, it will benefit for years in the long-run in the health of your tank and the amount of work you have to put into it.  I have a 25 gallon goldfish tank with a Marineland Emperor Biowheel made for a 75 gallon aquarium  It's FANTASTIC and only ran me like....$50.  If that.

Make sure your decor is simple and not pointy in any way.  Goldfish are said to be the "bumbling tourists" of the aquarium and will hurt themselves on ANYTHING they can find.

Larger gravel substrate always.  If they can fit it into their mouths they WILL eat it.  Many goldy keepers keep a bare bottom tank for this reason and that it's just easier to clean.  If you go with bare-bottom you can have plants in terra cotta pots to make it spiffed up.

The best food to feed a goldfish is a sinking pellet as they like to root for food.  Flake food is not the best as they gasp at the surface to get the food and swallow air.  Ryukin's especially are prone to Swim Bladder problems.

Don't mix seeing-impaired goldfish with non-impared goldfish, you'll know the ones I'm speaking of when you see them haha.  Also don't mix single-tailed ish like commons, comets or shubunkins as they will outcompete the fancies for food.

Since you already have 3 other tank, cycling your goldy tank should be as easy as snatching some filter media from the other three tanks and using them on the new tank.  Cycling should go by quickly that way and work just fine.

Plecos should not be kept with goldfish.  Like like the taste of their slime coat.  Apple snails can do well with them though I've found.

Goldfish love fresh foods.  Anything you'd put in a salad they'll love.  And a bit of orange as well, mine go crazy for this!!

There's more of course, but I think I've covered the basics.  Here's some links though!

TIP: when you're buyinga  Ryukin, look for a fish that looks as though he's fatter than he is long, or looks like he will grow to have these proportions.  A deeper ryukin is more desirable than a long ryukin :)

the tank needs to have certain levels of bacteria that breaks down the fishes waste products. you can buy bacteria from pet shops.
:-) also introducing each fish gradually so the bacteria levels can build up. 
we use stress zyme and ammo lock, the stress zyme contains live bacteria and the ammo lock detoxifies aquarium ammonia  :-)

You are prepared better than most for getting into Goldfish.

1) Goldfish are a cold water fish, so set the heater for 65 F or so.
2) Goldfish are bottom feeders/scavengers going through the substrate, so if you have a substrate (some don't) make it something that will not hurt or get stuck in their mouths.  BTW, it is generally better to feed Fancy Goldfish with sinking food instead of flakes.
3) Goldfish produce a lot of ammonia, so make sure you cycle your tank and do not overstock.
4) Because of the above, you should change the water more than tropicals and have a bigger filter.
5) Goldfish might start small but grow if given a chance.  You could probably handle 3 full grown fish in the 40.
6) Water quality - keep a consistent pH, since you will be doing a lot of changes, keep it close to your source water pH.  A bit of salt is OK and recommended by more than a few.  Hard/alkaline water is generally recommended.  Watch for Ammonia, Nitrites and try to keep Nitrates down as well...

most new aquarium heaters will only heat to the temperature it is set to so set it to 26c.

because it is quite powerful for such a small amount of water you should possibly invest in a small heater protector but i am not quite sure

The main difference between a 100 watt heater and a 50 watt heater is that the 100 watt heater will not stay on as much as the 50 watt heater.  If both heaters are thermostatically controlled, they will both turn themselves off when the correct temperature has been reached and will only turn on if the temperature drops.



It's safer to use an higher wattage heater than one that is too small because if the heater is too small, it may not be able to maintain a high enough temperature in cold weather.  In summer, your heater will hardly if ever come on unless you run the air conditioning all the time.

The principle problem with using too big a heater is it chucks out twice the heat. The temperature in a tropical aquarium varies +/- 2C of what the heater is set on.

If you set your heater at 26C it doesn't come on till the water drops to 24C and it doesn't switch off till it hits 28C. That's a gentle rise and drop if the heater is the correct size.

In your tank from 24-28C will take about the same time as a kettle boiling, which will do the cold blooded system of your fighter no good whatsoever.

The sooner you can get a smaller heater the better for your fish.

Go ahead, use the algae destroy!! I use it in my tanks that get more sun then others. You can also look around Petsmart or Petco for algae cleaners. I used to have an algae problem until I started doing a 2X week water/tank cleaning. That worked the best for me and my fish sure appreciated it.

Algae Destroy should have the fact that it is safe for all fish in the instructions.  I use it in my 55 and 70 and 30 gallon freshwater tanks with parrot fish, flowerhorns, plecos, corydoras, etc.  You need to scrub the algae off the sides before placing the drops in the tank, this will disintegrate it and deter it from coming back.  I also use Tetra Algae Gone and it works about the same.  You can get that at Walmart. Use one drop or less per gallon.  The trick is not to overuse it.  Better to use less than more!

There are plenty of fish that will eat the algae out of your tank such as plecostomus which get large, different types of loach such as algae loach, and some other types of Catfish, there are non fish harming chemicals that you can buy from pet shops, but they may effect the friendly bacteria in your filter, there are also cleaners that are designed so that you do not have to put your hand in the water.
hope that helps =]

I had this same problem and it was due to over-feeding! Check here: http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/forum...

Is sandstone and sandcrete stone safe for aquarium use?



I saw a few pieces at Lowe's on the gardening section, they're something like 20"x20"x3" [i might have the measurements wrong] for $5 or $6. has anyone seen these and are they ok to use in an aquarium?

Thanks.

Natural sandstone should be safe to use in a fish tank as long as the rock does not dissolve in water.  Test it by boiling for 30 minutes.  If it is still hard after cooling, it should be fine in the tank.



Sandcrete sounds like a man made rock made from sand and concrete.  Concrete is high in lime and phosphates and must be neutralized or cured before it can be used in an aquarium.  If the rock is sold for aquarium use or pond use then it has probably been treated by the manufacturer.  If not, you may have to soak it for 24 hours in a 5% solution of muratic acid, rinse it well, and then soak it for 48 hours in clean fresh water.  Give it a final rinse and then you can use it in your tank.
