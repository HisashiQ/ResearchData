2006 "Marie Antoinette" Film ?



Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson played characters Aunt Victoire and Aunt Sophie. Were these two gossiping gals based on real people or were they just from Sofia Coppola's imagination?

Oh they were quite real! Nicknamed 'Mesdames Tantes', 'tante' meaning aunt in French, they were Louis XV daughters, thus Louis XVI's aunts.Those two are rather interesting, you should read up on them.

Cheers!

They were Loui's aunts, but more like sisters.  While they didn't take to their Austrian Ostrich at first, it is said that the younger sister came to love and befriend Antoinette as the years passed.



They were, however, depicted in one aspect quite accurately: they were both unmarried spinsters to their deaths.

Queen Elizabeth I not to be confused with the current reigning monarch Elizabeth II was referred to as the Virgin Queen because she wasn't married. You already probably know that Britain's Royal Family is somewhat famous for it's sexcapades so you can take it to the bank that she did not live up to her name.

No one knows for sure. When she got into her late 30s and it was clear that she was not going to have a child, the cult of the virgin queen was very carefully developed. The queen was portrayed as a selfless monarch who gave up her sexuality for her country. She became almost divine.

Many letters exist that point not only to Robert Dudley as a likely lover, but to a few others.  However, contrary to Hollywood, Clive Owen's Walter Raleigh wouldn't have been a suitable suitor.  Age and her growing temper would have most likely ruled him out.



Many of the Queens Ladies in waiting were educated along side of her and therefore knew how to write/correspond.  A few of her Ladies  never expected her to truly rule for any significant period.  Their gossipping betrayals can be found in the museums of London.  Let's just say that this Queen's sheets did not remain dry for her entire life; although, no one is certain during which periods they were and were not.  One thing is certain: when Dudley was accused of murdering his wife, Elizabeth banned him from the court for a sufficient amount of time for appearances sake.

She will always be known as the Virgin Queen because it is high treason to accuse an hrh of an affair.  Who was going to do that? Norfolk? O.k., well, he tried, and ended up a lollipop.  She never married; thus, she never consummated any relationship...officially.

Elizabeth was a virgin, because she had Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. A very rare hormone disease cause by the syphilis bacteria. Anne Boleyn her mother was riddled with syphilis when she married Henry VIII, and when Elizabeth was conceived her sex was male-but the syphilis bacteria killed the testosterone male hormone, and oestrogen the female hormone took over. Like her father she went bald in her twenties, she had a very masculine voice and upper torso, no breast tissue, spindle fingers, and long elegant legs. She had no reproductive organs,a shallow vagina, and penetration was impossible. Prior to her expected marriage to the King of Spain she was examined per vagina, and it was justifiably presumed she was virgo intacta by the court physician. Two other famous women had this syndrome-Wallis Simpson, and Cleopatra VII [Mark Antony].

Medical research in the 1980's after the discovery of Elizabeth's medical records in the Tower of London. 1-1000 woman have this problem, and 10-1000 men have this problem too. Possible cause for sex-changes too

It would be nice to believe the popular stories about her but,whether a man in a woman's body or not,it is probably not true that she died a virgin.

Henry went looking for a young twit, but slutty wife within his own walls and found Catherine Howard, first cousin to the Boleyn sisters.  He had just had the unfortunate incident with the unattractive Cleves woman and needed to prove his manhood.



Howard was the only wife who truly committed high treason by sleeping with half of his privy chamber; thus, it seems she deserved her beheading.

You couldn't find this online on your own? Seriously?

To add a further voice, yes, it was a young girl by the name of Catherine Howard who was a Lady-in-Waiting to Anne of Cleves. She was a member of the prolific Howard clan and a cousin to Anne Boleyn.

Catherine Howard was a daughter of Lord Edmund Howard who appeared to be in blunt terms as being rather lazy and irresponsible. He is even said to have been struck by either his second or third wife (I can't recall which) after he had some sort of bout of incontinence. Lord Edmund's sister was Lady Elizabeth Howard who was the mother of Anne Boleyn.



Catherine was mostly raised by relatives, in particular her grandmother, Agnes Howard nee Tilney, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk, and had little supervision.
