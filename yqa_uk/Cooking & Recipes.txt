Well if it's yummy who the hell cares if it's falling apart on the way in lol.



You have plenty of time to experiment so I would start making 1/2 or 1/4 batches and try adding more egg, more liquid and more flour. One of those 3 options should work, hard to tell since you didn't mention it being overly dry or moist, i'd start with the egg first since thats the number 1 binding ingredient in most recipies.

Kitty_Ka, just a quick question did you soak the fruits in the sherry or brandy, they do help with the moisture. Your saying it tasted yummy, but was it dry in anyway? There could be a number of reasons for it to crumble.

Depending on how nice your butcher is or what they normally have available you can sometimes find turkey breasts. If not then ground turkey is readily available in most stores. I would make a traditional thanksgiving meal just mini sized, you can put turkey breast on top of some stuffing in a casserole dish and bake it, make some mashed potatoes and yams or squash. Or you could make a turkey pot pie or sheppards pie, somthing hearty and homey feeling that you can make in smaller ammounts.

You might consider ordering in... Cracker Barrel makes a great Thanksgiving dinner for 4, and I think it's around $30.00.  It's delicious, and you would have leftovers....  All you do is order it in advance and pick it up that day.



You get ham, turkey, sides, even pie!

Hey Brown_ey, no it's not, your wrong there, if you go to the more larger grocery stores. Check out the meat and poultry section. Here in Montreal we can get quarter and half turkeys. So if you want turkey have a look around.



For a meal idea i would open with a Prosciutto and Melon, a slice or two of the Italian Parma Prosciutto wrapped around the center of a quarter cantaloupe.



If you can't get the turkey, do a duck, really there is not to much on a young duck, and the sauce you can do with the pan juices, bit of chicken stock and the squeeze of a orange is fantastic.



Besides your standard veggies, you could do a tossed salad with a nice vinaigrette. Desert you have the traditional thanksgiving stuff, or you could be inspirational and use your imagination there.



You need more specifics contact me here at Yahoo Answers and I will fill you in on the details, however you sound like someone that does not get lost around a kitchen.

Buy a Turkey for both of you add some salad rice and what ever you love to eat and a cherry pie and then left overs can be eaten the next day, or give it to your family when you see them next in a container  Leftovers are always good : ) Its thanksgiving celebrate

No foil or any metal in the m/w!!!



You cannot roast in the m/w; only "cook."  Your chicken will not end up browned and caramelized.  You need a regular oven for that.



Perfect Roast Chicken



1 (5 to 6 pound) roasting chicken



Kosher salt



Freshly ground black pepper



1 large bunch fresh thyme, plus 20 sprigs



1 lemon, halved



1 head garlic, cut in half crosswise



2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) butter, melted



1 large yellow onion, thickly sliced



4 carrots cut into 2-inch chunks



1 bulb of fennel, tops removed, and cut into wedges (optional)
Olive oil



Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.



Remove the chicken giblets. Rinse the chicken inside and out. Remove any excess fat and leftover pin feathers and pat the outside dry. Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken. Stuff the cavity with the bunch of thyme, both halves of lemon, and all the garlic. Brush the outside of the chicken with the butter and sprinkle again with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken. Place the onions, carrots, and fennel in a roasting pan. Toss with salt, pepper, 20 sprigs of thyme, and olive oil. Spread around the bottom of the roasting pan and place the chicken on top.



Roast the chicken for 1 1/2 hours, or until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and thigh. Remove the chicken and vegetables to a platter and cover with aluminum foil for about 20 minutes. Slice the chicken onto a platter and serve it with the vegetables.

It could be uneven heating, try a slightly lower temp.



Or just very gently turn the cake upside down before you frost it

Too much moisture, too much heat too soon, and don't open the oven to "check" on the cake before it's done.

Put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven while your baking the cake. It will keep the cake from cracking. I'm not sure if it will help with the rising. Most professional cake decorators cut the top of the cake off since there's not really any way around it.

The oven is set too high, the cake mix hardens on top to fast and the the inside is like a volcano still trying to expand and so it cracks the surface, lower the heat slightly especially if you have a fan assisted oven.

When spreading batter in the pan, spread it thicker on the sides, and thinner in the middle.  It should even out some.  Cake mixes are bad about doming like this; yo may try a scratch cake, too.

This recipe has more chocolate than flour!



Outrageous Brownies



1 pound unsalted butter



1 pound plus 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips, divided



6 ounces unsweetened chocolate



6 extra-large eggs



3 tablespoons instant coffee powder



2 tablespoons real vanilla extract



2 1/4 cups sugar



1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, divided (1 cup for batter and 1/4 cup in the chips and nuts)



1 tablespoon baking powder



1 teaspoon kosher salt



3 cups diced walnut pieces



Preheat oven to 350º F. Grease and flour a 13x18x 1½” sheet pan.



Melt together the butter, 1 pound chocolate chips, and unsweetened chocolate on top of a double boiler. Cool slightly. Stir together the eggs, instant coffee, vanilla and sugar. Stir in the warm chocolate mixture and cool to room temperature.



Stir together 1 cup of the flour, baking powder and salt. Add to cooled chocolate mixture. Toss the walnuts and 12 ounces of chocolate chips with 1/4 cup flour to coat. Then add to the chocolate batter. Pour into prepared pan.



Bake for about 30 minutes, or until tester just comes out clean. Halfway through the baking, rap the pan against the oven shelf to allow air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough. Do not over-bake! Cool thoroughly, refrigerate well and cut into squares.

* 2/3 cup (150g) caster sugar



Method



1. Grease 2 x deep, 20cm round cake tins (or different tins, as directed in individual recipes) and line bases with baking paper. Sift flours and 1/4 tsp salt together three times to aerate.



2. Preheat oven to 180C. Using an electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl on medium-high speed for 6 minutes, or until mixture is thick, pale and tripled in volume.



3. Gradually sift flour mixture over egg mixture while simultaneously folding in with a large metal spoon until just combined. Divide mixture between prepared tins. To level batter, gently spin tins on kitchen counter. Bake for 20 minutes (or as directed in individual recipes), or until cakes have shrunk away from the sides slightly and spring back when gently touched.



4. Turn out on to baking paper-lined wire racks. Carefully peel away baking paper, then leave to cool.

Make a deviled egg. Just put the egg in a pot of cold water and put in some salt and put on high until it comes to a boil. When it starts boiling turn it down just a little so that it is still boiling but not bouncing around in the pot. Let it boil for 5 or 6 minutes then remove from heat. Run cold water in the pot and let the egg cool to the point where you can pick it up. Peel the egg cut it in half and remove the yolk to another container. Put a teaspoon of mayonnaise in the yolk and some salt and pepper and, whatever other seasoning you might like and mix it well. Put the mixture back into the halved egg and enjoy!

You don't have to cook the rasberries at all.  Just mix them with the sugar and push them through a fine sieve.



Some recipes do require you to cook the rasberries and the time of cooking varies from recipe to recipe from between a few minutes and fifteen minutes.  If you choose to cook them allow the consistency (thickness) of the coulis to be your guide as to how long to cook them for.

juice of 1 lime (or lemon)
1 tbsp icing sugar (plus extra to taste, if desired) Method:



Add the raspberries and the lime juice to a saucepan and slowly heat. Sprinkle the sugar on top and stir to dissolve. Bring the mixture to a simmer, mashing the fruit with the back of a spoon.



Take off the heat and pour into a sieve. Push the fruit through, collecting the liquid. Discard the pulp then taste then taste the liquid and adjust the sugar, if needed. Remember, however, that a coulis should be tart, to contrast with the generally sweet confection it's served with.

All a coulis consists of is the juice from the fruit, sweetened as necessary, so for raspberry coulis you take a load of ripe raspberries, whizz them in a blender then strain through a fine sieve. Add icing sugar to the juice - and you may wish to add a drop of lemon juice to it although I can't think why! You chuck the pulp and seeds left in the strainer in the bin.
Why people make such a fuss - to the extent of making a major production number out of it - beats me ! ! !

I imagine the reason is that they are relatively cheap, nutritious, and available all year. They have a mild flavor that most people can appreciate for adding a slight kick to the food.



If you dont like them, you can always just leave them out. Substitute another kind of pepper. I can't think of any recipe that absolutely depends on them, except stuffed peppers. Even with that you could use a tomato.

I like bell peppers especially the red, yellow and orange ones; these have a sweet taste to them. My favorite way to eat them is warm after they have been taken right off the grill at the BBQ. But I have 4 daughters and 2 grandsons that don't like them, so I substitute italian squash were the peppers should be. It works just as well and is the closest thing consistency wise that I have found, same color too. maybe you could try this. Good luck :)

Is the soft baked pretzel a pastry?



i have a pastry shop in a shopping centre and i want to expand the range of products i sell. i'm interested in stocking freshly baked soft pretzels. since shopping centres are very strict with what we stock, i would like to know whether it is okay to sell them.



i found a wikipedia article on pretzels: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel



it says that they are a 'bread pastry', but because anyone can contribute information and edit these articles, i am not sure if the info is correct.



thanks in advance :)

A pretzel is a bread pastry of German origin, that has the shape of a three looped knot or twisted braid. Pretzels are either soft or hard. Hard pretzels have evolved into a variety of shapes from knotted loops to straight "pretzel sticks" (called "Salzstangen" in German, Ropi in Hungarian).

Mainly slaves and the poor ate these foods such as fried chicken, hoe cakes, scrapple, chittlin's, collard/turnip/mustard greens, etc. Sugar was a commodity and was usually replaced with molasses or not used at all ( which is why biscuits in the south aren't sweet like they are up north) With the onset of the Great Depression the culinary creativity in the South only intensified. From my own family history, recipes like Tomato Soup Cake and Supper on a Loaf, both recipes that use a smorgasbord of ingredients and are easily adaptable to whats on hand. In short, the true beauty of Southern cooking comes not from the ingredients but from the amazing flavor that our ancestors were able to put into the meager supply that they had. Flavors so good in fact that many thrive to this day.

I think the most important thing with a chilli is to give the chilli powder time to soak into the dish.
I always add the powder to the meat/onions/kidney beans etc and cook very gently for at least 20 mins. This is what makes the difference between a chilli burning your lips as soon as its tasted or getting the slower nicer heat a minute or two after its first tasted.Its always best made a day in advance too as this allows all the flavours to blend into one another.
I usually use sieved or chopped tomatos, gravy granules and ketchup for my sauce.

Ingredients
500g (1Lb) Lean Minced Beef
250g (8oz) Skinned tomatoes
225g (8oz) Haricot or Red Kidney beans (soaked overnight)
50g (2oz) of Butter
2 Teaspoons Olive or Corn oil
2 Medium onions
2 Cloves of garlic
1 Medium sized green pepper
1 Level teaspoon Chilli powder
¼ Level teaspoon of salt
1 Level tablespoon of flour
4 Tablespoons fresh single cream
150ml (¼ pint) of Water



Method
(1) Drain the beans. Cook in boiling salted water until almost tender. Strain and keep on one side.



(2) Chop the onions and garlic finely. Fry gently in butter plus the oil, until golden (oil stops butter from burning). Add the meat and fry for a further 5 minutes (or until brown), breaking it up with a fork and turning it over all the time.



(3) Chop the skinned tomatoes and green pepper. Then add to the pan with kidney beans, chilli powder, salt and half the quantity of water. Cover and cook over a very low heat, for between 45 minutes to an hour (or until beans are soft), stirring occasionally.



(4) Combine the flour with the rest of the water and pour into the pan. Cook and stir until the mixture thickens.



(5) Remove from the heat and stir in the cream.

& here is the recipe..



Preparation Time 15 - 45 minutes



Cooking Time 50 minutes



Makes 10



Ingredients



300g (2 cups) self-raising flour



Pinch of salt



500ml (2 cups) milk



2 eggs



60g butter, melted



Melted butter, extra, to grease



2 x 250g punnets strawberries,



washed, hulled, halved, to serve



Maple syrup, to serve



Maple syrup butter



120g butter, at room temperature



1 tbs maple syrup
Method
Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Whisk together the milk and eggs in a large jug. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture, whisking constantly until a smooth batter forms. Stir in the butter. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to rest.



Meanwhile, to make the maple syrup butter, use an electric beater to beat the butter in a medium bowl until pale and creamy. Add the maple syrup and beat until well combined.



Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Brush with the extra melted butter to lightly grease. Pour 80ml (1/3 cup) of the batter into the pan to form a 15cm-diameter pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until bubbles appear on the surface and the pancake is golden underneath. Turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes or until golden. Transfer to a plate and cover with a clean tea towel to keep warm. Repeat, in 9 more batches, with melted butter and remaining batter, reheating pan between batches, to make 10 pancakes.



Place pancakes on serving plates. Top with the maple syrup butter and strawberries. Drizzle over maple syrup to serve.



have fun.

A nonstick griddle works best.  Ladle a small amount of batter onto griddle, stopping before it's the size you want the pancake as it will spread.  A godo tip is to try to keep the circle of batter not much bigger than your spatula.  Med. heat.  You will see bubbles rise to the top as it cooks.  When edges look sort of dry and many bubbles are popped, slip spatula under pancake and quickly flip.  (This may take a little practice, so don't give up.  If you sort of flip it off-center, you can wait a moment, then flip again to cook exposed batter.)  Cook a minute or so on other side, then remove to plate.  Top a stack fo 3-4 pancakes w/ soft butter and maple syrup.



As far as reheating the next day, allow pancakes to cool on wire rack.  When room temp, slip into zipper bag and freeze.  They can then be reheated in a toaster oven (best) or microwave (okay).



The Best Buttermilk Pancakes



1 cup Buttermilk**
1 egg, room temp
3 Tbsp butter, melted
¾ cup all purpose flour
½ tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda



Put the buttermilk, egg and melted butter in a mixing bowl. Stir briskly until the mixture is smooth and blended.
Stir the flour, salt and baking soda together in a small bowl. Stir into the buttermilk mixture only until the dry ingredients are moistened - leave the smaller lumps.
Heat a skillet or griddle to medium hot. Grease lightly and spoon out a 3 TBLS of batter per pancake. Cook until a few bubbles form on top and break. Flip the pancake over and cook until golden brown..not too long.



These are the best pancakes and nothing else will compare after having these!!! Enjoy.



Makes about 6-8 pancakes.



**To make your own buttermilk, add 2 tsp of lemon juice or vinegar to a scant cup of milk, stir, and let sit at room temp for 15-30 min.  Stir again before adding to recipe.

try this:



Bonfire Toffee



A nice recipe for the kids.



Ingredients:



60g Margarine



180g White Sugar



155g Golden Syrup



70g Black Treacle



20mls Vinegar



Method:



Put the margarine and the white sugar in a saucepan and heat gently, stirring all of the time. When all of the margarine has melted, add the golden syrup and black treacle. Continue to stir until the sugar has dissolved. Boil slowly, over a low heat, stirring occasionally.



You need to boil off enough water for the mixture to solidify when cooled to room temperature but you also need to keep the temperature of the mixture low enough during cooking to prevent burning. The test involves getting a sample of mixture on a teaspoon and dropping it into cold water - either in a cup or a saucer.



When the test yields a soft but not liquid result, add the vinegar carefully. The water and most of the acetic acid in the vinegar will boil off but some will stay in the toffee and modify the flavour - most importantly, the malt will stay in the final toffee.



Lightly grease a toffee tray with margarine.



Keep on boiling slowly and testing every few minutes (things speed up towards the end) until you get a stiff result - you will get a feel for how fast you can boil toffee without burning it. Carefully pour into a greased toffee tray and let cool. When cold, break up with a toffee hammer or the handle of a heavy knife or spoon.



Variations:



Add some peppermint oil or orange oil near the end to alter the flavour slightly.



Add some nuts (sliced roast almonds or brazils).



Storage:



Break up and store in an airtight tin - bonfire toffee is deliquescent so, unless you want to end up with a sugar solution, make sure that it is airtight.



Serving suggestions:



Eat straight from the tin whilst watching the bonfire



or this:
BONFIRE TOFFEE



INGREDIENTS



1 lb sugar, preferably Demerara



1/3 pint water



1 ozs butter
2 level tablespoons black treacle
1 teaspoon malt vinegar



METHOD



Put all the ingredients into a strong saucepan and stir over a steady
heat until the sugar has dissolved.



Bring to the boil and cook slowly.



To test for consistency stage drop about half a teaspoon of the mixture
into a cup of cold water, if it sets hard then it is done, if still soft
and chewy cook for a little longer and test again.



Pour into oiled or buttered tin and either allow to set as a slab or
mark in squared as toffee becomes partially set.
Break when completely set.

Looking for an Alfredo baked chicken breast recipe?



I am making fettuccine alfredo for my husbands birthday this Friday. It will be the first time I have ever cooked for his family (8 people!) I have made this before but I want to do something different. I am wondering if anyone has a good recipe for baking the chicken breast to have along with the noodles rather than putting it in with the noodles. My husband does not like tomato sauce so I'm looking for a recipe with a cheese cream sauce.



Thank you :)

Applesauce Recipe



Preparation time: 45 minutes. The sugar amounts are just guidelines, depending your taste, and on the sweetness of your apples, use less or more. If you use less sugar, you'll likely want to use less lemon juice. The lemon juice brightens the flavor of the apples and balances the sweetness.
Ingredients



* 3 to 4 lbs of peeled, cored, and quartered apples. (Make sure you use a good cooking apple like Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Fuji, Jonathan, Mcintosh, or Gravenstein.)



* 4 strips of lemon peel - use a vegetable peeler to strip 4 lengths



* Juice of one lemon, about 3-4 Tbsp



* 3 inches of cinnamon stick



* 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar



* up to 1/4 cup of white sugar



* 1 cup of water



* 1/2 teaspoon of salt



Method



1 Put all ingredients into a large pot. Cover. Bring to boil. Lower heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes.



2 Remove from heat. Remove cinnamon sticks and lemon peels. Mash with potato masher.



Ready to serve, either hot or refrigerated. Delicious with vanilla ice cream or vanilla yogurt.



Freezes easily, lasts up to one year in a cold freezer.

Make some Taco Boats.



Get some WonTon Wraps from your local grocery store. They usually hang in the produce isle near the Tofu. They come 60 to a package.



I can make about 48-50 of these with two pounds of ground beef.



Brown your ground beef ( 1-2 pounds) with chopped sweet onion (large or small). Drain and add the dry Ranch Dressing mix (1 pkg. for 1 lb. 2 for 2 lbs.). Stir in well.



While your meat is cooking take the Wonton Wraps and place them individually in a muffin tin to bake and form a small bowl. Transfer them to a cookie sheet after you finish baking them.



Spoon in your meat mixture to each bowl and add grated cheddar cheese to the top. Place them back in the oven to melt the cheese slightly.



Toppings can range from sour cream, guacamole, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, corn, chopped green onions and salsa of course.



They are fun to make and more fun to eat. And believe me they will disappear so don't think you can make to many!

grease is oil or butter, personally i think pancakes taste nicer when they're cooked with butter.



if you were supposed to put the grease into the mix then maybe you didn't mix the mixture enough inbetween pancake making meaning that the mixture separated after the first pancake.



if you're referring to when you cook them in the pan you are supposed to add a little more grease each time you make a new pancake to ensure the pancakes don't stick to the bottom of the pan.

* About 4 litres of water



1. Firstly, prep the vegetables. Cut the parsnip into quarters, top and tail the carrots and cut in half.



2. Cut the leek, celery and onion into big pieces and put into your biggest saucepan. Then add the chicken.



3. Finally, cover in water and add the bay leaves, plus half of the parsley - stalks and all.



4. Slowly bring the pan to boil and then turn right down. Leave just below a simmer for three hours.



5. Drain all the stock into another saucepan. Slice the carrots and add to the stock, and finally add some chopped chicken back in.



6. I usually add one breast back into the soup and make the rest into Thai chicken salad or use for sandwiches.



7. Then add a handful of chopped parsley and check the seasoning. Et voila!

see the recipe and then see how to defrost quickly
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoons chopped green onions
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
5 cups chicken broth
1 cup snow peas, sliced in 1-inch lengths
1 cup canned sliced bamboo shoots, drained and rinsed
1/2 cup sliced water chestnuts, drained
2 cups diced cooked chicken
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or parsley
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
salt, to taste
ground cayenne pepper, to taste
In a large soup pot, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the green onions and garlic; sauté for 1 minute. Add ginger and the chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil.
Stir in the snow peas, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts; simmer for 5 minutes, or until snow peas are tender.



Stir in the chicken, cilantro or parsley, vinegar, sesame oil, salt, and cayenne pepper. Simmer until thoroughly heated. Serve hot.



Serves 6.
Put the chicken in a bowl, set in the sink and let COLD water run over it. The water does not have to be turned on full blast, just a steady stream. Hot water on raw meat will cause bacteria to grow and cause a person to get sick. Do not risk it. I work in food service we are not allowed to have raw meat defrost in hot water due to this fact. Chicken breasts take about 20 minutes to defrost using this method.

the main thing is to have a good variety of each.
go to a local cheese shop and do some tastings if possible.
you want to have different types of cheese and different varieties of wine as well.
seek out someone that has some experience and do some reading on the internet other than this forum and you will be fine.

Make sure you have a good selection of cheeses, i.e. cheddar,Brie,cheshire,Edam,stilton and lancashire or red leicester.
You could also serve it with a fruit bowl Selection ,mixed crackers and french stick.Sweet pickle would also go well and olives. As for wine a good selection would be , medium sweet, white wine , medium dry white wine and red wine .You could also have an asti spumanti and a jug of orange juice for those that drink less .

Maybe...2 fried chicken wing, some long beans, some eggs, rice and some salad. Looks like you will be very full. So another choice for you. 2 prawns, 3 fish balls, some cabbage and rice. But if you still don't like, you have a last choice. Sweet sour chicken, raw salmon fish(with lemon), salad for vegetable and rice. That's all!!!

if you put salt in with them they probably won't soften. i don't know what that has to do with it but it happened to me when i tried to make baked beans once. also i just read that if the beans are old they won't soften.

Your peas are old that's why they will not soften. I love them and cook them a lot. Don't add salt until ready to serve.
You should only have to soak over-night.

Healthy, budget friendly recipes?



A group of nursing students are creating a healthy, budget friendly cookbook for elderly adults living in a senior apartment community.  We are all contributing recipes that meet the previously mentioned criteria.  I've come up with a few ideas on my own and I'm headed to Barnes and Noble today to see if I can find any recipes there but I'm hoping to get more recipes.  Thank you!

Lasagna is a good choice - it's really easy to make.
It can be a bit tricky making it for two however I manage it. I have a normal sized casserole dish rectangular in shape and I just make it in half of the dish. If you have a dish the right size then will be alot easier.



I use tesco or Asda's own Lasagna sheets and Ragu red and white sauce.
You'll need about 400-500grams of minced beef.



-Brown off mince in frying pan (once brown drain off oil & fat)
-Stir in red sauce and bring to a simmer
-Once cooked, put a 3cm layer of mince in (half of the casserole dish) or if you have the right size dish a 3cm layer in the whole dish.
-Cover with uncooked lasagna sheets
-Spoon on a layer of white sauce straight from jar
-Repeat the last 3 steps *mince



*lasagna sheets



*white sauce
-Grate some cheese over the top and sprinkle with some pepper



-Put in middle of oven for 20-30 mins at 180deg

If you just want to thicken the stock, cornflour is less likely to go lumpy.  A better technique is to coat the raw meat in plain flour then fry it for a minute before stewing it.  The cooked flour will absorb the blood and thicken the stock.

1 pound confectioners' sugar, about 3 3/4 cups, unsifted
Preparation:
Grease and flour a 9x13x2-inch baking pan. Heat oven to 350°.
Sprinkle coconut and pecans evenly over the bottom of the prepared pan. Prepare cake mix with the appropriate measurements of water, oil, and eggs, following the package directions. Pour the cake batter over the coconut and pecans. Beat together the cream cheese, butter and confectioners' sugar; drop by spoonfuls over the top of cake batter. Bake for about 45 to 50 minutes.

Recipes for corn chowder using frozen corn and milk?

Texas Corn Chowder



INGREDIENTS



1/4 cup chopped onion



1 tablespoon butter or margarine



1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (I use 4 Tablespoons to make it thicker)

1 cube chicken bouillon



1 cup fresh or frozen corn

In a medium saucepan, saute onion in butter until tender. Stir in flour. Add the potato, water and bouillon; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and simmer for 7-10 minutes or until potato is tender. Add corn, jalapeno, milk and seasonings. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes.

What's the secret to making crispy bacon?



It seems that no matter how long I fry it, it stays soft.  I like the really crispy, almost-burnt style, but that just doesn't happen.



?



Thanks.

This works every time!



1. Start with a cold pan or baking sheet. This is of paramount importance. If you are using a frying pan, make sure it is as cold as possible, put your bacon on it, and only then put it on the stove element. If using the oven, start with a cold baking sheet, put your bacon on it, and put it in the oven. Adding the bacon directly to a hot surface will almost instantly coagulate the fat on the bottom surface, which practically locks in the fat. That might be good for roasts, but not for bacon.



2. Use lower temperatures. The increases the time that the fat on the surface will take to coagulate, thus allowing more fat to drain off.



3. Drain the fat frequently. You do not want the bacon swimming in its own fat. If using a frying pan, use a spatula to hold the bacon in place while you pour the fat into a heat resistant container. (Make sure not to get any fat on the outside of the pan, as it could catch fire on the element). If using the oven, put your bacon on one of those trays that allows the fat to drain off, and put that on a baking sheet to catch the fat.



4. Cook smaller amounts at a time. This applies mostly to the frying pan method, as you will need to drain more frequently if you put more bacon in the pan. If you are cooking a lot of bacon, use the oven. If you are doing multiple batches in a frying pan, remember to rinse the pan with cold water between batches, so all bacon starts on a cold surface.

When frying bacon, it wants to stay soft because it's sitting in all that liquid fat.  Bacon needs a couple of minutes resting on paper towels to get "crispy". . .which, in my opinion (like yours) is the only way to eat it.



My preferred method to cooking bacon is wrapped in several paper towels and placed in the microwave (one minute per slice).  Let it sit for a minute, then give it another minute of cooking time.  Do a couple of trial runs to get it just the way you like it, but the paper towel wicks away the fatty moisture, leaving only the crispy, crunchy perfection of nearly-burnt pork candy (bacon).

Bake it in the oven.  Lay a single layer of bacon on a baking plan.  Set your oven to 375.  Watch the bacon because it will burn quickly.  You will get crispy bacon that is perfectly flat and straight.  Do not drain the fat while it's baking.  That's the key to cooking the bacon evenly.  I do this when I'm making bacon for cobb salad.  It's needs to be crisp!

my best advice is to get your steak from a reputable meat market.
There can be nothing worse than a bad cut of meat, and nothing left to be desired in an exquisite one.
Give it a garlic rub and make sure you know to what temperature he likes it prepared.
The side dishes may depend on what he likes.
I like asparagus on the grill with a couple of Portabella mushrooms...drizzled in olive oil with some salt and pepper.
Grab a nice red wine as well.

Gotta go with man food.  Steak, roast, etc..  If you don't know or are unsure about how to pick out a steak and cook one to perfection, you might try a pork loin.  They're really easy and taste great.  You can usually buy them already seasoned and all you have to do is bake it.  Side dish of some kind of potato - fried, baked, mashed, etc..  then a salad.  Everyone knows the only time a 'guy' eats salad is when he has it with meat!  Don't forget a hearty desert--apple pie would be good.--joe's wife

I like artichokes quite alot, in dips, salads, bruschetta, pizza, etc. However, preparing them from fresh whole artichokes has NEVER been something I have thought would be worth the trouble. Literally, I have never even tried it because I thought it would be too much of a pain. I find that the canned (or jarred) version satisfy my taste just fine. One of these days, I will try them the old-fashioned way just to see what they are like...if there is any significant improvement over the canned version...

look on the label of the container label. it should tell you how much in pounds it will hold. usually, 30 quarts will hold 30 pounds.



congrations on getting a container. it will keep the dog food fresh, prevent little beasties from getting in your house, and most important to me, you can control portion size instead of having the dog eating the whole thing at once.

just season your ribs with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. put them in a baking dish ( if you need to cut them it is ok). cover with one cup of sauce mixed with one cup of water. Cover dish with foil and bake at 350 degrees for one hour. Remove ribs and turn on your broiler. broil till ribs get some color, turn repeat. turn ribs and brush with bbq sauce, repeat on other side.

Go to foodnetwork.com and search Emeril Lagasse's rib recipes.  There are many to choose from.  Don't be discouraged by his recipes because he uses a lot of ingredients.  You will not be disappointed.  He has a great talent in blending multiple flavors which enhance one another resulting in awesome tasting food.  If the recipe calls for finishing off the ribs (baby back pork ribs are the best cut and worth the extra $) just use your broiler.  If you are pressed for time, you can always make the sauce a day ahead (which makes it taste better anyway).  You will not be disappointed!  Yum!

many of us think that boiling the meat first will tenderize it,what you want to do is steam the ribs in a pan throughout the primary cook time ,covered and with diluted sauce reducing then creates a carmalized glaze ready for the grill or broiler ,then turning and basting several times to keep moist you build a niece crunchy crust  in the same pan (drained of fat ) place ribs and pour sauce as u like  heat till bubbly and enjoy

* 5 cups sugar



* 1 cup water



* 6 tablespoons butter



* 1 cup cream, warmed if possible



Directions



Place sugar in a clean dry saucepan. Pour the water around the wall of the pan to avoid any splashing of sugar crystals onto the sides of the pan. Bring to a boil and continue cooking on high until amber colored. Turn heat off and with a wooden spoon, stir in the butter and then the cream. Pour into an 8 by 8-inch pan that has been lined with foil and well-buttered and let the caramel cool and set until firm. Once firm, cut into squares. Wrap in decorative clear plastic. Store at room temperature.

Why do milk gets spoilt even though it is boiled before?



boiling of milk kills the bacteria present in it and prevents it from spoiling.but why do we have to boil it again after few hours of storing(without using fridge) to prevent it from spoiling?if bacteria again enters the milk from where does it come as it was killed when we boiled it for the first time?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Bacteria are microorganisms and they are there everywhere in air, water, soil etc etc. When we boil the milk all the bacteria are killed. Then we keep the milk at room temperature. The milk cools down and then the surface of the milk which is in contact with the air permits the atmospheric bacteria to enter in the milk. The milk is an ideal environment for the luxurious and fast growth of the bacteria.  To stop this growth the milk needs to be boiled again if one wants to store the milk without refrigerator. If it is kept at cold temperature then the bacterial growth slows down and the milk remains good for more time.

Notes: Though you can’t rush this sauce, if it seems to be taking too long to thicken, stir in up to 1/4 cup cream cheese. Make sure your Parmesan or Romano is grated and not shredded; it won't melt properly if shredded. Do not use Kraft® Grated Parmesan in the canister

Here's how I do it:
1-2 slices of bacon
1 stick butter
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup finely shredded parmesan



Minced fresh garlic  (I like a lot, so i put about 5-7 cloves-you can vary yours to accommodate your tastes.)
Cracked black pepper (to taste)



Fry bacon until crisp, and set aside.  To the bacon grease add butter and saute garlic.  Add cream.  Add cheese.  Add pepper.  Once it is thick, creamy and gooey add your other meats or veggies- you can chop up the bacon and add if you like.  Add noodles and toss.



I would have the broccoli already cooked, so you are just adding to coat.  Shrimp cooks so quickly that it can be added raw.  Wait till the shrimp is about 95% done before adding noodles.

Simple things, in my opinion, because the bread is so yummy.



-Toasted with butter - my dad used to make this for me for breakfast when I was a kid and we called it "Best bread in the world toast"
-Sandwiches like: pastrami, chicken & pesto, anything really



-Toasted in the oven with Parmesan/Romano cheese on top
-With an olive or tomato bruschetta
-It's a great accompaniment, like rolls are, to any meal.

Ciabatta bread is great for paninis. Slice your bread in half, and lay on some ham, proscuitto, provolone, roasted red peppers, and some pesto, then weigh it down with a cast iron pan. Heat it in a non-stick pan with the cast iron one on top...it presses the sandwich together..gets crispy, and the cheese melts. Delicious!

You get a couple of cold pieces of KFC -whichever kind you like best, pull the meat off the bone and remove any gristle etc.and then you chop it up and add mayonnaise. Taste it (it'll already have a bunch of the Colonels spices) and add salt and pepper if you want. You can also add chopped celery, some mashed up hard boiled egg, a little mustard or hot sauce -go crazy with it if you want.



Me- I like it simple and slapped on two pieces of toast. Enjoy!

If you are in a hurry you can get the canned shredded chicken breast, drain it, add mayo, boiled eggs, celery and salt and pepper.  If you are not you can cook some white pieces of chicken and shred or chop.  Either way it turns out.....

I love salmon.  I want it simple, no fancy stuff.



My favorite way to prepare fillets is to saute them in butter and olive oil, seasoned with a little salt and pepper. Just before I pull them out of the pan I drizzle with lemon juice.  Depending on the thickness of your fillets, this will take from 3 to 7 minutes total cooking time.  If you cook it until it's firm to the touch--it's overcooked.



I sometimes serve  a sour cream dressing on the side, but that's to appease my husband who thinks you have to have something to punch up the salmon.  I'm happy with it's lovely delicate flavor.

I like fresh Salmon fillets on the grill.  I use tinfoil to place it on & butter (not margarine)  then I use mesquite seasoning.  Very yummy.  My kids prefer salmon to other fish when I make it this way.  It really doesn't take long to cook.  The biggest mistake people make when cooking fish is to over cook it.

On a cedar plank on the grill!  Rub the fillets with olive oil, salt and pepper and lemon juice. Fish should be removed from the heat source BEFORE it flakes easily with a fork.  Hope this helps!

Grate a bit of lemon zest and mix in a bowl with salt, pepper, minced garlic, and dill. Coat the salmon pave with it. Heat oil in a pan to about medium heat and slide in your pave. Brown on all sides then turn the heat down to low and allow to cook a bit, about 3 or 4 min so it doesnt dry out. It so easy, healthy and good! Serve with a lemon wedge and either some steamed veggies or rice pilaf!

If you cook it at 350 F then it is 20 minutes per pound - usually about an hour for a average chicken.  Use a meat thermometer to be safe.  It should reach an internal temperature of 170 F.

Burgundy or Shiraz for cooking?



I've got a choice of two wines I could cook with: a Burgundy (Pinot Noir type) or Shiraz (Cabernet Merlot type I think).  Which would be the better one for cooking with? (not interested in drinking this, only cooking with it!).  I am thinking of using it to marinade for a casserole, maybe beef, or in Italian meat sauce/ragout and/or woud welcome any other recipe ideas that are good for cooking using either of these red wines!

When cooking with wine, choose a wine thats not very good, especially if you are not going to drink it. When you cook it, the alcohol is cooked out and wheather its a good or bad wine, its going to taste almost the same when you have the finished product. I recommend to drink your burgundy or shiraz and use a different wine for your food. If you want to drink wine and cook with it, then go with a good burgundy. If not, dont waste good wine only to cook it away! Good luck!

Peking Ravioli is another name for the Chinese dumplings known as potstickers.  Pan-fried on the bottom and steamed on top, the dumplings are called potstickers because they tend to stick to the bottom of the pan.



The term Peking Ravioli was coined by well-known chef and restaurateur Joyce Chen coined in the 1950's.  Her restaurant was located in a largely Italian neighborhood, and she wanted a name that would help customers understand what the dumplings were like.  Today, many Chinese restaurants in Boston still use the term Peking Ravioli instead of potstickers.

1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup ground pork (not lean)
4 ounces shrimp meat, finely chopped
6 shelled and deveined prawns, finely chopped
5 water chestnuts, fresh or canned, finely chopped
4 tablespoons shredded carrot
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons minced green/spring onion
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Freshly ground black or white pepper, to taste



Preparation:
Lightly beat the egg with the salt. Place the pork in a bowl, add the shrimp, prawns, water chestnuts, carrot, cilantro, green onion, ginger, egg, soy sauce, sesame oil and pepper.



Place a small bowl of water on the work area. Lay out one of the gyoza wrappers in front of you.  Dip your finger in the water and moisten the edges of the wrapper.



Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.



Fold the gyoza wrapper over the filling and pinch the edges to seal it shut. (You may want to use a cornstarch/water mixture to make this easier).



Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or wok.When oil is ready, carefully add the dumplings and cook on high heat until golden brown (about 1 minute).



Without turning the dumplings over, add 1/2 cup of water and cover.  Cook for about 1 minute to cook the raw filling and then uncover and continue cooking until most of the liquid is absobred.



Serve the potstickers with the burnt side on top, with potsticker dipping sauce or soy sauce mixed with minced ginger for dipping.

This is an extremely hot salsa recipe ….use with Caution!!



I'm telling you it doesn't get any hotter than this. If heat is what you want then you are going to love this "Damn Good'n Hot Salsa".



Please don't serve it to your "chile tenderfoot" friends 'cause you might make them an enemy… remember revenge is swift.
Good'n Hot Salsa



8 Habanero Chiles, roasted, peeled, stems and seeds removed, finely diced



3 Roma tomatoes, finely diced



1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro



1/4 cup minced white onion



1/4 cup lime juice



Combine all the ingredients and let sit for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow the flavors to ripen…."yeah right" just get hotter you mean.



Yep!



Heat Scale: "Damn Hot"



Sure try this "Hot Salsa" Recipe with Jalapenos…sure to please and not near as toasty as the "Damn Good'n Hot Salsa. Hey you can simply start with only one of those Scotch Bonnet beauties still will get some heat…get out the tongue warming blanket.

Any salsa recipe can be made hotter or milder depending on the chiles you use and whether you add the pepper seeds or not.  If you want HOT, use habanero, complete with seeds but be warned that it will be quite hot - not just a little spicy.  You may want to start with just a bit of habanero and some jalapeno, give the flavors a chance to blend and then try it.  You can always add more pepper and seeds if you need more heat.

I know how to make potato cakes but it doesn't use flour at all! Only leftover cold mashed potatoes eggs, onions n salt/pepper...You can also do this with left over cream style corn, mackerel or salmon. Yummy! It's the way I've always done them, my grandma showed me how when I was a lil girl..
Make mashed potatoes, now they have to be cold, left over from the day before preferably. It's important that they are thick. Anyway add 2 or 3 eggs depending on how many potatoes you have. Saute some onion and drain oil, stir the cooked onions in there. Salt n pepper. Mix very well, if they are not sticking together then add more egg... Take a big spoon and sorta form a patty, put it in a hot skillet. Only enough oil to film the bottom, fry till firm and brown, flip and brown... You may add a lil oil per batch...

All you can do is add more liquid! Some people say that if you add a piece of bread or a potato, that they help absorb the salt but all they really do, is absorb liquid. Try adding beef or chicken stock (watch the salt content in that) to add flavor and not dilute it too much. Good luck!

try this no-bake cheesecake, it's the easiest thing i've ever made and i always get raves! just mix together 2 8-oz packages cream cheese (softened), 1 14-oz can sweetened condensed milk, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1 tsp vanilla. blend til smooth & pour into prepared graham cracker or oreo crust. (i like to make mini cheesecakes - instead of the crust, just line some muffin tins with paper cupcake liners & drop an oreo into each one.) cover & let set in the fridge or freezer & voila! cheap to make, but looks fancy & tastes awesome.



some other ideas are chocolate-dipped fruit, rice krispie treats, baked apples, worms & dirt, s'mores...don't be afraid to get creative! :-)

1 cup of peanut butter
1/2 cup of butter/margarine
1 cup chocolate chips



melt it together on the stove over low heat. stir a lot to make sure the bottom doesn't burn. when its melted and creamy looking, add a tablespoon of vanila. when it's blended in, pour into a pan and put in the fridge for an hour or so. cut into squares and savour!! :)



------------



or another idea is to cut up a couple apples into thin slices. lay flat in a pan/cookie sheet. rub a thin layer of butter/margarine on top, and then sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar. bake in the oven for about 10-15 minutes until soft and hot. tastes like apple pie but without a crust of course. awesome in a bowl with ice cream on top!!!

Saucepan or Pot

Large Bowl or Mixing Bowl



ingredients
Potatoes (4-6 medium-sized potatoes; more if the potatoes are small)



Butter (2-4 tbsp.)



Milk or Cream (1 cup, warm; milk is more common, but cream will make them, well, creamier)



Salt



Pepper



steps



Wash the potatoes by scrubbing rigorously. You can use a potato scrubber or your hands, but don't use soap. Running water will do just fine.



Remove the eyes of the potatoes with the tip of your potato peeler.



Peel the potatoes next.



If you're using red potatoes, you'll want to leave those skins on for some added texture and flavor.



Cut out bad spots that you find after peeling. They are easy to see because of their dark color.



Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise. Cut into quarters if desired.



Place in a saucepan or pot and cover with water. Add salt to the water, bring to a gentle boil and simmer for about 20-25 minutes. It's better to overcook than to undercook.



When potatoes are soft and a knife or fork can pierce through the center easily, drain the potatoes in a colander
step 2
Using a masher, potato ricer, or fork, begin a preliminary gentle mashing of the potatoes. You can also use an electric mixer if desired.



Add some butter and begin adding milk or cream in small amounts. Start with about 1/3 or 1/2 of the milk/cream, and slowly add more as necessary. Continue mashing until you've reached the desired fluffiness, smoothness and consistency.



Be careful not to overdo it with the mashing, as this will make them gummy and not fluffy.

you have to put you're own take on them.  Sure... boil them soft, add salt, pepper, butter (a lot), and milk.  Then throw some cheese, garlic, bacon, or anything you like (that would coexist with potatoes or course) And I would recommenced whipping everything in a mixer to infuse all the ingredients.  Sometimes manually mashing leaves lumps.

peel 4 med size potatoes, and cut into small pieces, boil them until they are tender when poked with a fork or knife.  Drain the water, and rinse a little to keep the mashed potatoes from becoming gummy.  Add 2-4 tablespoons of butter or margarine (butter tastes better) and about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of milk, salt and pepper to your taste, and mash them until all the lumps of potato are gone.

Try making the sauce from scratch.  When I cook Italian meals, I always make my own sauces (well..semi-homemade lol).  I buy Tomato sauce and depending on the dish, I'll use a bit of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  Then add herbs and spices from there.  You can read the ingredients labels on your regular store bought sauce to figure out the basics of what belongs.

Use some chicken stock in your sauce (instead of all the spices) – makes it taste home made.  Defiantly add shredded carrots and mushrooms.  Use a very cool plate and top it with FRESH grated parmesan – not the gritty bottled stuff from the grocery store!  Try using Gnocchi instead of pasta.  Add some crusty Italian bread torn into chunks with garlic flavored butter or even change things up and use those long skinny bread stix instead of traditional bread.  Make sure to pair it up with a fabulous wine like a lambrusco or a rosso.  And serve it up wearing something dashing!

Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used as a leavening agent in baking bread and related products, where it converts the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, eggs, or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Salt and fats such as butter slow down yeast growth. The majority of the yeast used in baking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the same species commonly used in alcoholic fermentation. Additionally, Saccharomyces exiguus (also known as S. minor) is a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains that is occasionally used for baking; it is not, however, generally used in a pure form, but comes from being propagated in a sourdough starter.

Yeast is a fungus that feeds on sugar. In dough, the yeast grows and multiplies using the sugar as food. The by-products of the yeast's metabolic process are alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. The alcohol evaporates when the bread is baked, the yeast is killed by the heat and the carbon dioxide is trapped as bubbles in the dough and causes the dough to expand like a sponge.

yeast is a living thing, like all living things it needs food  (sugar) warmth and moisture in the form of warm liquid eg milk. Not too hot though as this will kill it



Adding these things to yeast before you add it to the mixture and then letting the bread "prove" so the yeast grows and gives off gases this makes the bread rise

The correct culinary taught three step process is flour, egg, bread crumbs



I mix seasoning with my flour- depends on what I am breading- in what seasoning I will use



Milk and egg mix is great



Bread crumbs- seasoned or Panko is the way- but you could use corn meal



You should have 1 plate with plain product- 3 dipping vessels, and one tray for finished product-



You can take any or all of these and use them-

use boneless skinless chicken breasts. thin cut is best or cut them yourself after defrosting. scramble an egg. dip each piece in the egg then roll in breadcrumbs. place in a frying pan with heated oil at just above medium. only turn once. remove when browned on both sides (approx 5 minutes on each side). put on metal grate (not on paper towel) to let excess oil drain. it is great served with a honey mustard sauce. good luck.

Get 3 large bowls. In 1 put the an egg/milk mixture (3 or 4 eggs with jut enough milk to thin the eggs). In the second you put a flour mixture and any spices that you want that is not already in the bread crumbs. I like to put seasoning salt in it. In the third bowl you put the bread crumbs. I use Pregresso Italian Bread crumbs as they have a very nice flavor that does not over power the chicken.
I would dip the chicken in the flower then the the eggs then the bread crumbs. Some people will dip the chicken in the egg/milk and then the flour then the egg/milk then the bread crumbs. I think it is called double dipped. put the finished chicken on a tray or plate.



If you fry them do not over load the pan. They will not cook evenly. I like to use an electric frying pan it will keep a more constant heat the a burner from a stove.



If you bake them make sure to use an oven rack (that is sprayed with something like "Pam") in the tray you cook the in. That will cut down on the soggy breading.
Have fun and experiment, cooking can be very enjoyable and a good stress reliever.

Cream cheese is the THE CHEESE to use. You don't have to use PHILADELPHIA Brand you can use and generic brand - its just as good.
Also there are baked cheese cakes and no bake cheese cakes. A good website to use is allrecipes.com they have an abundance of cheese cake recipes and reviews for each one.

Whats in a Leon chicken wrap?



I'm a huge fan of Leon restaurants but there are only a handful in London and I live in Kent. I was wondering if anyone could tell me what goes into one of their chicken wraps so I can try and make one at home between fixes. There's a load of salad, and I think lime juice and maybe coriander in a dressing? Thanks.

note to andrew m
all vinegar is not mage from wine, some are made from cider, some from fuit, some from plain old barley and water, thenthey are all distilled, and left to react to obtain ethanol, which is what gives it the taste

1 pound bulk Italian sausage



1/2 cup warm water



1 cup sliced black olives



1 pinch basil



2 teaspoons garlic powder



1 tablespoon dried oregano



1 1/2 teaspoons dried sage



2 teaspoons ground black pepper



2 tablespoons minced garlic



1 tablespoon dried onion flakes



2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce



1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles



8 ounces ricotta cheese



1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded



DIRECTIONS
Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.



Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).



Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.



Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.



This one is my absolute favorite and can made without the sausage to make it veggie or with to make it meat! :-)

BEEF JERKY



4 pounds lean beef, sliced into 1/4" strips
1/2 tsp hickory or mesquite smoke flavoring
1/4 cup soy or teriyaki sauce
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp cracked black pepper
pinch of cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons molasses or brown sugar (optional)
1/2 cup barbecue sauce or ketchup



Choose lean beef only, as fat goes rancid when making jerky. Remove all fat from meat.
Beef top round, flank steak and rump work well. To make jerky that isn't hard to chew, slice across the grain no more than 1/4" thick and don't overdry it. If you freeze meat for a short time, not until it is frozen solid, but just until ice crystals form and meat can still be pierced easily with the point of a knife, then it will be easier to slice thinly. You can also use an electric slicer (Rival or Chef's Choice make home type slicers if you'll be making a lot of jerky).



Combine ingredients and marinate meat in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours, stirring occasionally. Be sure marinade gets between the slices and covers the meat.



Drain liquid and place in smoker, oven, or food dehydrator at 160-180°F. Turn when dripping stops. They are ready when jerky is dry enough to easily break off a portion, but still has enough resilience to crack when bent, but not break (4-8 hours). It should not be tough and leathery.



It's important to store jerky away from humidity. Let cool completely before packaging. Seal up in Food Saver bags, canning jars or use Press-N-Seal or aluminum foil to keep away air and humidity. If you won't be using right away, store in the refrigerator to preserve freshness longer, but jerky can be kept without refrigeration.



Note: Sodium Nitrate (curing salt) can be used to enhance preservative qualities, but is not required. If used, add 3/4 teaspoon to the above recipe or follow directions on package.

Alton Brown's is the best and the best method.



*  1 1/2 to 2 pounds flank steak



* 2/3 cup Worcestershire sauce



* 2/3 cup soy sauce



* 1 tablespoon honey



* 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper



* 2 teaspoons onion powder



* 1 teaspoon liquid smoke



* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes



* Special Equipment: 1 box fan, 4 paper air-conditioning filters, and 2 bungee cords.



Trim the flank steak of any excess fat, place in a zip-top bag, and place it in the freezer for 1 to 2 hours in order to firm up.



Remove the steak from the freezer and thinly slice the meat with the grain, into long strips.



Place the strips of meat along with all of the remaining ingredients into a large, 1-gallon plastic zip-top bag and move around to evenly distribute all of the ingredients. Place the bag into the refrigerator for 3 to 6 hours.



Remove the meat from the brine and pat dry. Evenly distribute the strips of meat onto 3 of the air filters, laying them in the grooves and then stacking the filters on top of one another. Top these with 1 empty filter. Next, lay the box fan on its side and lay the filters on top of it. Strap the filters to the fan with 2 bungee cords. Stand the fan upright, plug in and set to medium. Allow the meat dry for 8 to 12 hours. If using a commercial dehydrator, follow the manufacturer's directions.



Once dry, store in a cool dry place, in an airtight container for 2 to 3 months.

I had this several times while on vacation in Germany/Austria. It's delicious! If you can't find Speck you can use bacon, proscuitto or pancetta. Also, you can use vegetable oil in place of the lard. Just add a tablespoon at a time, as you need it, for browning etc.

All Butter Crust for Sweet and Savory Pies (Pâte Brisée)



2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling



1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes



1 teaspoon salt



1 teaspoon sugar



4 to 6 Tbsp ice water



Method
Cut the sticks of butter into 1/2-inch cubes and place in the freezer for 15 minutes to an hour (the longer the better) so that they become thoroughly chilled.



Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor; pulse to mix. Add butter and pulse 6 to 8 times, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with pea size pieces of butter. Add ice water 1 Tbsp at a time, pulsing until mixture just begins to clump together. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready. If the dough doesn't hold together, add a little more water and pulse again.



Remove dough from machine and place in a mound on a clean surface. Gently shape into 2 discs. Knead the dough just enough to form the discs, do not over-knead. You should be able to see little bits of butter in the dough. These small chunks of butter are what will allow the resulting crust to be flaky. Sprinkle a little flour around the discs. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days.



Remove one crust disk from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes in order to soften just enough to make rolling out a bit easier. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick. As you roll out the dough, check if the dough is sticking to the surface below. If necessary, add a few sprinkles of flour under the dough to keep the dough from sticking. Carefully place onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Use a pair of kitchen scissors to trim the dough to within 1/2 inch of the edge of the pie dish.



Add filling to the pie.



Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently place onto the top of the filling in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang. Fold the edge of the top piece of dough over and under the edge of the bottom piece of dough, pressing together. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork. Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking pie can escape.

Food temperatures are considered critical between 40-140 degrees F.
If they remain in this temperature zone for more then 4 hours it is considered dangerous because bacteria grows exponentially in this zone.  If you put something in the fridge hot there is a very good chance it will stay in this critical zone for that amount of time.  When below 40 it greatly slows growth, freezing even more so.  But does not kill bacteria, causing eventual spoilage.  Heating foods above 140 kills bacteria.  That's why many recipes say to cook to at least 160, just to be extra safe.

The reason is that the heat in the food brings the ambient temperature of the refrigerator down.  Depending on how hot the food is, that may actually make other things more likely to spoil  Say you put a dish of hot soup next to a carton of milk.  It may bring down the temperature of the milk enough that bacteria begins to grow in the milk.  Then the milk might spoil by the next day, even though the soup will be fine.  So, it's better to leave the soup out for an hour or so, until it has come down to room temperature.  Then put it in the fridge.  That way it won't ruin anything that's cold in the fridge.

Because the temperature of that warm/hot food starts to warm nearby food items in the refrigerator. It can spoil items that contain proteins (eggs, dairy, etc) and cause those items to grow bacteria that normally wouldn't in a cold refrigerator. Plus, those hot foods, which would probably be wrapped in plastic or foil have a greater chance of developing bacteria since the core will end up taking much, much longer to cool down.

It's best to let food cool off quite a bit before putting it in the fridge, if it is very big (such as a casserole,) because the heat from the food can raise the temperature of the entire refrigerator, possibly bringing others foods to an unsafe temperature.

Yes.  It warms up the interior of the fridge and causes it to run excessively in order to cool down again, increasing electrical usage.  The recommended course of action is to allow the food to almost totally cool, then place in the fridge.

The hot food can warm up the interior of the fridge, brining other foods into an unsafe temperature range.



The hot food can also take longer than anticipated to cool off, keeping it in an unsafe temp range.

Place the rice in a mixing bowl and use your fingers to separate the grains until they are loose. Set aside. Lightly beat the eggs and sherry together with a fork or chopsticks. Set aside.



Heat the oil in a wok or stir-fry pan over high heat. When the oil is hot, stir in the onions and the eggs. Scramble until the eggs re dry and break into small pieces.



Add the rice, salt, ham, and peas and stir constantly until the ingredients are well blended and heated through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Serves 3 to 5.



Note: I have used thawed frozen peas in a pinch. They don't taste quite as good as the snow peas but they will work.

yes, you boil it, using exactly double the amount of water as rice. white rice takes about 15-20 mins, as does jasmine or basmati. brown rice takes about 40. and you don't boil it hard, you simmer it as gently as possible, just hot enough to bubble. to make fried rice you do the above, then fry it hard in a pan with plenty of oil. if you're adding veggies get them frying first. season with soy, red pepper, sesame oil, five-spice powder, garlic, ginger, whatever you like. plain rice has like 160 calories per serving. the oil adds about another 60-80 depending how much.

I think the trick is when you boil the rice, put less water. That way, it'll keep the rice dry and perfect to have it fried on pan.



The typical yellowish color of fried rice comes from eggs. So you just have to fry the rice with mixed eggs and add anything you that you prefer (shrimps, peas.. etc)

To make 'boiled' long grain white rice, use twice as much water as you use dry rice.  Put both into the water at the same time, apply heat.  When the water is boiling, turn it down to simmer, cover, and cook for twenty minutes.  Take the lid off and if there is still visible water, let it continue to cook until you can't see any.
To make fried rice you need a wok or slope sided fry pan.  Put one tablespoon of good oil (use canola or plain olive oil) into the pan and heat to 'high' then add the rice and stir like crazy.  Have a well beaten egg to which you have added an 'egg worth' of water and cooked and sliced before (fry it in as little oil as possible).  Add the egg right before taking it off the heat.
Since you don't like vegetables, try making what I fondly call 'mess' ... go to the grocery store and buy a small amount of every vegetable you hate.  Take them home and chop them into small cubes.  Put a tiny bit of oil into a slope sided pan and heat.  Add a mixture of the vegetables you hate.  Add a bit of soy sauce at the end.  Serve beside the fried rice.  Believe it or not, when you taste the 'mess' you'll find that you do like vegetables, especially mixed and cooked properly.



White rice is far more fattening than brown rice.  You can make brown rice (follow the directions on the package) and fry it or eat it 'plain' with a bit of butter and salt and pepper or soy sauce.  Also try eating the vegetables raw ... you can eat virtually every vegetable raw, but cut them up and arrange them to make a 'pleasant looking' plate, and have some 'dip' for them.  Use non-fat sour cream to make the dip so you don't get too fat.



I don't know how many calories are in plain cooked rice or fried rice, but I do know there are fewer calories if you use brown rice instead of white rice.  You should also include some beans ... red kidney beans, black beans, even pinto beans ... if you want a 'complete protein.'  Also get some edamame (soy beans) or some tofu (I use 'firm') for more protein.  Don't eat much bread or rolls except 'whole grain' or 'multi-grain.'



There are three types of rice.  Long grain white (jasmine or basmati taste best, with a 'flowery' aftertaste that is quite pleasant.  Short grain rice (the 'sticky' rice used to make sushi and sashimi).  Brown rice ... it's the whole rice kernel, not the 'white' inner part used to make white rice, so there is more fiber to it and fewer calories.



I hope this helped ... and do try the 'mess.'  I had a friend who had three sons who HATED vegetables.  I got a list of all the veg they wouldn't eat, took that to the store and made 'mess' with some stewing beef added.  All three sons ate every bit and asked for seconds and thirds.  They asked for the recipe for their mom.  I smiled and handed them the 'list of stuff we hate' and said 'That's what you ate for supper tonight.'  They were very surprised, and went to the store with their mom to be sure she got the 'wrong now right' vegetables the next time she shopped.

Probably because it's a viscous liquid and a thin sharp solid.



To keep it from happening, crack your eggs on a flat surface, not on the edge of a bowl or other sharp corner. This will keep the shell from splitting into the egg. Rotate the egg after tapping it on the counter to get an even split around the egg. When opening the egg, don't shove your fingers into it. Just pull apart the edges.



To get the shell pieces out, I've heard that using half of the shell itself makes it easy to retrieve. I've never really had much luck with this. You can always use a strainer.

It has something to do with the oils in your hands and the egg white but I don't know how to explain that part.



When you do drop some shell into your bowl, use the egg shell a the scoop to get it out.



Also for this reason, you should use a separate bowl to break the eggs into.

I always crack eggs into a separate bowl  - one time I added the 3rd egg to a cake mix only to discover the egg was bloody -- yuck!  I had to throw everything away.  So, I have always cracked eggs individually into a separate bowl.  If you do get a little piece of shell in the egg, use the shell you have left to scoop out the shell in the bowl.  I don't know why this works, but it is like a magnet.

first of all, if you're getting a lot of shell in your eggs, crack them more gently.  You're only trying to CRACK the egg... NOT smash it.  I have a cook in my kitchen who does this all the time. Whack! half way through the egg on the edge of the bowl.  All you have to do it TAP it as you turn it a little until you can pull it open.  Practice.



Now.. until you get the hang of cracking the egg... use one of the larger pieces of eggshell to scoop out the bits.  it's about the only thing that does it first try.  Weird, I know.  It's hard to pick the shells out because the whites are slippery and the use of a piece of shell can pierce the slick whites.

Do not put them in the refrigerator. Keep them in original package and away from dampness. Cold and damp makes them go bad faster. In hard times potatoes are a staple because they are nutritious and can be kept longer without refrigeration.

Dizzy106, basically you have been steered on the right path, depending on how many people your serving, I allow half a table spoon per person, plus a half. in a small glass measuring jug I give it a little burst in the microwave just to remove the fridge chill.



If it's the one in the bottle, give it a shake so you stir up the mint leaves that have settled to the bottom.



Serve in a gravy boat with a serving spoon, or you can add mint sauce at the table over the meat, don't over sauce the meat or you will loose the flavor of the lamb.



Enjoy

Sorry John- I must disagree with you. My Grandmother made the best lamb ever. She's now passed. But she did tell me how she did it. She stuffed the lamb with garlic much like any roast- salt and pepper and then used the mint jelly sauce as a baste. Use hot water to dissolve the jelly keeping it in a cup off the side. Every once in a while basting with he fresh liquid and also the pan drippins. Extra mint jelly at the table for condiment sake, but no one ever used it!!  I've even heard family members that did not know this secret claim that they did not like mint jelly at all-because Grams was just so good the way she cooked it!!

Go simple....Pound the chicken between wax paper.  If you don't have a specialized tool, use something around the house like a wine bottle or can of veggies.  Hit it until it its about 1/2 inch thick.  Spray a pan with cooking spray or put a little olive oil in it.  Heat the pan over medium heat.  Meanwhile put a little salt and pepper on the meat (or lemon pepper seasoning if you like).  Put meat in the pan.  Brown until the pink disappears on the edges and remains in the center. Flip and cook about 2 more minutes.  You can top it with bbq sauce or even leave it plain.  Serve with salad and baked potato.



You could also get some potatoes, cut them up in 1 inch chunks, put in a ziploc bag with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Bake them on 350 for 20 minutes.



Hope you enjoy!

You can try making Orange Chicken!



Orange Chicken (serves 2)



1 tablespoon butter



2 skinless boneless chicken breast halves (~175g each)



1 tablespoon all-purpose flour



1/2 cup orange juice



1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or more to taste



Salt and pepper to taste



In a large heavy skillet, melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts in a single layer. Cook till golden on one side, 1 to 2 minutes; turn and cook till golden on the other, about 3 minutes total time.



Reduce the heat to low and cook till the chicken is done, 6 to 8 minutes, depending upon how thick the breasts are. Do not overcook.



While the chicken is cooking, in a medium saucepan, melt remaining butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until well blended.



Gradually stir in the orange juice and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 -3 minutes. Add the lemon juice and stir until combined. Season well with salt and pepper.



Arrange the chicken breasts on a platter and pour the orange sauce over them. Serve with roast potatoes or fresh salad greens.



If not, you can always make some spaghetti by buying store-bought pasta sauce and just dice the chicken breast up and add fry it with the ground beef in chopped onion and garlic before adding in the pasta sauce. Serve with cooked pasta.

Stand: 10 minutes
Serves: 4



Ingredients:



1 can (10 3/4 ounces) Campbell's® Condensed Cream of Chicken Soup (Regular or 98% Fat Free)
1 1/3 cups water
3/4 cup uncooked regular long-grain white rice
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper

Bake for 50 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender. Top with the cheese. Let the casserole stand for 10 minutes. Stir the rice before serving.

There is a recipe on the Minute Rice box for chicken and rice.



Basically you cook the chicken in some canola oil about 10 minutes or until tender.
Then add 2 Tbsp. of the oil into a stewer or skillet. Add in 1- 10 ounce can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of uncooked Minute Rice and bring to a boil on medium high. Then add the chicken pieces (about 2 pounds cut up) then cover and reduce heat to medium-low and cook about 10 minutes. Stir it frequently.



Then you can cook some green beans for a side dish.

oh you could make anything with chicken breast. honestly thats all i ever cook for my husband and myself because its so versatile.



you could probably make quesadillas and that would be a hit with your roomies. all you need is some tortillas, a frying pan, some cheese, sour cream, and salsa. its pretty easy and not too expensive. also look into casseroles. campbells has some pretty good ones like chicken and rice casseroles that you really only need rice, cheese, chicken and maybe a can of cream of chicken soup.



i really like the website www.allrecipes.com  i find a lot of good stuff there and the recipes are rated by those who make them so you can see what others think.

chicken in lemon butter sauce. it's very simple...



slice chicken in bite sizes (like chicken nuggets). dip chicken in egg (slightly beaten) & dredge with flour/cornstarch. fry in a pan over medium heat (you don't have to deep fry although deep frying would be good) until golden. set aside.



for the sauce, saute about a tablespoon of minced garlic on 1 or 1 1/2 tbsp of unsalted butter. once butter turns gold (not brown you don't want your garlic burnt), squeeze in juice from half a lemon (large one). add a tsp of surgar. salt & pepper to taste.



you can either mix in the fried chicken pieces into the sauce or just put the sauce on the chicken slices.

Cook the chicken breasts in a skillet with a little oil about 4 minutes per side on medium heat. Add one chopped onion, cook briefly and add 1 cup of chicken broth. Cook about 3 minutes then add one jar of spaghetti sauce. Turn heat to low, cover and let simmer until chicken is done, approximately 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook some spaghetti following directions on the box. Drain the pasta and serve the chicken and sauce over the pasta.  Add some bagged salad and Italian bread and there’s a meal.

If it is boneless chicken try cutting into small chunks and cooking in a hot pan.  Then mix a little oil and some peanut butter with hot sauce to your ability to stand.  This will make a quick peanut sauce (satay) which you mix with the chicken.  Put over some noodles and put a little broccoli on the side.  Very asian

Chocolate Truffle recipe?



So, this summer I spent my time working in a kitchen at a bible camp, and we made these amazing truffles for the tea-parties we held every week. And I remember they started with a cake mix, baked in a loaf pan, then, when it cooled, we crumbled it, and mixed it with some other ingredients over heat, but I don't remember what they were, I think they were like cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and butter, but I'm not quite sure, Then they were covered in melted chocolate on teh outside. Anyone have a recipe like this? Please help me! I'm making them for a New mother and her family!

crushed graham crackers
crushed peanuts
cocoa powder
butter (softened)
condensed milk (it's the thick sticky one) - if this is not available, then you'll need white/powdered sugar and a some more butter to hold everything together.



all you have to do is mix a certain proportion of everything until everything holds together. and yup you may coat them with melted chocolate or confectioners sugar or simply serve it cooled.

I bake a 20-pound turkey at 325 degrees for about 4-5 hours.  Longer if you have stuffing in the turkey.  I usually check by sticking a fork in the thigh -- juices should run clear, not any blood.  And if you wiggle the turkey leg, it should feel as though you could easily pull it off.  I never go by minutes per pound -- it varies so much and it depends on the turkey -- large thighs, small breast, etc.  Also, if it starts to brown too much before it is done, just cover the breast area with aluminum foil.

I actually put my turkey in around 9pm the night before on low like 200 swamped in fluids, I use a ton of chicken or turkey broth along with a bit of cajun spices and I bake it through the night.  When I get up in the morning I add more broth.  About an hour before we eat I take the lid off the turkey and turn up the heat, so that we have a nice crunchy skin.  I have REALLY moist turkey by noon that day.  However, at that point we have to almost ladle it out instead of carving it we really like the moistness of our turkey instead of how pretty it looks.

To safely thaw out egg yolks, they should be thawed in the fridge. Plan to place them in the fridge a day (not more, not less) ahead before you use them in baking. If they are left in the fridge longer, the yolks will become thick and lumpy, and difficult to blend with other ingredients.
Hopefully, prior to freezing, you have whisked the egg yolks together, and added sugar or salt to protect them from becoming a thick, dense, unusuable mass once they are thawed.



I am not sure what would happen if you add egg yolks (instead of egg whites) Angel food cake batter, but I bet you'd end up with something similar to Classic Yellow cake- but with a lighter texture. You might need to incorporate some leavener like baking powder and/or baking soda to the cake batter to compensate for the volume that the egg whites contribute to light and airy textured cake.

Egg yolks have fat in them.  IF you put them in anglefood cake they will destroy the cake and the froth will not stay in place.

Ingredients



* 1 3/4 cups sugar



* 1/4 teaspoon salt



* 1 cup cake flour, sifted



* 12 egg whites (the closer to room temperature the better)



* 1/3 cup warm water



* 1 teaspoon orange extract, or extract of your choice



* 1 1/2 teaspoons cream of tartar



Directions



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.



In a food processor spin sugar about 2 minutes until it is superfine. Sift half of the sugar with the salt the cake flour, setting the remaining sugar aside.



In a large bowl, use a balloon whisk to thoroughly combine egg whites, water, orange extract, and cream of tartar. After 2 minutes, switch to a hand mixer. Slowly sift the reserved sugar, beating continuously at medium speed. Once you have achieved medium peaks, sift enough of the flour mixture in to dust the top of the foam. Using a spatula fold in gently. Continue until all of the flour mixture is incorporated.



Carefully spoon mixture into an ungreased tube pan. Bake for 35 minutes before checking for doneness with a wooden skewer. (When inserted halfway between the inner and outer wall, the skewer should come out dry).



Cool upside down on cooling rack for at least an hour before removing from pan.



Cook's Note: Since they're easier to separate use the freshest eggs you can get.

Ingredients



* 3/4 cup whole milk ricotta cheese



* 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese



* 1 large egg yolk



* 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, plus more for dusting



* 8 ounces frozen strawberries, thawed



* 2 tablespoons sugar



* 2/3 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (recommended: Nutella), at room temperature



* 3 tablespoons whipping cream, at room temperature



* 6 (2-ounce) pieces homemade or purchased pizza dough, cold



* 1 large egg, beaten to blend



Directions



Blend the ricotta, mascarpone, egg yolk, and powdered sugar in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Transfer the ricotta mixture to a small bowl, then cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.



Meanwhile, blend the strawberries and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a clean food processor until smooth. Transfer the strawberry sauce to a small bowl and set aside.



Whisk the chocolate-hazelnut spread and cream in a medium bowl to blend.



Position the oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.



Line a heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out each piece of pizza dough into a 7-inch-diameter round. Spoon the ricotta mixture atop the center of the lower half of each pizza dough. Spoon the chocolate-hazelnut mixture atop the cheese mixture. Brush the lower edges of the dough with egg wash. Fold the plain dough halves over the filling, forming half circles. Pinch the edges of dough firmly together to seal. Using a pastry wheel, trim the edges. Transfer the calzones to the prepared baking sheet, spacing evenly.



Brush the tops of the calzones with more egg wash. Bake until the calzones puff and become golden brown, about 10 minutes. T

Angel Food cakes do NOT have egg yolks in them.  Then you'd have either a Chiffon or Sponge cake, and the baking directions are different.  Just put them in with other eggs and make scrambled eggs, or an omelet ... make custard or pudding ... make an egg bread and add extra yolks......

As long as its some kind of cooking oil then you can use anything you want. Olive oil tastes nasty to me. There is no reason to use anything but generic vegetable oil in anything unless you specifically want the taste of the oil.

A 4 lb. beef pot roast should cook 35 minutes after pressure is achieved, and then allowed to cool down on it's own, another 20 or so minutes.  A rolled rib of beef would go 8-10 minutes per lb. for rare meat, 10-12 minutes per lb. for medium meat, and 12-15 minutes per lb. for well done meat.  Allow to cool on own, not with cold water. Corned beef (4 lbs.) requires longer cooking.  Place it on a meat rack and cook 40-50 minutes after pressure is achieved.  Cool on own. 2 lbs. of short ribs....25 minutes.  Whereas swiss steak, 2 lbs, cut in one inch pieces, 15 minutes.  Hamburger patties, 5 minutes.  Meat balls, 15 minutes.  Cool all on own.  2 lb. meat loaf, 15 minutes after pressure achieved.  Have fun!  I love my pressure cooker for great, quick flavorful meals.  Oh, just to add, most of the meats require between 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup water, except the corned beef....2 cups of water.

I don't like strawberry sauce with brownies, but raspberry sauce with brownies is amazing. Just take some sugar and some frozen raspberries and cook it down on the stovetop until it's hot and bubbly and syrupy. Keep stirring and don't have the heat up past medium or it could burn.



Another possibility is caramel sauce: sugar with a little bit of water (just enough to wet it really) cooked until it turns golden brown, add butter and cream when you take it off the stove.



Or beat butter, powdered sugar, and cocoa together for an easy chocolate frosting.



Or you could just melt some marshmallows on top. Sprinkle them on right before the brownies are done, return them to the oven (top rack this time), switch to the broiler and wait for them to turn melty and golden.

You shouldn't have to cook it for that long if it's only 1.5 lbs. I would try maybe 4 hours.



And I would add the cup of water and if you see it's starting to get dry, add some more. I hate cooking pot roast in the slow cooker because of all the juice that's left over but that's just my prefrence.

If you are going to leave it all day while you are at work leave it on low and if it sits 6 to 8 hours on low it will be fine



I usually put all my stuff in the pot then dump the seasoning and water on top. The water will cook out of the veggies and meat too so a cup of water should be good! Dont worry about it the slow cooker does all the work

is this your first time using a slow cooker?  if it is cook something else first.  Seriously, dont ruin a pot roast in a slow cooker that isnt slow.  I found out the hard way that my slow cooker will bring water to a rolling boil on the low setting.  Not good for long slow cooking but good for large orders of soup.  Put two or three cups of water in your cooker and check out the temps at 15 minute intervals.



In my properly working other slow cooker I do pot roasts with a can of cream of mushroom soup and toss in chumked potatoes 1/2 hour before serving.  Meat, taters n gravy all in one.

Place the roast in the crockpot, the veggies around it evenly, and then personally, I like to mix the lipton onion soup mix in a measuring cup FIRST with one cup of warm water.  This will ensure the onion and seasonings are evenly distributed and you don't have just a plunk of seasoning on the top of your roast.  Pour the liquid over the top of everything, then leave on low for 6 to 7 hours.  ALSO...I always set a plexi-glass cutting board under my crockpot...just so it doesn't get TOO hot and burn my countertop.



Good luck and YUM!!  Sounds like the perfect meal!!

Tonight is Wednesday night and we usually have "catch-as-catch-can"  meals. I try and do quick meals since it's just myself and my older son. We love healthy wraps with a bowl of pears on the side. Here are a few recipes for wraps:



Asian Chicken Salad Wrap



3 1/2 cups cooked, shredded chicken
4 green onions, chopped
2 cups bean sprouts, rinsed, drained
1 large carrot, grated
1/2 cup chopped cilantro
1/4 cup each: chopped basil, chopped dry-roasted peanuts
3/4 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons bottled sweet and sour sauce
Juice of 1 lime
6 each: 12-inch flour tortillas, Boston lettuce leaves



Combine chicken, onions, sprouts, carrot, cilantro, basil and peanuts in medium bowl; set aside. Mix together mayonnaise, sweet and sour sauce and lime juice in small bowl. Pour dressing over chicken mixture; toss to combine.
Heat tortillas, turning every few seconds, in skillet over medium heat until hot. Or, microwave between sheets of paper toweling until hot, about 20 seconds. Place lettuce leaf in center of tortilla; top with chicken salad. Fold over 2 sides; roll up.



Here are a couple more: 2 Quick Picnic Wraps

These are especially good healthy choices for the holidays when we get busy with meal planning. The kids can make these for themselves.



Enjoy!

Cookies, cupcakes and brownies are smart because they're individual eats. My favorite cookie is peanut butter blossoms, the no bake kind.



All you do is mix peanut butter chips and sweetened condensed milk and microwave and stir until smooth. Refrigerate over night. Then in the morning, scoop out bits, roll into balls, roll through white granulated sugar. Then push a Hershey Kiss into the center of the peanut butter ball. They're really good and pretty easy

Give him a little garlic in his food every day. Garlic is a Natural Anti-biotic that would ward off infections and colds in the long run.
If you have to, sneak it in to his dinner without him knowing.



Also try give him a regular dose of Cumin and Cinnamon.



More importantly, get him to stop drinking and smoking, that in it self would go a long way in restoring his Masculine ability.

chicken is healthy when its grilled. If it's fried it has all the extra fat and oil. Turkey is also healthy because it is baked. You just have to be careful with what you eat with them.

This is simple, yet unusual;



Bread Fritters;
Go to the bakery section of the store where you normally buy bread.
Ask the baker for an "unbaked" loaf of bread.
He must put exactly the same amount of dough he would have used to bake a bread with in to a plastic bag for you, and it would cost no more than a loaf of bread.



Take that home and in a pot warm some cooking oil to about half the depth of the pot. (Smaller pots take less oil than bigger ones do)...
The oil temperature should be medium hot. (About half the heat that the stove plate will go)



Now cut from the unbaked dough a slice about the size of your palm, and with a little water on your fingers (to prevent the dough from sticking to your hand), stretch out the dough in all directions until it is about the size of your whole hand including the fingers. That brings the cutting of dough to about twice the size it was when you cut it....



Now with care, drop the stretched out dough in to the hot oil.
It would rise almost instantly.
Fry it in the oil until it is golden brown all over, taking care to turn it over occasionally.
It would be puffy and crisp when done.



With a large ladle or sieve, scoop out the bread fritter and place on an absorbent kitchen towel to rid it of most of the oil still on it.
Repeat this process until all the dough is done.



These bread fritters are extremely filling, and can be cut open and filled with almost anything from grated cheese to minced meat to cold processed meat, syrup or jam.
Try it, you will probably have some left over for two or three days, which you can take to work if you like....
Bread fritters can be frozen and warmed up again if you have made too much, but the dough cannot, so rather make the whole lot and freeze what is left over for another day. If you decide to freeze them, do so without a filling. Fillings should always be made fresh.

I'm looking for an old recipe for chicken hash?



I remember that you boil a whole chicken, strip the meat off the bone return to the pot, add potatoes,onions and salt and pepper. That's all I can remember! The old gentleman that  made this for me when I was young never gave me the recipe and he has been gone for many years,he always told me his mother made it for him. Can anyone help me find this recipe?

<answer>



Just use a basic hash recipe like this, which works for any meat
To make the hash. Sweat the chopped shallots in a little of the olive oil until tender. Scoop the potato flesh from the skins of cooked baked potatoes and mix it with the cooked shallots and slow cooked chicken or duck leg meat and a knob of melted butter. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Divide the hash mix into four and press into buttered rectangular or round moulds, or simply shape into cakes. Fry in butter until golden brown before turning each and roasting in the oven for 8-10 minutes

just use one of them, go for the flavor you really want, both of them are really aromatics, their flavor profile might not complement each other. You may add a little  coffee as a secondary flavor and also try to substitute half of the sugar you use with brown sugar or if you could get "mascovado" (raw brown sugar), it has a more distinct  aroma than regular table brown sugar. Do not substitute entirely with brown sugar coz the cookie might get soft and chewy. Lastly, you may want to bake it on an oven that uses charcoal or fire wood to give it a smokey hint but i think this is a long shot in your area... maybe you can add a little smoke flavor to your batter...

Not much or they wont be sugar cookies.  That's the way "sugar cookies" taste.  It's a shortbread cookie sprinkled with sugar.



You can flavor them with extract, as mentioned above.  Usually after you use the extract, they're named for the fllavor, such as almond cookies, lemon cookies, etc.

I love this recipe and it really does work everytime:



Burnt Cambridge Cream



Ingredients
685ml double cream, or equal amounts double and single cream
4 large egg yolks, beaten
60-90g caster sugar



Method
1. Heat the cream in a saucepan and boil for about 30 seconds before pouring immediately onto the egg yolks and whisk together.



2. Return the mixture to the pan and continue cooking without allowing it to boil. Stir the mixture continually until it thickens and coats the spoon, then pour into a shallow baking dish. Leave to cool completely and refrigerate overnight.



3. Two hours before the meal, sprinkle the chilled cream with an even layer of sugar and place it under a preheated grill on a maximum setting. The sugar will caramelise to a smooth brown crust. You may need to turn the dish in the grill to achieve an even colouring. It is important that this step is done very quickly in order to keep the custard cold and firm and the top crisp and brown.



4. Return to the fridge and chill before serving.



I bought a mini creme brulee torch from a hardware store and it works really well to get an even, golden top. Enjoy!

Jacket Potatoes



Could there possibly be anyone in the wide world who doesn't drool at the thought of jacket potatoes with really crisp, crunchy skins and fluffy, floury insides with something lovely melted into them? I'm not speaking of the insipid microwave versions of convenience fame, but the hallowed, reverenced beauty of the real thing. Life is too short, and therefore we need to savour every moment by spoiling ourselves with what is best and not some pale imitation that fails to satisfy. If you ever feel like treating yourself and want something supremely soothing and comforting that costs almost nothing (forget chocolate bars and the like), just bake yourself the biggest potato you can lay your hands on (see the method below), then cut it in half and, as you do, listen carefully to the inviting crackle and crunch of the skin as the knife goes in. Next, with a fork, fluff the floury insides, then add a generous amount of butter and watch it melt and disappear into the clouds of fluffiness. Add rock salt and crushed black pepper, then eat and savour it alone in all its humble, simple glory. The secret of perfect jacket potatoes like the one described above is not to hurry them – give them up to 2 hours to get the really crunchy skin, learn to use the time when you're out, so they can be ready when you come home, or go and do something else and forget about them till they're ready. Below I have included the master recipe, and this is followed by some ideas for fillings and toppings.



Serves 2
Ingredients



2 large Desirée potatoes, 8-10 oz (225-275 g) each
a little olive oil
rock salt, crushed
a little butter
salt and freshly milled black pepper



Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 5, 375°F (190°C).



First you need to wash the potatoes and dry them very thoroughly with a cloth, then leave them aside to dry as much as possible. If you're using ready-washed potatoes you need not do this, as the high heat will purify them. Next, prick the skins a few times with a fork, then put a few drops of olive oil over each one and rub it all over the skin. After that, rub in some crushed salt – this will draw out the moisture from the skin and, together with the oil, provide more crunchiness.



Now place the potatoes straight on to the centre shelf of the oven and let them bake for 1¾-2 hours, or until the skins are really crisp.



When you are ready to serve, slit each potato in half lengthways and top with the butter and seasoning. Serve immediately because, after you remove jacket potatoes from the oven, they lose their crispness very quickly, so don't let them hang around.

It tastes better fried for sure and is low fat, good for protein and a nice alternative for vegans and veggies to meat. It's better for women than men though as soya mimics a female hormone. That's why it helps women with menopause etc..

Tofu is a very good source of cholesterol-free protein.  Very fresh tofu is nice raw, chilled, served with a sprinkling of yuzu zest, bonito flakes and a generous swirl of soy sauce.  It can also be added to hot miso soup (or other soups) towards the end of cooking time, just to heat through.  Or marinated and stir-fried with veg.
There is some controversy re soy's effect on hormones: it is sometimes recommended for perimenopause (reduces hot flushes), but too much may hinder some types of thyroid function and possibly male fertility.  Whole-food soy products such as tofu are less likely to cause such problems than isolates in pills (e.g. isoflavones).

Something really dry like a Sauvignon Blanc. There are a few really good New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs under $10 that are aged in steel drums rather oak barrels. They are less oakey which I personally prefer for cooking.



A cheap Chardonnay works well too. The Charles Shaw (also known as Two Buck Chuck) is a good cooking wine that's about $3 at Trader Joe's.

I learned a little more about wine through this answer.  Like Cabernet Sauvignon is a dry white wine and dry white wines should be used for cooking.  Also glad to know that (now three where I am) buck Chuck is just fine to use. Thank you much!

OK, this is purely my opinion on cooking with wine.  Cheaper whites are just fine for cooking.  (But yes, not that stuff bottled as cooking wine.)  If I paid for a bottle of Markham sauvignon blanc, I'm not using 1 cup of it in the risotto!  I like getting those little bottles of wine, the 4 packs to use as my cooking wine.  It's about $5 for the 4 little bottles, and that way you don't waste the rest of an $8 bottle when you only need 1 cup or so.  Anyway, I recommend a sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio/gris.  I've been using Bella Sera.  They're lighter than chardonnays.  I won't use chardonnay since they started the barrel oaking 10+ years ago.  What used to be a crisp chardonnay turned into a very buttery wine that overwhelms a dish.

The rule is to use wine you wouldn't mind drinking.  However, this does not mean you have to spend as much as you would on the wine you pour in glasses.  It basically means, use DRINKING wine, not the cooking wine they sell with vinegars.



The best white wine in most recipes is Barefoot Chardonnay or Yellow Tail Chardonnay.  Both are $5-$6 dollars a bottle at Walmart or the grocery store.

Poached Eggs recipe



This recipe is also available as a step-by-step video guide
308 calories per portion



Serves: 1



Ingredients
1 Large Lion Quality egg
Water for boiling
Pinch of salt
Dash of vinegar
Warmed, buttered muffin or toast to serve (optional)



Method



Fill a large pan with 5cm (2") of water. Add a pinch of salt and a dash of vinegar to help set the egg. Bring the water to a gentle boil. Crack the egg onto a plate and then tip it into the water. Set a kitchen timer for one of the timings below:



3 minutes for a completely runny egg yolk



4 minutes for a slightly set yolk with a runny middle



5 minutes for a firm egg yolk



When the cooking time is complete, carefully remove the poached egg from the boiling water using a slotted spoon and place on kitchen paper to drain. Serve immediately on a warmed, buttered muffin or slice of buttered toast.



Micro tip



For extra speed use the microwave. Carefully crack the egg into a large teacup or ramekin dish filled with 1/2 tbsp of water. Use a cocktail stick to pierce the yolk and white in a couple of places and poach in the microwave on HIGH for 40 seconds (750 Watt oven)/60 seconds (650 Watt oven). Stand for 1 minute and serve. Turn your poached egg and muffin into Eggs Benedict with a layer of smoked ham topped with a ready-made or home-made Hollandaise sauce.

Poached Eggs
Always use the freshest eggs you can find for poaching: The thick albumen will hold its shape better around the yolk than older eggs. Add vinegar to the poaching water to help the eggs coagulate faster by preventing the whites from spreading out.



Instructions:
Bring a large, wide saucepan of water and 1 tablespoon of vinegar (any flavor) to a boil. Break one egg at a time into a small heatproof bowl, about the size of one egg. Reduce heat so that the water is just simmering. Slightly immerse the bowl in the water, and gently slide in the egg. After all eggs are added, cover pot, turn off heat, and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove eggs in the order they were added and set spoon briefly on a kitchen towel to drain. Trim ragged edges with a knife or scissors, if desired, and serve immediately.



Planning Ahead:
If cooking for a crowd, poached eggs can be made ahead of time: Chill in an ice-water bath, transfer to a covered container, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Reheat them by immersing in simmering water for 1 minute.

Fill a saucepan with 3 inches of cold water, add a pinch of salt and bring to the boil.



For your first attempt at preparing poached eggs, you may want to carefully break each egg onto a small cup, plate or bowl before adding it to the water.



As the water reaches boiling point, reduce the heat and allow the water to simmer.



Once the eggs are in the water, do not move them around. Let the eggs cook for 2½ - 3½ minutes, allowing for the size of the egg and the preferred doneness of the egg yolks.



Remove each egg with a slotted spoon and drain for a few seconds on kitchen paper. Trim any stringy or dangling bits with a knife or scissors if you wish and serve immediately.

Fill a frying pan with boiling water, deep enough to cover an egg. While it is boiling briskly over a high gas flame, break as many eggs as you need into the water. The water will go off the boil, but keep an eye on it until it comes back to the boil. Once it is boiling again turn the heat off and let it sit. The eggs will continue to cook and you can take them out when they are cooked - about four minutes should be the maximum. You will end up with a runny yolk but a fully cooked but non-rubbery white. The yolk will be covered all over with a delicate white.

Drive by the chicken farm late at night.  Shine the henhouse with your million-candle-power spotlight.  Use your 22 mag to shoot the chickens off their roost and steal the eggs.  Don't let the gamewarden see you.



Seriously though, I have trouble boiling them directly in water like most people are suggesting.  I prefer to spray a little pan in a shallow cereal bowl (earthenware is best) and crack an egg or two in there, then put the bowl in a skillet of boiling water and cover a few minutes until the egg is at desired doneness, then scrap out of bowl onto plate for eating.

the trick is to use very fresh eggs, people will say put some vinegar in the water but you only need to do that if the eggs are not fresh.
boil the water, when at boiling point stir the water, and crack the egg into the vortex, lower heat, and wait.

To all those people saying use really fresh eggs - Don't.  You shouldn't use any eggs less than a day old, as the whites of these eggs really spread themselves out during cooking.



The same goes for frying and boiling - the white of really fresh eggs spreads all over the pan, and when boiled the white sticks to the shell making them hard to eat.



Unless you have your own hens I wouldn't worry about this though!

New York Cheesecake !!!
And this is a great recipe for it!!
You have to try it!!



15 graham crackers, crushed



2 tablespoons butter, melted



4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese



1 1/2 cups white sugar



3/4 cup milk



4 eggs



1 cup sour cream



1 tablespoon vanilla extract



1/4 cup all-purpose flour



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.



In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.



In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in milk, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.



Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving. Serves 12.

Most varieties of rice use the 1 to 2 ratio. 1 cup Rice to 2 cups Water. Some varieties use just a bit more water. If you have regular long grain white rice then it is the 1 to 2 ratio.



For the 1/2 cup rice, use 1 cup water and a dash of salt. It still takes about 20 minutes to cook covered.
Minute Rice is equal amounts of rice and water. We are thinking you are asking about regular long grain rice. Or the regular 20 min rice.

Generally you use equal cups of liquid to equal cups of rice.  Try using chicken stock for a better flavor.

You can try using Splenda, but I find it doesn't really taste the same as sugar. You can try doing half-sugar/half-Splenda if you really wanted to but you may as well go all out if you're making a cake.

The thing with frosting recipes is - you never follow the recipe exactly, for example the milk is added as needed until you get the desired consistency.  The ingredients for this recipe look pretty good, and basic - what I would usually see for a chocolate frosting recipe.  Though I haven't tried this one myself.



For finding recipes, I really like the the website allrecipes.com  Other users can give reviews, post pictures of what they have made, rate the recipe, and give tips on how to improve it.



Here is a search for chocolate frosting:



http://allrecipes.com/Search/Recipes.asp...



You can put them in order by rating so you only see the good ones.  Read the reviews to see what others have said about how the recipes have come out, I'm sure you'll find one that suits your needs!



Edit:



Also, I would not substitute splenda.  Powdered sugar and splenda have very different textures, and it would certainly effect how the frosting comes out.  Though substituting a portion of the sugar with splenda, and mixing the two together well prior to including them in the recipe can have okay results.

I used to ice cakes, the frosting used was made with lard. I used several frosting recipes and haven't found one as good. I am happy with a simple ganache (equal part of baking chocolate and heavy whipping cream). Sometimes when using Splenda in a recipe that has to cook or bake it doesn't turn out, because the sugar alcohol evaporates during the baking process.

Give stuff away



Splenda is better calorie wise. But no matter, make a batch and give at least half of it away. Take it to work. Send it to work with someone else. Make friends with your neighbors. Who doesn't like someone that gives/brings them cookies or cake??



Put individual portions into baggies and freeze. Most baked stuff freezes very well.

its can be frozen for up to a year. but in the refrigerate only 2 days would be on the safe side...but make sure when its reheated its internal temp. inside should be 160 degrees  to avoid any health issues.



it can last longer but its not advised by the american culinary foundation....

Use self rising flour. Add water and stir until the flour mix is not too runny, thick but smooth. Pre heat your pan with a little dob of butter or margarine. Lace your pan with butter or margarine by wiping off the excess fat with paper towel. Then pour some mix on the pan with simmer heat. Turn your pancake when you see bubbles forming. Your pancake will be ready in a few seconds. Enjoy.

Packed lunch.
I liked the old fashioned meals my mom used to make for my lunch;
Here is a good one;
Bread Fritters;
Go to the bakery section of the store where you normally buy bread.
Ask the baker for an "unbaked" loaf of bread.
He must put exactly the same amount of dough he would have used to bake a bread with in to a plastic bag for you, and it would cost no more than a loaf of bread.



Take that home and in a pot warm some cooking oil to about half the depth of the pot. (Smaller pots take less oil than bigger ones do)...
The oil temperature should be medium hot. (About half the heat that the stove plate will go)



Now cut from the unbaked dough a slice about the size of your palm, and with a little water on your fingers (to prevent the dough from sticking to your hand), stretch out the dough in all directions until it is about the size of your whole hand including the fingers. That brings the cutting of dough to about twice the size it was when you cut it....



Now with care, drop the stretched out dough in to the hot oil.
It would rise almost instantly.
Fry it in the oil until it is golden brown all over, taking care to turn it over occasionally.
It would be puffy and crisp when done.



With a large ladle or sieve, scoop out the bread fritter and place on an absorbent kitchen towel to rid it of most of the oil still on it.
Repeat this process until all the dough is done.



These bread fritters are extremely filling, and can be cut open and filled with almost anything from grated cheese to minced meat to cold processed meat, syrup or jam.
Try it, you will probably have some left over for two or three days, which you can take to work if you like....
Bread fritters can be frozen and warmed up again if you have made too much, but the dough cannot, so rather make the whole lot and freeze what is left over for another day. If you decide to freeze them, do so without a filling. Fillings should always be made fresh.
Finger snack variety;



By making the bread dough cutting about half the size when cutting off the raw dough from the batch, you can make smaller sized bread fritters and fill them with fancy foods like tuna mince or savory beef mince for buffet snack parties

To change grams to ounces divide by 30  (30 grams = 1 ounce)
(actually 28.8 grams but unless you are doing scientific work 30 is close enough)
150 divided by 30 = 5 ounces  you can do the rest

Yes, I make betty crocker's snickerdoodle recipe, I don't have cream of tartar too, but the recipe states if you're using self raising flour you can omit it, so that's what I do. Also you can for sure replace the shortening in the recipe w/ margarine, I always do that and the cookies come out just fine.
http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/reci...
Oh, if you love snickerdoodles you'll really like russian tea cakes recipe on the same sight, it's very very easy and doesn't even include shortening or cream of tartar, and I personally think it way better than snickerdoodles. Enjoy.

Don't stir it too much when its cooking as this releases the starch and makes it more sticky. A drizzle of olive oil is good too.

Before you cook the spaghetti (or any pasta), add about 10ml (2 teaspoons) of olive oil to the boiling water.  It floats on the top and coats the pasta as you put it in.  If you're going to serve it with a sauce, when it's cooked drain off the water and add the sauce to the pasta in the pan.

Whilst it is cooking add some olive oil to the pan this sits on top of the water and coats the spaghetti as you drain it.  It also enhances the flavour of the spaghetti.  That should solve your problem.  Also over cooking the spaghetti can cause this problem to be worse than if you under cook it.  Spaghetti when ready can be thrown at a wall and should stick initially then fall off after a short time.

Add a tablespoonful of olive oil to the pan of boiling water before you put the spaghetti in. Use a large pan with plenty of water and a small handful of salt, bring the pan back to the boil quickly after adding the spaghetti. Stir as soon as the spaghetti begins to soften.



To completely prevent sticking, stir a little more oil into the spaghetti after draining. Oil infused with basil also adds to the flavour.



Be careful when serving, if you're not, the spaghetti can slide off the plate very easily.

add a good slurp of olive oil and give a good stir



also when cooking pasta always add a good amount of salt to the water



EDIT:
Oil added to the water doesn't do anything as the pasta is in the water and the oil sits on top of the water... a complete waste of good olive oil

First make  sure you have enough water in the pot you are cooking the spaghetti in.  Let the water come to a boil before adding your spaghetti and also add a small amount of salt and crisco oil.  Your spaghetti is done when easily cut with a fork.  Pour into a strainer and drain all the water, You can rinse if you want to , but not in boiling water,  Warm is better.  Actually it isn't necessary if you add the cooking oil before cooking.  Hope this helps.

oil in the water is a false statement however many short order cooks do it anyway....



the best way is once the pasta has hit the boiling water stirrup the pasta  for the first minute or so with out stopping and then continue to stir it well very often until the pasta is done...then run cold water over it until it's completely cooled...then lightly drizzle with olive oil...and toss...



reason when the dry pasta hits the water the first 5 to 45 seconds is when its going to stick because the starch becomes gluey at first that's what makes it stick..mainly

Being a boy, my favourite pudding has got to be a good old fashioned treacle sponge. The recipe below is really easy and will bring a tear of nostalgia to the eyes of your guests.



If the occasion calls for something a bit more decadent, you could try this recipe for Chocolate Truffle Pudding. http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/513315



We have a top ten English pudding recipe page on our website, as well as 980 other puddings for you to look through. http://uktv.co.uk/food/homepage/sid/5896



Treacle Sponge Pudding



Serves: 4 Prep: 15 min, plus 5 mins chilling



Cook: 1 hr 30 min



Ingredients
2 tbsp golden syrup, plus extra for serving
115g plain flour, sifted
1 1/2 tsp Baking powder
2 large Eggs
115g brown sugar
75g margarine
25g unsalted Butter
1 tbsp Brandy
clotted cream or custard, for serving



Method 1. Generously butter a 900ml pudding basin. Place the buttered pudding basin into the fridge for 5 minutes to firm up the butter.



2. Once cooled, remove from fridge and add the golden syrup to the base of the basin.



3. In a large mixing bowl, place the flour, baking powder, eggs, brown sugar, margarine, unsalted butter and brandy and mix together thoroughly.



4. Spoon the flour mixture into the basin, over the golden syrup.



5. Take a large piece of tin foil, fold it in half and grease one side thoroughly.



6. Cover the pudding with the greased tin foil, pleating the foil a few times to allow room for the pudding's expansion.



7. Fasten the foil to the rim of the pudding basin with string.



8. Place the covered pudding basin in a large steamer.



9. Steam over a medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes. Make sure that the steamer does not boil dry, topping up with boiling water as needed.



10. Once the pudding is risen and cooked, turn it out from the pudding basin. Serve with golden syrup and clotted cream or custard.



I hope you find the one you want,



Michael.

Bourbon Sauce for Bread Pudding and Bread Pudding Soufflé
Ingredients
3 large eggs



3 large egg yolks



1 cup sugar



1 teaspoon vanilla extract



1 tablespoon bourbon (optional)



Directions
1
In a medium bowl or the bowl of your electric mixer combine eggs, yolks and sugar, whisk to combine.
2
Place your mixing bowl over a pan of hot water over low heat and stir continuously until it reaches 165°F.
3
I like to start the water off at well below the boiling point and slowly raise the temperature until it's just shy of boiling.
4
Do not whisk this mixture too much at this stage or you will incorporate too much air and take too long to heat.
5
If water starts to boil or you see steam coming off your mixture remove from the heat for a few seconds and whisk.
6
Getting this mixture too hot will cause eggs to cook.
7
After desired temperature is reached, use the whip attachment for your electric mixer and beat on high speed until thick and cooled to just warm to the touch.
8
Beat in vanilla and optional bourbon, serve ASAP.
9
The mixture will keep in the fridge for a day or so before it starts to separate.
10
Variations: Use rum, flavored liqueur or various extracts in lieu of bourbon.

Trifle is quite impressive and relatively easy to make although it can take a while...here is a recipe...enjoy!
Line a large bowl with slices of swiss roll. You could soak these in sherry if you like but I'm not into that. Use a tin of your favourite fruit or fresh, this is best. I usually like using raspberries, strawberries and blueberries.Spread fruit over sponge. Make up jelly (flavour to match fruit if possible, I like raspberry or strawberry), using drained juice of tinned if used. Let cool and pour over fruit and sponge. It tends to float a bit. Let set in fridge for about an hour.



Put a layer of cooled custard on top, I use ready made. Then top with whipped cream and decorate with whatever you fancy, choc drops, fruit, candy...be creative!!



Oh yea and if possible use a glass bowl so you can see all the layers!

If you have any chile paste, you can saute veggies, any kind and add some of the chile paste with soy sauce and serve over rice.  It is awesome.  Or you can stir fry veggies, add the chile paste and soy sauce, then toss in some oriental noodles, like Roman Noodles.  Add some chicken or beef.  I make that a great deal.  Add a lot or a little chile paste, depends on how spicy you like it.

Zebra Marshmallow Cups Recipe



White chocolate, dark chocolate, cookie crumbs, and marshmallows make a black and white layered zebra candy. What's not to love? No-bake zebra candy cups are easy to make and great for gifts.



* 12 ounces Hershey's Cookies & Cream Nuggets, unwrapped



* 2 cups (about) mini-marshmallows



* 2 Tbsp shortening



* 1 ounce paraffin



* 3 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips



* 1/2 cup finely crushed chocolate cookie wafers
Line mini-muffin tins with muffin papers.
In a double-boiler, melt butter and white chocolate Nuggets, stirring to avoid scorching, until combined. Remove from heat.
Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of melted white chocolate into each mini-muffin cup. Press 3 miniature marshmallows into each cup.
Clean double-boiler and dry thoroughly. (One drop of water will make the chocolate seize.) Place shortening and paraffin in double-boiler and melt. Add chocolate chips 1 cup at a time to melt, stirring until all are melted and smooth. Remove top from double-boiler and place on a trivet or heat-proof pad. Mix in cookie crumbs. Spoon melted chocolate mixture into cups to cover marshmallows. When trays are full, tap gently on the counter to force chocolate down and around the marshmallows.
Refrigerate zebra candy cups at least 4 hours before serving. Keep leftovers refrigerated.
Yield: 4 dozen candy cups

They sort of look like smashed bugs, but they are really bites of pure heaven. These crunchy chocolate caramel candies are easy to create for parties, bake sales, gifts, and Halloween.



* 2 cups (about) square snack pretzels



* 1 package (12 ounces) Rollo® chocolate-covered caramel candies



* 8 (about) large marshmallows, each cut into 8 pieces



* 1 cup (about) pecan halves
Preheat oven to 300 F. Line baking sheets with Silpats or parchment paper.
Place pretzels in rows 1 inch apart on lined baking sheets. Top with chocolate caramel candies. Place marshmallow on top. Bake for 3 minutes only. Immediately place pecan half on top of each and gently press down so all layers stick together.
Let cool. (May refrigerate to set chocolate.)
Cover and store in a cool place or refrigerate. If you refrigerate, let the candies stand at least 15 minutes at room temperature to soften up a bit. Best served at room temperature.
Yield: about 56 candies

Ganache is normally made by heating heavy cream, then pouring it over chopped, dark chocolate. The mixture is stirred or blended until smooth, and can be enhanced with liqueurs or extracts. Depending on the kind of chocolate used, cream should be adjusted to reach desired consistency.



Ganache can also be used in filled chocolates, chocolate truffles, and other desserts. The portions of chocolate to cream vary depending on the intended usage of the ganache. Typically, a ganache is equal parts chocolate and cream; this is used for filling cakes. For a chocolate truffle base, twice as much chocolate as cream is used. For making a glaze, one should use three times as much chocolate as cream. Ganache can also be allowed to cool and whipped to increased volume and then spread to cover a cake.



Ganache is said to originate from a culinary accident, whereby a chocolatier's apprentice spilled cream in the chocolate he was melting. The chef called the apprentice 'Ganache', a word meaning, figuratively, 'fool'. The result was delicious, and the name stuck.

Ganache is a rich mixture of chocolate and cream which can be used as a frosting or filling. Depending on the intended use, different ratios of chocolate to cream are used, to create anything from a light glaze to a dense standalone truffle. Although ganache is remarkably rich and luxurious, it is extremely easy to make, and it is well worth adding to one's baking repertoire, in the opinion of this wiseGEEK writer.



The evidence suggests that ganache was developed in the mid-1800s, although both France and Switzerland claim the credit for the invention. In either case, ganache quickly spread into European dessert making. To make ganache, heavy cream is brought to the boiling point and then poured over chunks of chocolate. The mixture is stirred so that the chocolate melts, and the result is a dense chocolate cream. Adding butter or oil to the ganache will make it highly glossy, as is sometimes desirable for frosting. Liqueurs and other flavorings can be added as well, if desired.



If the cook uses one part cream to every three parts of chocolate, the result will be a chocolate glaze which can be used like a chocolate frosting. This glaze can be rather elegant, and is is especially popular for tortes and other rich chocolate dishes. As it cools, the ganache will become more stiff, but it can easily be reheated, if needed. The addition of small amounts of coffee or orange can also radically change the flavor profile, if desired.



Using one part cream to two parts of chocolate yields a very rich, dense chocolate filling which can be used in truffles and other candied desserts. This version of ganache can also be lightly rolled in cocoa powder and served plain, like a truffle. For a lighter filling, the ratio is one to one. This type of ganache is good for layering in cakes and similar desserts.



Different types of chocolate yield various styles of ganache, from bittersweet to white. As a general rule, it is a good idea to use high quality chocolate, since the ganache is so simple that cheap chocolate will mar the flavor. Especially when the ganache is being paired with a rich, luxurious cake, this cheapness can become glaringly obvious. If you are glazing a cake with ganache, try adding ornaments like marzipan flowers for extra elegance, or dust the cake in cocoa powder for more visual texture.

How to make Spanish ham?



I had this ham from a Spanish restaurant the other day and it was great. I wanted to know if anyone knew how to make it.I was able to pick up on some ingredients like cinnamon, whole cloves, pineapple, sugar, does anyone know the full recipe?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



True Spanish ham is made by curing particular types of pig leg.  The type of pig determines the "grade" of ham.



Unless you're up getting a raw pig leg and curing it, this is not something to do at home.

How should I be cooking these vegetables?



I had this couscous at a restaurant and it was really great and I'm trying to re-create it. I know how to easily make the couscous but what I'm concerned about is how I'm going to make the vegetables.
The vegetables she used were:
Potatoes
Zucchini
Carrots
Celery



I have all of them but they came out very nice and soft and I'm not sure how to do that.. should I boil them? I don't want them TOO soft.



And I feel like putting only vegetables on top of couscous would come out very plain, which spices should I add for more flavor?

Yes, precook the veggies and pre spice them.  I don't know what spices were in the couscous you ate at the restaurant, I would use onions, garlic, salt and pepper and any other spice you like.  You could boil the veggies, but they would be better sauted in butter with the other seasonings, then added to the couscous.  Couscous only cooks for 5 minutes or so, you could cook the veggies to almost done, then add them to the couscous and cook the two together.  That will help flavor the couscous.  Good luck.

1st, make your couscous with chicken stock (or vegetable stock) instead of water.



Do you like curry?
I would curry them.



Get some RED CURRY PASTE in the store -- usually near the Thai foods.



_________________________________
Peel and dice the potatoes.  Put them in a pot of cold water and bring it to a boil.  Boil for 10 minutes then pour them into a strainer & let them dry off a little (maybe lay out on some paper towel).
Dice up your zucchini, carrots, celery, and some onion too.  I'd also use a little chopped garlic.



In a skillet, put about 3T canola oil and heat with 2 large spoonfuls of the red curry paste.  Stir and heat on medium then put in all of the veggies and potatoes.  Stir/toss to combine with the curry paste oil.  Cook on low/medium for about 10 mins to soften the veggies, stirring often.  Sprinkle with 1 T brown sugar and continue to stir.



Personally, I'd add in about 1/4 cup coconut milk to the veggies and stir.



Serve the veggies tossed with the couscous.

Have you already added the tomatoes and everything else? If so, yeah, you're probably in trouble.



but if not - put the meat in a colander and run water over it; if you see big chunks of pepper, take them out. that should help.



Since the too big pepper is the problem, you should be able to dig a lot of it out, as much of a pain as that will be.

The recipe called for 1/4 tsp of ground pepper.
It sounds like you just have coarse pieces instead.
Once it's been cooked, you may not notice.
Try increasing the volume by adding meat or tomatoes.
Then divide & save the extra sauce to make chili.

Is week-old beer ok for cooking? ?



I opened a 16oz natural light a week or two ago to use a little for some pork chops. I wrapped the top of the can in plastic wrap and put it back in the fridge. I plan on making pork chops again tonight and was hoping I could use the same beer and not have to open another one! I looked at it, it smells normal and all. I think it has been less than 2 weeks. I'd use less than 1/4 cup or so I guess, and it will bake with the chops.

It would be the best use of the beer.  An opened beer isn't quite the same for drinking after a week or so, but for cooking it would be fine.

Leg of lamb for a party?



I am looking for a method to cook a leg of lamb to medium and serve hot. Problem is that we are going to a game before people come to our house and eat. I would like to serve the leg of lamb medium and warm, but will be gone for 4 hours before we have to eat.



I was thinking caterers must be used to reheating the leg of lamb. What do they do? Can I precook the leg of lamp to rare and reheat it when we get back? How do I make sure that the meat is safe to eat and that it is medium and juicy - not being around for 4 hours?

If your oven has a timer, just set the oven to come on at a specified time.  Most modern stoves have this option.



Failing that...you could cook it at a very low temperature (200-250) for a long period of time, and then bump it up when you get in (depending on the internal temperature).

Why don't you do spoon lamb and then you won't have to worry about keeping it medium.

Mid rare lamb is nice, but it seems like a hassle with the time constraints.

I would say about 12.  We used to serve a pound of steamer clams at a seafood restaurant I worked at.  When you buy them, your seafood purveyor will have a scale.  They sell them by weight, not by each.

No-Bake Lemon Cheesecake
Light & Tasty



This dazzling dessert is a dieter's delight. A light and refreshing alternative to classic cheesecake, the slim sweet calls for gelatin and lower-fat cheeses. Eva Wright, who sent the recipe from Grant, Alabama, recommends, "Vary the gelatin and pie filling flavors to suit your family's taste."



Ingredients:



1 whole reduced-fat graham cracker, finely crushed, divided
1 package (.3 ounce) sugar-free lemon gelatin
2/3 cup boiling water
1 package (8 ounces) reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed
1 cup (8 ounces) 1% cottage cheese
2 cups reduced-fat whipped topping
1 cup reduced-sugar cherry pie filling



Directions:



Coat a 9-in. springform pan with cooking spray.  Sprinkle half of graham cracker crumbs on the bottom and 1 in. up the sides of pan; set aside.  Dissolve gelatin in boiling water; cool to room temperature.



In a blender, combine the gelatin mixture, cream cheese and cottage cheese; cover and process until smooth.  Transfer mixture to a bowl; fold in whipped topping.  Pour into prepared pan.



Sprinkle with remaining graham cracker crumbs. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until set. Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen, then remove sides of pan. Garnish with pie filling. Yield: 8 servings.

Ooey Gooey Cake



* 1 (18.25-ounce) box yellow cake mix
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted



Filling
* 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1 (16-ounce) box confectioners' sugar
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted



Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 13x9x2-inch baking pan.



In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cake mix, egg, and butter and mix well. Pat into the bottom of prepared pan and set aside.



Still using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth; add eggs and vanilla. Dump in confectioners' sugar and beat well. Reduce speed of mixer and slowly pour in butter. Mix well.



Pour filling onto cake mixture and spread evenly. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes. Don't be afraid to make a judgment call on the cooking time, because oven temperatures can vary. You want the center to be a little gooey, so don't bake it past that point!



Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. Cut into squares.



Happy cooking!

The dry parsley is better than going without.  It's strange that parsley is in a marinade.  Parsley doesn't really impart a flavor to marinades-  the liquids and onions and garlic impart most of the flavor.

Definitely don't go without. Contrary to what one person said earlier dry parsley isn't as song as fresh chopped up parsley. With some herbs that is true that its stronger however that's not the case with parsley. I don't know how much your recipe calls for but I probably wouldn't do more than 1tsp of the dried parsley. I wouldn't have any worries about it not being fresh though because it will be plumped up by being in your marinade and having the soaking time.

Many people swear by fresh herbs & i am one of them,however cannot see why you should go without when you have the dry one handy,as already suggested dry herbs need to be used sparingly.
I love gardening & have some choice potted herbs,so nice to pick your own fresh herbs.I grow both the flat & curly leaf varieties .Flat is flavoursome & best for cooking,curly besides cooking makes a fancy garnish.

You can make all your Xmas baking with "Splenda" both the white and brown for baking it cooks and measures like sugar, I use it and know one know the difference, I should mention I am a diabetic and was a professional chef for 20+ year internationally.



You can even make shortbread with it but use it with either cornstarch or rice flour to make the cookies, I also use unsalted butter, sugar is not the most critical issue with a diabetic, both carbs and fat are a no-no to when looking at a recipe for things.

If I'm in a "sweet" mood, or not too hungry then I will have toast with butter and some of my Mum's homemade Raspberry jam (its So good!)



If I'm hungry and want something quick and satisfying it will be either Scrambled Eggs (sometimes with some mushroom in it)
or Bacon with a little tomato sauce
or Cheese

Use white cheddar and panko (Japanese bread crumbs); or add chunks of ham or bacon to it. A little dried mustard seed adds a lot of flavor. The panko really make a huge difference though - they're delicious.

Layer the macaroni with sliced tomatoes. The top layer is tomatoes drizzled with olive oil.
Add chopped ham or bacon bits.
Add thyme and parsley to the cheese sauce.
Add a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the cheese.
Replace a quarter of the cheese with blue cheese.
Make sure the top goes really crispy and crunchy by putting it right at the top of the oven.
Use different shapes of pasta.
Add mustard powder to the cheese sauce.
Add a little horseradish to the cheese sauce.

At home I make "Crunchies". It's a type of mac&cheese from our Polish hertiage.  We add sliced small white onions. Not too much though.



Also, you can add bits of bacon into it. Fry the bacon yourself and chope it up and put it into the mac&cheese.



Here's website with different mac&cheese's. From Reuben mac&cheese to quesdilla mac& cheese

Pie question how do I squeeze it in a cup?



I am having a casual cocktail party tomorrow night and I bought really fancy/cute glass cups which I will fill with Sara Lee desserts.  I did a "test" last night to see how it would look and it wasn't as cute as I want it to be.  I cut it like I would a in pie piece and just kind of smooshed it in the cup and topped it with whipp cream (it's key lime pie and chocolate cream pie) Does anyone have any ideas on how I can make this look more presentable?

the proper way to achieve would to not have bought the pies premade.
take graham crackers and crush really fine and put first in the glass then  add the filling then top with the whip cream. you can make a chocate cream with pudding.



maybe you can still you the filling from the pies you bought.

Can a cheesecake be unrefrigerated overnight after baking?



So I took the cheesecake I baked last night out of the oven at about 9:30 p.m and wanted to let it cool before putting it in the refrigerator.  I set the alarm for about 10:30 p.m. to put it in the refrigerator, however, I fell asleep and for some reason the alarm never went off.  I woke up at about 5:00 a.m. to put it in the refrigerator.



Since the recipe has the cream cheese, sour cream, eggs, etc., is it ok to eat and serve to others?  Or do you recommend tossing it?



Thank you!

The cheeses are cooked and it won't be a problem.  Some bakeries leave the cheesecake out on the counter for sale for much longer than that!  I always travel with my famous cheesecake and take it on a plane to Florida from New York.  It is unrefrigerated for 4+ hours. Your cake is fine.

That's such a personal question.  I love peppers and eggs.  In fact I had it today.  I also love potatos and eggs and here's how you make them:



cut and deseed 1 whole (green/red/yellow - doesn't matter) pepper then julienne it.  Fry in oil till crisp cooked.  While frying mix 2 eggs w/ little milk (just like for scrambled eggs).  When peppers are done remove from oil and remove most of the oil from the pan, return pan to heat, return peppers to pan, add egg mixture on top and make like your making scrambled eggs.  Serve on crusty Italian bread and salt to taste (just a little).  Enjoy.



Potatos and eggs - same as above substituting the potato for the pepper.  I like this with a little ketchup and salt on it.  Enjoy!

Chicken and Apple



Take any kind of GOOD quality bread. Preferably ciabatta, foccacia or other panini style. Sourdough also works.



Spread with regular mayonnaise, or look for a flavored one. One with a little pesto is delicious. You can also use a cranberry chutney for this.



Add sliced chicken, thinly sliced apple, and brie cheese. You can toast this or eat as it. It is my Favorite sandwhich.

Does anyone know how to make fried lotus seed? ?



I tried some fried lotus seed which brought back from Vietnam by my friend. It taste really nice. Just wonder how do they made this fried lotus seed. I thought it would be the same way to make the roasted cashew nut which just fry or roast the dry cashew nut. But the result was really worst because the lotus seed still very hard after i fried it with oil and not crunchy at all. If anyone know the right way to make fried lotus seed, please tell me ya.

Chicken in Bernaise sauce. If it is just the two of you you could go with 2 or 3 chicken breast. Get two packages of Bernaise sauce and a package of sliced mushrooms. You will need a pretty big pan like a soup pan. First mix your packages of Bernaise by following the recipe on back of package and you will double it of course since you are using two packages. Bring to a boil and add almost whole package of fresh sliced mushrooms. Unless you don't like them then you could probably leave them out. Add your chicken and let cook until chicken is no longer pink. As for sides you could cook some fresh cut asparagus, or just go with some corn on the cob. And maybe some salad or whatever else you like.

Unless he is a vege - men love meat.  I would cook him steak with vegetables and mash potato.  Here is what you do:



Buy 2 pieces of fillet steak and brush with a little olive oil.  Cook them in your george forman and with 2 tomatoes (each) cut in half, sliced tomatoes and baby corn.  Then buy ready made mash potato.  Either like Tesco's finest you heat up in the microwave or Smash which you just add hot water too.  He will love this!



For dessert buy a ready made one e.g: chocolate cake, rice pudding you heat up in microwave, chocolate mouse - or even better strawberries to dip in the chocolate mouse - very romantic!

Does anybody know of an easy recipie for an electric fan oven to make plain scones(ones without raisons etc)?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Ingriedients:



225g self-raising flour



40g butter



150ml milk



1.5 tbsp caster sugar



pinch of salt



Method:



Heat the over to gas mark 7, (220 C / 425 F).



Sift flour into a bowl and add the butter.



Rub the butter gently into the flour until it resembles bread crumbs.



Add the salt and sugar.



Slowly mix the milk in using a metal spoon to form a soft dough.



Knead the dough with your hands to bind it.



Roll out the dough so it's about 2cm thick.



Use a 4cm pastry cutter to cut the little scones out.



Keep reforming and cutting until all the dough has been used.



Place the scones, with a little dusting of flour on top, onto a greased baking sheet and put into the oven.



Remove the scones after 12-15 minutes and cool on a wire rack.



Enjoy with butter, cream and/or jam.



Or:



350g/12oz self-raising flour
1½ tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
40g/1½oz caster sugar
75g/3oz unsalted butter, slightly softened
1 tsp freshly grated lemon zest
175ml/6fl oz milk
flour, for dusting
or 1 small egg beaten with ½ tsp sugar, for brushing



Method:



1. Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.
2. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl, then stir in the sugar. Add the butter and rub it in, giving a texture of fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the lemon zest. Gradually add the milk and mix to give a soft smooth dough, kneading lightly with floured hands. If the dough fells a little dry, add a drop more milk.
3. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the scone mixture to 2.5cm/1in thick. Using a 7.5cm/3in plain or fluted pasty cutter, press firmly through the dough, trying not to twist the cutter or you'll end up with a little flour for a matt finish, or brush wit the beaten egg and sugar fro a shiny glaze.
4. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes until golden and nicely risen. Once cooked, place on a wire rack to cool slightly. These scones are definitely best served still warm from the oven with lots of melting butter or strawberry jam and sticky clotted cream.



Tip
If you prefer plain scones, just leave out the lemon zest but do try it for a change as the lemon is really refreshing with the strawberry jam and cream.
For a fruit scone, add 75g/3oz sultanas to the mixture before adding milk. Orange zest or lemon.



Enjoy!! and good luck!! :)

I think lobster is so rich it doesn't necessarily need to be dipped in anything. When I've dipped in it butter I almost get sick or can't eat much since its so rich.



How about fresh lemon wedges, and just squeeze them on the lobster meat.



or mix 1/2 good quality olive oil with 1/2 white wine and some fresh herbs like dill or parsley

a beef or pork roast, on low setting, with a packet of lipton french onion soup mix, a couple dashes of worcheshershire sauce, pepper, herbs, potatos, carrots and onions. super simple, super delish.



You could also do short ribs, on low setting, with a cup of BBQ sauce and a dash of liquid smoke.



Another idea is chicken and rice. cook the chicken in the crock pot until almost done in some chicken broth, then add instant rice, a can of brocolli cheddar condensed soup, and some chopped frozen brocolli.  Make sure you remove enough of the broth so that the end result wont be too soupy.
When it is almost done, add shredded cheese.

If you want something a little different I've made a Thai stew. I've done it the oven and crock pot.



use mixed fresh veggies usually you can find premixed at the grocery store in a bag like:



broccoli
cauliflower
pea pods
carrots



1 package of sliced mushrooms
1 diced onion



1 can water chestnuts



then add 1 can coconut milk and 2 tablespoons red curry paste



I've also added potatoes before, and have made it with chicken or tofu

Crock Pot Chicken Salsa Curry



10 chicken thighs-bone in
1 jar of your fav salsa
1/2 onion chopped
1 tablespoon curry (or about 1/2 if you don't like a strong curry taste)
1/2 cup sour cream



Place the chicken in the crock pot. Mix the onion, curry and salsa. Pour over the chicken and cook on low for about 6-8 hours.



When the chicken is done take it out of the crock pot and put on a serving plate. Add the sour cream and mix well. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.



This would go well with rice or cous cous.
--------------



Mexi-rice:



Use rice that is still warm.



Heat a skillet or griddle pan to a med-low heat. Add the rice and your favorite salsa, some olives, corn and ground cumin. (A great salsa to use would be the kind in the plastic tubs in the produce section, I think it's labeled as "Fresh Salsa" but El Paso or whatever would work as well.)



Instead of pre-made salsa make your own using roma tomatoes chopped small, red onions, chopped cilantro, minced garlic, finely chopped jalapeño pepper, adding some lime juice, and garlic salt. Then toss this fresh salsa in with the rice and cumin, olives, and corn.



Serve hot and I like mine with just a sprinkle of melted cheese.....yumm!!!



You will most liekly have left overs so youcan cut the recipe in 1/2 or use the left overs in a chicken quesadilla with grilled onions, and bell peppers. Or mix it in with some left over rice, and also toss into a chicken tortilla soup.

Wagon Wheel Beef Stew



Use vegetables on hand for this tasty slow-cooked beef stew. The condensed beef broth keeps it flavorful, and the wine adds a little zing. If you don't have the wine, more beef broth or water will work fine.



* 1 1/2 to 2 pounds stewing beef, cut in 1/2 to 1-inch cubes



* 2 to 3 medium potatoes, cubed



* 1 medium turnip, cubed



* 1 cup sliced carrots



* 1/2 cup chopped onions



* 1/4 to 1/2 cup sliced celery



* 1/2 to 1 cup sliced mushrooms



* 1/2 cup butter beans or lima beans



* 1 can (10 1/2 ounces) condensed beef broth



* 1/4 cup red wine



* 1/2 teaspoon salt



* 1/4 teaspoon pepper



* pinch thyme



* 3 tablespoons flour blended with 1/4 cup water



* 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, corn, or peas, optional



In slow cooker, combine beef, potatoes, turnip, carrots, onions, celery, mushrooms, butter beans, beef broth, wine, salt, and pepper. Cover and cook on LOW for 9 to 12 hours, or on HIGH for 5 to 6 hours. Add thyme and frozen mixed vegetables, corn, or peas, thawed, if using. Pour liquids into a medium saucepan and simmer to reduce slightly. If desired, skim off excess fat. Add the flour and water mixture and simmer until thickened. Add back to vegetables and continue cooking on LOW until serving time.
Serves 6.

AIOLI MAYONNAISE
Makes: 1 cup
4  garlic cloves, peeled, chopped fine
2 egg yolks
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 teaspoon cold water
1 teaspoon lemon juice



I N S T R U C T I O N S



Add the garlic and salt to the mortar bowl and grind slowly with the pestle, moving in one direction only.  You can do this first step in a food processor if you'd like, then transfer the mixture back to a medium sized bowl. Whisk in  the mustard first, then the egg yolks. At this point you can transfer the mixture back into the mortar or use the whisk in the bowl.



Now you will add in half of the oil.  This must be done very slowly or the oil will not emulsify and your sauce will not thicken.  Add the oil in a slow, fine stream while either whisking with a wire whisk or using your pestle.  Once the first half of the oil is incorporated, then add the water and the lemon juice, and mustard,



whisking or stirring constantly with the pestle. Then slowly add the rest of the oil.  The mixture will thicken as you continue to blend it. The mixture should be slightly thinner than commercial mayonnaise.  If it becomes too thick you can add a bit more warm water, one teaspoon at a time.



ZABAGLIONE RECIPE
8 large egg yolks
1 cup confectioners' (powdered) sugar
1/2 cup of dry Marsala (or Sherry)



I N S T R U C T I O N S



Place the egg yolks and the sugar in top of a double boiler and place on top of the bottom of the boiler. The water should be lightly boiling and the should not be touching the bottom of the top of the boiler. (You can also use a bowl over a large pot of boiling water. )



Use a wire whisk and whip the mixture until it is foamy.  Then add the Marsala and continue to cook the mixture until it has doubled in volume Use an instant-read thermometer to insure the mixture has reached 140°F.  Beat the mixture for additional minute or two.



Serve the zabaglione immediately.  This dish looks quite elegant served in long stemmed wine or parfait glasses.



FREEZE THEM!
Tips For Storing or Using Left Over Egg Yolks



Store Individually - Egg yolks need to be stabilized before freezing or the thawed product will be pasty and hard to mix. For best results store the yolks pre-measured according to future use. If the yolks will be used for sweet or dessert recipes, add 1 tablespoon of sugar or honey per pint of yolks.  If the yolks will be used for savory recipes add 1 teaspoon of salt per pint of yolks.  The stabilized yolks may be dropped,  one egg yolk in each section of a ice cube tray and frozen.



Remove the egg yolk cubes and store in a freezer style zip-lock bag.



Thawing Frozen Yolks - All the yolks to thaw in the refrigerator for about 8 to 10 hours.

Hey, i'm a chef, so maybe i can help ya. Honestly, you could use both. I would use chicken broth and tomato sauce. Season your veggies when cooking them, add chicken or vegetable broth, then add a thick tomato sauce like a marinara slowly until you get the desired richness and consistancy. Always add a little at a time, and taste as you go. And simmer, not boil, for about an hour to let the flavors marry. Hope i helped!

.Hi I was a culinary student for 3 years at the Culinary School of Washington in DC. Even though I have not run any big expensive Restaurants I have cooked for a few wealth people and done a number of parties and I was also a banquet Chief at Dave and Busters restaurant. I would use Chicken stock if i used a meat stock but other wise I would make a veg. stock with some veggies that i love the most especially the mushrooms.  I would also try it both ways with the tomato sauce and with just including tomatoes in my veggies for the stew. As far as the beans I don't see a why you cant use the Green beans in the last fifteen minutes of cooking the stew so they don't get really discolored. I would cook my beans like kidney beans (In with turkey necks) separately so I can get them tender with out over cooking all of my other veggies. As far as my spices, would place them in a bag. Or Cheesecloth and tie them up with a string to the handle of the pot so that i can remove them at the end of the stew. That bag would have the Thyme, Basil, marjoram, garlic and whole cracked peppers in it. Salt it to taste and serve

When I make vegetable soup I use stew meat.  I cook the meat first.  Then add a bag of mixed vegetables, onion, potatoes, beans, whatever sounds good that I have, and a couple of cans of stewed tomatoes.  Top it off with enough water for the consistence you want, remembering that it will cook down.



I suppose it depends on what you like in your soup.



It will be delicious however you make it.  Just add your own seasonings and simmer for the flavors to blend.
Enjoy!

I would use the broth.  The tomato sauce does not have seasoning in it, and is a little bland in comparison.  The broth adds flavor, and works as a great base for soup.  You will need to add seasonings - herbs, spices - and I would add onion as well.  That sounds like a nice soup.

Stew.
Cut the beef into bite sized pieces, and trim away fat.
Brown the beef in a fry pan in a little oil, in batches and transfer to a heavy based pot. (preferably)
Fry off the onions and garlic and deglaze the fry pan with a little water.
Add the onions and garlic to the meat.
If the soup mix is powdered sprinkle over meat and onions and stir to combine.
Stir in more water until in covers the meat completely.



Add seasonings, S&P, Worcestershire sauce and bring to the boil.
Reduce and simmer for 45 minutes, on the lowest heat on an element.
Check water level and stir from time to time
Add carrots celery and chopped potatoes and crushed tomatoes and juice.
You may need to top up the level of water and stir to combine.
Bring to the boil and simmer gently for about 20-30 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are cooked.
Check seasonings once again, and if necessary thicken.



Serve.
(You could put everything into a casserole dish and cook in oven, but I prefer stove top)
I omit the potatoes so I can boil and mash, to mop up the gravy.

I love Beef Stew, but my recipe is a family classic so I won't give it out, respect for my Mother, Grandmother and Great Grandmother, sorry. But, I can tell you some hints, flour your Beef roast before you sear it and add a little tomato paste about 2 hrs. into your cooking time. Obviously, the flour will create it's own thickening process and the tomato paste will also do this and bring all of your flavors together with that little added something to your Beef Stew. Cutting your additional veggies a little larger might also give you a stewy look as apposed to a soupy stew, because the longer cooking time of the Beef Stew will break down your celery, carrots and onions quicker if they are too small.  So, that's it, sorry I can't tell you the exact process, but if still need some more help, email me and I can give you some more hints.  Good luck and happy cooking, hope I've helped you out today.

In a large dutch oven (if you have one. use a skillet if you don't.) Rinse and then dredge the beef cubes in seasoned flour, shake off excess, brown on all sides in oil in skillet or dutch oven.



Place meat in bottom of dutch oven, or in a large pot with a lid. Add frozen stew veggies, or use fresh chopped celery,carrots, pearl onions, potatoes.



Add just enough liquid to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, about 1 hour. (For the liquid, you can use beef broth, or water, but if you use water, you might wanna add a packet of lipton soup mix (maybe onion soup, or beefy mushroom, whatever you like.)



The flour from the beef cubes should thicken the "gravy" on it's own, along with the starch from the potatoes. Hope this helps.

This is one of my favorite beef stew recipes:



OLD FASHIONED BEEF STEW



Ingredients
1/4 cup all-purpose flour



16 ounces beef stew meat, cut into 3/4-inch cubes



2 tablespoons cooking oil



2 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, cut into thin wedges



2 15-ounce cans of seasoned diced tomatoes
6 beef bouillon cubes - I like to use Knorr



4 cups water
1 1/2 tablespoons Italian seasoning
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon black pepper



3 cups cubed potato (about 3 medium)



1-1/2 cups frozen cut green beans



1 cup frozen whole kernel corn



1 cup sliced carrot (2 medium)



OR in place of the above frozen veggies and carrots, use 2 16-ounce bags of frozen mixed vegetables



Directions
Place flour in a plastic bag. Add meat cubes, a few at a time, shaking to coat. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven brown meat, left over flour and onions in hot oil and butter. Stir in diced tomatos plus 1/2 can of water from each can, water, bouillon cubes, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, pepper and potatoes. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until meat is nearly tender.



Stir in green beans, corn, and carrot or mixed vegetables. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, about 30 minutes more or until meat and vegetables are tender.



Slow-cooker directions: Prepare and brown meat as above. In a 3 1/2- or 4-quart slow cooker layer meat, onion, potatoes, green beans, corn, and carrot. Decrease vegetable juice to 2 cups. Combine vegetable juice, water, Worcestershire sauce, bouillon granules, Italian seasoning and pepper. Pour over meat and vegetables in slow cooker. Cover and cook on low-heat setting for 10 to 12 hours or on high-heat setting for 5 to 6 hours or until meat and vegetables are tender.



I like to serve my stew with fresh hot biscuits or hot corn bread or crusty French bread.

There so many ways to make beef stew. The basic method is below:



1) Purchase stew beef (or cut chuck or round steak into cubes)
2) I usually cut the purchased stew beef into smaller cubes for ease of eating
3) Heat a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil (your favorite) in a Dutch oven or deep saucepan
4) Brown the beef cubes on all sides until well caramelized
5) Add water or beef broth to the beef cubes
6) Add frozen stew vegetables to the mixture
7) Season with salt, pepper and other favorite spices such as garlic, bay leaves, etc.
8) Cover and let simmer for a couple hours until the beef is tender
9) Make dumplings and add to stew, if desired



Note: Can use fresh veggies such as potatoes, onions, carrots, celery instead of frozen stew veggies

You need to add some flour to it.  When you cook the meat coat it in flour first then fry it. this adds thickening.  if after you have is cooking it looks soupy you could take a little flour and water and mix together in a jar till all the flour is dissolved then slowly pour into the stew stirring this will also thicken it.

You must dredge your cubed beef in flour before browning. Then add all the rest of your ingredients. The flour helps thicken the stew. If still too thin, add some instant potatoe flakes at the end till thickness you desire has been achieved.

You go to the store and buy corn, peas, carrots, celery, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese, oh and the beef. Then you chop it all up and put it out on a pan, bake it in the oven at 475 for 30 minutes. Then put it in a bowl, run some water on it, and stir! DELICIOUS!

I don't really have a "recipe", but this is how I do it.  I purchase a 3 - 4 pound chuck roast, bone in is good and adds more flavor.



Start by browning your roast in olive oil over medium high heat.  Once your roast is browned on both sides, transfer to the slow cooker.  Peel and quarter about 4 medium sized potatoes, peel and slice into large chunks about 6 - 7 carrots.  Open a bag of dry onion soup mix and sprinkle all over the top.  Add a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, 4 cups of hot water, put the lid on and turn your slow cooker to low.  Let cook and simmer for 8 - 10 hours.



Remove your roast and vegetables, strain your liquid into a saucepan, heat over over medium high heat.  In a jar with a lid, place 3 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch and add 1/4 cup cold water.  Put lid on jar and shake well.  Pour this mixture into the pan with your roast liquid very slowly while stirring with a whisk.  Continue stirring and cooking until mixture get bubbly and thick.

It adds an interesting zip...probably especially good with chocolate. Also, the acid in the buttermilk probably means there is less baking soda in the recipe, which can reduce any bitter aftertaste.

you dont need yeast to make banana bread just baking soda, and yes it would be just try to add honey instead of suger it gives  far better bread

Purchase 2 lambs. One female and one male.
Put together during mating season.
Hopefully they will mate and have babies.
Then you shall have a combination of 3 lamb hearts, unless you get lucky and the female has twins.

<answer>



Ingredients you need are:



2 sheep's hearts
basic herb stuffing
2 oz (50 g) soft lamb or mutton fat
butter for greasing
250 ml any strong stock
1 tbsp plain flour (All purpose)
salt and pepper



method
1. Prepare the hearts. Dry thoroughly and fill with the stuffing.



2. Skewer or sew together the thin flaps at the top to hold in the stuffing.



3. Heat the fat in a small baking tin and put in the hearts.



4. Baste well, and bake them in a moderate oven, 180°C, Gas 4, for 1 hour for sheep's hearts, 45 minutes for lamb's hearts.



5. Baste them several times during cooking.



6. When cooked, transfer them to a warmed serving dish, remove the skewers, if necessary, and keep hot under buttered greaseproof paper.



7. Drain most of the fat from the tin but keep any meat juices.



8. Blend a little stock into the flour to make a paste.



9. Mix the paste into the pan juices, then gradually stir in the remaining stock.



10. Heat to simmering point, stirring all the time, and simmer until thickened. Season well.



11. Pour a little of this gravy round the hearts and serve the rest in a warmed sauce boat.



Goodluck

</answer from>



<answer>



Start by browning your roast in olive oil over medium high heat. Once your roast is browned on both sides, transfer to roasting pan. Peel and quarter about 4 medium sized potatoes, peel and slice into large chunks about 6 - 7 carrots. Open a bag of dry onion soup mix and sprinkle all over the top. Add a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, 2 1/2 cups of hot water, seal well with heavy duty aluminum foil.  Bake in 325 degree oven for 5 - 6 hours.



Remove your roast and vegetables, strain your liquid into a saucepan, heat over over medium high heat. In a jar with a lid, place 3 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch and add 1/4 cup cold water. Put lid on jar and shake well. Pour this mixture into the pan with your roast liquid very slowly while stirring with a whisk. Continue stirring and cooking until mixture get bubbly and thick.

BISCUIT CRUST CHICKEN PIE



3-4 cups chicken broth
3 large potatoes, quartered
3 carrots, sliced
2 stalks celery. sliced
3 cups cooked chicken, cubed
1 3-4 lb chicken
1 sweet onion, chopped
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 stick sweet unsalted butter
1/3 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon sage or bell seasoning
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
5 cloves fresh garlic, chopped



BISCUIT DOUGH FOR THE CRUST:



1 1/3 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoon butter, sliced thin
1/3 cup sharp cheddar, grated
1 egg



In saucepan melt butter, add olive oil and chopped onion. Fry on high heat for 2-3 minutes. Add herbs, vegetables and garlic and fry 2 more minutes then remove from heat. Stir in flour and blend with fork. Return to heat and slowly add broth, mixing with wire whisk until smooth. Simmer on low heat until vegetables are nearly tender but not mushy.
For the crust, stir baking powder, soda and salt into flour and mix well. Cut cold butter (you can freeze it for best results) into flour mixture until only chunks the size of walnuts remain. Add cheese. (A nice addition is to add some chopped fresh rosemary to the crust but this is optional). Beat the egg with the buttermilk and stir into the dough. Gather the dough into a ball, place in the refrigerator in a plastic bag for 10-15 minutes to rest. This prevents gluten from developing.



It's important not to overwork the dough or you will cause it to become tough. Roll dough out on board to 1/2 inch thick. Cut out rounds of dough with a 2-3 inch biscuit cutter.



Put cooled chicken mixture in deep dish casserole. Place rounds of biscuit dough until chicken mixture is covered. Brush top with milk or cream.



Bake at 425 degrees F for approximately 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.



Optional: Use Pillsbury flaky biscuits (from a tube) as a substitute when in a hurry.

a rotisserie chicken
a can of cream of chicken soup
a can of water chestnuts
a bag of celery
a sleeve of Ritz crackers
some slivered almonds
1/2 stick of butter
Preheat oven to 375. Cut up celery in small bites and cook with 1/4 stick of butter for 5-10 minutes. Pick apart chicken and put in bowl. Mix can of soup, water chestnuts, and the cooked celery in with the chicken. Transfer to baking dish (I use a 9" square glass dish). Melt the remaining butter in seperate bowl. Crush the sleeve of Ritz and add to melted butter. Stir up. Dump and spread Ritz over top of casserole. Sprinkle slivered almonds on top. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes and ENJOY!

You can do a kids chicken curry with one of those sauces specially made for kids (so you know its not too spicy), my nephews love it.
Or you could do none spicy chicken fajitas, kids love to hold their food.
You could toast some bread, throw it in a blender, cut the chicken into strips coat the chicken in flour, then egg then the breadcrumbs and you have chicken goujons, serve it with ketchup for the kids to dip.
Thats 3 meals, hope that helps

My mum's chicken casserole was always the best ever!
Chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks or portions) are good for this.
Seal them first in a frying pan, frying on both sides until browned slightly then put them in a casserole dish,



To the frying pan, (wok is ideal for this) add a little oil, a chopped onion, garlic if your kids like it and fry until softened, then add a whole teaspoon of paprika and one to two teaspoons of cornflour.



Add a pint of chicken stock and a tin of plum tomatoes.  Bring to the boil, then cover and leave to simmer for 20-30 minutes.



Finally, add a tin of cooked, drained red kidney beans, and pour the whole lot over the chicken you put in the casserole dish, then pop in the oven for an hour.
To serve, you can serve rice, or mashed potato, the latter is my favourite and it is so delicious it is beyond belief, but not expensive, and very tasty.
Enjoy!
P.s, can I come for a roast chicken dinner, I love them? lol.

My 18 month old, and 5 year old both love Garlic CHicken strips, and so do we, their good for the whole family! And they are sooo easy!



2 Lbs boneless skinless chicken breast cut into strips
1 1/2 sticks butter melted
2 stacks saltine crackers
1/2 C parm cheese
2 teaspoons garlic salt
3 Tablespoons dried parsley flakes



Preheat oven to 350. Cut breasts into strips. Dip strips into butter, then into breading. Place in pan, and bake 20-30 minutes. Do not over bake. serves 4-5!



When dipping the chicken in the breading, usually the chicken will absorb the garlic salt and parm cheese faster than the rest of the reading, so half way threw I always just add a little more of each to the breading so that they don't get to bland! I also take some of the leftover breading and sprinkle it on the chicken before I bake it, yummy!!

Chicken and vegetable kebabs are great, especially if you marinate the chicken first.  I normally use a sweet chilli sauce for marinating, but might be a bit spicy for children - perhaps simply soy sauce or olive oil and herbs, or a honey & mustard marinade instead?



Then use whatever vegetables you have and/ or they like. Aubergine (egg plant), mini cherry tomatoes, olives (pitted), pepper and button mushrooms do well.  Sometimes I combine or substitute chicken with Halumi too.



Traditionally they're grilled on skewers but I find it too much work. So just cube everything then roast it all together on a tray for about 40 minutes with a bit of olive oil and herbs, then serve with pitta bread and a bit of salad if I've got some in.



Easy for the kids to eat with ther fingers too :-)

This is my absolute favorite:
http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler...
There are about 90 recipes for scones on the foodnetwork.com site and my favorites are Tyler Florence's.  I've made these scones lots of times and they always come out terrific.  And they are super simple.  This recipe calls for regular flour as opposed to self-rising and uses cream.  Be very careful not to overwork the dough and they will be tender and delicious.

Scones are traditional cooked pastries that are simple and easy to make, and delicious to eat.you have to use self-raising flour.



[edit] Ingredients



* 200g (1 3/4 Cup) self raising flour



* 1/4 pint (1/2 cup) milk



* 50g (1/4 Cup) butter or margarine, chilled



* salt



* 50g (1/2 Cup) filling - any fruit, chocolate



* spices



* 1/4 cup sugar



[edit] Steps



1. Heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.



2. Lightly grease a baking sheet.



3. Mix together the flour and salt.



4. Rub in the butter.



5. Stir in the sugar.



6. Add the milk to get a soft dough.



7. Turn on to a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out to a round 2cm/¾in thick.



8. Use a 5cm/2in cutter to stamp out rounds and place on a baking sheet.



9. Lightly knead together the rest of the dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up.



10. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.



11. Cool on a wire rack and serve with butter and good jam and maybe some clotted cream.



[edit] Tips



* The less you handle the mixture the better. Fast and light with the touch.



* Chill the butter well and cut into small pieces before rubbing in.



* Chocolate chip scones are very nice to take to school for break.



* When cutting the scones, don't twist the cutter or glass as it breaks up the scone so they won't rise as well.



* If your scones do not rise as high as you want, place them higher up in the oven.



* An alternative shape is: after you make the dough into a circle, run a knife through it like a cake so you have triangles.

I never had that burning problem myself. One thing I have heard about cheese free pizza is, that you'll want to eat it within a few hours after it comes out of the oven, and that it's something about the combination of cheese and tomatoes that keeps the pizza tasty thru the next day.



I can't vouch for it myself, though, because I usually eat my pizza right away. I only once left half a pizza for the next morning, but by then ants had found their way to it.



The people criticizing your cheese free pizza have a point, though. I have never actually seen one. I have seen tomato free pizzas, though, where the tomatos have been replaced with cream, but those aren't called pizza.

See link below for pizza dough.



The toppings you have suggested will probably burn so put the dough in the oven first until almost cooked then put the toppings on just to heat through.

Easiest way is to get a packet of dough mix from a supermarket.



I make it as follows:
500g plain flour
7g fresh yeast (don't like the dried stuff myself but use as per instructions if you do)
equal amounts of milk and water
1 egg
1 tsp sugar
3 tbsp olive oil
½tsp salt.



Liven up the yeast in some water/milk/sugar for 5 mins until your wife complains about the yeasty smell.  Mix the mixture into the flour.  Add water in small amounts, mix in and when it forms a ball that isn't that sticky it's ready.  Add the salt, and knead it for 5 mins gently.  The harder you knead it the more bisuity the base will be, if you want a thin crust then work it hard.



Put it in a warm place for 45mins or so, until it has doubled in size.  You don't need to let it rise twice.  Then just roll it out and put your toppings on.



Now for the toppings.



Pizza without cheese isn't as nice as with, but I guess you have your reasons, presumably you're vegan or lactose intolerant.  Paint the rolled out disk with plenty of olive oil, and season well with seasalt and black pepper.



The tomato puree wouldn't burn, but will dry out.  You should use passata (sieved tomato) which tastes like puree but is a bit more watery.  You could also use chopped tomatoes or fresh and add the purée.



Add plenty of oregano and fresh basil, they will bring out the taste of the tomatoes and red pepper.



I often make pizza bianca (literally 'white pizza') with cheese, garlic, basil, pork sausage which I buy in Italy but with no tomatoes, it's very nice. Most people would baulk but in Italy it's a lot more common. I haven't seen cheeseless pizza there though.



Cook for 10 mins in a 200C oven.

Despite your remarks, a pizza without cheese isn't a pizza - it's a FLAN, and you will have to cook the pastry first  because nothing else will hold the heat like cheese would whilst the pastry is cooking. With regards to the 'dough' you might just as well use shortcrust pastry - I mean, you're not making a pizza so why would you want pizza dough!

1 t. sugar

2 1/2 cups all purpose flour



Dissolve yeast in warm water about 5 minutes.  In large bowl, combine remaining ingredients, mix in yeast mixture.  Beat vigorously about 20 strokes.  Cover and let rest 5 minutes.  Punch down then pat evenly into 12" pizza pan.  Spread 1 cup of sauce over dough, top with desired toppings.  Bake at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes.



And, no, your toppings won't burn up, but if you want your toppings to be more firm, add them after your pizza pie has been cooking for 10 minutes.

Arh yeah, all those stupid answers that are like, "pizza without cheese is not a real pizza!" It's like... so?!?



3 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons of olive oil
2 teaspoons of honey
1 cup of warm water
1 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of yeast



Put warm water into a bowl. Add salt and honey and mix with a spoon. Add yeast, mix and let it sit for about 10 minutes.



Gradually add flour and olive oil and start mixing.



When the mixture gets too heavy to mix, start kneading the dough with your hands.



Knead the dough until you have a smooth ball. If the dough cracks it is too dry. Add water bit by bit until if forms a nice coherent ball. If your dough feels more like batter, it is too wet and you need to add flour bit by bit. If you need to add water or flour, do it by small amounts.



Coat the dough with olive oil, place it in a large bowl and cover it with kitchen wrap or a grocery bag. Let the dough rise for about an hour at room temperature, then push it down again so it deflates. Let it sit for about another hour. If you want to use it the next day, put it in a refrigerator.



Put the dough on a lightly floured surface, put a bit of flour on top and make it into the shape of a pie by stretching it out from the center outwards. Use a rolling pin until the dough is about 1/4" thick. Punch some holes in the dough with a fork to let the air escape while the pizza is in the oven.



With the burning, yeah, just put your dough in the oven for a while, and then all the toppings you want. :) Simple and easy.

Failing that....wagyu beef from Japan...take a couple of fillets out of your freezer and defrost them.Cooked rare, it's probably the best steak in the world.

Just bear in mind the following:-



Patrick Wall, chairman of the European Food Safety Authority, recently asked whether it is "morally or ethically correct" to feed grain to animals while people starve. Rearing animals for human consumption is a shocking waste of resources: 16lbs of grain are needed to produce just 1lb of animal flesh. The world's cattle alone consume the same amount of calories it would take to feed more 8.7 billion people – that’s more than the entire human population on Earth.



Some more statistics for you: ninety per cent of the agricultural land in the UK is used to raise livestock, but still we do not have enough grain and so we import 46 million tonnes annually from developing countries. These are countries which not only suffer environmental degradation as a result but, in many cases, cannot afford to feed their own people. Every day, 24,000 people die from hunger and hunger-related causes; 75 per cent of them children less than five years old. Meanwhile, millions of tonnes of grain are being siphoned off to feed animals destined for the already groaning dining tables of countries with the fattest populations in the world.



Factory farming puts a serious strain on our water supplies too. While millions face drought, much of the world's water supply is diverted to animal agriculture. A study this year by the Stockholm International Water Institute, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Water Management Institute found it takes up to 4,000 litres of water to produce one kilogramme of wheat but up to 20,000 litres of water to produce one kilogramme of beef. A totally vegetarian diet requires 300 gallons of water per day, while a meat-eating diet requires more than 4,000 gallons of water per day.

Shouldn't the water in a crock pot be simmering.?



It's my first time!



I have some chicken legs in there.  On low for 8 hours.  They are completely covered by the water.  I guess it's like 1/3, or barely 1/2, full of water.  It's been 2 hours and the water isn't simmering.  The first 1/2 hour I did on high.  I do hear a little popping here and there, pretty rare.  The legs were kinda frozen.

The liquids in my crockpot really don't start to simmer until after cooking for several hours, especially when on low.  And, yeah, I will occasionally hear the lid rattle while it's cooking.  Since your chicken was frozen, may take a little longer to heat up.

Take any recipe that calls for ground beef, such as spaghetti or chili or whatever. Then, after you fry the hamburger, put it in a collander and rinse it with hot hot water. You can remove practically ALL of the fat from ground beef this way.



Of course, you'll lose some flavor, too. Let's face it, fat tastes good. So add extra spices.

How to coat a banana in yogurt and freeze it without making a mess?



I've been told that frozen banana and frozen yogurt are both delicious...so I was wondering what it would be like if I combined the two (coat a banana in yogurt and freeze it). Question is, is there any feasible way I can do this without making a whole load of mess in my freezer? I thought about rolling a banana in a dish of yogurt and putting the banana in the dish in the freezer...but I don't have room for that at the moment. Any ideas? Would using the ice compartment in my fridge work for freezing the yogurt and banana?

Try freezing the banana first then when you coat it with the yoghurt, the yoghurt should stick to the banana, then carry on freezing.
If you use a tray, line it with greaseproof paper and put folds in it to form a ridge to help support the yoghurt and stop it from spreading.

I think Fajitas are really easy, all you need is Ole El Paso Fajita box (the original BBQ), Chicken breast (approx 3), peppers x 2, onion, (we add mushrooms as we like them), Guacamole dip, sour cream dip, grated cheddar.



It is so straight forward, heat the chicken in some oil, dice all the veg and add once the chicken is cooked through, heat together and sprinkle of the seasoning in the box.



Heat the tortillas either in the oven or in a microwave.



When you feel everything is cooked enough (i like my peppers to be warm but crunchy!) put the chicken mix on to plates, place the fajitas, dips and grated cheese in the middle of the table and enjoy.



Hope this helps

Don't be ashamed that you can't cook ... take time to learn simple things like spag bol, chilli or curry.  Use ready made sauces and read the instructions.  Once you have mastered them then you can change the dish to suit your taste.



If your man likes to cook, let him.  Offer to help and then you can pick up a few tips on the way.



Good luck ... this time next year you will be cooking and hosting a dinner party for 8 people, believe me!

Don't fret about not being able to cook - "all women should know how to cook" is a fallacy, in the past maybe but as many of us work now and don't grow up watching our mums in the kitchen anymore this has changed.  There are lots of things that are easy to cook, stews are one of the simplest and for me there's nothing better in the winter than mince, potatoes and dumplings - also very easy.  As is macaroni cheese.  Do a search and look for the simplest recipes, if you want I can email you how I do them (my recipes are very basic because I'm not a big cook either however they seem to go down well with my partner).

No you do not need to be a domestic goddess, just cook a stir fry tonight all you need to do is boil some rice (use boil in the bag rice because it won't stick to the pan) and while that's cooking pan fry some pieces of chicken and cut up some vegetables (any you have in the house), make some chicken stock using some Knor stock powder because it's better that the stock cubes as it dissolves quicker. Heat up some olive oil* in a big wok (a large frying pan will do if you don't have one) then mix up the rice chicken and vegetables for about 2 minutes and keep stirring while it cooks it so that it does not stick to the pan and that's it.

Panic ye not!
One pot cooking can be your new friend!  Anyhoo, if your man is a good cook, let him do that, and you be in charge of another big household task.
However, chilli con carne, spaghetti bolognese, chicken casserole, they are all the sorts of things where you just put one ingredient in the pan, stir it round for a bit on medium heat, stick the next ingredient(s) in and keep going until you add the stock, then leave it for 20 minutes to half an hour (longer for the chicken casserole) stirring occasionally to avoid sticking.
If all else fails, pasta, cooked with a jar of home pride bake in sauce, with some cheese on the top looks pretty impressive and tastes lovely.
No one will ever know that it's not your own recipe, if you hide the jar, lol.



Simple dishes can be the novice cook's friend.



I think Lasagne is quite easy to make, you just layer the mince, and other ingredients in between sheets of pasta with the bechemel sauce, but other stuffs are easier.  Get yourself a cheats cook book, with easy to make stuff in it and give the cheaper stuff a whirl to build your confidence.



Home made pizza is really easy too, buy bases, add your favourite ingredients, then stick grated mozzarella on top then bake for the recommended time on the pizza base box.
Once you master the easier stuff, move on to something that's slightly more difficult, but as long as you alternate a lot of easy dishes, I am sure it will all be fine.  After all, souffle and creme brulee would be boring if it were served every day!

Just heat the pan, put some oil then garlic if you like,then some vegetables(any you like) add shrimps, stir for a bit add some oyster sous ,then add precooked rice and fry all together ,till done. You could also add bitten egg in a process or extra soy sous. Et,s really easy and fast,and delicious.Man usually love this food,and kids too

2. Cooking Directions
In a large resealable plastic bag or shallow glass dish, combine the first eight ingredients; mix well. Remove 2/3 cup for basting; refrigerate. Add beef to remaining marinade; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Drain and discard the marinade.
On metal or soaked bamboo skewers, alternate beef, green peppers, tomatoes and onions. Place on a greased rack in a broiler pan; broil 5 in. from the heat for 3 minutes on each side. Baste with reserved marinade. Continue broiling, turning and basting for 8-10 minutes or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F medium, 160 degrees F well-done, 170 degrees F).

Sure you can -- sprinkle some flour into the fat, whisk well until incorporated. Keep adding bits of flour until all the fat is absorbed and let cook over medium heat about a minute.  Gradually add water and continue to whisk to avoid lumps.  Keep adding water, a little at a time, until your gravy is the consistency you like.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

Why would it have to come from oven baked turkey if it's for steak? If you have the juices and/or fat from anything, simply add some all purpose flour with a small amount of liquid (water, stock or whatever). Mix until a smooth cream, then add liquid a little at a time. Your gravy will taste of whatever you've cooked (as it should). Gravy browning essence or Parisian essence will give it a good color if it's a bit pale.

Country Fried Steak Gravy



Make the gravy by adding the 2 tablespoons remaining flour to the pan drippings, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon. Stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and the salt. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until the flour is medium brown and the mixture is bubbly. Slowly add the whole milk and the Ac'cent, if using stirring constantly. Return the steaks to the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low, and place the onions on top of the steaks. Cover the pan, and let simmer for 30 minutes.



Here are two basic ways of making gravy from roast drippings, one using corn starch, the other using flour. In each case, you start with the roast drippings. You may have much more drippings than you need for the amount of gravy you want to make. You can follow this guideline - for each cup of gravy you would like to make, start with a tablespoon of drippings. So, if you want to make 2 cups of gravy, drain all but 2 tablespoons of fat and drippings from the roasting pan (set aside for future use). These instructions will be for the end result of 2 cups of gravy, but you can easily divide or multiply to adjust for how much gravy you want to make.



Making Gravy with Corn Starch



Remove the roast from the pan. Place pan on stove on medium high heat. Pour off all but 2 Tbsp of the drippings in the pan.
Dissolve 2 Tbsp of corn starch in the minimum amount of water needed to make a thin paste - about 1/4 cup. Pour into pan with drippings and use a wire whisk or spatula (as pictured) to blend into the drippings
Stir with a wire whisk until the gravy begins to thicken. As it thickens, slowly add water, stock, milk, or cream, or some combination to the pan. Alternate stirring and adding liquid, maintaining the consistency you want, for several minutes (about 5). You will probably add about 2 cups of liquid all together. Taking into consideration the evaporation that is occurring while you are cooking, you will end up with about 2 cups of gravy. Season with salt



Making Gravy with Flour



Remove the roast from the pan. Place pan on stove on medium high heat. Pour off all but 2 Tbsp of the drippings in the pan.
Into the 2 tablespoons of drippings in the pan stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour. Stir with a wire whisk until the flour has thickened and the gravy is smooth. Continue to cook slowly to brown the flour, and stir constantly.
Slowly add back some of the previously removed drippings (remove some of the fat beforehand if there is a lot of fat). In addition, add either water, milk, stock, or cream to the gravy, enough to make 2 cups. Season the gravy with salt and pepper and herbs.

Sure you can. While your steak is resting, make yourself some gravy.



Take your steak out and put it on a plate and cover lightly with aluminum foil to keep it warm.



Use the grease/drippings from the steak to make your gravy. Turn your heat up on your pan to about medium-medium high. You should have at least 1 tablespoon of drippings. If not, add yourself a little veggie oil to make a tablespoon. Then I add 1 tablespoon flour to the pan and mix thoroughly with the drippings. Constantly stirring I cook over the heat for a couple minutes. You'll notice a slight nutty aroma.



Reduce your heat. At this point I add some wine about 1/4 C (remove the pan from the heat before you do this) and mix thoroughly. I put the pan back on the heat then turn the heat back to med-high. Then I add either beef broth if I have some or just water while constantly stirring. The amount of water depends on the thickness you want your gravy. I stir and let it cook for a couple minutes, add some salt and pepper and enjoy.

Actually the best gravy for steaks (meaning top sirloin, porterhouse, etc.) is to deglaze the pan. Add a bit of red wine and bring to a boil while scraping up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan. You can add a bit of shallot or chopped onion, maybe a bit of garlic, plus salt and pepper while deglazing the pan. Makes a yummy pan sauce.

It's good.  You might want to start off with a little, say a couple of tablespoons in the meatloaf, then make a glaze or sauce for using at the table.  If it's not enough flavor, the next time you make it add another tablespoon or two.

Yes, I have made it before and it turned out great.  It is sweeter than traditional meatloaf. I made mine by adding 1 pkg. NOH Hawaiian Style Teri-Burger Mix dissolved in 1/2 cup water to one pound meat.
Make sure you are using your teriyaki sauce in place of the Worcestershire sauce and/or ketchup or it will be too moist. Serve it with oriental rice and stir fried veggies.  Yum...now I am hungry!

Thanks everyone-Octopus it is as it's quick and easy!  All the other feedback was appreciated (although I'm not sure even I would even eat eel and rice not alone the girls....) the other two answers with the recipes sounds too lovely for my hubby to miss out so I'll save those for another day!

We had Fiesta Tortellini (tortellini, steamed carrots, bell peppers, cocktail onions, sugar snap peas, scallions) with white cream sauce (like alfredo but without the cheese); apple & pear salad (different apples and pears peeled & cubed, with a little blue cheese dressing & walnuts on romaine); Double chocolate pudding for after.



Tonight was our vegetarian night.  Normally we might add a protein to the tortellini like shrimp or scallops.  Total time spent making dinner was 15 minutes to prep and 15 to cook.

I'm going on the assumption you'll be eating, too:



Ingredients:
4-6 Lamb chops (I normally do 2 per person, but if they're small then one each should do)
2 TBS honey (any sort should do, as long as it's not set)
1 lemon, fresh
2-3 cloves of garlic
1-2 tsp rosemary (pref. fresh, but you can use dried)
1 medium onion (I use red onions, but it's just preference)
1-2 leeks
3 cups kale
A little cooking oil (I use peanut, but safflower or canola will work)
Extra virgin olive oil



1. Mince or crush the garlic, slice the onion and leeks. If you're using fresh rosemary, then chop it fine.



2. Mix the honey and about half the lemon's worth of juice together (about 3:1). Mix in the rosemary and about 1tsp of the garlic. (Adjust to taste, and add salt and pepper if reqd.)



3. Heat up a little cooking oil in a skillet to a high heat, meanwhile preheat a grill to low-medium heat



4. Sear the lamb in the skillet briefly - the outside should brown but not blacken



4. Coat one side of the lamb with a thin layer of the glaze, and carefully transfer it to the grill, glaze up. Then add the leek and onion to the skillet, and turn the heat down a little.



5. Sautée the leek and onion for about 7 minutes, turn the heat down a bit more, then add the kale, add a dash more cooking oil, and stir it around until all the kale looks very deep green. Cover the skillet with something. It should be just hot enough that it only just makes a very faint sizzling sound.



6. When the chops are done on one side, turn them over, glaze the other sides, and grill 'til nearly done.



7. Remove the cover on the skillet, make a little bed on each plate with the green, sprinkle the rest of the garlic over the top, squeeze some lemon juice on, and drizzle on a generous amount of the olive oil.



8. Transfer lamb chops to bed of green, serve, enjoy.

Rinse the chicken both inside and out. Be sure to remove the giblets, heart and gizzard from inside the chicken. Pat dry with clean paper towels.



Rub olive oil on the skin. Season with garlic, salt and pepper. If you can find some rosemary, crush it between your fingers or in your palm, rub the seasonings on the outside of the chicken.



Place the chicken on a roasting rack and put it in a shallow pan or roasting pan. Roast until the chicken is crisp and golden. I think the internal temp should be 165 degrees F. Check a cookbook to be sure as my old memory is gettin' old! LOL!



To make some nifty potatoes:  Peel the potatoes and cut them into large chunks. Place in a 8 x 8 or 9 x 9-inch baking pan. Toss in a bit of olive oil (about a 1/4 cup) and season with garlic and onion powders, salt and pepper, plus a bit of paprika. Place in the oven about 30 to 40 minutes before the chicken roasting time is nearly ended. Roast until crisp and golden.



Remove the chicken to the cutting board and let rest for a few minutes. Carve and serve with the roasted potatoes.

You can put butter on the skin to make the skin crispy add a little salt too. I'd say cook it for about 2 hours nice and slow. Gas Mark 4.  Keep basting it - the juices that come out of the chicken, spoon them back over the chicken to keep the meat moist. Do that every half an hour if you can.
cook the potatoes for about 20 mins or until you can get a knife cleanly through them. cook the veg separately till that is cooked - depends on what you have depends on how long it takes.
Good Luck and I'm sure whatever you do he will be delighted with it because you made an effort.

Ok try this out. I did once and it turned out amazing!



2 tablespoons of butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
salt
rosemary or thyme (this is optional so dont worry if you dont have it)
garlic



Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Rinse the chicken well, and dry thoroughly with paper towels. Rub the inside cavity of the chicken with kosher salt. If you like rub the outside of the chicken with peeled, halved garlic cloves, and add whole unpeeled garlic cloves to the roasting pan. Crush the peppercorns with the flat of a heavy chef's knife, pounding with your hand, or with the bottom of a heavy pan. Rub the cracked peppercorns all over the outside of the chicken, along with more salt. If you're stuffing the chicken, stuff the cavity at this point. Otherwise, you may insert a few sprigs of fresh herbs into the cavity. For more even cooking and a neater appearance at presentation, truss the chicken: Tuck the wings in under themselves, and pass the middle of a 5-foot length of kitchen string under the tail, making a loose single knot across the drumsticks. Slip the string under the ends of the drumsticks, pulling them together tightly. Bring the ends of the string along the body of the chicken toward the neck end. Position the string so that it pulls tightly across the drumstick-thigh joint. Make a single knot at the neck opening. Bring the ends of the string back up toward the tail, along the first length of string. Tie a single knot catching the loose skin on either side of the open cavity (this helps keep the stuffing in). Pull the string over the drumsticks and tie a tight double knot, catching the tip of the breast. The chicken should be a neat, compact shape, and the cavity should be tightly closed.



Select a large cast-iron skillet, a heavy sauté pan, or any sturdy pan that's large enough to hold the bird and can go from stovetop to oven. Melt the butter in the pan, and add the olive oil, and heat. Put the chicken in the pan over medium heat and turn the chicken to coat it with the butter and oil mixture. Set the chicken on its side and put the pan on the middle rack of the 475°F oven and roast for 15 minutes. Turn the chicken to the other side and roast another 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 400°F, turn the chicken breast side up, and continue roasting for 25-30 minutes, basting with the pan juices every 5 minutes.



I used this reciep i found a couple months ago and the chicken was to die for. Heres the website if you want to check it out yourself.  Hope this helps some. If you don't like this one I have one other one that I made up.

I need some good advice for cooking sausage!?



OK, so I tried making some sausage in a fry pan....just sprayed some Pam on it and put the sausages on. I had the heat on low-low/middle heat.  Seemed that the outsides started getting faster than the outside....blacker on the outside but the insides weren't exactly "cooked" color.



What color should I be looking for on the inside of the sausage? Grey or a bit red?  Thanks for any general tips

Well, at least you tried and we've all done this before, so don't beat yourself up about it, at least you're not to prideful to ask for help.  I always do my sausage in a large, flat pan with a water bath to begin with, about 1/4 of the way up to your sausage links and drizzle some Olive Oil in the pan as well. Cook your sausage on Medium High heat and while the water evaporates out of the pan, this will cook the inside of your sausage. Then, once the water evaporates, the olive oil will take over and lightly brown the skin of your sausage and seal all those wonderful flavors inside!  When your sausage is done, you should see a uniform color upon cutting into it, a light grey color, no pink or red at all.  Please remember, that differently flavored sausages might be different in color on the outside, but the inside should be the same, basically. For an exact internal temperature, it should be 160 at least. Hope this helps you to enjoy your safely cooked sausage and this was a good question to ask!  Happy Cooking to you!

They should look grey.
At that temperature you should be having no trouble, you just want them to gently sizzle.



I find it better to grill broil, about 8" from the heat, on a rack in a pan.

I generally make a bleeding heart cake for our annual pumpkin carving party  (Pumpkinfest). Sometimes the heart beats, sometimes it's anatomically correct, and so on and so forth. This year I decided to go the whole hog and make an entire thoracic cavity cake. The plan was for each organ to be made out of a



different kind of cake and to secrete a different color of fluid when it was cut into. Previous heart cakes have bled fresh, homemade raspberry sauce. This year I made raspberry, strawberry, kiwi, mango, and blueberry sauces. Sadly,



the organs didn't bleed as well as I had hoped when I cut the cake, as each organ was relatively small and couldn't hold much sauce. Also all the moving around after filling the organs made it hard to keep the sauce contained in the little cavities I hollowed out. The heart bled pretty well, but the other organ fluids weren't very dramatic. On the bright side, there were lots of leftover



sauces, which were all quite delicious. But I'm getting ahead of myself. My intended organ-cake-sauce combinations were as follows.

Make your own vanilla extract.



HOME-BREWED VANILLA EXTRACT



2 c. vodka
5 vanilla beans, cut into 1 inch pieces



Combine vodka and vanilla beans in a jar with a tight fitting lid. Cover the jar and let it stand 6 to 8 weeks. The vodka mixture will turn amber colored after a day or two.
After half the vanilla extract is used, add more vodka to cover the beans. The flavor in the beans is gone when the vodka no longer turns to a dark color. Yield: 2 cups.

I am not sure what the name is for this rolling pin but I love my wooden rolling pin. It is a Martha Stewart (don't laugh that's all I could find here at Kmart) and a solid wood pin with tapered ends, an no rollers. It is the best rolling pin I have ever used. Sure beats the rolling pin with rollers.

hi few days ago, i did the same, made soup with the stock and then had the flesh left, i know its kinda tough to work with boiled meat. what i did is, i took the flesh, and then mixed a little bit of black pepper, some tomatoes,  then i used it for a sandwich, first i put lettuce on one bread, then put some ketchup then placed the chicken on it, after that topped the chicken with another lettuce, and some more ketchup, it tasted good!!! hopefully u'll like it too

I don't know what Coronation chicken is but if it is a fairly bland recipe then there are lots of ways to recycle cooked chicken. Here's some ideas:



Barbecue chicken sandwiches. Add chicken to saucepan and moisten with favorite barbecue sauce. Heat until warm.



Creamed chicken:  Add a bit of thinned cream of mushroom soup (or any other favorite cream based soup) to a pan. Thin the soup with a bit of milk, cream or half and half. Add the chicken and heat through. For color add chopped pimientos or peas and carrots. Serve over toast points, biscuits or rice.



Chicken Pot Pie: Follow the creamed chicken recipe except add vegetables including potatoes. Turn out into a lined pastry pan. Top with the remaining pie crust. Vent and bake. You will need a double crust pie for this recipe.



Curried Chicken: Follow cream chicken recipe except add curry powder to taste. Serve with favorite curry condiments. Serve over rice.

CHICKEN & SWEET CORN SOUP



Serves 2



INGREDIENTS



1 egg



1 chicken breast (either fresh or leftover from a roast chicken)
1 tablespoon of sunflower oil (if you are using a fresh chicken breast)
200g (½ a 400g tin) of creamed sweet corn



1 chicken stock cube
500ml of water



Ground pepper to taste



METHOD



Break the egg into a bowl and pick out any bits of shell. Mix up the egg.



If you are using a fresh chicken breast, cut it into thin strips. Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Fry the chicken for about 5 minutes. Stir frequently to stop it sticking.



If you are using a leftover chicken breast, tear it into thin strips.



Put the chicken and sweet corn into a saucepan on a medium heat. Crumble the stock cube into the water and pour it into the pan. Mix thoroughly. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils, for about 10 to 15 minutes.



Slowly pour the egg into the soup, stirring gently all the time to form ‘strings' of cooked egg. If the soup reaches the desired consistency before you’ve added all of the egg, stop adding the egg.



Season with the pepper.



ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES



If you want a thick soup, add ½ a tablespoon of cornflour mixed with a little water towards the end of the cooking.



For Creamed Sweet Corn Soup, omit the chicken and substitute a vegetable stock cube for the chicken one.

Sounds like the recipes your refering to have Rice milk or powdered rice in the crust. If thats the case Heres one with rice in the crust and one with rice milk. And if thats not what your looking for ask for the recipe from one person who does use it in the recipe.



Rice based piecrust
Makes two 10-inch pie shells



2/3 cup rice flour



1/4 cup tapioca flour



3 tbsp potato starch



1 tsp xantham gum



1/4 tsp salt



1 tbsp sugar



1/4 tsp Gluten-free baking powder



3 tbsp cold dairy-free margerine (omit and double the shortening below if you can't find a suitable margerine)



3 tbsp cold vegetable shortening in small pieces



1



egg yolk



3 tsp cold water



1 tsp cider vinegar



Blend the dry ingredients.



Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles a course meal. Add egg yolk, water, and vinegar.
Blend.



Wrap dough in plastic and press into a ball. Chill for 1 hour. 4. Between two sheets of plastic wrap, roll dough out into a 12-inch circle (about 1/4-inch thick). Remove top sheet of plastic wrap and flip pastry onto a 10-inch pie plate. Keeping the plastic wrap over the top of the crust, pat it into the pan, piecing together any parts that separate when the crust lands in the pan. Remove the second sheet of plastic wrap. Crimp edges.



Dairy Free Pumpkin Pie filling
Makes two nine inch pies



1 cup sugar (1-1/2 cup if using the rice-based crust)



1/4  cup  Brown Rice Cream hot cereal mix (or tapioca pudding mix (tapioca pearls work ok, too)). The rice cereal really helps the pie firm up.



1/4  cup  tapioca flour (or omit and double the rice cereal or tapioca mix above)



1  tsp.  Salt



1  tsp.  Ground cinnamon



1/4  tsp.  Ground cloves



1/4  tsp.  Ground ginger



4



large whole eggs



2



large egg whites



1  can  (29 oz.) Libby's “100% Pure Pumpkin”



3  cups  rice milk (soy is OK too if you like it).



Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Mix sugar, salt, cinnamon, clover, ginger, and tapioca into a small bowl.



Beat eggs in a large bowl (I use the main mixing bowl for my big mixer) and then add the canned pumpkin. Running the mixer, add the sugar/spice mix, lastly add the rice milk. Mix thoroughly.



Pour into the pie shells. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, turn down to 350 degrees (maybe open the oven door for a sec to let some heat out), turn the pies a bit if spots of the crust are burning, and bake for another 40 minutes.



Usually you test a pumpkin pie for "doneness" by sticking a knife in the center and it's done if nothing sticks when you pull it out. That doesn't work with this recipe since it isn't doesn't make a pie that solid (when hot out of the oven). So, I say the pies are done if he center is not completely liquid. If you care, the pies solidify nicely when refrigerated overnight. However, mine rarely survive long enough to even cool down ...

Stuffing is the obvious answer. If you want something sweet, try making an Indian Pudding. Milk, eggs, sugar, nutmeg, molasses, cinnamon. Bake it in a covered water bath on medium heat (350) for about 2 hours

I can't remember exactly, but it has to do something with a chemical balance. Baking Soda is already well balanced, but when we add stuff like chocolate to a mixture, it throws the balance off, so we have to add baking powder. Check out the muffin episode of Good Eats.

Baking powder is self-rising. It actually has some baking soda in it, but it also has something acidic that will react with any liquid in your batter and cause bubbles that will make the cake (or whatever rise).



Baking soda requires something acidic to cause it to rise, so you'll often see baking soda used in recipes such as buttermilk biscuits or banana bread.



You can see the difference easily: put a little baking powder in some water and you'll see it fizz; baking soda will just sit there.



If you don't have baking powder and you want to make a recipe, simply use about a teaspoon of baking soda instead and add a couple teaspoons of white vinegar to the liquid.

What Is the Difference Between Baking Soda & Baking Powder?

Question: What Is the Difference Between Baking Soda & Baking Powder?



Answer: Both baking soda and baking powder are leavening agents, which means they are added to baked goods before cooking to produce carbon dioxide and cause them to 'rise'. Baking powder contains baking soda, but the two substances are used under different conditions.



Baking Soda



Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate. When baking soda is combined with moisture and an acidic ingredient (e.g., yogurt, chocolate, buttermilk, honey), the resulting chemical reaction produces bubbles of carbon dioxide that expand under oven temperatures, causing baked goods to rise. The reaction begins immediately upon mixing the ingredients, so you need to bake recipes which call for baking soda immediately, or else they will fall flat!



Baking Powder



Baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate, but it includes the acidifying agent already (cream of tartar), and also a drying agent (usually starch). Baking powder is available as single-acting baking powder and as double-acting baking powder. Single-acting powders are activated by moisture, so you must bake recipes which include this product immediately after mixing. Double-acting powders react in two phases and can stand for a while before baking. With double-acting powder, some gas is released at room temperature when the powder is added to dough, but the majority of the gas is released after the temperature of the dough increases in the oven.



How Are Recipes Determined?



Some recipes call for baking soda, while others call for baking powder. Which ingredient is used depends on the other ingredients in the recipe. The ultimate goal is to produce a tasty product with a pleasing texture. Baking soda is basic and will yield a bitter taste unless countered by the acidity of another ingredient, such as buttermilk. You'll find baking soda in cookie recipes. Baking powder contains both an acid and a base and has an overall neutral effect in terms of taste. Recipes that call for baking powder often call for other neutral-tasting ingredients, such as milk. Baking powder is a common ingredient in cakes and biscuits.



Substituting in Recipes



You can substitute baking powder in place of baking soda (you'll need more baking powder and it may affect the taste), but you can't use baking soda when a recipe calls for baking powder. Baking soda by itself lacks the acidity to make a cake rise. However, you can make your own baking powder if you have baking soda and cream of tartar. Simply mix two parts cream of tartar with one part baking soda.

First heat your stock back up. You need to taste it. Use sea salt if possible, Add extra boullion cubes and water to make sure you have enough broth as you will need to reduce it for the maximum richer flavor, anyway simmer on high not (boiling). When it reduces down to a good half pot(enough for veggies to move around), add a spoon of sugar & taste to see if you need salt, add bay leaf, basil carrots, plenty of onions, beans & deboned chicken back to the pot, then potatoes. When it returns to a boil, reduce and simmer with a lid for 45 min or so, tasting every lil bit as potatoes absorb some salt and may require more. Tomatoes would be good, about 1/4 c of celery, green onion tops and 1/4 c chopped cilantro would be the ultimate. When it has cook and veggies are tender, add either wide egg noodles cook 5 min and remove from heat. Let set an hour if possible. If you add rice instead of the noodles it need to cook about 20 more minutes, then remove from heat and let set...Good luck

Some places do the pre-making, some places send recipes but they make you sign a contract that you can never open up a restaurant of your own that has the same style food, or be a direct competitor. That's what happened with Outback Steakhouse and Boulder Creek. But Outback lost their case.

Most franchises will "sell" their recipes to the franchise owner. That's part of the deal from what I understand. I've never had the money to own a franchise so I can't say yup that's true for sure.



Also, most commercial kitchens use prepared products to help complete meals. Good kitchens cook from scratch but most restaurants purchase soup bases, etc. to help with their cooking.

Practice makes perfect.  Start out with easy to make recipes.  Don't look at them as chores, but as time away to spend with yourself.  Have fun, don't worry so much about getting the measuring just right.  As long as you aren't makin' a cake, measurements can usually be approximate.



Buy some common utensils like a good measuring cup, measuring spoons, and a can opener.



Get basics like:
Olive oil
Canned tomatoes
Tomato Sauce
Ground beef
Chicken Breasts
Pasta
Cheeses
Seasonings
Jar of chopped garlic
Sugar



Most men LOVE spaghetti, so you can't go wrong there.



______________________________



The pasta:  bring big pot of water to a boil and add in a dash of salt.
Put half the box of pasta into the water and stir it up a little and let it do its thing.
For about 10-12 mins then pour into a strainer.



Beef:  Put thawed beef into a pan with 2 T water on medium heat.  Break up the meat with a spoon and stir it around as it browns.  Let cook until you see little or no pink.



Add to the sauce.



Sauce:  Pour 1 jar pasta sauce, 1 can tomatoes, 1 spoon of chopped garlic, 1 tsp. sugar into a pot.  Stir and let heat on medium heat for about 10-15 mins.  Reduce heat if it starts to bubble too much.



Put sauce on pasta and serve.  Your guy will love it.



Better yet, get some store-bought garlic bread and salad stuff.  Even better!

Purchase a basic cookbook such as Betty Crocker. Start with simple recipes (roast chicken, oven fried chicken, sandwiches, casseroles) and work your way up the kitchen ladder.



Cooking is fun and easy, if you start out simple.



Also, try to plan something you can make ahead so you can concentrate on the final recipe.



Below is a sample easy menu:



Coleslaw (buy pre-shredded coleslaw mix to use in your recipe) and prepare. Chill until ready to serve.



Oven Fried Chicken. Prepare and bake the chicken.



Mashed Potatoes:  Peel, cook and mash potatoes while the chicken is cooking.



Remove chicken from oven and place on platter.
Add mashed potatoes to serving bowl.
Serve with chilled coleslaw.

Nearly every community out there offers some sort of cooking class for adults, I teach in a program in my area. Check the web. You can also watch the Food network to pick up some tips and most newspapers have food sections that have surprisingly good ideas. There are tons of resources out there. You might never be a gourmet cook but anyone can learn to roast a chicken and make a meatloaf

Yes, it will be similar to a large biscuit.  I would do it on a pizza stone, or in a pizza pan.  I am not sure how you are going to turn it, though.  You may need to be skilled to do that part.

it wont be pancake anymore... it would be just a cake or bread.



pancake is called such because of its pan toasted exterior and soft fluffy inside.



if you baked it in the oven, its cake or bread.



if you cook pancake batter using a waffle maker, its a waffle... not a pancake anymore.

If I left a stew out overnight, is it still okay to eat?



I took it out shortly before 1:30 a.m. to put some in a container for my SO's lunch, and left it on the stove.  Woke up at 6:30 a.m., realized it was left out, and put it back in the fridge.



If I eat it, am I going to die of botulism?



It's vegetable barley stew, homemade, if that matters.

If it is all vegetable, with no meat or meat stock, you're probably fine. (It's the protein that is most susceptible to bacteria). Just reheat it to boiling before you eat more.

No. It is not safe to eat. Botulism is found in canned foods so that shouldn't be a concern but you can get food poisoning from other sources including improperly stored food. Your stew would qualify for improper storage.



Check the USDA web site for more info.

I bought some potato gnocchi for the first time and I was wondering what happens if you add them to a soup. I know you're actually supposed to serve them with sauce and whatnot, but what do you think? Will they break down if I put them in soup?

they won't break down. you just have to make sure you don't let them sit in the hot broth for too long. they will be like dumplings, if they are overcooked they will be tough. the most appealing thing about gnocchi is the pillow like, soft texture of the pasta.

they wont break down at all, but i would cook them seperately and then add them to your soup bowl instead of putting them in your soup as they will absorb too much liquid and get soggy and mushy.

Make the soup and don't add the gnocchi until you are serving it. Any pasta will break down if it's left in a hot broth long enough

Banana bread recipe question?



I have been making banana bread from the same recipe for the last few months, it always comes out good, but my last 2 batches seem a little different then the previous times. It comes out much paler, and not as moist. Does anyone have any idea how it can come out differently if I didn't change anything that I did before? All the ingridents are the same brands as before to.
Thanks

It might be due to the ripeness of the bananas, or the humidity on the day you make the bread.  Riper bananas make a darker, moister bread than yellow/green bananas.

Welcome to the club! That has happened to me before...remember that products of same brand do sometimes have higher or lower qualities, the bananas may have been more ripe or less ripe each time, sugar could be slightly lighter or darker, the eggs could be the same in quantity but slightly larger or smaller each time. You also have to be careful not to over mix the batter and ensure the oven temperature is right and preheated before baking....As long as the consistency and taste is good I think you should be okay...

Do you want to fry.. or bake?



If frying:



There are special seasoning blends made for Seafood.. I would use that. For frying.. coat in egg, then flour (or fish fry), get your oil hot, but not too hot and fry for a few minutes on each side (until med. brown)



It doesn't take too long to fry.

Put this fish in a glass baking dish and smother in marinate.

Just season with salt and pepper...dredge it in flour and fry in about 1/4 inch of oil.  Let it cook a few minutes on one side, then flip.  The key to keeping the crispy fried crust on is to make sure you wait until it's cooked good on the first side before you flip it.



Warning: it WILL stink up your house.  I don't cook fish much because of that.

If you like fish breaded and fried, I suggest that you head to the grocery store and pick up some fish fry coating. It will contain all seasonings needed to cook up crispy and tasty.



My mother taught me to break an egg and mix it with a little water. The egg helps the coating adhere to the fish. Dip the fish in the egg, and then into the coating. Use one hand for each part or you'll end up washing your hands over and over.



Cook the fish at medium to low heat in pre-heated olive oil. Yum.

Frying fish (or any food) really isn't a healthy way to prepare a very healthy food.  Myrecipes.com has a lot of resources for someone just starting out.



An easy recipe for any white fish is to bake it with a little fresh lemon and herbs such as targon or rosemary.  Serve with wild rice and a side of veggies and you have a very clean meal.



Good luck!

Tilipia is a really nice mild white fish, so you can make it in a variety of ways.



You can season it with a spicy seasoning mix like Old Bay and a bit of olive oil and/or butter and slide it under the broiler for about 10 minutes per inch of thickness.



You can roll it in a mix of flour, cornmeal and grated parmesan cheese(about 1/2 c. flour for every c. of cornmeal and 1 tblsp. grated parmesan).  Season with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Heat canola oil on the stove at medium heat until you can feel the heat when you put your hand about an inch from the pan, and then fry on both sides until golden.



You can slide it in a vegetable-based broth and seasonings and poach it.



By the way, if it is fresh or fresh/frozen, it should NEVER stink up the house.

She can butter the bread and put all of the sandwhiches together all by herself so she will feel important  :)  And it is really hard to mess up too.  You can use any kind of cheese that you like or add meat to it too.  My personal favorite is provolone and smoked turkey.

We cant do anything after preparation.



Before preparation, the brinjals should not be kept outside after cutting them. Keeping them in salt water till putting them in the cooking vessel avoids turning bitter.

For brown butter sauce:



Melt butter in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Cook until butter begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Carefully mix in vinegar and thyme.



Meanwhile, working in batches, cook ravioli in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender, about 3 minutes. Using slotted spoon, carefully transfer ravioli to hot butter sauce; spoon sauce over to coat ravioli. Transfer to plates. Sprinkle with pecans, if desired; serve immediately.

1/4 teaspoon salt



1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper



3/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese



If possible, use fresh sage and freshly grated Parmesan to heighten the flavor of this dish. Makes a huge difference!



Heat butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Add sage and slowly cook butter until it begins to brown. (It's okay if the sage darkens and gets crunchy).



Remove from heat.add parmesan cheese, salt and pepper and toss.

Rinse them well before you use them. You can put them in a sauce pan with heavy cream and grated cheese and garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper. Heat over LOW heat until the cheese melts and you can stir it into a smooth sauce. Very retro.

Cream of Pumpkin Soup is nice and very easy for a busy day. (You can substitute any kind of winter squash for the pumpkin.)



Cream of Pumpkin Soup



Serves 6



1 onion, finely chopped



1 TBSP butter



1 lb. can pumpkin (not pie filling)



6 cups chicken broth



salt and pepper, to taste



1 tsp. curry powder



1/2 c. heavy cream



Sour Cream for garnish, if desired.



1. In a large pot, saute the onion in the tablespoon of butter until transparent.



2. Stir in the pumpkin, broth, and seasonings. Simmer on a low heat 1/2 hour.



3. Before serving, stir in the heavy cream. Do not let the soup boil after adding the cream.



4. Serve the soup hot, with or without a dollop of sour cream, and sprinkled with a bit of nutmeg.



This soup is also good served chilled. If you want to serve it chilled, increase the curry powder to 2 tsp. Chill the soup for several hours, and serve with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle with a bit of nutmeg.



To make this a vegetarian soup, substitute canned or homemade vegetable broth for the chicken broth.

I have never heard of Dublin coddle until now when I looked it up - it sounds very rich without adding the pigs feet and tails



Now to answer your question - no I do not fancy eating these even tho I do have some Irish ancestry (it must have leached out of me somehow and that is something I do not mind)



However on occasion my other half does like some pigs feet to chew on as a snack - we just boil them for about an  hour - he just loves 'em but he is of scottish origins  so perhaps the scots and the irish have more in common than they realise

hi mate,



basically you should be cooking them for about 35/40 mins on about 200'c turning inbetween or until the juices flow clear from them!



your chicken is already seasoned but i would say brush on some oil to keep their moisture in more, or even surround them in foil to almost steam them!

I would start them off on a high temp [about 220C] for the first 20 minutes or so, then reduce the heat to 180C and cook for a further 30 minutes [or longer]. That way the meat will fall off the bone. Wrap them in foil first won't you!

I'd heat the oven to 200 celsius or 180 if it's fan assisted. Cook for about 20- 30 mins. Stick a knife in the thickest part and if the juices run clear eat and enjoy. If the juices are at all pink give the chicken a few more minutes in the oven we don't want you being ill.

pumpkin is more fresh and contains more vitamins and minerals than the can since the canning and packaging process depletes vitamins and minerals....also, pumpkin is fresher while can might have been on the stand for years.

The thing to realize with ANYTHING from a can is preservatives. Not that the preservatives are all bad, it's just that they are not really as good as using fresh fruits or veggies in cooking.



Also, depending on what brand you use in can the health contents are not exactly great in a cheaper brand.



Of course, you then have to weigh the option of time. Is a cans negative attributes worth the quicker time of preparing a fresh pumpkin.

By nutritional value do you mean you are counting calories and fiber, or are you merely wondering which is most nutritious (i.e., vitamin content)? Calorie-wise, canned pumpkin and fresh pumpkin will be about the same, but nutritionally fresh pumpkin is light-years better.



For those who say canned is way easier, I reply that you're giving up too easily. I make fresh pumpkin soup, pie, and bread every year and it's just a few steps more than using canned. I buy a small sugar pumpkin, split it with a cleaver, scoop out the seeds with a spoon, and then use the cleaver to cut it into several wedges. Peel the wedges with a carrot peeler (takes all of 30 seconds per wedge) and then you can bake it or whatever. Sooooo easy and delicious.

Frost the entire cake with one color frosting (say chocolate).. Smooth the frosting out by heating your spatula under hot water, dry it and smooth over. Repeat till all smooth. Then take a contrasting color frosting,( say white) put into a little plastic bag and cut the tip of the corner off. Now you can pipe a design of your choice all over the cake or along the sides. It will be one of a kind & look very professional.

I used brown icing all over, smoothed it out like you said, and, with neon food coloring and some white icing, I made a cute swirly thing around the top edge,  wrote "thnx", and put a huge smiley on top, just to give it a cute, teen-ish look. :) (I'm 14...lol)

I used devil food chocolate with a can a cherry pie filling.  Cook until knife inserted down center comes out clean.  The topping is 1 pint sour cream and 1 box vanilla pudding mix.  mix together and use for the topping.  Very easy and the cake comes out moist and yummy.

Try adding about 1-2 tsp of espresso powder or instant coffee. Coffee always accentuates the flavor of chocolate



Also, chocolate and orange pair well together. Grate in some orange zest or about a tsp of orange extract into the batter. Organize a few candied orange rind strips on top for decoration!

You can add things to the batter before you bake it, like chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, etc. Or you could drizzle heated fruit jelly over the top, strawberry and raspberry are the most popular. And of course you could use icing as well to finish off the cake.

I'd recommend a pan sauce. Cook your steak in a saute pan (not non-stick, not cast iron), and when it's done, deglaze (pull up the browned bits from the bottom) the pan with a little high quality chicken or beef stock. Throw in some balsamic vinegar, red wine, butter, and spices, and let it reduce while you let your steak rest.



It's a classic way to make a sauce, and you can vary it very easily.

Yes, I don't know where you are from, but at our local grocery store - Winn Dixie - they have A-1 brand steak sauce - get the sweet hickory flavored kind. It is to die for. Also same section look for a bottle of "tiger sauce", that one is just as good and you can put it on anything. Seafood is really good to use with it.

Soups are your best bet.



Chicken noodle
Vegetable beef
Tomato
Whatever her favorite flavor is!



Give her a side of toast, bagel or fruit - nothing too acidic though.

Not knowing exactly what the procedure was, but when I am feeling a bit out of sorts from something like your mom went through, I go for comfort food.  While you want low in fat, I would recommend some yummy mashed potatoes and roasted chicken.  I think comfort food would be fantastic.



I have a recipe for baked mashed potatoes with Gouda cheese, you could substitute another cheese if you don't have gouda, it is really good.  Roasted chicken is easy to make, or have someone bring you one from the store.

this one is a little bit different then the other ones i gave you on your other question...

2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni
1 big onion, finely chopped
1 ½ cups chopped vegetable
(for example...french beans, cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, green peas, sweet corn but w/e you want)
1 cup milk
¼ cup cheddar cheese, grated
3 cheese slices
1 ½ cups breadcrumbs
1 tbsp butter
4 tsp oil
1 tsp mixed herbs (optional)
salt and pepper to taste
¼ tsp mustard powder (optional)

Cook the macaroni in water, adding salt, till just done. Drain, add 1 tsp oil, mix well and keep aside. This ensures the macaroni doesn’t stick and clump together after cooling.

Steam cook the chopped vegetables till just done and firm. I microwave them at 100% for about 6 minutes. Keep aside.

In a pan, melt the butter and add the chopped onions. Sauté the onions till soft and translucent. Turn down the heat and add the milk, the cheese slices (torn into pieces) and grated cheese. Stir till the cheese melts completely. Now add the cooked vegetable, herbs, mustard powder, pepper and salt.



Stir well and add the cooked macaroni. Mix well gently so that the cheese sauce uniformly coats the macaroni. Keep aside.

In a bowl, put the breadcrumbs and the remaining 3 tsps oil and mix well together using your fingers.

The last step (below) you can skip and just eat...or

Now take a glass dish and grease well. Spread the macaroni mixture in it. Cover with the prepared breadcrumbs to form a layer on top. (This can be made upto this point and then baked just before serving.) Now bake in the oven until golden brown.

Hope this helps! =)

The frosting on both of those cakes is rolled fondant.  You can buy it ready-made, but don't buy the Wilton one...that's the one that gives fondant a bad reputation.  Buy Satin Ice or Chocopan from the cake supply store or order it online.  You can also make your own fondant out of marshmallows.  Here's the recipe: http://whatscookingamerica.net/PegW/Fond...  I use that all the time and always get good results with it.  Here's some of my cakes if you want to see them: http://darkmindseye.deviantart.com/galle...

To put the fondant on the cake, you need to start with a fairly dense cake.  Level it (cut off the rounded part on the top if it has one), fill the layers and then give it a crumb coat with buttercream.  Let it settle for a couple of hours if you have time, then give it another thin coating of buttercream.  Roll your fondant out to about 1/4 inch thickness.  You will need the diameter of the cake pan plus 9 inches...for example, to do a 10" 2 layer cake, you need to roll a circle that's 19 inches across.  Fondant likes to stick to the rolling surface.  If you watch videos on youtube of people using fondant, you'll see them lifting it up every so often to dust the rolling surface with powdered sugar or cornstarch.  An easier way to do it is to use shortening.  Once you've got your circle big enough, pick it up and set it on the cake.  Gently open out any folds or pleats that develop.  Starting with the top, smooth the fondant.  Smooth the sides after that, gently working the fondant down to the bottom of the cake.  Don't pull on it and don't push too hard on the cake.  Once the fondant is smooth, use a pizza cutter or pastry wheel to cut around the bottom edge.  Tuck the edge under the cake for a neater look if you want.  And that's all there really is too it. :D  Fondant isn't hard to work with at all.

Using cherry tomatoes for soup will be a lot of work.
Plum tomatoes are preferred, because they have more meat.
You'll have to peel, chop, & then sieve out the seeds.

Melt 4 tbsp unsalted butter over medium heat.
Add 1 lg chopped onion, 1 1/4 cups of vegetable stock, 
2 lbs of peeled chopped tomatoes, & a pinch of baking soda.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, & simmer 20 minutes.

Remove from heat & let cool, transfer to a blender,
process until smooth, pour through a strainer, back into pan.
Add 1 1/4 cups of vegetable stock & 2 cups fusilli pasta.
Season to taste, salt, pepper, & 1 tbsp sugar.
Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce & simmer 15 minutes.
ladle into serving dish, swirl 1/2 cup heavy cream on top, 
garnish with fresh basil leaves, serve immediately.

u need about 2lb lb brisket or topside of beef chopped (use kitchen scissors for f'sake!) into bite size chunks. Put in a plastic bag with plain flour and dried herbs to coat. Chop up a large onion and place it and the seasoned beef in a casserole. Add tomato sauce, brown sauce, half can of good beer/red wine or even a can of condensed consomme and top up with boiling water. Cover and stew in med (190degC) oven for about 2 hours. Add mushrooms or even oysters (shucked) half hour be4 end of cooking time for finesse!..Allow 2 cool..layer the cold casserole with potato crisps on top (this keeps the pastry from getting too soggy!)
BUY ur puff pastry (making it from scratch is only for the dedic8ed and delusional). Roll it out on a floured board..and using the lid of ur casserole as a template cut out a disc to cover the casserole with an annulus to go round the edge.Wet and seal the pastry lid so fashioned (this is where a diagram would be useful!) and use the spare bits to make a tasteful decor8ion..(michaelangelo's last judgement, the three graces or even a plain lief-motif would do). (Pierce the top with a slit and use a bone or a circular pastry cutter to support the pie in the middle) Brush pastry with egg/milk mix  and bake at 200deg C for 30-35 min (check!)

Yes you can assume that is has been.  But what's happened since it's been washed?  Someone may have picked it up to have a look,  Little Jonny may have sneezed on it etc etc.  Wash it again if it bothers you, it's the only way to be certain.

I would never assume they were washed.  I always think you should wash your fruit and vegies before eating them to be on the safe side.

No just do not assume they have been washed. Besides, apples often have been sprayed before their journey to keep the freshness, and appeal (no pun). This should certainly be washed off before consuming the apple.

It may well have been washed, but how many other customers have handled it before you bought it? Just don't panic! One day I thought my sister-in-law was going to have a heart attack. She had sliced peppers and put them in very hot oil. Suddenly she screamed, 'Oh my God, I forgot to wash the peppers.'

Remember the story of the bar snacks, they were "clean" when they were first put out but how many hands have been to the loo and not been washed and have then touched the food - traces of pee, poo, blood and other body fluids were found on the food - also remember washing in cold water will not remove germs, ALWAYS PEEL

No, even if it has been washed by someone or a machine, you don't know who has handled it, or what has landed on it.  It should be washed before eating, even supermarket fruit.
The only fruit I can think of that wouldn't need washing before eating is a banana.

1 can of Eagle Milk
1 bag of Wilton candy melts

Mix together in a double boiler (or a glass bowl that fits on top of
a pan of boiling water, but doesn't let moisture in) until melted. 
Pour into a prepared pan (8x8 for thick fudge).



This makes a chewy, caramel-like fudge and with two ingredients
is definitely the easiest. You can always add nuts, raisins, mini marshmallows or whatever you like)

Indian sweet dishes tend to be milky and sweet. Gulab Jamun, and similar are very sweet, using evaporated milk and Vermicelli made from rice (not pasta). Although I can't remember any particular recipes, any Indian cook book should be able to help.

Try books by Madhur Jaffrey, Kalid Aziz, and may others. You can also buy sweets like this ready made from Asian grocers.

Constipation is unfortunately part of pregnancy. I found eating porridge and muesli along with plenty of fresh fruit every day really helped. Drinking plenty of fluids is essential but if all else fails you will have to resort to laxatives from time to time.

Here are some ideas:

1.  Drink lots of fluid (2 quarts of water daily)
2.  Incorporate fruit into your diet, including fresh plums and peaches
3.  Increase natural fibres, such as fresh spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, romaine lettuce, baby lettuces, tomatos, cucumbers, bean sprouts, etc.
4.  Decrease things that might be promoting constipation, such as cheese or milk based products.
5.  Your hormones may be creating a change in your bowel habits so talk to your OBGYN about taking a supplement to help you go more regularly.
6.  Watermelon and strawberries!

Congrats on your pregnancy!

Here is a link to foods high in fibre.  Unfortunately constipation is a common complaint with pregnancy especially if you are taking an iron supplement.  Try these foods and drink a lot of water and that should help.

Chick peas are excellent with Chicken and rice.I also like them on salads.Any green vegetable is good for you especially Kale and Spinach.Both contain Zinc. Blueberries are the best fruit you can eat and Apples will help keep you regular.I would also eat Yogurt everyday for just that reason.Kale and Spinach are both great cooked or used in a salad..Congrats and good luck.

Good zinc food sources aside from meats are dairy products such as milk and cheese, yeast, peanuts, beans, and wholegrain cereals, brown rice, whole wheat bread, potato and yogurt. Of all these vegetarian zinc foods, pumpkin seeds offer one of the most concentrated non-meat food sources of zinc.

Hope this helps!

Chickpeas are great with  4 ounces of meat, and corn bread and fried cabbage.  Raw veggies always worked for me.  Especially broccoli and cauliflower.  For less calories you can boil the cabbage.

Add whole grain foods, fresh fruits and vegetables, like unpared apples, peaches, raspberries, tangerines, broccoli, cabbage, Brussles sprouts, carrots, zucchini, beans, whole grain breads, and my favorite, oatmeal.

Since you want to add fresh vegetables to your diet, you might want to add the chick peas to your salads.  Or you could make hummus and spread it on whole wheat pita bread, crackers or the like.

As for zinc, fruits and vegetables are not a good source.  The levels of zinc are low and what zinc there is is less easily obtained and used by the body.  Higher levels of zinc are found in beef, pork, lamb, and the dark meat of the chicken.

It is impossible to be constipated if you use olive oil in your diet. Coose Extra Virgin Olive Oiul, and for flavour I would go for Greek. Now use this loiberally on your salads, dip bread in the oil instead of spreading butter, and drink a spoon full every morning....or simply eat a little bread dipped in a bowl of oil. It is very good for you, you will never experience constipation or straining on the toilet and it will help build a beautiful baby. Once you use it you'll never go back!

Royal Icing is best for wedding cakes you can buy ready coloured fondant icing and roll it out thinly for cutting with cake cutters. If you want to colour it yourself it is better to make it from scratch. you should be able to get all the ingredients from a specialist cake decorators shop. Although some large supermarkets have fairly decent supplies.you can google for suppliers in your area and for icing recipes The glitter would best be added later or it could get lost in the mix ing of your icing . You can also buy coloured icing ready made for piping straight onto a cake.this you should get in Sainsberrys  I hope this helps All the best Rab

Soap and water, strangely enough. Copper polish helps but you can also use salt and vinegar or even ketchup to shine 'em up.

they are made of copper.
Copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This is why pans where made with copper. 
Pans made today have the benefit of better metals and technology that made the use of copper no longer neccesary. 
Most pans that are made with copper are for show. ''However they are great for making omlettes and sauting.

You can purchase cleaners for copper in the cleaning section of the local grocery store.

Chocolate Caramel Slice Recipe
Makes one 20cm (8") square cake pan.



Ingredients.
 Biscuit Base Ingredients
1 cup plain flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
2/3 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
2/3 cup desiccated coconut
80g butter, melted

Caramel Filling Ingredients
800g sweetened condensed milk, you can use 2 x 395g cans.
50g butter
5 tablespoons golden syrup



Chocolate Topping Ingredients
200g dark chocolate
30g canola oil



Baking Temperature

Preheat the oven to 180oC. 
Method.

Grease and line a 20 cm (8”) square cake pan with non-stick baking paper.



In a bowl mix together the dry ingredients for the biscuit base. Make sure there are no brown sugar lumps. Mix through the melted butter. Press into the base of the prepared cake pan. Use the back of your hand to make it even and level. Bake at 180oC for 15 mins. The base will have risen and be just starting to colour. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.



While the base is baking add the caramel filling ingredients to a small pan stir over a low heat until the butter has melted and the filling is smooth. Continue stirring, the mix will be just bubbling, continue to stir for five minutes. Pour over the still warm base and return to the oven for a further 15 minutes. The filling will just be starting to colour on the top. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.



Add the chocolate topping ingredients to a medium sized microwave safe bowl and microwave on high for 45 seconds. Stir until smooth. You may need to microwave again for a further 20 seconds. For more information on How to Melt Chocolate - click here. Pour over the cooled caramel filling. Spread to the edges. Tap the slice gently on the bench to level the chocolate. Leave to set.



Cut the chocolate caramel bars into as many portions as you like. Sometimes it is easier to slice if you set in the refrigerator first. To make a clean cut through the chocolate, warm your knife first and clean between each cut.



This chocolate slice recipe will keep for a week if stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator.



White Chocolate and Macadamia Caramel Slice.
 A simple but extra delicious variation on this old fashion favourite. Mix through 1 cup of macadamias, chopped to the cooked filling before spreading over the biscuit base. Then use white chocolate instead of the dark in the chocolate topping. 
If you like extra chopped macadamias can be sprinkled over the chocolate before it sets. Of course any of your favourite nuts can be used instead of the macadamias, walnuts are especially nice.



Individual Chocolate Caramel Bars.
 Now I have to say that is the old way I use to portion my chocolate caramel slice. With the invention of the silicon moulds for baking a whole new world has opened up! You can use the same recipe to make 18 individual heart shaped chocolate caramel bars. 
I used a 1/3 cup capacity heart shaped silicon baking mould. Press 1 tablespoon of the base into the moulds. Divide the caramel filling and chocolate topping evenly between the 18 slices. Baking times will be similar - check at 12mins. Make sure you refrigerate the chocolate slice recipe before pushing them out of the mould.



These make a very generous serve. Why not use mini muffin silicon moulds like I have here in my chocolate peppermint slice recipe. These are wonderful because they are bite sized. If you plan to make these with nuts in them just chop the nuts a little finer, it makes them easier to fill.



Ok this is what the caramel slice looks like when baked in the mini silicon moulds. Only put 1 teaspoon of the base in the mould and bake for 8 minutes. Fill with caramel (Half the mix will make 30 chocolate caramel bites)bake for 8 minutes and top with chocolate either dark or white. 
I have used these as part of a celebration for a 21st and 50th birthday but you can find even more decorating ideas on my peppermint slice page.



You could also use a small heart shaped mould (silicon) like the one I used in my valentine chocolate truffles.

2 cups water place in 2 qt pan and heat untill boiling. Then add 2 teaspoons corn starch.(This is the base) Reduce heat and continue to stir until thickened (about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes) take 10 ounces American cheese cut into slices and then cut the slices smaller. Add to your base mixture. Stir constantly until melted.On a medium setting ( not boiling but just about) Then stir in 8 ounces Cream Cheese again stiring until melted. At this point (if you want to thin the soup you can add milk.) Add 1/2 cup cooked and crumbled bacon and 1/4 cup onion (red onion makes for a little color) Valdalia sweet onions are really great too! 
rememver to stir constantly while on the burner or the cheese will burn to the bottom of the pan. That is also why it's made with the water mixture, Milk will scald on the bottom of the pan before the cheese will melt.
If you put it in the fridge. To reheat you can thin it with milk then... ENJOY! I forgot ot add that you can use the sliced american cheese or Velvetta, Velvetta seems to me to taste alittle saltier. but just add a coule of slices at a time to the pot and stir alot it will melt in. I don't know how much you cook ! So I will add this comment when you add the cornstarch to the water to thicken it.You want the water to only be a slight heavy (soup consistancy) you'll see what I mean and either add more water or cornstarch to adjust it

That sounds like French onion soup. Sweat off an large amount of sliced onions in veg or olive oil. Add some cloves of garlic and then stock, which can be made with a stock cube. (Beef, chicken or veg.) Simmer this for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile grate some cheese, possibly Gruyère, or as the French call it 'Fribourgeois' and pop some slices of real bread, not bought sliced bread in the oven to harden.
Check the seasoning and add a glass of brandy to the soup, ladle into soup dishes, place the bread on top and smother with the grated cheese.
Place under the grill to brown the cheese.
For best results use soup dishes which are sort of urn shaped - narrower at the top. then you can cover the whole dish with the grated cheese. It should form a crust on the top of the soup.

I like mine made with roasted tomatoes - the flavor is awesome!

2 1/2 pounds fresh tomatoes (mix of fresh heirlooms, cherry, vine and plum tomatoes)
6 cloves garlic, peeled
2 small yellow onions, sliced
Vine cherry tomatoes for garnish, optional
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 quart chicken stock
2 bay leaves
4 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, optional
3/4 cup heavy cream, optional

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Wash, core and cut the tomatoes into halves. Spread the tomatoes, garlic cloves and onions onto a baking tray. If using vine cherry tomatoes for garnish, add them as well, leaving them whole and on the vine. Drizzle with 1/2 cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 to 30 minutes, or until caramelized.

Remove roasted tomatoes, garlic and onion from the oven and transfer to a large stock pot (set aside the roasted vine tomatoes for later). Add 3/4 of the chicken stock, bay leaves, and butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until liquid has reduced by a third.

Wash and dry basil leaves, if using, and add to the pot. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Return soup to low heat, add cream and adjust consistency with remaining chicken stock, if necessary. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Garnish in bowl with 3 or 4 roasted vine cherry tomatoes and a splash of heavy cream.

Have fun!

Chicken Kiev



INGREDIENTS



8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves 
1/3 cup butter, softened 
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
2 eggs 
3 tablespoons water 
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
1 teaspoon dried dill weed 
1/2 cup all-purpose flour 
1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 
2 cups vegetable oil 
1/2 lemon, sliced 
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley



DIRECTIONS

Place each chicken breast between a sheet of wax paper and pound, using a mallet or rolling pin, to about 1/8 inch thickness; be careful not to 'break' the chicken. Wrap and refrigerate until seasoned butter is frozen.



To Make Seasoned Butter: In a small bowl combine the softened butter, 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon garlic powder and mix well. Spread mixture into a 2x4 inch rectangle on a piece of aluminum foil; freeze until firm.



When butter is firm, cut into 6 equal size pieces and place one piece on each chicken breast. Fold in edges of chicken and roll to encase butter completely. Secure with toothpicks.



In a small bowl, beat eggs with water. In a shallow dish or bowl, mix together the 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, dill weed and flour. Place bread crumbs in a separate shallow dish or bowl. Dip chicken rolls in seasoned flour, then egg mixture, then crumbs. Place coated chicken in a shallow dish, cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.



Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. When oil is hot, deep fry chicken rolls for about 5 minutes, then turn over and deep fry for another 5 minutes until golden and cooked through, with no pink showing inside. Drain on paper towels, garnish with lemon slices and parsley and serve.

Voila!!!
Enjoy!!!

8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus extra for seasoning chicken
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for seasoning chicken
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 large whole eggs, beaten with 1 teaspoon water
2 cups Japanese bread crumbs (panko), plus 1/4 cup for filling
Vegetable oil, for frying

Combine butter, parsley, tarragon, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in the bowl of a stand mixer. Place mixture on plastic wrap or waxed paper and roll into small log; place in freezer.

Place chicken breasts, 1 at a time, between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. Squirt chicken lightly with water and squirt the top of the plastic wrap as well. Pound to no less than 1/8-inch thickness. Season each piece of chicken with salt and pepper.

Lay 1 chicken breast on a new piece of plastic wrap and place 1/4 of the compound butter and 1 tablespoon bread crumbs in the center of each breast. Using the plastic wrap to assist, fold in ends of breast and roll breast into a log, completely enclosing the butter; roll very tightly. Repeat with each breast. Place chicken in refrigerator for 2 hours, or up to overnight.

Place egg and water mixture in 1 pie pan and 2 cups bread crumbs in a different pie pan.

Heat 1/2-inch of vegetable oil in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F.

Dip each breast in the egg mixture and then roll in the bread crumbs. Gently place each breast in oil, sealed-side down, and cook until golden brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove to a cooling rack set in sheet pan and allow to drain for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

If u want ur CK in &lt; geological time..take a couple of med sized chook breasts, and using a sharp small knife make a small incision, and then expand the cavity inside by working the blade carefully. Stuff the chook cavities with roulade cheese and secure with a toothpick etc if necessary. Coat the chook bits in plain flour (packet of cream of chicken cup-a-soup would do), dip in a beaten egg on a plate and roll in fish dressing or grated stale breadcrumbs. Rest in fridge for half hour to allow coating to 'take'.Then seal in a hot shallow pan with oil for 2min each side and finish under hot grill or in oven (warp factor 9) for about 10-12min. Serve with steamed baby veg.

Boneless Pork Chops



2 tablespoons butter 
1 tablespoon oil 
1 boneless rib end pork loin roast, cut into 6 generous 1-inch thick chops, each chop pressed lightly with fingertips to flatten 
Salt and ground black pepper 
1/4 cup flour measured into a pie plate or other shallow pan 
A pan sauce



Heat the butter and oil in an 11 to 12-inch skillet over low heat. While the pan is heating, sprinkle the chops on both sides with salt and pepper, then dredge them in flour. 
A couple of minutes before sauteing, increase the heat to medium-high. When the butter stops foaming and starts to smell nutty brown, arrange the chops in the skillet. Cook, turning only once, until they are a rich golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from skillet.

the healthiest thing you can steam is fish it make it nice and soft but cooked healthy.  Most veg can be but i would recommend chicken and meats if you do it would be better to just boil in bag as you lose to much goodness. but if you do fish you cannot really cook it the same time as veg as it cooks in about 5 to 10 mins and would need to be on top of the veg which is a bad idea.

You can steam chicken and meat, but unless wrapped in foil with (say) black pepper, lemon juice, herbs to taste it can be rather bland. You can steam any vegetables. Tomatoes grill nicely and bake in the oven.  Cooked tomato is extra good, cooking releases the beneficial lycopene.
Steamed puddings are fantastic, can be reasonably healthy if you cut down sugar and use half fat butter.
Savoury steamed puddings, cut the amount of fat, add lots of filling, veg., chicken, steak and kidney (not often!), they are great in the autumn and winter.

I just put my favorite potato soup recipe up on my blog this evening!

Ingredients:
Potatoes
Onions
Milk
Butter
(pretty simple, huh?)

Peel and cut potatoes like you're making mashed potatoes - approximately 1" squares (don't get too picky on the shape)
Boil in water like you're making mashed potatoes - don't over boil as they'll be mushy
While potatoes are boiling, dice up a small yellow onion
When potatoes are soft, drain nearly all of the water from them, leaving just a little in the bottom.
Put enough milk in the pan to cover potatoes, about 1/2 stick of butter and add the onions
Slowly bring to a boil, stirring often to keep milk from scorching - keeping the small amount of water in the pan helps to prevent scorching.
Turn to low and simmer for about an hour - stir often

When there is about 15 minutes left, make some grilled cheese sandwiches to go along with the soup. I usually use regular American cheese for the sandwiches as the Borden Fat Free cheese doesn't melt real well.

I like to add enough crackers to my bowl of soup to absorb most of the juice and then add salt (it will need salt!) and a lot of pepper.

Hope this helps! For more recipes, visit my blog:

you can get reduced fat coconut milk or you could try making your own by soaking dessicated coconut in low fat milk. (it works with semi skimmed milk, but don't know about fat free).  Fromage frais works ok too.

you can get light coconut milk.  Or you could try just using some yogurt instead and adding a bit of dessicated coconut.  Beware with low fat yogurts though, if you cook them, some will split - so it might be best just to add it right at the end.



Also, if you omit the coconut milk, the curry may be a bit runny, in which case some cornflour mixed to a paste with water could help thicken it a little.

A fried egg sunny side up. Place it on top of the steaming porridge. Scoop the porridge around the egg. Don’t eat the egg and any porridge underneath it. Of course, the larger the plate the more porridge you can munch. An alternative: blend the porridge with crunchy peanut butter. Most likely you will do that only once and return to just a little bit of sugar and double cream and that's really yummy.

Butter?  Peanut butter!  Some people get away from the sweet stuff and have salt and pepper on theirs, with a little butter.

Another thing I really like to do is grind up a few different nuts and seeds (walnuts, almonds, pecans sunflowers seeds, pumpkin seeds...)



and cook them along with the oats, and then add honey and butter.  This gives the oats a really nice fresh taste and adds some protein.

I would not eat any meet past the useby date.  With chicken you can get salmonella & end up with really bad food poisoning.  Same with any kind of meat or fish.  I have had really bad food poisoning (ill for 2 whole weeks, should have been in hospital but my doctor was incompetent).  So take it from me, NEVER eat meat past the useby date.

OMG I thought you meant the chicken was still alive...Usually they're only a guide but with things like chicken it's probably best not to, chicken is one of thw orst meats when it comes to food poisoning so you have to be quite careful. Though the chicken they sell in shops isnt always that fresh to begin with. .

Chicken (poultry) is one thing that I am very careful with. Normally, I wouldn't use any a day or more past the sell by or use by date. If it was really fresh and properly wrapped ( especially cryovac), you should smell it for freshness, wash it or soak in salt water, before cooking, and it should be fine.

The topping is added afterwards.  Just pop plain popcorn or modify the salt accordingly.  Make sure you have some extra softened butter so you can form it into popcorn balls if desired.  The link below is a good recipe for toffee popcorn with peanuts.  If you don't want the peanuts, just omit them.  I think they're wonderful in it and have even used pecans instead at times.  If I don't form it into popcorn balls, I could sit there and eat the whole batch!

Enjoy your popcorn!

8 ounces elbow macaroni



1 tablespoon olive oil



1 tablespoon all-purpose flour



1/2 teaspoon dry mustard



1 1/4 cups skim milk



1 1/4 cups shredded low-fat extra-sharp cheddar cheese



1/2 cup light ricotta cheese



2 tablespoons chopped green onions



salt



ground black pepper



1/4 cup toasted bread crumbs



Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Coat an 8" x 8" baking pan with no-stick cooking spray. Set aside.



Cook the macaroni according to package directions. Drain well.



Meanwhile, heat the oil in a 3-quart no-stick saucepan over low heat; stir in the flour and mustard. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Gradually stir in the milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the Cheddar. Remove the pan from the heat.

In a blender or food processor, puree the ricotta cheese. Add to the sauce. Stir in the green onions and pasta; add salt and pepper to taste. Spoon into the baking pan. Top with the bread crumbs.



Bake for 20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.
------------

12 oz uncooked macaroni, elbow-type
1/2 cup fat-free sour cream
12 oz fat-free evaporated milk
8 oz low-fat cheddar or colby cheese, shredded
1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
1/4 tsp table salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
2 Tbsp dried bread crumbs
2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 350ºF.

Cook pasta according to package directions without added fat or salt; drain and transfer to a large bowl. While pasta is still hot, stir in sour cream; set aside.

Heat milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until tiny bubbles appear just around the edges (known as scalding). Reduce heat to low, add cheese and simmer until cheese melts, stirring constantly with a wire whisk, about 2 minutes; remove from heat and stir in mustard, salt, pepper and nutmeg.

Add cheese mixture to pasta; mix well. Transfer to a 3-quart casserole dish.

Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese; sprinkle over pasta.

Bake until top is golden, about 30 minutes. Yields about 1 cup per serving.

Hope this helps! =)

I'm assuming you mean Fahrenheit, and that's very low to bake a potato.  With the oven at its highest temp takes about anything from 45mins to an hour, but with an oven that cold I'd say between 1h30m and 2 hours.

You can make a wonderful fried rice!!  Make sure you start with your cooked rice cold.  Hopefully you also have a couple of eggs.  If you do, beat them, place in a hot skillet, sprinkle with the ground black pepper and cook as one big pancake.  Roll up and set aside.  Dice the chicken and saute in some oil (if raw) - very good using sesame oil.  Cook in the same pan you did the egg in - you don't have to clean it.  Set aside.  Dice the onions and saute until translucent.  Add the bell peppers, cut into small pieces and saute until tender. Add the rice to the pan, with the bell peppers, onions and the chicken, smashing the rice into them. Cook a bit until the rice is warm.



Add some soy sauce (hopefully you have it) and stir to coat all the rice with the soy sauce.  With the egg rolled up, cut it width-wise into strips and just before serving, stir it into the mixture.  The soy sauce is better if you mix a little water and sugar in with it before adding it to the mixture.  That will take away some of the bitterness of the soy sauce.



Enjoy!

Prepare the "chilled Champagne", lots of "red roses" and "dimmer the lights" in your house. There are way too many recipes that contain aphrodisiacs. I always start out with Oysters (although they are kind of "hard to open") and you need the little "special knife" to open them (it looks almost as a "cheese knife"). I don't know exactly what recipe you are looking for but I've found a website, with pretty much very easy recipes. Have fun and enjoy while preparing and cooking anything with aphrodisiacs !

Koeksisters
The secret of the crisp syrupy outside of koeksisters is that they are taken straight from hot oil and dipped into ice-cold syrup. This seals the syrup outside and leaves the inside dryish in contrast. 
To make the syrup, mix a liter of sugar, 5 ml cream of tartar, 2.5 ml tartaric acid and 5 ml vanilla essence or grated orange rind or cinnamon, or 1.5 ml ginger with 500 ml of water. Bring mixture to the boil and allow it to simmer for about 10 minutes or until syrupy. Set syrup aside to cool. It is advisable to make the syrup first and leave it overnight in the fridge. 
To make the batter, sift 500 ml flour, 10 ml baking powder and 5 ml salt into a mixing bowl. Cut or rub 70 ml of margarine or butter into the dry ingredients. Beat an egg thoroughly and add it to 80 ml of milk. Add the egg and milk to the flour mixture, handling as little as possible. Put the dough in the fridge for at least one hour. Roll out the dough to a thickness of 4 mm. Cut into strips about 8 cm long and 2.5 cm wide. Cut each strip into three lengthwise, leaving one side uncut. Now plait the three pieces and press ends together firmly. 
Pre-heat a deep pan and remove syrup from the fridge. The hot fried koeksisters must be dropped into the cold syrup. The syrup will warm up about halfway through, so divide the syrup into two bowls. Deep-fry koeksisters until golden brown, drain for a few seconds on absorbent paper and dip into cold syrup.

tuna pasta that is cheap,  filling and tasty, get a tin of tuna (can be in brine or sunflower oil whatever your preference) cook the pasta, drain the tuna and put in bowl, to the tuna add either a finely chopped onion or some chives add some mayo and salad cream too suit your taste, mix it together, once pasta is cooked drain water and add the tuna mix making sure all pasta is covered, get a fresh lemon cut it in half and squeeze over pasta mix stir in. nice with a crusty roll.

You could also save up money and buy a wide mouth thermos jug.
How about stuffed tomato, hollowed out apple filled with cottage cheese or peanut butter, ants on a log, cold soup such as gazpacho, cold pizza, energy bars, or bring a shaker and some Carnation Instant breakfast and make a milkshake. How about making some Cornish Pasties? They are filling. You can make several at a time and freeze some before baking. You can thaw one during the day, bake the night before or that morning and plop into a sandwich bag or wrap in foil. They are just as good at room temp as they are when hot. Well, almost. You could make some Samosas. They are spicy East Indian fried pies. Great with chutney, hot or cold. I love them both ways. OR you could get an immersion heater and use it to heat some water to make soup or noodles or ??

Spent several years shifting for myself at lunchtime. We got a new principal who was determined to force everyone to eat the crappy cafeteria food. We got a small microwave and kept it in the trunk of my friend's car. Plugged it in in the gym during lunch. He almost caught us a couple of times and I overheard him say, "Did they get a new cook? Lunch actually smells GOOD today!" Imagine his shock and surprise when he actually tasted it, LOL. It was his first time. It wasn't the cafeteria he smelled, it was my reheated Portugese chicken. He fired the cook that day and things improved when he hired the kids who had just finished at the culinary institute. They wanted to build their resumes.

there is NO reason you can not have hot soup, spaghetti, stew, and and. Ice cream and hot chocolate

LASAGNE - MAKE SAUCE AS U WOULD FOR CHILI - IN LASAGNA DISH, SPOON A COVERING OF THE SAUCE, SO IT WILL NOT STICK TO THE DISH - LASAGNA IS PASTA THAT IS STICKY WHEN WET - SO THE TOMATO PASTE(CHILI) WILL PREVENT STICKING - THEN LAYER THE PASTA-LASAGNA - WITH THE SAUCE - WHEN IT REACHES DESIRED SIZE, USING THE PASTA AND SAUCE, COVER ENTIRE CONTENTS WITH GRATED CHEESE, AND BAKE UNTIL BUBBLY

You should never put the pasta down first - are you sure you've seen that in a recipe? If you did that it would go hard and dry, it needs the moisture of the meat sauce or the bechamal on either side to work properly. Ignore anyone who is stupid enough to say pasta first, it will be horrible.

Does anyone know the recipe for making mousse using ideal milk and jelly. What size can do I use. Thank you. ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You just make up a fruit jelly according to the instructions then let it cool but before it sets you whisk in a can of evaporated milk. Then you let it set in the fridge.
Not sure if that is a large tin of milk or a small one but you could try the small one first to see how it works out. If it doesn't look fluffy enough then just whisk in a second small one. I suppose it depends how you like it.
Hope it works. It has been years since I made one of those and I might have to try it out myself now you have reminded me about it!!

STEAK PIE



Serves 2

INGREDIENTS

250g of beef
½ an onion
1 tablespoon of sunflower oil
½ a tablespoon of flour
150ml of beer
Ground pepper to taste
1 tablespoon of parsley
1 egg 
450g packet of frozen ready rolled pastry

DEFROSTING

Defrost the frozen pastry according to the instructions on the packet.



METHOD

Chop the beef into 2 cm (1 inch) pieces. Peel the onion, cut it in half, chop one half into tiny pieces and save the other half.



Put the oil in a saucepan on a moderate heat. Fry the beef and onion for about 5 minutes until the meat is brown with no pink bits. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the flour and beer, and stir. Season with the pepper.



Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Put the lid on and cook very gently for 2 hours. Check the liquid level from time to time and top it up if it starts to dry out.

Add the parsley. Mix and put into an ovenproof dish.



Break the egg into a bowl and pick out any bits of shell. Mix up the egg.

Unroll the pastry. Moisten the rim of the dish with some of the egg. Cut off a strip of pastry and place it around the moistened rim of the dish. Moisten the top of the strip of pastry with some more of the egg. Cover the dish with the pastry, pressing the edges down firmly. Trim the edges and make a hole in the centre. Brush the pastry with the remainder of the egg, so that it comes out of the oven shiny.



Cook in a preheated oven at 200°C, 400°F, gas mark 6 for 30 minutes.



ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS

Use water instead of the beer. Add some button mushrooms at the same time as the parsley. Use mixed herbs instead of the parsley.

I suppose so, but they sound like that would be better cooked.
The rutabaga or swede or (yellow) turnip (Brassica napobrassica, or Brassica napus var. napobrassica) is a root vegetable that originated as a cross between the cabbage and the (white) turnip—see the turnip disambiguation page. Its leaves may also be eaten as a leaf vegetable.

"Rutabaga" (from dialectal Swedish rotabagge) is the American term, "swede" is the term used in England. Its common name in Sweden is "Kålrot" (Cabbage root). It is also known as the "Swedish turnip" or "yellow turnip". To the Scots, the Irish, and some of the Northern English it is called "turnip", or colloquially, especially in Scotland, "neep"—the vegetable known elsewhere as a turnip being called a "swede" or a "white turnip" in Scotland. In the US, rutabagas may also be called "yellow turnips." In Newfoundland, white turnips are relatively unknown, with rutabagas being known simply as turnips.

The vegetable is native to Sweden, and was introduced into Scotland. From there, it spread to the rest of Britain and to North America. In continental Europe, it acquired a bad reputation when it became a food of last resort during World War I. In the German Steckrübenwinter (swede winter) of 1916–17, large parts of the population were kept alive on a diet consisting of little else but swedes. After the war, most people were so tired of eating swedes that they have remained unpopular to this day and are rarely planted.

These days, swedes are mostly eaten as part of stews or casseroles, or are served mashed with carrots, or are baked in a pasty.

In Scotland, "neeps" are traditionally served mashed as part of the Burns supper and are hollowed out at Hallowe'en to make Jack-o'-lanterns.

If it's already cooked, not much to be done other than to make some gravy to go with it to add some moisture. Next time try covering the breast meat (after about 30 minutes when it's already browned) with some foil to reduce the amount of heat it receives. Then as it's nearing the time to be done remove it for the last 10 or so minutes to crisp up the skin again.

Don't stuff your chicken.  In the words of Alton Brown from the show "Good Eats":



"Stuffing is evil."

The problem is that breast meat is dry to begin with because it's so low in fat.  Then, when you stuff a bird, by the time the center of the stuffing is cooked to the proper temperature, (165 degrees), the outer portions will be overcooked.  While the dark meat can tolerate this to some degree, the white meat cannot.

To improve a chicken's juiciness you can brine it.  That means soaking it in a salt-water solution which causes the meat to absorb some of the water.

Try marinading them over night in a mix of olive oil, rosemary. If you have pau pau leaves or flesh where you are, add that too. BBQ is best but as they will have soaked in the olive oil, you can hit them with a really hot pan, slightly oiled, flash fry and seal the tender juices inside. try not to keep these in the oven while you prepare the rest...serve them straight onto the plates!  Not Baaaahd!!

Try planking them.  I took a grilling on a plank class this summer and lamb was one of the meats we cooked.  Marinade or season your lamb with whatever you like.  We used an orange juice, brown sugar, and blackened seasoning for our marinade. You can plank either on a gas grill or in the oven.  We used red cedar planks that had been soaked in water for 4 to 6 hours.  Both grill and oven were heated to 350 degrees.



Use indirect heat on the grill.  Take the wet planks and put in the oven or on the grill for 5 minutes allowing the plank to warp.  Then turn the plank over for another 3 minutes and the warping should pretty much even out.  At this point, put your lamb on the hot plank and close the oven or grill.  When using a plank, you do not turn the meat over.  It took between 15 to 20 minutes to cook on the gas grill and 20 to 25 minutes in the oven.  Start checking you lamb at about the 15 minute mark as each grill and oven are different in their regulation of temperature.  Also when using the grill, check periodically to make sure your plank has not caught fire.  If it has, use a spray bottle with water to extinguish the flames.

Anyway, the lamb turned out tender, juicy, and very tasty.

when oil and butter are both included in a baking recipe, the butter is usually added for flavor and the oil for not sticking to the pan.  Your going to need to follow the recipe to the letter when baking.  Making sauces, gravies and casseroles, soups, you can make it up as you go along.  But baking is more of a science.  If you make that recipe without butter, you should increase the oil to make up the difference and sacrifice the taste and texture.  It wont be as good with out.

You can get something far cheaper which does the job better.  A George Foreman, Lean, Mean, Grilling Machine, or Woolworths does a cheaper alternative which is just as good.  In Woolworths is called a Family Grill or similar.

BTW I felt really sorry for Peter Springfellow.  He may be a letch but to stay so calm in spite of such a catastrophe was admirable.  I hope he sacked the plumber.  I have never heard of that happening before, and I have seen some kitchen disasters!

Why does temperature setting matter when something is in the oven?



I'm being ridiculous here, so don't take this serious. But I want to know why they tell me to set the temperature to 300degrees or something, but what does all that matter????..Why can't I just go to 10000 degrees to make the food cook quicker??..Why wait 2 hours instead of 2 minutes?

Do things become better cooked when given more time or something??

It matters because it helps cook the food you want to it's best taste.  Like meat, it's always good to either cook above 500degrees or broil it.  When you broil meet, you have to pay attention that the top of the oven doesn't burn the top of whatever you are cooking.  Pasta type recipes should be cooked between 300 to 400 degrees.

The answer is simple it is physics. The density and type of the food being cooked dictate the cooking (oven) temperature. To cook a pot pie for instance, if you put the pie at a very high temperature, not only does the top food burn but it ceases to conduct heat to the center to cook the rest. That's the full story.

It all depends on the thickness of the food, but you want to make sure the outside and the inside cook correctly relative to each other.  If you want the heat to permeate evenly, say for a cake or a thick roast, then your temperature should be lower.  If you want the outside to get crusty, but the inside to stay rare, say for a smaller roast or some veggies, then you crank it up.  It's all in the physics.

some things just require lower temps such as cookies, so they don't cook to fast and become burnt on the bottom, extra crispy on the outside and still dough in the center. basically anything you cook at a higher temp than it says is going to be raw in the center a look done on the outside.

It is so things cook evenly.

You would cook the outside and the centre would be cold, or the outside will be burnt to a crisp by the time the centre is cooked.

Because just like cooking something in a microwave - if the temp is too high it will cook the outside too fast and the inside won't be ready.

A deep fat fryer can be a big, DEEP, heavy metal pot.  You put fat in it - preferably vegetable or corn oil, and peanut oil also works well because it doesn't burn at high temperatures.  Keep the oil deep enough to cover the food you will put in it.  This means it needs to be at least 1/3 full because when you add the food it sometimes bubbles up.  You heat this oil to 350 to 400 degrees F using a thermometer that is just for this.  Frying in small batches will insure that the temperature of the oil does not drop so much that the food absorbs a lot of oil and get soggy.

If you buy/use a deep fat fryer you will find that they have a thick wall - like the Fry Daddy, or an insulated wall which has an outside wall and an inside wall.  The inside will be metal and the outside can be painted or decorated.  Both have electric plugs.  The Fry Daddy comes with a metal slotted scooper and has a non-stick interior.  The deep fat fryer has a metal basket you put the food in and usually does not have a non-stick interior.  The Fry Daddy has no temperature control.  You just put the oil in, heat it up by plugging it in and when the oil is hot enough, you put the food in and watch it.  It is small-ish and cooks quickly.  The other deep fat fryer has a temperature gauge so if your recipe has a temp. to cook it at then you set it to that.  When I want to know if the oil is hot enough I drop one drop of water in the oil.  It spatters like crazy, and the oil is hot.  I could also use the thermometer, but when I can't find it, the water works okay.  The Fry Daddy uses less oil as it is smaller.  Using a large pot or an electric deep fat fryer uses about the same amount of oil.  Both come with lids for storage, but you don't use it to cook with.  I drain my oil out every time and store it in a container with a lid.  You can store it in the refrig to keep it longer.



Hope this was helpful.

The easiest way is to buy a jar of your favourite cook in curry sauce, chop a piece of chicken breast into small pieces, fry them until they are white all over, then add the sauce, stirring, and bring to the boil. Cover the pan, lower the heat and allow to simmer for about 30 minutes - and there you are!

I marinate the meat for a few hours or over night. and use lots of hot pepper.

Here is one of my favorit base recipes, I add what I have, omit what I don't have and adjust to my tastes, but its a good start to a great dish.  Remember all amounts are estimated, a great curry dish needs to be seasoned by taste, not with a teaspoon.

Hope you enjoy.



2 lbs. beef 
4 tablespoons cooking oil 
2 cloves garlic 
2 tablespoons finely chopped chives (green onions) 
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger root (optional) 
a few sprigs of fresh cilantro
a few sprigs of frsh thyme
2 cups water 
2 onions 
2 tablespoons curry powder 
1 teaspoon black pepper 
salt to taste 
Method:
Cut meat into small pieces. Chop fine onions, garlic, chive, ginger. Heat oil in pan, add curry powder and seasonings and cook for about 3 minutes. Add the meat, black pepper and brown in savoury fat. Add water to cover meat and cook until meat is tender. Cooking too rapidly will toughen meat and boil away curry sauce

500g Chicken breasts, skinned and cut into strips
2 tbsp Vegetable oil
25g Butter
1 Onion, sliced
1 tsp Cumin seeds

Add the tomatoes, garlic, turmeric and remaining garam masala and cook for around 10 minutes until the mixture becomes thick. 
Add the chilli and chicken and simmer for 15 minutes until everything is cooked through. Serve with yogurt and fennel fronds or coriander leaves.

Not at all (although it depends how much oil is used). In this recipe there's only 1 tablespoon of oil and the rest is simply chicken, spices and vegetables:

Ingredients
2 chickens

For the marinade:
1 tbsp allspice berries, freshly ground
3 Scotch bonnet peppers
2 bunches of Spring onions, chopped
2 Onions, chopped
2 garlic clove, chopped
2.5 cm fresh ginger root
1 bunch of Thyme, chopped
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp water
1 tsp Sugar
1 tsp Salt
freshly ground black pepper

Method
1. Using a food processor or a pestle and mortar, blend or crush the allspice berries, Scotch bonnet peppers, spring onions, onion, garlic, ginger, thyme, oil, water, sugar, salt and freshly ground pepper into a paste.



2. Toss the chicken quarters thoroughly with the marinade. Cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator.



3. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas 6 or heat a barbecue to cooking point. If using the oven, preheat a griddle pan until hot. Brown the chicken quarters on the griddle pan, transfer to a roasting tin and roast for 30 minutes until cooked through. If using a barbecue, cook the chicken pieces on it for around 40 minutes, turning often and basting with the marinade.



Enjoy!

Help understanding this recipe?



It says, "for mop." I don't cook often, so I'm having a little trouble understanding this recipe.

Does it mean mix those ingredients together in a bowl and use some kind of brush to brush it on the pork?

Also, how well should I cook the pork on the skillet?

Mop means to use a kitchen tool that looks like a mop and baste meat with it.  It is used primarily in southern BBQ cooking techniques.  Mix all the ingredients together.  Put in the baster and get a lot of the sauce on there.  Then place the baster on the meat and get it all over the meat, generously.



When President Johnson threw a barbecue he called upon is favorite Pitmaster Walter Jetton to cook up a meal that often feed hundreds of people. This meal would be cooked on an open air fire pit that measured about 40 square feet. Walter would cover every square inch of this surface in ribs, roasts and meats of every variety. To keep the meat moist he mopped it, with a real mop. Hence the barbecue term, “mop”.



Today you can buy a miniature tool that looks like a kitchen mop to mop your meat. The cotton fibers hold the thin mop sauce and make it easy to dash large amounts on at once. But a mop isn’t just another kind of barbecue sauce. It is a thin, watery solution that drips over meat adding moisture to combat the drying of an open fire. Think of it this way; a sauce is applied with a brush, like a paint brush.



A mop, sometimes called a sop, is applied with, well a mop. Sauces are thicker than mops. Mops should have a consistency close to water.

I make a rocky road cookie that my neighbor goes absolutely nuts for whenever i make them.  i use small marshmallows (when i think mini, i am thinking the kind you put in hot cocoa) and i freeze them, and add them to the cookie dough as i am dropping the cookies. this way i have control over where the marshmallows are placed in the cookie, and i can keep them from being on the bottom of the cookie, which makes a melty mess.  and instead of using drop method, i just spoon out the dough, put my marshmallows in top, and fold the dough all around the marshmallows until they are completely covered.  this keeps the white color of the marshmallow visible after they are baked, and you don't have to struggle with getting the cookie off your cookie sheet because of the melted marshmallow.

because if its cut into four triangles its easier to hit the filling than hit the sides with your mouth, crust always interrupts the taste of the filling unless its a crusty roll, but then you choose that type not soft squishy yummy sliced bread.

someone has already said that we eat with our eyes first and he is absolutely correct, someone else said that you hit the taste of the filling more directly, he's also correct and another answerer says its because the sandwich is made with care and attention - also right,but it is when all three come together with your favourite sandwich filling, Ah that is what you call a sandwich

pasta is perfect for beginners.



Go to the market and pick up some boneless skinless chicken breast, some alfredo sauce in the bottle (classico brand 4 cheese alfredo), some fettuccini noodles, some garlic, some fresh basil, parmesean cheese, butter, and broccoli crowns.

cook your pasta- about 10m
Slice your chicken breast into peices, season with S&P, brown in a pan with some oilive oil and minced garlic. Add in the alfredo sauce. Meanwhile, steam your broccoli crowns. The last 8mins of cooking your chicken & alfredo sauce slice your french bread and brush with melted garlic and butter, throw it in the oven on 375.

When you serve, put some fettuccini on the plate, top with chicken alfredo sauce, shaved parmesean cheese, and chiffanade some fresh basil, top with that. Put a slice of garlic bread on the side with steamed broccoli.

Your question leads to many other questions.  What is it you are cooking? Are you useing a glass or dark non stick pan?  As a gerneral rule most things are baked at 350 to 375 .degrees.  Bake times vary on what you are baking and how dense it is.



Do you have access to a cookbook? If not would be a wise investment. Also many sites are offered on the internet.  Betty Crocker has a site, as well as Pillsbury and Stonewall Kitchen.

When all else fails consult a relative or friend.

Happy baking. Trial and error are all part of the process and the way that you learn.

My parents have always spoilt me when it comes to fresh home cooked meals, but after a recent misunderstanding, i am quite reluctant to go asking them for help.

So for someone who really wants to learn how to cook, and preferably learn on my own, at my own pace and most importantly very cheaply! i am quite puzzled at where exactly to start.

So can any of you helpful souls recommend any beginner cook books? must need cooking utensils? essential staple ingredients? or something as simple as recommending a couple of beginner websites. I will be happy with any form of help!

when I went to university, my mother bought me 2 cookbooks.. I still have them now.. (30years of age now).. and they are just about falling apart..
Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (it has a checkerboard cover)
and
Betty Crockers cookbook

both are easy and simple to understand..
think of cooking as science class.. it tells you exactly what measures to use and how to mix it together and how long to cook..
just follow step by step the recipe.. you'll get used to it in no time..

but purchase a few simple items like a 1 cup pyrex glass measuring cup, some teaspoon, tablespoon measuring spoons,  2 or 3 good sauce pans with lids. something small/medium sized for reheating sauces, and a largerone that might hold a whole stew..
a good frying pan (stainless steel) with a lid... a metal spatula for flipping foods in pan, a huge spoon for stiring stuff in pan and moving around fried stuff.. and substituting for  a ladle.. some good knives.. a cutting board.. a strainer for draining pasta etc.. a cake pan( go with the rectangler 13x9x2 pan) cause you can roast in it, bake a cake in it, and make casseroles in it also.. a good size to use.. buy a huge roll of aluminum foil.. 
staples like all purpose flour, milk, eggs, cooking oil. salt, peppers, sugar. etc is always good...

goodluck and dont be scared..

ok, you can learn to cook anything in a cookbook or off the web. the main thing i have to say, as a former cook/perpetually hungover college student, is that if you light a bacon grease fire FOR GOD'S SAKE do NOT smother it with flour. it is not happy times.

I think you should invest in a slow cooker. They are so good. They come with a little recipe booklet. You can honestly throw just about anything in there, turn it on, get home from work and eat straight away. If this isn't an option for you, then why not buy a kitchen starter kit. I bought one when I moved out of home and it did the trick for the forst couple of years. You can get them at k-mart for about $120. The one I got included 3 different sized saucepans, a skillet, a collinder, a chopping block, a knife block with about 6 different knives and a pair of utility scissors, wooden spoon, whisk, ladle, and a few containers with lids. 
Some things that should always be in your freezer/fridge/cupboard are: flour, rice, canned tomatoes, tomato paste, pasta, stock cubes, gravy, mince meat, butter, milk, eggs, frozen veggies, bread, olive oil
I would recommend just buying a food magazine from the supermarket. They have some really tasty and cheap meal ideas that would be perfect for you. Hope I helped

ps. If you are aussie, (lol, me too!) try recipes plus magazine or super food ideas. They are good ones :)

First of all, congrats on the move!

A good place to start is by asking friends that cook how they make any particular dish that you like.



Basic seasonings to always keep on hand; salt, pepper, garlic salt, seasoned salt.  There are others depending upon what type of food you are wanting to eat, but those are pretty common.  I would recommend that you start looking at chicken recipes, because that's pretty cheap (at least if you're in the US).



Onions are good to have on hand, whatever your favorite vegetable is.

Some things that are super easy to make: cheese enchiladas, pasta salad, tacos, stuffed bell peppers, mashed potatoes, baked chicken,  oh and I did find a good recipe for steak http://www.ehow.com/how_2161674_cook-ste...



Hope that helps!  You'll be fine, I went through the same thing in college and now, I love to cook and people love my cooking.

Anytime I cook for more than 2 people, I make a Pot Roast in the crock pot.  Chuck Roast, and add water and Lipton Onion soup/(packets of flavoring).  Add Mini peeled carrots also, and cook for about 8-10 hours.  The meat will fall apart, and is a huge hit with the family.  Then make mashed potatoes with Peppercorn gravy, but use the juice from the Roast, not water.

Try this one...wont be like your Grans but still......Boil and mash potatoes not leaving them too wet.



Add a little grated ginger, about two spring onions,  2 pieces of grated garlic and a handful of  chopped coriander leaves a green deseeded chilli .  Salt and pepper.  Beat one egg into it and add some cheddar cheese.  Form into balls and shallow fry till golden brown.

Or you can add some wetted bread slices in the mixture and deep fry the mashed potatoe patties....delicious especially with coriander or mint chutney...or even tomato sauce.

I like with grated potatoes better but my Granny never threw any good food out either.

No real recipe...you just mix a little egg and flour and some grated or chopped onions up and fry.

You can get a better "from scratch" result from grating big potatoes , carrots,a little celery,and onions and mix lightly together...so it looks kinda right then add about a 1/2 cup of flour with a sifter (S & P) and a couple eggs - well just enough to hold together. Depends on how many people....

My Gran was Swedish...we ate these cakes with sour cream and different fruits on the side...often spiced apples because we always had a lot of those.

Take the left over potatoes and mash well. Pour in some hot melted butter and mix well. Slowly add in some sifted flour, for lightness, until the mixture is malleable without sticking all over your hands. It should be nice and smooth, a little like pastry. Add a little salt and some freshly ground black pepper. roll out with a lightly floured rolling pin and then cut into however many pieces you like. Heat a frying pan until hot, then add some butter to melt. Place the potato cakes in the pan and let brown on a medium heat. check when they are golden and turn them over to cook the other side. Serve on a hot plate, with lots of butter. Not good for the figure really but delicious.

We try our hardest not to waste food.  Anything I make has to be able to be my husband's lunch the next day.  And whatever else I make should be able to be frozen and socked in the deep freezer.

We try not to.  Most of our wastage is from things expiring in the fridge or cupboards before we use them.  We usually eat left overs the next day.



I am so paranoid about eating anything past it's best before/expiry date - we just don't risk it.  Especially with two kids.

I am bad with veges, fruit and meat.  That is what most of our wastage is because I leave cooking dinner too late and so I go for the quickest things to cook and end up having to chuck out sprouting potatoes for example.

We don't waste much if any.
Leftovers get turned into a new meal or ate as is.
When I take meat off the bone, all the fat & bone goes to the dog to eat. (Save for turkey bones!)

When something is no longer edible by us to our standards (been in the fridge for 4/5 + days) we give to our dog to eat as well.

Left overs (we rarely have any because I try not to overcook) always go into the fridge - meat, of course, will make a sandwich for lunch next day.
Veges usually go into a box, for the freezer, labelled "Soup veges".
When I have a box full (roast potatoes are a great addition for flavouring and thickening), I make a thick mixed vegetable soup, with the addition of a stock cube and sometimes a handful of barley, lentils, etc.  A teaspoon of curry powder makes a spicy change.  A tablespoon of tomato ketchup enrichens. 
Vegetable peelings, chicken bones when not used for stock, etc., go down the insinkerator.
I take little or no notice of "Best before dates" - never had them till a few years ago.  Us old uns were born with senses which kept us safe - a sense of smell, a sense of sight and a sense of taste; if it smells OK, if it looks OK, if it tastes OK - it's OK.
Only had food poisoning once in over 70 years and that was from mussels in a restaurant.

Credit crunch food crisis - please help?



I am finding it hard to meet the food bills so have decided to try and cook a badger I found on the side of the road, can anyone suggest any way I could do it so my children wont know and it will taste ok. Also any tips on how to skin/gut it would be great.



This is a very serious question and we are really struggling to make ends meet.



If this works I may try some more, any tips on other animals that I could run over that wont damage my car too much.

LOL . . . can't help you with the skinning/gutting.  But seriously, anything in the crockpot has got to be good.  Throw in a bunch of onions and garlic, add potatoes and carrots.  Pour some water over the works and let it cook all day.  You can use this same technique for rabbits, squirrels, possum, racoon, etc.  They're relatively small and won't do much damage to your car.  I'd stay away from skunk (obvious reasons) and unfortunately, though much tastier, deer will do a terrible number on your car.



Best wishes to you!  :D

The first things first road kill can be safe to eat but only if it is fresh. If you don't gut it right away the intestines will leak toxins into the meat and you could kill your family. If it is stiff it's too late. However if it is fresh kill the first thing you need to do is slice it from it's neck to its rectum and pull out the guts. Then take it home and skin it. If you don't want anyone to know debone (remove bruised meat) it and cook it like stir fry or boil some raw biscuits and make "chicken" and dumplings. Obviously a deer would be your best kill but not with a car. So I would seek out thinks like raccoon and squirrels. Now I have a question for you. Why do you have the internet if you can't buy Ramon Noodles.

According to one French cookbook, 'Les Cuisines Oubliees' by Annie and Jean-Claude Molinier, it was traditional, prior to cooking, to skin the badger and then suspend it in a fast-flowing river for 48 hours to "de-grease" it.



After that, you cut it into pieces, brown it in a frying pan with butter, flambée with armanac, pour over some sparkling wine and simmer for two hours. Then add a glass of pig's blood, two egg yolks, some ginger and creme fraiche and, voila...a meal fit for anyone other than a Gloucestershire peasant.



Henry Smith, though, favoured simpler recipes. He rated cured badger hams as "exceptionally good fare" and declared: "Badger pies are even better than pork pies, hot or cold." He also said that the animals were at their best in October or November as they were "fat and succulent by then". And he reminded wannabe chefs what good gravy could be obtained from the skinned feet and tail, thickened with a little flour.

1 Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut open the pumpkin and use a strong metal spoon to scoop out the insides. Separate the seeds from the stringy core. Rinse the seeds.



2 In a small saucepan, add the seeds to water, about 2 cups of water to every half cup of seeds. Add a tablespoon of salt for every cup of water. Bring to a boil. Let simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain.



3 Spread about a tablespoon of olive oil over the bottom of a roasting pan. Spread the seeds out over the roasting pan, all in one layer. Bake on the top rack for 20 minutes or until the seeds begin to brown. When browned to your satisfaction, remove from the oven and let the pan cool on a rack. Let the seeds cool all the way down before eating. Either crack to remove the inner seed (a lot of work and in my opinion, unnecessary) or eat whole.

a good recipe is to coat them in real butter in a bowl with a lid.  Then put a package of sour cream & onion soup mix in the bowl and shake vigorously until the seeds are well coated.  Then bake them at 350 for approximately 15 minutes or until they start to turn golden brown.  Then just pop them in your mouth, outer shell and all and ENJOY!

How to cook brown rice without burning the bottom of the pan/rice?



I cooked brown rice for the first time in a long time yesterday. I just used a regular sauce pan. I followed all the directions, waited til the water was absorbed, and took it off the heat. The bottom of the pan was burnt and some of the rice was...it was crunchy. The top was mostly soft and tasted good, but not the crunchy pieces. Ick.  Do you have any tips on how to cook brown rice better without using a rice cooker? Thanks!

How to Cook Brown Rice
March 14th, 2007 by Steve Pavlina



Email this article to a friend Email this article to a friend



Many people have trouble cooking brown rice and having it turn out decently, since it can be more temperamental than white rice.  There are also many different ways to prepare it.



Here’s the most efficient way I found to cook brown rice on a stove.  It takes about 35 minutes from when you start to when you’re eating (which is pretty good for brown rice).  This method works for both short grain and long grain brown rice.  I prefer long grain.  I’ve eaten hundreds of batches of brown rice using this method over the past 10 years.



Here are the instructions:



1. Put brown rice and water together in a pot with a lid.  Use the ratio of 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice.  I normally make 3c rice with 4.5c water for a single batch.



2. Set the heat to maximum, and bring the rice/water to a boil uncovered.  Then put the lid on the pot, and reduce the heat to low/simmer.  If your lid has a steam valve, keep it closed.  Let the rice simmer for 20 minutes.



3. Turn off the heat, and let the rice sit in the covered pot for another 10 minutes.  It’s OK if you let the rice sit longer than 10 minutes (20 or 30 minutes is fine too), but don’t let it go any less.  I prefer my rice to be slightly chewy, not mushy, so I usually remove the lid after 10 minutes.



4. Eat and enjoy.  Be careful when you remove the lid, since a lot of steam may escape when you do.



This works for white rice too.



After the rice is cooked, I normally scoop some into a bowl, and mix it with a little tamari and 1-2 tablespoons of sesame seeds.  The sesame seeds add a lot of flavor to the rice.  Sometimes I’ll eat it with steamed veggies and blackened tempeh, both of which can be prepared while the rice is cooking.



I put the leftover rice in a plastic container in the refrigerator, which keeps well for several days.  Since I don’t use a microwave, I usually just eat the leftovers cold.  But when I’m not in the mood for cold rice, here’s another tasty dish I make from the leftover rice:



1. In a small pot, add 1 teaspoon of oil, and heat it for about 1 minute on medium heat.  I prefer dark sesame oil because it adds a lot of flavor.  Canola oil works well too.



2. Add some chopped veggies to the pot, and sauté them in the oil for a few minutes.  My favorites are onions, green onions, and bell peppers (any color).



3. Once the veggies are cooked, scoop in some of the leftover brown rice.  I like to use 2 parts rice to 1 part veggies.  Mix it well with the veggies.



4. Reduce the heat slightly to medium-low, and cook the rice/veggies for 3-4 minutes until the rice is hot, stirring about once every minute.



5. Pour in a little tamari to taste, and mix it with the rice.  Cook for another minute to sear in the flavor.



6. Turn off the heat.  Mix in 1-2 tablespoons sesame seeds.



7. Eat and enjoy.



I hope you find these recipes helpful.  Brown rice became a staple of my diet after I studied macrobiotics during the mid-90s, and I eat it almost every week.  I find it a great food for endurance activities.

Put brown rice and water together in a pot with a lid.  Use the ratio of 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice.  I normally make 3c rice with 4.5c water for a single batch.



Set the heat to maximum, and bring the rice/water to a boil uncovered.  Then put the lid on the pot, and reduce the heat to low/simmer.  If your lid has a steam valve, keep it closed.  Let the rice simmer for 20 minutes.



Turn off the heat, and let the rice sit in the covered pot for another 10 minutes.  It’s OK if you let the rice sit longer than 10 minutes (20 or 30 minutes is fine too), but don’t let it go any less.  I prefer my rice to be slightly chewy, not mushy, so I usually remove the lid after 10 minutes.



Eat and enjoy.  Be careful when you remove the lid, since a lot of steam may escape when you do.

You probably had the heat too high. Bring the rice to a boil, cover and cook over low heat until it's nearly done. Turn off the heat and let it steam for about the last ten minutes of cooking. Also make sure you are using a heavy bottom sauce pan

I had the same problem, so I went out and bought a cheap rice cooker- $15 at target.  I only eat brown rice and to get my husband to eat it too, I really have to cook the stuff so it's super soft.  I just add more water until its cooked all the way even.  Good luck, brown rice is so yummy!

Put your hand on the rice (flat) and pour water in till it covers your hand. Then cook for 30 mins. If it is undercooked then do for longer. And if it burns at the bottom at more water (only a little thought)



Also you can just put like a casserole dish in the oven. And do the normal water thingy. It works. Dad makes rice for his curry like that.



Hope it helps.

You can add a few tablespoons of flour (how much really depends on how much liquid is in it) or use corn starch if you have it.

You can dissolve a few Tbsp of flour or corn starch in 1/2 c of water to make a slurry and add that.  But, keep in mind that the sauce won't thicken until it reaches the boiling point.  Since a crockpot typically cooks at 250 F on low and 325 F on high, you shouldn't have any problem.  Don't forget to re-taste and re-season when it's done, if necessary.

If it's too thin, simmer over medium-high heat, allowing liquid to reduce. If your gravy is still too thin, add a beurre manie: Make a paste of equal parts flour and softened unsalted butter, and add it a little at a time, whisking constantly, until the gravy thickens.

Corn starch is the way to go. Remove a cup of the cooking liquid, stir a tablespoon of corn starch into it and then pour it back into the crock pot and stir it through.

"There are several methods of thickening the gravy, and my favorite involves making a roux (equal parts of flour and butter or oil).



You simply cook the flour and oil/butter in a heavy saucepan or skillet, stirring constantly, until the color desired. (If you want a blond gravy, such as for chicken, only cook until a blond color. If you want a dark, rich gravy for red meat, cook the roux until milk chocolate brown. Add some chopped onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic (any flavors you like), and cook the vegetables in the roux until they are soft.



Whisk in the stock, and bring gravy to a low simmer. Cook until thickened and the flavors have come together. Add any extras you may like, such as chopped green onions, fresh herbs, or other spices and seasonings. For every 2 cups of broth or stock, you will need about 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken. Of course, if you like a thinner gravy, simply use less.



An even simpler method involves using cornstarch. Simply mix a little cornstarch with just enough cold water to form a pourable "slurry," then add this slurry, little by little, to hot stock or broth. As the stock comes to the boil, the cornstarch will work to thicken the sauce. You can always add more slurry if your gravy isn't thick enough, but always wait until the sauce boils between additions, to make sure you really need more."

Just like the inside of spam; the processed pork product in a square blue tin.



No matter how you cook it or burn it or irradiate it, the outside may look different - but the inside will always look the same.  Unless you burn it to a cinder, then it will look like charcoal.



All processed & re-manufactured food products are like that.



If you want it to look like its rare or medium done, you will have to cook virgin meats in their raw form.

The only negative calorie food I know of is celery, and I know when cooked it is softer (and tastes foul) and so does not require as much chewing, and is easier for the stomach to digest, so it loses it's "negative calorie" status.



Hope this helped a little!

Yes, I believe celery is probably the only negative calorie food.
It takes more energy to consume and digest raw celery than it actually gives.



I suppose some things can be made into neg calories, if you make them especially hard to chew and digest. I doubt they will actually taste nice though.

The phrase "negative-calorie food" has been coined recently to refer to foods that use up more calories in digestion than they provide. All foods have calories, but some have very few. Carrots and celery certainly do have very few calories, as do lettuce, cucumbers, and other green vegetables. What these foods can help do is fill your stomach and relieve some hunger pangs while you are on a weight-loss diet.



I would not focus a lot of attention on whether foods are "negative-calorie foods," however. The point is that if you limit your intake only to these foods, you could become malnourished. You need to eat protein, carbohydrates, and fat to survive. Still, eating lots of raw vegetables can fill you up because they are relatively high in volume and fiber and low in calories. In summary, while they have a role to play in a weight-loss diet, they shouldn't be the central focus of such a diet.

the same reason that you order sweet and sour chicken at a chinese restaurant. it's a polynesian dish, but it has long been associated with chinese food. pineapple grows very well in hawaii and was embraced by the locals when it was imported there. it is now a staple in their diet and one of their biggest exports.

The 'ingredients' for butter are simply cream and possibly a little salt. I think you can make butter from goat's milk, but it takes a different method so I'm sticking to what I know. Making butter from cow's cream.



Unless you have your own cow or access to a dairy, you are not going to save any money by making your own butter. As with most commodity products in the supermarket, the retail price of butter is less than you can buy the raw materials for.



Having said that, sometimes you will find the supermarket has reduced it's cream as it approaches the end of it's shelf life. One Christmas Eve we found our supermarket had a load of cream reduced to 5p for a large tub.



I've never managed to freeze cream so making butter was the ideal way to take advantage of a bargain and store it for use in the future.



You need double cream or whipping cream to make butter, single cream is just too thin.



Butter Making - Equipment
You do not need much equipment to make butter at home, a bowl and large jar with a lid being the minimum. If you have a food processor or an electric whisk then the task will be much easier.



Butter Making - Method
Let the cream reach room temperature, around 20 C (68 F) is ideal – this is critical. Don't heat it but leave the pots out of the fridge for a good few hours to warm up. If you have a cold kitchen, put them into the living room to warm up.



Now we are ready to make butter.



With a jar you need to half fill the jar, put the lid on and shake it for anything between half an hour and an hour. This is hard work, especially for any quantity and I've not tried it myself.



With a food processor or an electric whisk, proceed as if you are making whipped cream. In the processor, use the plastic blades if you have them. I'm told the Kenwood 'K' beater is the best tool if you are lucky enough to have one.



It will go through the usual stage of starting to form firm peaks and then it becomes quite stiff. At this point you might like to reduce the speed of your whisk because when it goes it happens very fast.



All of a sudden the cream goes a bit yellow in colour and then little bits of butter appear and a thin liquid, the buttermilk. Just seconds later, the butter seems to clump and is separated from the buttermilk. If your whisk is on high speed you are now redecorating the kitchen, hence my suggesting you reduce speed to a minimum

First you get a cow.  Milk it every day at the same time.  They prefer before dawn.



Then you find a butter churn (check with your Amish friends to see if they have an extra one lying around).



Now, pour a bunch of fresh milk (real creamy) in the churn, and sit there all day pumping the handle up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.  All day.  The chunky stuff at the bottom is butter.  Glom it out and mash it into butter molds (you do have your own butter molds, don't you?)  After it solidifies, you have your own butter!  Good luck.

Put a pint of heavy cream or whipping cream in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat with the whip attachment.  Beat it on medium speed way past the point of whipped cream (about 20 min).  Put the butter in cheese cloth or a clean, lint free towel and rinse under cold water.  Rinse and squeeze until the water runs clear.  Squeeze out all excess water and open the towel.  You'll have butter.  Pretty simple.

Regardless of whether it is a cheap or expensive product, soups & stews (chili too) some of the water in it will settle & separate while it sits & begins to freeze. Especially if its a watery soup/stew. Now if you used a thickening ingredient, them less of the water content won't separate.



The Best product to use would be a Vacuum Sealer Freezer bags. The food won't suffer freezer burn as badly as most other foods left in the freezer over long.

I stock my pantry with containers of broth (beef and chicken) to make homemade soups, tomatoes and tomato sauce (for chili) and a variety of pastas (mac and cheese) and beans. You can make some excellent bean soups (I like white bean and bacon). It's always nice to have those on hand.



I also like keeping different condensed soups (cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, celery, french onion, etc.) and rice on hand for casseroles.

Frozen: Few dinners or meals, egg-beaters, whatever meat you can afford, frozen veg's, bread dough.
Some dairy can be frozen such as milk and cheese, but may not have the same consistency when thawed (good for grilled cheese, etc) but are still edible.

It depends on the type of rice you are using.



RICE



Add a tablespoon of oil to the water when cooking rice so the grains stay separate and don't stick together.



• 1 cup dry rice = approx. 7 oz. (wt.)
• 1 lb. dry rice = approx. 2 1/4 c. (vol.)
• 1 cup cooked rice = approx. 8 oz. (wt.)
• 1 lb. cooked rice = approx. 1 pt. (2 cups)



• 1 lb. dry rice yields about 6-7 cups cooked rice



Check their answer (complete answer) and see if you can figure from that.

What about like a breakfest quiche in the morning, u could even bake it shaped like a football (u can buy pans like that) and it should b easy to put candles in.



Pound cakes arent to sweet.  Or just fix up finger foods and do chip and dip in a football bowl.  And put the candle somewhere where hed really like to blow it out (if u know what I mean!) Just make sure he blows it out really quick!!!! Good Luck!

meat balls?!
Like let's say you have to have 20 candles, you can make 20 meatballs and put each candle in one meatball, I guess that's gonna be a unique "birthday cake".
Or maybe hamburger? steak? meatloaf?
casserole?
There are actually a lot of things that can "function" as a birthday cake, it all depends on what he likes.



And you can still make a cake, it doesn't have to be sweet. You can make lemon cake, with maybe lemon filling and lemon butter frosting. Mmmmm...

While cleaning out the fridge tonight, I found 4 muffins(3 chocolate & 1 blueberry) in sealed zip-lock baggies?



with the date of 09/07/2008 on them. They smelled fine and I see no trace of mold, nor are they dry to the touch.



Can they be eaten, or should we toss them?

Dinner recipes for sausage meat?



the only thing I can think of is to mix it with grated carrot and chopped onions and make it into patties (maybe breadcrumb them).



Has anybody got anything more interesting without pepper or Chili in it? one of our family is allergic to them so it has to be fairly plain.

This is the best recipe :) Try it out:



*  2 tablespoons olive oil



* 1/4 cup diced onions



* 1 tablespoon chopped garlic



* 1 teaspoon cumin powder



* 1 tablespoon hot sauce



* 1 pound left over chicken breast



* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro



* Salt and pepper



* 8 (10-inch) flour tortillas



* 2 cups leftover dirty rice



* 1 cup grated cheddar, plus 1 cup for topping



* 1 cup tomato sauce



Directions



Heat skillet on medium flame, add oil and saute onions. Once the onions are sauteed, add the garlic, cumin powder, hot sauce and chicken. Saute until the chicken is heated, then add the chopped cilantro and season with salt and pepper.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Once all the tortillas are stuffed and in the casserole dish, pour the tomato sauce over the top, and sprinkle the rest of the cheddar cheese over the sauce. Bake casserole for 20 to 30 minutes until heated through and the cheddar should be melted

Chili, chicken noodle and chicken tortilla... I LOVE beef stew, but I don't know of any stew that can be done in less than an hour.



For the easiest chili, brown ground beef (or chunks of beef) in a little oil. Add broth and seasoning packet (I know, it's a big cheat, but it's SO easy... Buy it from Ralphs) and simmer for a while. Serve w/ cornbread, grated cheese and chopped onions.

Yummm!  I make this pretty often. Ina Gaarten, The Barefoot Contessa has a good recipe.  Mostly, I just wing it.



Make the gravey from chicken stock or chicken broth.  Use a baking pan.  I don't know how big your dish is so it's hard to give you ratios for the gravy.



Try melting two tablespoons of butter, stirring in two tablespoons of flour and then adding 2 cups of chicken broth or stock.  Salt & pepper. Pour as much of this gravy mixture as you need into the chicken, veggie baking pan.

I'm sorry, but I do not have any suggestions for making the gravy. I wil say, however, that you should not make the mistake of having too much of one ingredient in your pie. Don't put too much veggies or chicken or anything.

The reason you cook meat is to kill all the bacteria etc that will inevitably infest it. It's just silly to eat raw meat because you have no idea where it's been and you'll probably end up getting ill. Don't eat raw meat, it's not cool or clever.

Is my strawberry jam off or is it "crystallized"?



Well, I've been looking forward to a nice scone with strawberry jam and cream for ages. So I finally get my scone, but then I open the jam, and it's got like, mold on it or something. the top is all white and non-jamy looking. It's pretty gross.



So I refuse to eat it, because I think it's gone off. But my mother claims it's just crystallized. Note that this is a woman who tries to feed my strawberries covered in white fur.



So is it off or just crystallized? Is it safe to eat?

Is it possible to make candy from just water, a torch or small fire, a tiny cup, and plain granulated sugar?



I put some granulated sugar in the cup, and put that over the flame, but it turned brown before the rest of the grains melted, and when it hardend, i poped it out of the tiny aluminum thin cup, and it tasted burnt. is it possible to make any candy from just those items? if not, what else would i need to make some basic candy?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Yes it is possible, but with candy you have to be very careful with what the temperature is, because if it is too hot, it can crystallize and burn, if it is too cool then it will take too long to harden, so you have to find a balance.  Try finding a candy thermometer if you can, they have different levels of heat you need to apply while making candy and the different levels will give you different types of candy from hard candy, to taffy, to gummy.  With what you have, water, sugar, and heat, you can make a simple syrup base and add the flavoring of your choice, but you have to watch the temperature or you won't get anywhere.

How about an english layered trifle?  It is simple and flop-proof plus you can get really creative with the layers and it is always a great talking point at a dinner party as this is a fairly novel dessert to anyone outside England and former english colonies like South Africa where I'm from.  Here are a few links to trifle recipes for inspiration.

* 2 cups strong black coffee



* 1/2 cup marsala (see note)



* 3 eggs, separated



* 1/3 cup caster sugar

3. Beat eggwhites in a medium bowl with electric beaters until soft peaks form. Using a large metal spoon, gently fold eggwhites into the mascarpone mixture.



4. Dip enough biscuits into the coffee mixture to cover the base of a 19cm square ceramic dish. Cover the biscuits with one-third of the mascarpone mixture. Repeat layers 2 times, ending with the cream. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Dust generously with cocoa and serve.

* 1 1/2 cups (240g) icing sugar, sifted



* 300g mascarpone



* Sugar flowers or edible flowers, to decorate



Method



1. Preheat oven to 170°C. Grease two 24cm cake tins and line bases with baking paper. Sift flour, baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt into a large bowl of an electric mixer. Add 6 eggs, butter, sugar, and mandarin rind and juice, and beat on low speed until ingredients are moistened. Scrape down sides of bowl and beat for 1 minute or until mixture is smooth and well combined. Divide mixture between tins. Smooth tops, then bake cakes for 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Stand cakes in tins for 8 minutes, then turn on to a wire rack to cool completely.



2. Combine strawberries, liqueur and 1/4 cup icing sugar in a bowl and set aside for 20 minutes. Using an electric mixer, whisk mascarpone, 2 tbs extra sugar and 2 egg yolks until very thick. In a clean bowl, whisk 2 eggwhites until soft peaks form. Gradually add remaining 2 tbs extra sugar and whisk until firm peaks form, then fold gently into mascarpone mixture.



3. Drain juices from strawberries and reserve. Place strawberries on one cake half and top with mascarpone mixture, spreading it 3cm from edge. Top with second cake. Add enough strawberry juices to remaining icing sugar to form a thick icing, then spread icing over top of cake, allowing it to drip down sides slightly. Stand until icing is set, then decorate with sugar or fresh flowers.

* 3 eggs



* 1 1/2 cups thickened cream, plus extra to serve

Method



1. To make the pastry, place the flour and icing sugar in a food processor and pulse for a few seconds. Add butter and process until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the egg and process until the mixture forms a ball. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.



2. Once chilled, roll pastry out on a lightly floured workbench and use to line a lightly greased 23cm fluted loose-bottomed tart pan. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to chill.



3. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line the pan with baking paper, fill with rice and blind-bake for 10 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 220°C. Place pumpkin puree, eggs, cream, sugar and spices in a processor and whiz until smooth. Pour into the tart shell, then bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 150°C and bake for a further 30-40 minutes. Cool, then serve with the extra cream, a drizzle of maple syrup and dusting of icing sugar.



PUMPKIN CAKE
Ingredients (serves 8)



* 600g piece peeled, seeded butternut or Queensland blue pumpkin



* 2 1/2 cups (550g) caster sugar



* Juice of 1 lemon



* 250g unsalted butter, chopped, softened



* 3 eggs, separated

* Finely grated rind of 2 oranges



* 2 cups (300g) self-raising flour

Remove from foil and cool. Mash cooled pumpkin then measure 1 cup puree. Using a vegetable peeler, peel reserved pumpkin into thin, wide strips.



2. Place 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water in a saucepan and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves. Add pumpkin strips and cook for 20 minutes or until pumpkin is translucent and syrup is thick. Using a slotted spoon, transfer pumpkin to a piece of baking paper to dry. When dry, place in a bowl and scatter with 1/2 cup sugar. Stir lemon juice into syrup and set aside.

I've never hear of it being actually bad, but it's starchy and can lead to obesity if your diet doesn't include other things like vegetables. Other problem with rice is that most people eat it with huge amounts of butter, cheese, or cream sauces.

So what I'm asking is, if anyone knows any great recipes that they're willing to spare, I would love to have them. Anything is acceptable. Desserts, dinners, breakfast, and lunch.



It will be greatly appreciated!

This website has a ton of quick and easy recipes. When I was in your position I was scared to death of cooking something other than toast & cereal, but I took one recipe at a time and became comfortable in the kitchen.
My recommendation is a crock pot! That is the BEST & easiest thing to use when you are starting to cook.

When I left home My mom got me this cookbook called Cooking with 3 Ingredients... It was a great book. I suggest going to your local bookstore and getting a few cookbooks for easy recipes.
The other thing about getting cookbooks is that they explain the basics. Ex: how long to boil and egg to make it soft or hard boiled. Lots of the basic skills you need to become an independent cook, so you won't need recipe's and cookbooks for ever.

As others have said allrecipes is a really good site.  My suggestion is to invest in a crock pot.  There are many really easy meals you can make and you do not have to worry about watching it all day.  There are also allot of casseroles that are quick and easy.  I am noting tater tot casserole.



Tater Tot Casserole
1 pound of hamburger cooked
1 bag of frozen mixed veggies (or whatever veggies you like)
1 can cream of chicken soup
1 8oz bag of cheddar cheese
1 bag of tater tots



Put a small amount of soup on the bottom of the casserole dish.  Layer the hamburger, mixed veggies, cream of chicken, tater tots.  Top with cheese and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until bubbly at 350 degrees.  You can cook this 15 minutes first and then put the cheese on top for the balance of cooking time.  The tater tots will crisp better that way.

Hi,



one of the best ways that I learned to cook is just to take things and experiment a little. It will mean the odd disaster - but for the sake of coming up with a few of your own dishes and getting to know what flavours and ingredients work with each other, it's well worth just giving it a go and trusting your own taste buds!



A few of my favourites though to start you off...



Breakfast: Drop Scones
200g/8 oz self raising flour
5g/1 oz caster sugar
1 egg
250ml/1⁄2 pint of milk
Pinch of salt



* Put the dry ingredients into a bowl and stir together.



* Make a well in the centre and drop in the egg and milk.



* Whisk everything together thoroughly. The batter should be a creamy consistency. Add a little more milk, if necessary.



* Pre-heat & lightly butter a heavy frying pan.



* Drop the batter in spoonfuls into the frying pan and cook about 2-3 minutes, until bubbles rise to the surface of the drop scones.



* Flip the drop scones over with a palette knife and let the other sides cook for a further 2 or 3 minutes - actually you will get to know when it's ready to flip them over, and then begin ignoring the timings!



* When the drop scones are cooked, place on  a clean tea towel on a cake cooling rack, and cover with another clean tea towel. The moisture and heat of the drop scones will be retained this way and they will stay soft. - I never usually bother with this alst bit, but rather I make a few at a time, then serve them up - it's quite a social thing at breakfast or any time of day. Put butter, golden syrup, bananas, etc on the table for people to choose as toppings. It's also nice to place thinnish slices of banana in the frying pan (one for each drop scone), then spoon the mixture over the top.



Lunch: Bread and dips
another good social style of lunching,



get some good quality extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinigar. fill a small pot to about half full with oil, then pour vinigar in - the vinigar will fall to the base, making a nice dip. You can also get some humous and guacamole. Get a selection of different breads, and some olives - put in the middle of a table and share with friends, or just the two of you.
Okay, so it's not really cooking (unless you want to try making some breads!), but it is a good lunch, it is good for you, and it's great if you want to entertain for friends.



3 Courses for dinner:



Starter: Parsnip and apple soup (this is a lot nicer than it might sound!)



1 medium onion
2 medium parsnips
1 medium cooking apple
1 pint vegetable stock (a stock cube is fine)
1 tsp mixed herbs (optional)
1 pint milk



* Chop onions parsnips and apple and sauté in oil for a few minutes.
* Add stock. Bring to the boil and simmer for approximately 30 minutes
* Allow to cool slightly, then liquidise. Add the milk during this.



Serve this with fresh bread rolls - there are some great packet mixes around that make the job a lot easier!



Main: (this is for one person, obviously, so just adjust according to how many people you dare to cook for!)
Get a really sharp knife and cut into the fattest part of a chicken breast - try to make a decent size insision into the meat without going through it (it doesn't matter if this doesnt quite work every time!). Into that, stuff with chilli cheese - there are a few varieties out there - if you buy from the deli counter, they will usually let you try a little bit of the ones you are interested in before you commit to buying any.



Once done, wrap the chicken breast in a single layer of streaky bacon -  you may need three or four strips to cover completely.



Now you can do one of two things, either whack straight into a hot oven (about 200C - fan assisted), for 25 minutes, or pan fry for a bit first to give it some good colour, then transfer to the oven for about 20 mins.



Do remember to wash your hands after touching raw chicken and baconbefore touching anything else - I usually make sure I have the ingredients all ready next to me on a plate).



Serve with whatever takes your fancy - mash potato, stemed peas and carrots works really well.



Dessert: "Lemon Crunch"
blitz up 300g ginger nut biscuits.
Gently melt a large knob of butter in a pan
add gingernut biscuits into this and stir together.
press this mixture into a medium flan dish or spring-form cake mould. - Don't press it too firmly though, or it will be a pig to cut later!



While this is coolling down a bit, get the zest from two lemons, then juice them. Add this into a bowl along with a tin of condensed milk and a small tub of double cream. Whisk it all together for a minute or so, then pour over the biscuit base.



Crumble up a flake bar, or grate some chocolate ofer the top, then put in the fridge to set.



It's really easy to make - try substituting a bit of the lemon zest/juice for lime, or orange. It looks good, and is delish!

when you eat it, it will be moist or contain much pf water, it's not good in taste

Freeze away, as long as the quiche is allowed to become cold first. Make sure the freezer is on its top setting while the new stuff freezes, then turn back to normal setting.

I never put lemon juice in or on my pancakes but all my pancakes have edges.  Your question is very odd
-----------------
If you don't mind, would you post if this is a UK thing?



In the US, 99% of people put butter and maple syrup on their pancakes.



I never even heard of putting lemon on pancakes but might give it a shot if i found out that an entire country was doing it...lol

Unfortunately you can have pancakes without lemon of any kind, but how this information got out I'll never know. We have pancake parlours here in the UK - that originated in France, I think - where they serve both savoury and sweet pancake dishes and not a lemon in sight !

I can't see how you would make a pancake without edges, every solid object has edges  - but you do not have to have lemon juice - many people have nothing - lots have something different - like Maple Syrup for instance.

Spaghetti sauce question?



ok. I've never really made spaghetti before. There is a boxed kind that I have had before. But anyhow, I want to buy a jar of spaghetti sauce, do I need to refrigerate it after opening?? How long can I keep it for? I'm looking to keep it for a good while. I've seen some spaghetti sauce mixes. Do they last longer than the sauce in a jar?? Would it be better to buy it instead?? Thanks in advance for any decent answers.

Creole Christmas Fruit Cake w/ Whisky Sauce



For the Simple Syrup:
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup water



1 1/2 tablespoons lemon zest, cut in strips



2 tablespoons lemon juice



For the Cake:



1/2 pound mixed dried fruits, such as blueberries, cranberries, cherries, raisins, and chopped apricots



1/2 pound, (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature



1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar



2 ounces almond paste



4 large eggs



1/2 cup Grand Marnier, or other orange-flavored liqueur



2 cups bleached all-purpose flour



1 teaspoon baking powder



1/8 teaspoon salt



1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon



Pinch freshly grated nutmeg



1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted



1/2 cup pecan pieces



1/2 cup walnut pieces



1/4 cup bourbon



Make a simple-syrup by combining the sugar and water in a medium-size heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the lemon zest and juice and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil for 2 minutes and remove from the heat.



Combine the dried fruits in a large mixing bowl. Pour the simple-syrup over them, toss to coat and let steep for 5 minutes. Strain and reserve the syrup.



Cream the butter, sugar and almond paste together in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle at low speed, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Beat until the mixture is fluffy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs 1 at a time, mixing in between each addition on low speed and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add 1/4 cup of the Grand Marnier and mix to incorporate.



Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg in a medium-size mixing bowl and blend well. Add this mixture 1/2 cup at a time to the butter mixture with the mixer on low speed, each time mixing until smooth, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. The batter will be thick.



Add the warm fruit and all of the nuts a little at a time, mixing well. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle.



Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.



Lightly grease a bundt pan with butter or non-stick baking spray. Pour the batter into the pan and bake until golden brown and the top springs back when touched, about 45 to 50 minutes (turning the pan to ensure even browning after 30 minutes.)



Cool the cake for 20 minutes in the pan, then remove and continue to cool upside-down on wire racks.



Make tiny holes with a toothpick randomly on the rounded end of the cake. Combine the remaining simple syrup with the remaining 1/4 cup of Grand Marnier and the bourbon. Wrap the cake in a layer of cheesecloth and pour 1/4 cup of the syrup over the top of each cake. Store in a plastic zip bag for 3 or 4 days until the cake is slightly stale. Sprinkle syrup over cakes once every 2 to 3 days until all of the syrup is used. Let the cakes age for up to 3 weeks before eating.



For the Whiskey Sauce:



3 cups heavy cream



1/2 cup bourbon



1/2 cup granulated sugar



1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons cornstarch



Combine 2 3/4 cups of the cream with the bourbon and sugar in a medium-size nonstick saucepan over medium-heat. Stir to dissolve the sugar.



In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 1/4 cup cream. Add this to the cream-and-bourbon mixture and simmer stirring often, until the mixture thickens, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve warm with the fruitcake.



The sauce may be stored, after it has cooled, in an airtight container for 24 hours. When ready to serve, warm over low heat.

Soup - Black-Eyed Pea
This recipe is being prepared in a 6-1/2 quart slow cooker, if you have a smaller pot, cut the recipe in half.



Ingredients



2 lbs. Black-eyed Peas, dried
3 cups Onions, diced
1 - 6-oz. can Tomato Paste
4 Bay Leaves
Cayenne Pepper or Hot Sauce, to taste (optional)
(To enlarge the photo of the black-eyed pea soup, click on the photo or link)



Preparation



This black-eyed pea soup is best prepared the evening before you want to serve it.



Turn on the slow cooker (Crock-Pot) to "high."



Boil 12 cups of water and carefully pour into the cooker pot. Cover with the lid.



While the water is boiling, wash the dried black-eyed peas in a strainer and remove any extraneous matter.  It is best to do this in quantities of no more than one cup at a time.  Add the black-eyed peas to the pot, and cover again.



Add the bay leaves.



Before going to bed, turn the slow cooker down to "low."



In the morning, mix the black-eyed pea soup, add the tomato paste, and mix again.  If the soup is too thick, boil one more cup of water, add it to the pot, and mix.  Repeat as necessary.



Wash, peel, and dice the onions, and add to the the cooker pot. (We precook the onions in our microwave oven.)  Add cayenne pepper or hot sauce (optional, adjust to taste).  Cover the pot.



If you are planning to eat the black-eyed pea soup at noon, we suggest turning the heat back up to "high."  Mix the soup every hour.



If you are going to be away during the day, and are planning to eat the black-eyed pea soup in the evening, leave the pot setting on "low."



Serve and enjoy with a large tossed salad.

first, see the expiration date. It is ok if it is only defrosted and you put it again to the refrigerator. If it is defrosted and you put it out to the refrigerator. Smell the ham. If it is ok, then you can eat it.

I use provolone, mozzarella and parmesan. Here's the recipe I use:



Baked Ziti



Ingredients:
1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta



1 pound lean ground beef (I use pork sausage instead)
1 onion, chopped



2 (28 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce



6 ounces sliced provolone cheese



6 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese



1 1/2 cups sour cream



1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese



1/4 cup chopped fresh basil



Directions:
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.



In a large skillet, brown beef over medium heat. Add onions; saute until tender. Drain off fat and add spaghetti sauce; simmer for about 15 minutes.



Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).



In a lightly greased 2 quart baking dish, place about half of the pasta; top with a layer of provolone and mozzarella cheese slices. Spread on a layer of half the spaghetti sauce mixture and sour cream.



Cover with remaining pasta, cheese and sauce; sprinkle a layer of Parmesan cheese and fresh basil.



Bake in preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until cheese and sauce are bubbly; serve.

Use a long log of FRESH mozzarella if you can afford it.  It is the BEST!



Otheriwse, try adding 1 bag shredded mozzarella to your ricotta, with 1 package SOFTENED cream cheese too.  Add in 1 T dried basil and 1 tsp. salt.  That is how I make the mixture for my baked pastas and lasagna.  Mix all 3 cheeses together.



If you have parmesan, add a little parm too, for added salty flavor.

I use a 14.5 ounce box of Pasta, small container of Ricotta (about a cup), and  8 ounces of mozzarella (shredded), half I put in the pasta mix, the other half on top.  I also add 1/2 cup grated romano and/or Parmesan cheese to mixture sometimes.  I spread a small amount of sauce on the bottom of a glass baking pan it keep the Ziti from sticking.  I never use metal pans as the tomato sauce will ruin the pan.

When I was a child my Great Aunt used to put the pumpkin seeds in the oven to dry or roast.  Once done (usually 15-20mins) she would place them into a paper bag, put a little butter, sugar, and Cinnamon in with them and then shook them up!  I think she put them back into the oven for 5-10 more mins.  They're actually really good! Try it you might like too.

Spaghetti sauce question?



ok. I've never really made spaghetti before. There is a boxed kind that I have had before. But anyhow, I want to buy a jar of spaghetti sauce, do I need to refrigerate it after opening?? How long can I keep it for? I'm looking to keep it for a good while. I've seen some spaghetti sauce mixes. Do they last longer than the sauce in a jar?? Would it be better to buy it instead?? Thanks in advance for any decent answers.

If you do buy a jar, you will probably use most of it over 1 lb of spaghetti.



Toss some of it in with the cooked spaghetti (to prevent sticking) and serve some on the side to accomodate individual preferences for amount of sauce.



Refrigerate left over sauce but use it fairly quickly (a few days)



Never heard of a spaghetti sauce mix.



There are a million sauce recipes, but the ingredients are simple.



Garlic or Onion, Basil, some use oregano,



Some use celery and carrot finely chopped (with the onion).



And tomatoes of course.

Yes, you will need to refrigerate the spaghetti sauce after you open it. It is good to keep anything that comes in a can or jar refrigerated after you open it, especially if you are unsure.



Keep the top on tightly, and it should be good for a while. I've been going though a jar of sauce for about a week now and it is still good.



A mix would keep longer if it is a powdered mix of some kind. Foods without water in them generally keep longer.

If I don't have time to make a homemade sauce, then I always buy the jarred variety. They taste good. You can always add more ingredients (extra garlic, mushrooms, herbs, etc.) to the sauce to suit your tastes.



The storage directions are listed on the jar. You always have to store it in the refrigerator. It only lasts a few days though. Eventually, it will begin to grow mold.

Yes refrigerate it after opening, it keeps for several days.  What i do is make a big pot of sauce then freeze it in a ziplock bag and wrap it in tinfoil for future use, it can save 4-6 months in the freezer.  There are many good jarred sauces out there, one of my favorites is Newman's sauces, they are affordable, tasty, and the money goes to charity!

Refridgerate open sauce jars after opening. They should stay good for at least 1 to 2 weeks. Any longer than that, pour the sauce into an ice tray and you can just pop out the number of "sauce cubes" you need and thaw them! Or you can just freeze the sauce in a plastic baggie or tupperware and thaw as needed.
The boxed kind are not good at all.

If you buy Jar Spaghetti Sauce and don't use it all, You will need to refrigerate it. I wouldn't keep it in the refrigerator more then seven days.
If you want to keep the left over Spaghetti Sauce Longer put the extra in the Freezer.
As for Spaghetti Sauce in the Box your going to have to do the same



thing for storing as you need to do for Jar Spaghetti.

I usually make my own, but if I use the jarred kind, I add some dry red wine.  Also, Ragu and Prego don't have the authentic Italian taste....too sweet!  Newman's is good, as well as Bertoli and Classico in the mid-price range.  I find that the more you pay, the better it is.  You really do get what you pay for in this case.
As with anything in a jar, you DO have to refrigerate the leftovers, and use within a week, but simmer it all with the wine, then re-jar it.
The powdered stuff???  Yuck!

The jar spaghetti sauce does have to be refrigerated after opening, but I don't keep mine longer than 2 weeks.



If I have the time I make my sauce using the spaghetti sauce mix. I use buffalo beef (very lean) onions, fresh mushrooms, sweet Italian sausage, 2 can of stewed tomatoes, 1/2 cup of red wine, spaghetti sauce mix, 1 can tomato paste, 1 cup of water, 1 tsp oregano & simmer. You can also freeze the sauce but I haven't kept it longer than a month.  Enjoy!

An easy way to double or triple a recipe is to use the same measurement they use two or three times.  Instead of saying 3/4 X3 = 2 1/4



just do 3/4 three times.  Get it?  one 3/4 two 3/4 three 3/4.

"Pumpkin pie spice is a blend of "warm" spices, generally including some or all of the following: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, allspice, mace. There are indeed a lot of pie recipes out there that call for pumpkin pie spice, but there are probably as many where the recipe writer specifies a particular mix of individual spices.  There are a variety of pumpkin pie spice blends on the market at various prices in various quantities. You can also easily make your own. — and quite possibly without having to run out to the store. Here are a few options:



Mix 1/4 cup of cinnamon with 4 tsp of ground ginger and 2 tsp of nutmeg



Mix 1/4 cup cinnamon with 1 Tbsp each of ground ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves



Mix 1/4 cup cinnamon with 2 Tbsp of ground ginger and 1 Tbsp each of nutmeg and ground cloves



Mix 2 Tbsp each of cinnamon and ground ginger with 1 Tbsp ground nutmeg and 1 tsp ground allspice."

For 1 pie you'd need 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Remember if you are really going from scratch meaning baking your own pumpkin then you need a sugar pumpkin which is different from your jack ' lantern pumpkin. But if you're using canned then 2 tasp. of your spice will work.

What might make a banana ripen quickly is if you leave it in the Sunlight, ( I tried this, and it worked ). And what will make a banana ripen slowly is if you leave it in the shade or in the refrigerator.

Bunny, for someone who worked in the produce section, you should know that putting it in the fridge does NOT make a banana ripen quicker.  It will SLOW the ripening process, although it will make the skin turn black (but fruit will still be fine to eat).



Putting a banana in a brown paper bag is the best way to speed ripening.  Ethelyn is produced by the banana in the ripening process, and the bag traps it in when it is released which, in turn, makes ripening even quicker.

You probably could learn a few things from the game.  For instance, what ingredients to cook first (the ones that take the longest).  They also show you how to cut certain things, arrangements, etc.  It's more of a game than anything, but yes, you could certainly pick up something useful from it.

Best way to learn to cook is to go to the bookstore first!



Get a cookbook: Better Homes and Gardens, Betty Crocker, Fanny Farmer. My absolute favorite is the BH&G. Yes, they are quite expensive, but think instead of the investment you are making.



I have had my BH&G for nearly 50 years! I didn't need a learn to cook book when I got it, but it does have all the "how-to's" in it at the front of each section. It is a life time investment in Happy Cookery!! You won't really need any other cookbooks ever, but it does lead to collecting as many as possible to get all the variations on the theme you wish for later.

Self-rising flour can be created by combining 1½ teaspoons of baking powder with a ½ teaspoon of salt and 1 cup of all-purpose flour. This substitute equals one cup of self-rising flour.

Yeah, you'll be fine.  My old dear always used to use baking powder instead of self raising flour and it works just fine.  Chuck about a teaspoon in there....but, if it doesn't work, I am not to blame!  Happy baking!

Flours~



US & UK all purpose and plain flour can be interchanged without any adjustments.  US cake flour is lighter however, and can be substituted with 1 cup minus 3 Tbsp. of all purpose/plain flour, and add 3 Tbsp. of cornstarch or potato flour to make the full cup.  Self rising flour can be made by substituting 1 cup of all purpose/plain flour minus 2 tsp., and add 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt to make the full cup.

I don't go to Chili's cuz I have a grudge against them.  One morning I walked in right when they opened at 10:30am.



I looked at a menu and decided upon mashed potatoes.



I gave my order and it took forever to get to my table.  Like they hadn't even gotten the potatoes boiling til I ordered.



All the employees were running around doing stuff that should have already been done before they opened.  I think if the sign says.....Open at 10:30am....then they should be ready to take orders at 10:30am.



I know the great majority of their business doesn't start til 11 or a bit after, but that's irrelevant.

You roast them right when you take them out of the pumpkin, you clean them with salt water and then cover them in oilve oil, worchstershire sauce and garlic powder and salt, then bake  at 350 for about an hour and keep checking them ,they are wet so they need to be completely dry before eating or they wont get crunchy, then you can eat the whole thing, they are very yummy! the shell is not like a sunflower seed it is actually edible.

dont put it in the microwave but take the dough put it in a tightly sealed plastic bag and run it under warm water for about 10 -15 minutes that will not totally un thaw it but at least get it so that you can cut it...there is no need to have it totally unfrozen before you bake it! Good Luck!

I wouldn't recommend putting it in the microwave because it will start to cook in places. If it's that kind that is tube shaped leave it on the counter for about 10 min. then run a sharp knife under hot water and you should be able to cut through them quite easily.

yeah!! defrost them on soften butter setting. About power level 3 for 15 seconds at a time.



Cookie dough slices best if it is still icy cold. Sharp butcher knife or boning knife works best.



Defrost only enough to be able to get the knife through the dough, lay on the cookie sheets and allow to finish defrosting. about 5 minutes to baking tops!!

KNORR SPINACH DIP



PREP TIME: 10 Minute(s)
CHILL TIME: 2 Hour(s)



INGREDIENTS
1 package (10 oz.) baby spinach, chopped or 1 package (10 oz.) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
1 container (16 oz.) sour cream
1 cup Hellmann's® or Best Foods® Real Mayonnaise
1 package Knorr® Vegetable recipe mix
1 can (8 oz.) water chestnuts, drained and chopped (optional)
3 green onions, chopped (optional)



PREPARATION
Everyone loves our dip! Here's how we make it:



Combine all ingredients and chill about 2 hours. Serve with your favorite dippers to your favorite people.
A new serving idea: Hollow out cucumber slices and cherry tomatoes. Fill vegetables with Knorr Spinach Dip and garnish with a sprig of dill.
MAKES 4 cups dip



Definitely go for the water chestnuts, they add a nice crunch. You can also use Pumperknickel bread and make a cauldron. Turn it upside down to hollow out, the flat bottom gives a nice edge. Place it on a fire of big pretzel logs with red/orange/yellow bell pepper flames.

Halloween Brain Dip



Cauliflower is hollowed out and filled with avocado dip to make a realistic brain that you will enjoy serving to guests! Perfect for Halloween parties.



INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)
2 avocados



1/2 cup prepared salsa



1 head cauliflower



6 thin slices red and blue fruit leather



DIRECTIONS
Slice the avocados in half. Remove the seeds and set aside. Scoop the avocado out of the skin into a bowl. Mash with a fork or whisk and stir in the salsa. Set aside. Slice off one side of each pit to make it flat and expose the cores of the pits. They will look like eyes.



Remove all of the leaves from the cauliflower and remove the stem, leaving a nice hollow area with the outer part of the head intact. Use toothpicks to hold it together if it starts to fall apart.



Place the cauliflower into a small bowl, so that the hollow is facing upwards and most of the cauliflower is up out of the bowl. The bowl is just for stability. Fill with the avocado dip and arrange the pits as eyes. Decorate the white ''brain'' by weaving thin strands of red and blue fruit leather between the florets to make veins and arteries. I wrap the bowl with cheesecloth and decorate with red food coloring to make it even more horrific!

At Thanksgiving, there are usually so many side dishes, people tend to keep the portions small so they can fit everything on 1 plate. I would think this recipe would serve 25 people...between 3 and 4 oz. per serving.

I have this casserole that I make for my nieces and they love it.



You cook 2 cups of chicken (or you can buy one already cooked like I do, lol) and shred it.



You chop 1/2 cup of onion and 1/4 cup of both green and red bell pepper



Mix the chicken, onion, and peppers with 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 1 cup of monteray jack/ cheddar cheese shredded.



Cook 12 oz. of egg noodles until done (al dente) then mix the noodles with the rest of the mixture and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, place another cup of the cheese mixture on top and bake again for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted.  It's quite good and I hope you find it delicious as much as my nieces do, lol.

7. CATALINA CHICKEN:



From DontH8Me
http://www.city-data.com/forum/recipes/2...



"Catalina Chicken from the thighs and legs - separate them and skin them before baking to keep the fat down, if you prefer. The recipe I use is typically for a whole chicken, so I would substitute 4 - 5 legs and thighs in this case.



Take the cleaned pieces and put them in a rectangular glass baking dish. Mix one small or 1/2 large bottle of Catalina Island French salad dressing with one envelope of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix. At this stage, depending on your preference, you could add to the pan of chicken any of the following: Onions, 1 inch dice, red/green/yellow bell pepper, 1 inch dice, and/or pineapple tidbits. Pour the sauce mix over the whole thing and swirl it around to coat all the pieces. Cover with foil to keep moist.



Bake in a 375 degree oven until the chicken juices run clear. You will want to make a batch of fluffy rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce from the chicken bake. My family loves this recipe and it takes less than 5 minutes to prep."

Chicken Fried Steak.  It makes a great Sunday Dinner or an everyday sandwich.  So cheap and easy to make.  Here is how I do it.



Buy some cubed steaks.  Season some all purpose flour with salt, pepper, garlic salt and Lowry's season salt.  Dredge meat in flour then drop them in a small amount of vegetable oil.  Cook till golden brown on both sides.  Heat on a Electric Stove should be just slightly past medium.  Cook like a piece of chicken then serve with mashed potatoes, gravy and your favorite vegetable.  If your from the south, serve with Sweet tea and some rolls.

"Greek" is used to describe things/people/cuisine from the nation of Greece. The simplest Greek dish I can think of is tzatziki sauce with toasted pita bread. The tzatziki is plain yogurt, diced cucumbers, a little diced onion, lemon juice, dill, and salt. Should be cool, tangy, and smooth.

A good and easy food, which can easily either last you a few days or serve many is this:



boil up some pasta



strain off the water, put pasta back in the pan



add soup to the pan - plus any other herbs, etc you may want to add, maybe some of the mushrooms, etc you think may go with it. Heat it through thoroughly, stirring frequently.



If you have cheese, you could then put it all into an oven proof bowl, cover with cheese and whack under the grill for a few minutes to brown the cheese.



Plate up! (or bowl!)



Enjoy.

Here are three options:



Stir fry looks good, you have awesome veggies.  Cut them up, saute in oil and spice them up with what you have.



Fried potatoes with sausage, onions, garlic and cheese sounds good, can replace sausage with the ham.

If you're extremely lucky, you will end up with a lambic style sourish beer. More than likely, though, it will get infected with something like lactobacillus and taste terrible. Down here, we have the "South Texas Lambic", and believe me, it's not pleasant.

8 medium Granny Smith apples, chopped
1/4 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
Preparation:
Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add apples, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Sauté 15 to 20 minutes, or until apples are tender. Serve as a side dish for pork or with breakfast. Serves 6.

The way I fry apples is to cut the apples in half, remove the core & seeds then slice it (thick or thin - it's up to you.)  Melt some butter in your frying pan (approx. 1 tbsp. per 2 apples) add your apples slices & some brown sugar & nutmeg (optional) and cook until apple slices are tender.  I prefer Granny Smith apples, but any type will do.  Just remember that if the apples are tart you might want to add a bit more sugar if you want them sweeter.  That's a matter of taste.



Hope this helps!  Enjoy!

Ingredients
Cake:
1 (18 1/4-ounce) package yellow cake mix



1 egg



8 tablespoons butter, melted



Filling:
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened



1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin



3 eggs



1 teaspoon vanilla



8 tablespoons butter, melted



1 (16-ounce) box powdered sugar



1 teaspoon cinnamon



1 teaspoon nutmeg



Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.



Combine the cake mix, egg, and butter and mix well with an electric mixer. Pat the mixture into the bottom of a lightly greased 13 by 9-inch baking pan.



To make the filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and pumpkin until smooth. Add the eggs, vanilla, and butter, and beat together. Next, add the powdered sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and mix well. Spread pumpkin mixture over cake batter and bake for 40 to 50 minutes. Make sure not to overbake as the center should be a little gooey.



Serve with fresh whipped cream.



Variations: For a Pineapple Gooey Cake: Instead of the pumpkin, add a drained 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple to the cream cheese filling. Proceed as directed above.



For a Banana Gooey Cake: Prepare cream cheese filling as directed, beating in 2 ripe bananas instead of the pumpkin. Proceed as directed above.



For a Peanut Butter Gooey Cake: Use a chocolate cake mix. Add 1 cup creamy peanut butter to the cream cheese filling instead of the pumpkin. Proceed as directed above

For your traditional british recipes you can't beat good old delia:

This recipe uses lamb kidneys and lamb best end and neck, however when I make it I just use whichever cut of lamb I can find (normally leg) and leave the kidneys out.  Also I like to add carrots to the cassserole below the potatoes.  Tried & tested - this recipe makes a nice juicy hotpot.

Despite these facts, there is no doubt that Avesil contains some good ingredients: Super Citrimax, Chromium, Green Tea extract and caffeine. These ingredients work together to increase the fat burning effect in the body, releasing stored fat, boosting energy and decreasing the appetite. The website provides the results of clinical trials performed on the ingredients and showed that Avesil is three times more effective in weight loss than by just diet and exercise alone (although the manufacturers do recommend a healthy, active lifestyle).
While Avesil does appear to be a promising product, it is too soon to say how successful it actually proves to be and, not knowing the exact amounts of the ingredients in the formula, makes it hard to judge adequately. It is hard to evaluate if there is enough of any of the ingredients to be effective as a weight loss supplement. The secrecy surrounding the ingredients is not an indication of the ability of this product to deliver the desired results but is a cause for concern. Finally, it is likely that the price will be off-putting at a cost of $89.95 per month. The consumer can take advantage of a free trial offer but should be aware that if not cancelled promptly, they may be signed up for the auto-ship program which can itself be hard to cancel.



If you do shop for a weight loss product in a health store, pharmacy or on the Internet, you'll often find hundreds of different brands containing a confusing array of ingredients. You may be tempted to experiment with different diet aids until you find one that works. But this approach may be expensive. Jennifer Berniello, a respected nutritional writer from Health News Minute did a fantastic review on diet pills and their actual effectiveness in a recent feature, the results are quite surprising.

I love to buy a big cheaper cut of meat and make soup or stews with it. you can use any roast and just chunk it up and brown it then let it cool and put it in freezer bags in soup pot sized portions. I also make a lot of soups with beans or barley to stretch out the meat to save money.



If I am making a cream soup I will use non-dairy powdered coffee creamer to thicken the soup.



A big pot of pasta sauce with just a little meat and a lot of veg added will go quite far and freezes well for a quick meal later.

you can grill it over an open flame or put saute it in a pan. toss it the asparagus in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. fresh minced garlic would be better. then just throw it on the grill/pan with butter and cook until tender.



oh yeah, dont over cook it until it they are limp, you still want a little bit of a snap

Roasting it in the oven is my favorite, as well as grilled.  For roasting, lightly coat with good olive oil (a Misto is perfect to apply if you have one), and put in a 425 degree oven for about 15-25 minutes (don't over bake ~ crunch is good).  I sometimes also like to add quartered zucchini, thickly sliced red onions, bell peppers, whole cherry tomatoes, a few sprigs of your favorite herb (Rosemary loves everything in my house!), and garlic.  Make sure to turn about every 5 minutes after the first 10 minutes of baking time, and watch carefully towards the end.



If just doing asparagus, I also love it topped with provolone/parmesan cheese browned under the broiler after it has been roasted (make sure to cover the entire spear with cheese so they do not burn).



On the grill, coat it lightly with olive oil as above, and make sure to keep turning every minute or so (depending upon how hot your grill is).  When I do a veggie mix, as above, I skewer them, and just pay attention that they do not burn.

Hi,
when you are buying asparagus make sure you buy the skinny female asparagus. The fat (male) asparagus is not as tasty as the skinny asparagus.  To cook it you just need to steam it.  Place asparagus in a bowl or pot placed over a pot with water in it.  You should steam it for 3 - 4 minutes only. You want it firm not limp.  If you over steam it, it will be yucky. You can add garlic and salt to the water, so that the steam flavours the asparagus.  Also you can cover it with garlic butter, or regular butter and sliced almonds. YUMMMMM

It's very good with roasted salmon. It can taste very nice with pepper and butter. Make sure to cook it for long enough so it is not cooked all the way through. Don't overcook it either though.

it depends on what type of sausage you're talking about. some sausages are already cooked. i prefer to poach my brats in beer and spices first then finish on the grill. breakfast sausages have enough fat in them already, so you don't need to add any oil to the pan. just cook them over medium heat.

Use vegetable oil (or any oil you want)



Pan fry or deep fry? If it's pan fried, it'll take 8 minutes. If you deep fry, it'll probably take a few minutes lesser. The instructions are probably written on the packaging.



How hot? I'd say turn the heat up 3/4's of the way (medium tto high heat). You don't want to burn the outside. Cook it slowly until the center of sausage turns brown (no pink bits).

Little olive oil/vegetable oil in a frying pan on a low heat.  Put in the sausages and cover with a lid.  You must turn frequently to avoid burning, replacing the lid each time (allows the sausages to cook in the middle and keep the hot oil in the pan and not all over the cooker!).  Total cooking time around 15-20 mins.

You can use anything really, butter, oil, lard, or you can just do them dry, i think its best just to use a drizzle of oil. Heat the oil in the pan for about 5 mins, on medium heat. They should take about 15 mins, there is no exact time, just however long it takes for them to go brown, once they're brown all over they're definitly cooked right through

I usually put a very small amount of oil (1 tsp) in the frying pan.  This will help the sausages to not stick at the beginning of cooking.  Sausages are typically fatty, so they will release some grease as they cook.  They burner should be set at medium or medium low... if the pan's too hot, the outsides of the sausages will burn before the middles are cooked.  Cooking time depends on the type of sausage... are these small breakfast sausages or big italian sausages, for example.  Breakfast sausages - about 10 minutes, but cut one open and check.  Italian sausage - at least 20 minutes, again cut one open and check.  Hope this helps!  Cooking is fun!

It depends on the kind of sausage you're cooking.  If you're doing breakfast links (brown and serve), you don't need oil and only a few minutes in a medium heat pan to warm them through.



If you're cooking raw breakfast links (like Jimmy Dean), I use 1 tsp of olive oil and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes or so, until the center of the sausage is no longer pink.



If you're taking about sausages like bratwurst (raw), I thaw them (if they're frozen), then simmer them in water or stock for about 8-9 minutes.  Then, remove from the liquid and grill for a few minutes to impart nice-looking grill marks on them.  If pan frying, use medium heat and cook (after simmering) until they get a good color on the casing.



If you're cooking pre-cooked sausage, like kielbasa, sometimes I cook it whole, other times I slice before cooking.  Again, I use 1 tsp of olive oil and cook over medium heat until the sausage gets a nice "crust" around the sliced edges.



Hope this helps.

use very little oil or EVEO. Because sausage has nautual jucies. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes on meduim heat in a pan. Or you could just use the microwave for about 30 to 45 sec. covered in a paper towel.

You use oil. I would tell you to use a deep fryer then you no everything is cooked.



If your using the flat pan it sort of makes the oil go madd.
First preheat the pan .. put your hand over it about 10 cm if you can feel the heat its hot enough.
Carefully put in the sausages.
Turn occasionally.
Even though the sausage may look burnt on the outside it doesn not mean the sausage is cooked before turning off the cooker cut the sausage in half and make sure it NOT PInk

For the pre-cooked ones, I like to cook mine in a little bit of water over medium heat (about a cup of water in a standard frying pan).  The water keeps them moist while the middle warms up, and by the time the water cooks out, the sausages or brats are ready to brown on the outside.  I brown them and serve them up.  Yummy :)

1. Put a small amount of oil into the pan (around 1-2 teaspoons) as the sausages will give out some fat. Heat the pan, until the oil runs easily around it and keep it onto a medium heat



2. How long you fry them for depends on their size, but typically around 20 minutes, turn 3 or 4 times



You'll find more information on cooking techniques etc. at this site



http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/recipe_coo...



Personally, I prefer to cook them in the oven



1. Heat oven to Gas 6, 200C



2. Put the sausages onto a baking tray or rack in a roasting tin



3. Cook for 15 minutes, then turn



4. Cook for a further 15 minutes

I never add oil when cooking sausage since they have enough of their own.  to make sure they are cooked



ht rough, I put the sausage in a pan with about1/2 inch of water in the bottom.  Place the cover on, and cook on high boil for 5 minutes.  Then remove the cover, let the water evaporate, and brown the sausage in the pan with the burner still on high.  The result will be well cooked, juicy, and browned sausage

you can cook them in many ways



and all the cooking instructions are on the sausage



because of the amount of fat content in a sausage, i tend not to use oil
i put the sausages into a cold pan and leave it to heat up on the low heat (if you fry without oil and heat the pan up first, it will stick and burn too easily)
once the pan starts to heat you will notice it getting more oily.. this is the fat in the sausage burning out
once the pan starts to get more oily .. you can then turn up the heat, cover with a lid



you keep turning the sausage so that each side turns browns



you can prick holes into the sausage so that you are certain it cooks inn the inside



the best way to cook is by oven or grill
when grilling you need to be constantly checking it because it will burn
you place your sauages on to an oven pan and put it under a low heat grill with no oil .. you continue to turn until all sides are brown



when ovening you cook it for 20+min's .. and when its down , it does look uncooked

Flavor salts or herbs need something to stick to.  You need to lightly spray on a liquid and then toss chips with the salt/herb mix while the chips are still moist.  Pop into a pre-heated 300 degree oven for 10 min. to crisp dry before serving or storing.



Spray suggestions are:



spray butter (refrigerator section of your market);



spray baking oil, some are flavored or olive oil based (in the baking section or near the oils in your market);
lo cal spray salad dressing -- comes in different flavors -- you might not need the flavor salts or herbs with these



OR Make Nachos!



spread chips on a baking sheet, top with olives, cheese, salsa, or whatever you like; bake till cheese melts; then put a dab of sour cream and/or guacamole on top.  You can mound the chips or spread them out so most get some of the salsa and cheese.

Gelatin is made by boiling bones connective tissue skin and hooves. Then it is filtered processed and dried to make Gelatin.



Jello is made in a similar fashion. After the liquid is filtered, food flavors, sugar and anti-caking chemicals are added. The liquid is dehydrated forming crystals. Jello also is the brand name.



In a way Jello is a flavored sweetened Gelatin with starches and anti-caking agents.

OK, the little smokies are already cooked, so all you are doing is making the sauce. I use some canned spaghetti sauce and add some mushrooms and BBQ sauce and A-1 steak sauce and some crushed garlic and heat until it perks, gets bubbles, which means the sauce is cooked. Then, simply turn the crock pot down to the lowest setting to keep things warm for serving. I LOVE sticking little smokies with a toothpick...

Main thing to remember is that you should fill your crock at least half full to achieve proper cooking (read the instruction manual if you have it).



I make these for Superbowl, but my recipe is one bottle of Chili Sauce, half jar of grape jelly (I know, sounds strange!), and weenies.  I cook mine on low for about 1-1/2 hours to 2 hours, stirring about every 15 minutes after the first 30 minutes of cooking time.  If your crock has a "warm" setting, that is what I would put it on after they are perfect in temperature.  But again, it depends upon how large your crock is, and how large of a batch you are making.



If you can post more info, I would be happy to help with more exact times.

i have to say that i don't like cheerio es sorry. But it does not mean other people cant like them just because i don't like them. Lots of people like Cheerios and when i was little i loved them but we change. Our taste buds change and no one cant change what we eat and not.



Sorry im a bit cheese.

I'm not big on the plain original one but I like the one in the blue box that's relatively new.  I think it's called Oat Clusters Cheerios, the Cheerios are lightly sweetned with brown sugar or cinnamon and then oat clusters are added.



There is also a Honey Nut Cheerios snack mix that has Honey Nut Cheerios along with Corn Chex, cookies, pretzels and a few more things.  It's really good.

Ok Methods
1.  Baking spray - like Pam -- in the market in baking section (flour,sugar,spices)
2.  Waxed Paper - old method, not always the best
3.  Parchment paper, oiled or wiped with Crisco shortening



Best Methods
4.  *Reynolds Release Aluminum Foil -- Works very well for me -- use the correct side up, it is marked.
5.  Silicone baking mat like Sil-Pat -- washable, reusable, larger ones can be cut to size. Fairly expensive, but good for a long, long time.

You can buy those silicon baking sheet anywhere, but since you dont have one you can just spray cooking spray on the baking tin. Greasing the tin with butter helps too. Or just put the thing you wanna bake on a aluminum foil (if you have)

people been baking for longer than there are non stick sheets.  Not everything you bake needs to be on a greased pan.  what does your recipe reccomend?  For a cake or pan bars, I would grease the sheet pan and then flour it generously.  For cookies that need a greased sheet, grease it.  If they don't need a greased cookie sheet, don't grease it.

Use baking paper (also called baking parchment) to line the dish.
Or get butter on a kitchen towel and rub it into the sides, bottom and corners of the dish then sprinkle flour on it (put in about a tablespoon of flour and roll right round the dish then throw out the excess).

I am a total scratch cook, but also do not fancy sweets (chilehead!).  Therefore, when I needed a sweet treat for a party, I called my sister for a recipe, and this is what I made.  It was the bomb, super easy, and I have made it several times since with rave reviews.



KAHLUA CAKE



Cake:



1 package yellow cake mix
1 package (4 cups) chocolate instant pudding mix (unprepared)
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup Kahlua
1/2 cup water
1-1/2 cups chocolate chips



Mix all ingredients and pour into a bundt pan.  Bake at 325 for 45-55 minutes.



Icing:



1 cup powdered sugar
1-3 tablespoons Kahlua



Mix with a little water if you want to go easier on the Kahlua (not in my house!), and drizzle on cooled cake.  You want a thick consistency.

These terms are as the answerer above described but I believe they are all being used together to describe the yeast bread making process(es) so i think "roll up" is being used to describe a form of bread roll, and "punch" is being used to describe the way a the  first rising of a dough creates a lot of air and some of it has to be knocked out of it by lightly punching it out.

It's a packaging thing. If they were sliced through, it would be harder to keep them neat and tidy. There would be 1/2 bagels falling all over the place. I used to work for a bagel shop, and our machine still left a little slice still attached for that very reason.

pizza cuz its not as bad for you as cake and also you can have it any meal of the day. also i don't feel bad about myself when i eat pizza, but i do when i eat cake. in pizza you can basically put anything on it and it would still taste great, but cake, its basically icing and maybe sprinkles and anything else is too much. Also, pizza is basically your whole meal, its your starch in the crust, your protein in the meat, your dairy in the cheese, your fruit in the sauce or maybe pineapple, but not for me. and vegetables also in the toppings.

I begin cooking dinner at 5 PM so that it is ready for consuming my 6 PM.  Tonite, I will be piercing a spaghetti squash before cutting it in half around the short middle; remove the seeds; place each half upside down on a pan lined with foil.  Bake for 50 minutes at 400 degrees.  When baked, remove from the oven and using a fork, remove the veggie from the rind onto a dinner plate.  Serve with half a can of Wolf brand beanless chili (or turkey chili) scooped onto the top of the squash.

Just posted this, so am pasting ;)  ENJOY!



I am a total scratch cook, but also do not fancy sweets (chilehead!). Therefore, when I needed a sweet treat for a party, I called my sister for a recipe, and this is what I made. It was the bomb, super easy, and I have made it several times since with rave reviews.



KAHLUA CAKE



Cake:



1 package yellow cake mix
1 package (4 cups) chocolate instant pudding mix (unprepared)
1 cup vegetable oil
4 eggs
1/2 cup Kahlua
1/2 cup water
1-1/2 cups chocolate chips



Mix all ingredients and pour into a bundt pan. Bake at 325 for 45-55 minutes.



Icing:



1 cup powdered sugar
1-3 tablespoons Kahlua



Mix with a little water if you want to go easier on the Kahlua (not in my house!), and drizzle on cooled cake. You want a thick consistency.



YUMMMMMY!!!

Hallow out a medium Pumpkin and make a "punch bowl". If you make sure you get all the "guts" out, the bevy's won't take on the taste of the pumpkin, it's not that strong, BUT you could make the drink to go it in to COMPLIMENT the pumkin, here is a site with some good recipes, but not sure if you're liquor store carries this "pumkin spice" liquor, I'm sure you could make something nutty or spicy that would taste good out of the pumpkin though!

Fruit that has alcohol needs to soak a while-like a day.  I tried doing grapes last year, unfortunately I ate them four minutes later, watermelons.  Jello shots with a fake eye or bat or something at the bottom, do not serve after people have consumed lots of liquer, or maybe put those into liquid drinks, not jello, for safety reasons.

Hi Anna S, I would stick to the old true and tested method, I have tried cooking in the microwave and what a disaster. I only use it to re heat or use it for believe it or not a frozen TV dinner. Even with that I have to make a minor adjustment to the instructions to make it more palatable

We did a Pork Crown Roast one year to change up the Christmas Dinner. we did make a stuffing for the center of the roast, but for us we added sausage, apples,celery, cranberries. Usually we have cornbread dressing or regular stuffing or Mom brings Oyster Dressing. You can add tons of stuff to the stuffing for making it different. Another year we did a Lamb Crown Roast. We also did roasted red potatoes and of course veggies. And traditional trimmings such as Cranberry Sauce etc

Strawberry Soup



Serves 6



This one is a dessert soup. It's a novel way to use sweet and juicy Quebec strawberries when they are in season. Cranberry juice could replace the yogurt for a clearer, non-dairy soup.



1 pint strawberries, washed, hulled and cut in half



1 cup (250 mL) low-fat vanilla yogurt



1/2 cup (125 mL) cold water



1 teaspoon (5 mL) balsamic vinegar, plus a little extra for serving



Mint sprigs, for garnish



Puree strawberries, yogurt, water and 1 teaspoon (5 mL) balsamic vinegar in a blender until smooth. Chill until cold.



Serve in small stemmed glasses or transparent dessert bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and a sprig of mint.

Pearl barley cooks great in a slow cooker. I add a big handful to vegetable soup every time I make it.

it's fine in a slow cooker, but you may need to top up with water to keep the stuff moist, when it drys out it tastes like sugarpuffs!



I add it to casseroles and soups, adds a different texture to it all!
