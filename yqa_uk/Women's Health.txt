Question regarding birth control.?



My period cycle has been kind of messed up but I accidentally took my birth control last night (Monday) and this week is the week of my period.  I'm not quite sure how that would affect my cycle further but I was wondering if I could gain some insight.  I've been on birth control for about three years now.

Bleeding after sex, what is it?



okay so the last few times me and my partner have had sex i have had random bleeding, well cant really call it bleeding as its only like a tiny bit there when i wipe and only once (like if i wipe, there will be tiny spot of blood then i wipe again and there is nothin) we both were treated 4 chlymidia about 2 yrs ago, so its not that, (and my boyf is faithfull) also my last two periods have only lasted 2 days and been much lighter, the last period i was having trouble gettin tampons in (dunno if that has anythin to do with it)



</question>



<additional details>

1. Maybe he's being 'too rough'?
2. You can still get it if you've been treated for it.
3. The big one: Maybe you have some sort of growth such as a genital wart or cancer inside your cervix which is being caused to bleed when you have sex and causing obstruction when you put the tampon in?



'from grace....i said me and my boyf had it and had been treated for it, not that i cant get it again! we r both clear of std's so its not that!!!'

I had a similar thing a little while ago and got checked for Chlamydia and was clean so I had no idea what it was! You should go see a doctor and get a pap smear if they say you need one. I know it seems scary but I got one and it wasn't too awkward! And it turned out I just had a raw spot on my cervix or something.. sounds weird but nothing to worry about! But I definately suggest you go to the doctor or a free clinic asap!



Good luck :)

Birth control advice?



I have a 6 month old baby and have decided that I don't want to have any more children, unfortunately my husband does so won't let me go on any type of birth control that may make it difficult to conceive in the future. I am 36 and a smoker so have been advised that the pill is not a good option for me. I had implanon inserted and bled for 7 weeks straight so had it taken out. I also looked at an IUD but found that you can also bleed excessively from this. I have bled for 4 out of 6 months and don't want to go there again.  Any suggestions on non permanent birth control and the side effects (If known). I live in Australia.

I'm surprised they won't let you take the pill if you smoke.  That is too bad.
Quit smoking, it causes cancer.

Period problems - what could be wrong?



I have my periods regular but recently they have been heavy and painful. They are more or less like clockwork but i wondered why they are suddenly like this? Also my husband and i have been trying for a baby for about a year now with no avail, could this be connected? I am due to see a specialist cos i may have M.E. i have symptoms which the docs think could be this, could all these problems be connected to having M.E. if not what else could be wrong?

Stress can cause irregularities. Because you are trying for a baby, obviously you can't go on the pill to help but if you take vitamin b6 this relieves pms and period pains. If you think there are problems with getting pregnant, this could be causing the stress that is causing the irregularities.

Take diclofenac. Ask the doctor to prescribe you this. This is the strongest pain killer (which i use for my IBS ftw) and it will calm down your stomach cramps in no time. Works well for myself. In the meantime, hot water bottle wrapped in a thin towel or a hot flannel will help also.

I  can agree with the weight loss, I started taking Provigil 200mg/day (now up to 600) in early July, 2006. I actually just saw my doc last week and have seem him on numerous occasions since, my weight has dropped significantly. I have lost a total of 39lb since our first visit 4 months ago. I agree with its not appetite loss but the love of certain foods are lost. So you just don't eat cause nothing is "appealing" anymore. Good luck and I hope everything works out

Do you have any other symptoms?



Also, have you seen a gynecologist yet?
We usually start going after our first period.
Sometimes, a period can come earlier or later than normal.
However, I'm not sure of just how late yours is.



What date do you generally get your period?
How long as it been since your last one?



It could be a few things, but it depends



on whether you have any other symptoms.



Do you notice anything out of the ordinary?



Any pain when urinating or odor or anything like that?



When I had leaking urine, it wound up being a urinary tract infection. My other symptoms were;



an unpleasant odor in my urine, slight discomfort in my lower abdominal area, and feeling the urge to urinate frequently.



If you don't have any other symptoms, I feel as though you should get checked out, to find out what the problem is.



You couldn't be pregnant, could you?
That would explain the late period.

A detailed medical history would usually be sufficient for the diagnosis to be made in the majority of cases. Physical examination of the urinary tract is carried out to see if the bladder is distended; the prostate is palpated by digital rectal examination (DRE). Simple urine and blood tests may be necessary.



In specific cases, a detailed assessment of the voiding function (by inserting catheters into the bladder) is done by the urologist, a test known as urodynamics. Accordingly, the following are the various types of urinary incontinence:

What if a virgin girl masturbates everyday?



My best friend, who is 18 and a virgin told me that she masturbates everyday and sometimes more than once. She's become addicted to it, she's always searching for um, porn stuff on the internet. She sounded quite worried. Actually, she was crying when she told me, she felt like she's so disgusting. I assured her it's not true, that it's perfectly normal for someone at our age, but I'm not so sure either. I mean, I was never really addicted, like she is. Or am I the one who's not normal here?



She has a bf but he doesn't know about it. They're both virgins and agreed not to have sex yet for now, and she's worried if her first sex would be affected with her habit of masturbating. Well, would it? I mean, affected in what way?
I don't know so much about this. But please tell me what to say to her. And how to help her get over the addiction? Or will it pass eventually?

Really, the one thing is she knows her body, so could let her bf know what feels best for her so could make first time better then would otherwise be.  Its not abnormal to do that, however if she is addicted to it thats not a good thing.

The boyfriend is no doubt doing the exact same thing.
Our nature is to procreate.



The more loving the couple, the more intense the desire for the ultimate sharing of a sexual nature.
The masturbation releases the built up tension and it is perfectly 'normal'
As an added bonus, masturbation will allow her to discover her preferences, increasing their combined pleasure when they decide to couple.

at your friends age it is normal to have a good sexual appitite,and there are no set rules as to how many times a person can or cant masturbate,however watching porn is adding to her desire to experience sexual intercourse.it is doubtful her first time with her "husbend"will be affected as it will be the real thing,however,depending on the rating of the porn she watches,she could be dissepointed as she may expect it to be the same,which it may well not be!!!to stop a person watching porn,if they are addicted,may not be easy,so she may need to seek prof help,rgds

it is normal. although different people will have views on what is not enough/ too much. it's up to whoevers body it is to decide what they want to do. it should help sex as she will know what she wants and will be ready so won't be painful. she probably has a high sex drive, which is ok and can be controlled.

It is quite possible that you could be getting your period. You really never know.



When i got mine (2 years ago). I had lots of signs of it for a while but then it stopped for a long time. Then one day it just came. Its hard to predict.



What do you mean by red dots?
If they are blood like then it could be your period. You might just have a very light flow.



The only thing i can tell you to look forward to about your period is that you are becoming a woman.



Continue to wear a panty liner. If your flow gets heavier, TELL YOUR MOTHER. so she can by you pads and tampons.



Good luck!!

Well this is what happened to me. One day at school I had a really bad cramp so i went to the bathroom and i noticed i had my period. Very scary. So just wear a pad just in case you do actually have it. When you have the bad cramps just go to the bathroom and you will be all right. You should seriously tell your mom because shes a life saver. Without her you could actually be in danger because parents need to know these things. Well i hope i helped!

if u had blood on ur pantyliner, then u probably have it. the only thing u can do is wait and see if there is more blood later on.



ur first period can be heavy, so be prepared. u might want to learn how to use tampons, because they feel so much better than pads, but if u want to save it till later on, thats ok too.



just be prepared to change ur pad every hour at school if u arent using tampons too. the flow can be really heavy. (i cant repeat myself enough on that one!!)
my first period lasted like.....15 days, so dont freak out if it just keeps coming. the thing u have to look forward to is a lighter period next time. although sometimes u skip months. but dont wear pads if ur just waiting for it, use pantiliners. i was walking around with pads on for like 2 months, and the insides of my legs hurt so much from the wings rubbing against them!
i'd tell ur mom once u know u have it. she'll be happy about it, not awkward lol.

Well boobs arent a factor
I know many young girls with their periods that have small or no breasts



It may seem awkward at first but try feeling your nipple area for ''breast buds''. Breast buds are just a circular shape that are kind of hard, these are your breasts forming. As for the hair factor, you seem to be growing at a normal rate, periods come between the ages of 10-18, dont be shy, ask your mum when she got hers, as for the stuff, for inbetween periods you should use liners just so your discharge doesnt go everywhere, i suggest you use pads with wings until your comfortable with tampons, at first your period will be irregular so maybe, dark brown instead of red, or a bit clumpy, but thats all determined by your weight and what you eat, so for a healthy period and body, try eating the right foods and make sure your not under or above your recommended weight for 13. Your boobs will grow at their own rate, if your mum has big breasts, chances are you will too, if her breasts are small, than there is nothing wrong with that. Sorry that its long
I hope it helped

Common obvious signs with menstruating are terrible lower back pains and you might notice just near your pelvic area you may have sharp pains on your left or right side. I'd also check for a change in mood, you may feel quite upset for no particular reason or easily become defensive.



My advice is to pack some tampons or pads (depending on what you prefer using) in a discreet little bag in your school bag and if you have to some undies. I know that sounds dorky but if it was to happen at school you will thank yourself for it honestly.



Also have some tampons/pads at home to be prepared. Sometimes you may not experience the symptoms until it fully comes on, if that makes sense.



As for boobs, don't expect to be up a few bra sizes within the year...infact im twenty and mine only started growing , it's going to be up to genetics and luck on that one :) Although you will definitely see a difference in your body whether it is obvious or not.



You shouldn't be ashamed to tell your mum, she went through this too. My mum was a huge help when it came to my body changing, i'd freak out so it helps to have someone to help you out.



Be prepared :)

It does sound like you are about to start your period.



This month it probably won't be really easy to gauge. You may just spot for a few days. You could bleed for a week. Make sure you go to the store and buy pads - Always brand has always been my favorite. You can use tampons later, but I remember when I first started my period, I didn't even want to think about tampons!



Once you start bleeding, remember to change your pad every 4 hours or so.  Also when you shower every day, make sure to wash down there and rinse thoroughly!



You'll know you've started your period if you start bleeding more than a few spots at a time. For most of us, we bleed for 3-7 days or so and it is unfortunately a bit uncomfortable while it comes out.



Your cramps will hopefully stop after your first day of bleeding.  Eventually the cramps may help signal to you that you are about to start.



In the beginning few years, you may not be on a very good schedule, but eventually you can expect to start your period at almost the same time every month.

you shouldn't take more than one in 24 hours so now you have changed to 7:30am you should wait until that time tomorrow.. You have between 7:30am and 10:30am ( a 3 hour band) for which you can take it in.. so if you wish to continute taking it at noon, build it up gradually. say tae it half 8 tomorrow, 9:30 the next, 10:30 ... etc etc.. its not such a big deal, dont panic!

What is hypothyroidism?



Hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by abnormally low thyroid hormone production. There are many disorders that result in hypothyroidism. These disorders may directly or indirectly involve the thyroid gland. Because thyroid hormone affects growth, development, and many cellular processes, inadequate thyroid hormone has widespread consequences for the body.



This article will focus specifically on hypothyroidism in adults.

In a way, yes it is normal.  BUT, you need ALOT of lubricant and I do mean alot.  You and him both.  Then, you need to be really hot or else it just doesn't feel good.  If you come before you do that, it doesn't feel as good and tends to hurt.  Additionally, you may want to try another position for that.  My husband and I love doing anal, but it all has to work together or it doesn't work at all.  Have fun and good luck.

The important things to make this work are:
1. relax
2. lubricate (alot!0
3. be gentle (both)
4. practice yourself -&gt; First masturbate like you always do, after you have reached an orgasm, start stroking your anus with your finger. Gently making circles around the whole, slowly making these circles smaller and smaller, while increasing pressure. Make sure your finger is lubricated (for instance from your vagina). gently push it inside. If it hurts, move slower, or wait a little. Be sure te be very relaxed, and very hot. once you are inside, keep moving in and out, slowly at first, increasing as you like, and whatever feels good to you.
If you try it out like that, you will get a screaming orgasm, and will be better prepared for a penis.

You have to be really relaxed like so relaxed untill you get use to it, use lots of lube and he has to go very very slow even if it takes 15 mins. try using a dildo by yourself just to see if you like it because he might not be able to stay hard for 15 doing nothing. google safe anal sex and people will give you good feedback who have a lot of experiance because im a guy so dont know how it feels but deffinatly try by yourself like i said.

Bucking the trend here! Perfectly normal!



When I lived at home my bedroom was right at the top of the house, no bathroom up there.



It was my custom to take my drink of the evening up to bed with me.  One night it just happened to be a glass of cider, I woke and needed a pee, so I peed in the empty glass.



In the morning I was tidying my room and saw the glass and thought 'Oh look, I didn't finish my cider last night' and drank it. It was a bit flat but other than that tasted like cider.



I was at about lunch time that I remembered that I had actually finished my drink the night before.

You need to stop and think right now. Take a deep breath! Your actions are very risky. Taking the morning after pill 3 months in a row puts you at a much higher risk for developing blood clots and other health risks. Do some research on the internet to educate yourself on your actions. To answer your question- chances are that an abortion will not render you infertile. Women have spontaneous abortions all the time and do not even know it. It is part of life. Pro-lifers will tell you horror stories of women who died or became infertile after an abortion, but these are VERY RARE cases. What can render you infertile is continuing to have unprotecteed sex and getting a disease from it. You know what you are doing is risky and you seem to be an intelligent girl, so I would recommend that you listen to your head and start protecting yourself.

If you dont even know if you are pregnant you ant be that far along so the type of abortion you would have would be a pill, then another a few days later. that shouldn't change you getting pregnant in the future. its when your very far along and they have to kind of cut the baby out. that could affect you getting pregnant again.

You're playing Russian Roullette with your life, Honey. Please get on birth control.



Abortions have a pretty low risk of complications, much lower than actual childbirth. But abortion is not a method of birth control.



This isn't something to be "stubborn" about. Get to a doctor or to Planned Parenthood and get information on the various types of birth control that are available. Being on the Pill is only one option, and it can be hard to remember to take the pill every single day at the same time each day. Maybe getting the shot or the patch would work better for you.



Birth control will not ruin your chances of having a baby later on, when you're ready to be a mother.



Your boyfriend should also take some responsibility here, as in wearing condoms or outright not having sex with you until you're protected by birth control. His future is at risk too.

Hi Honey,



Most of us seem to create dramas like this for ourselves at some stage. Go easy on yourself.



You need to have pregnancy tests ASAP to make sure one way or the other. The stress you are putting yourself through and the morning after pills are more likely to do you damage than having an abortion. Morning after pills are to be used as a last resort, there not lollies.



If your not pregnant see your doc about some safer more effective contraception.



Get some effective emotional therapy to assist you so that you are emotionally to make decisions that are right for you.



Statically having an abortion does increase the chances of conception difficulties later.



My feeling is, and I don't have proof it's just what I've observed in several cases, that difficulty conceiving after abortion seems to have more to do with the emotional issues from abortion than the physical.



One EFT practitioner I know has worked with 2 women who were unable to conceive. They even spent tens of thousands of dollars on IVF with no success, but after resolving the emotional issues with EFT the both conceived and gave birth to healthy babies.



Whatever you do don't listen to people who are judgemental they've got their own skeletons in the closet.



Get good emotional help now & see a doctor about your pills, going on and off messes up your cycles and there are many factors for you to consider.



Hope this helps

Considering a new gynaecologist...?



We only have one gynaecologist here in my town and do not feel comfortable with some of consultations we've had in the past. I am considering a new gynaecologist from the city. (Perth, WA, Australia).
Is there anything I should take into consideration of who I choose?



If I speak to any gynaecologists in Perth, what should I ask ?
Can anyone from Perth recommend one?



**I'm not pregnant at the moment, but hopefully in the near future.

Dark brown blood during period?



I'm on Yazmin, and just recently have started to take them "properly" (not skipping, at the same time, etc).  My period started Monday (when it's actually supposed to start), but I only got red blood for a few hours, and now (2 days later), I only get a little bit coming out, and a large amount when I wipe; it's also pretty much all brown (with little bits of red, i suppose). I normally have light periods, but is this normal? Can you have brown blood your entire period?

Just to be safe go to your doctor and get him to check you for asthma.  Sudden excitement can bring this on and your heart rate will naturally increase if you are genuinely having trouble with breathing.



Your heart rate may also increase if you get scared that you can't breath or maybe your bf is a real stud and gets the rate up ;-)

Its a feeling.



Similar to that of having a panic attack.  I have it.  You are actually holding your breath and becoming tense.  See him more as a friend the someone who is untouchable and relax.  Maybe he is just so good looking that it takes your breath it happens just try and relax.



Try breathing in and holding your stomach with your hand. As you breath in you should feel your stomach expand as you breath out bring your stomach in.  Most people breath opposit to this.

It's normal to feel your pulse increase and sensations in the chest when becoming aroused. There's no need to get anxious about it, just enjoy...



If you are unable to relax and stop feeling anxious see a good NLP practitioner, EFT  practitioner or Hypnotherapist and you'll be smiling.

There is nothing wrong with loosing a day at school. You had a reason, you were in pain so it's not like you are skipping school for no reason.
I've had to skip school a few times because of period cramps and to make up for it and not feel guilty I just study at home a little bit.
Trust me, just let it go. It's no big deal

Breasts unusually small?



I'm 15 and still have fairly small breasts. They're A or B depending. But the thing is, I'm not skinny. I'm not fat though, I'm probably average. But a little chubby in the stomach. Anyway, do you think that they'll ger bigger? My Mom and both Grandma's had C's and D's...I just hate being small chested. thank you.

No that much bleeding is not normal, you need to go see another doctor. You are losing way to much blood, and I don't think you can conceive while you are bleeding like that.

I have never heard of anyone having a miscarriage and bleeding like that. Maybe you need to find another doctor and they can help you. All the blood that you are losing is not something that sounds normal to be going through after a miscarriage. The heavy bleeding is the reason that you are having problems becoming pregnant. You do need to find a different doctor so they can help you.

When I was a teenager I used to worry that I looked different or abnormal...now I know I am normal and nothing down there  has changed its just something you learn.  I do not worry about the colour or size or appearance of my girly bits and mine are not picture perfect either but they are perfectly normal.



I trim the bush with clippers year-round, and wax the bikini line in summer-time.



I have had 3 babies and have the same issues you have.  Its all normal and you cannot firm it up unless you really want to go have surgery which is just plain desperate in my opinion.  Losing weight will not change a thing down there.



I bet you are fine...dont forget to love yourself.

Yes, it happens to me on occasion, but I don't get "copious" amounts of fluid. I have read posts (on medical forums) from other women who have had it happen and had quite a lot of fluid. And have had a few friends who've had it happen, again the amount of fluid varies from woman to woman. And the amount of fluid can vary at different times for each woman. So it just depends on the woman, and the specific circumstances of each sexual encounter, but yes it is for real.

Im not due  for AF till about the 16 or 17th. I know its to early to tell If im pregnant. But my cervix are confusing me.

Sounds like you are experiencing a "seasonal period."  This happens when the weather turns from hot to cold and cold to hot particularly when we change the clocks back and forward.  Your body picks up on the change and confuses your cycle.  The best that you can do for yourself is to RELAX and eat healthy.  Pay attention to what you are eating by avoiding sugar especially (This is the worse for your cycle and causes nutritional depletion as well as PMS.)  and carbohydrate  foods like pasta and white breads.

You can...But not likely. You're most fertile 2 weeks after your period, then you're chances just go downhill. If you're stressing about it, your period may delay, or may not come at all. It's best not to think about it until your period is due - then take a test if you're late.

Mirena Coil - Help please?



I had this coil fitted 6 weeks ago.  I have been bleeding fairly heavy ever since and I have still got horrendously bad tummy pains.  I seem to be extremely tired constantly.  Is this normal?  I have my first check in 2 weeks time.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



unfortunately one of the side effects of Mirena is prolonged bleeding / spotting in early use (3-6 months), it may not happen in every woman though. After that usually oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea will take over. still it's essential to check for any complications like perforation, infection, or expulsion.

it's just an ultrasound, all you needed to do was ask your doctor when he told you he was ordering one, geez.  It doesn't hurt, the technician rubs a wand across your lower abdomen using a lubricant gel.  and sound waves bounce of your organs sending pictures back to the wand.  All you do is lay there.

You don't need to worry, a USG is jusdt the ultrasound where they but a little bit of gel on your stomach and then move over your stomach with a device that enables them to see whats going on inside. They won't do anyhting to your vagina for this procedure. However even if they were too you shouldnt be concerned, staff are trained to be very professional and caring for any medical procedure. Its important that you get checked out for your own well-being so try not to put it off.
Good luck:)

I don't know about PCOD but as a women we all eventually have to have a vaginal exam, sounds like the ladies above know what they are talking about so you probably won't have to have one so don't worry. But if and when you do it's not that bad once your there, it's just scary and embarrassing b4 hand. =) But remember doctors and nurses see that everyday.

There are two types of pelvic ultrasound procedures:



1.Transabdominal (abdominal) ultrasound
While the patient is lying down, a transducer is placed on the lower stomach allowing the uterus, ovaries, and pelvic organs to be seen through a full bladder. The bladder must be full with urine, and resolution is low, but a wide picture of the entire pelvis can be seen.



2.Transvaginal (endovaginal, vaginal) ultrasound
A protective cover and lubricating gel is placed on the end of a thin, long transducer, which is inserted into the vagina to obtain US images. As the transducer by-passes the intestine and is more closely positioned to the pelvic organs, like the uterus and ovaries, better images can be obtained. There is no need to fill the bladder for this exam.



Usually you are able to insert the transducer yourself, while covered with a sheet. The sonographer never has to see your vagina.

What could cause this ?



After having my last child c-section I had a tubal ligation all done at one time . This was 7 1/2 years ago . My monthly has always been normal since no more than a day or two off . But now I'm two weeks late I took a P.T. last week and it was negative . I have had some signs of pregnancy like heartburn , cravings , constipation , slight weight gain & always tired . So my question is " Is there anything else that could cause my cycle to change or stop besides a pregnancy ? "

Is pregnancy considered a pre-existing condition?



I am 8 weeks pregnant and about to start a new job. I have been paying insurance premiums through COBRA out-of-pocket for the last several months and would love to be able to use the benefit plan at my new job instead (I haven't told them at the new job yet that I am pregnant, but have been to the OB several times and it would show on my medical record that I am in fact pregnant). Will they cover an already existing pregnancy or will I have to continue with COBRA?

My sister recently became pregnant and went through something similar. I would go to the doctor because she was taking pregnancy tests and they were coming out negative even though she was pregnant! If you have taken one and it is negative you could try taking it in the morning first thing. The doctor told her that is when the hormone they are trying to detect is most potent. Either way you should make an appointment. GOOD LUCK!

How long between tampons? My first periods were VERY heavy but it depends on the person. If you are going through tampons very VERY quickly, go tell someone quick. (Full tampon in less than an hour to an hour)



**********
Symptoms



The signs and symptoms of menorrhagia may include:



* Menstrual flow that soaks through one or more sanitary pads or tampons every hour for several consecutive hours



* The need to use double sanitary protection to control your menstrual flow



* The need to change sanitary protection during the night



* Menstrual periods lasting longer than seven days



* Menstrual flow that includes large blood clots



* Heavy menstrual flow that interferes with your regular lifestyle



* Constant pain in your lower abdomen during menstrual periods



* Tiredness, fatigue or shortness of breath (symptoms of anemia)



When to seek medical advice



Doctors generally recommend that all sexually active women and women over the age of 21 have yearly pelvic exams and regular Pap tests. However, if you experience heavy or irregular vaginal bleeding, schedule an appointment with your doctor and be certain to record when the bleeding occurs during the month. If you're having heavy vaginal bleeding — soaking at least one pad or tampon an hour for more than a few hours — seek medical help. Call your doctor if you have severe menstrual pain that doesn't respond to at-home treatment or if you have any vaginal bleeding after menopause.

The first couple of days of your period are always bad.
I know a girl who was bleeding really bad she had to go to the hospital.
wait a couple more days to see if it goes away, and if it doesnt see your doctor.



I was put on birth control because my periods were really bad. not for any sex reasons. but if u get on birth control your periods will only be 3-4 days and not heavy at all.

Yes it's normal. It could happen this way every month, but by the third or fourth day it should get lighter. But don't be surprised if it is still heavy the whole time for this first one and maybe the next one.
But after that maybe you should have your mom take you to the doctor if your periods are VERY heavy for the whole time it lasts.



A person could get low iron from losing that much blood. And don't worry the doc won't have to examine your privates unless there is something seriously wrong.



Sorry I don't mean to scare you, you're gonna be fine. I was just trying to prepare you and make sure you watch out for signs of trouble.

First one ever? Oh dear not nice is it? And you're stuck with it for the next 40-50 years! rubbish isn't it?!



It'd recommend using pads at first, much easier for you to see what's happening like.



I'm sure it's fine.  I get really bad cramps as well - it's horrible. Your first few are all over the place though until they settle into a routine, you might not even have one next month.  They take a few months to get into a cycle like.  Once you're used to them you'll be fine.  If you get cramps, use a hot water bottle, and for feeling sick, try a little sleep.



Speak to your mum or a friend as well, all women have periods, so it's nothing to be embarrased about or anything.



Good luck x

This sounds pretty normal. Depending on the thickness of the tampon that you're using, you'll need to change them more often. I was also surprised when I had my first period at how much you bleed. If you are feeling really sick, I always find that taking Midol Extra Strength really really helps. If you haven't told your mom that you've started (I know it's embarrassing) you should. She can help you get through the first one and she knows what's normal. All in all, this sounds pretty normal. Good luck!

What is the most important information I should know about senna?
donot 	Do not use senna for longer than 1 week without consulting your doctor or other health care provider. Prolonged use of senna can be dangerous.



Senna has not been evaluated by the FDA for safety, effectiveness, or purity. All potential risks and/or advantages of senna may not be known.

Is pregnancy considered a pre-existing condition?



I am 8 weeks pregnant and about to start a new job. I have been paying insurance premiums through COBRA out-of-pocket for the last several months and would love to be able to use the benefit plan at my new job instead (I haven't told them at the new job yet that I am pregnant, but have been to the OB several times and it would show on my medical record that I am in fact pregnant). Will they cover an already existing pregnancy or will I have to continue with COBRA?

Usually if you have not had a lapse in insurance and you are going from one company insurance to another, they do not refuse to treat preexisting conditions. I had the same dilemma with my first child and I called the new insurance company and asked about it. They told me they did not consider pregnancy a preexisting condition. I would call the new job's insurance and ask. Good luck !!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



To begin with, you are absolutely amazing for being this concerned. Very thoughtful of you.



Yes, most women do have to bear through terrible pain during their periods, but you will too. She will almost inevitably be moody and emotional on and around the time of her period. Brace yourself, and be forgiving.



A period can be avoidable in several ways. Continuous birth control pills can help reduce periods and sometimes they can be completely stopped. By continuous I mean this: Birth control pills are a daily dose of hormones and the dose is sometimes alternated by the week. Usually, a woman will take three straight weeks of hormones, and a week of placebo pills, ones that have no hormones. By skipping the placebo pills, a girl may avoid her period.
Also, the Depo-Provera shot is another form of birth control in the form of a shot every few months. Many women do not experience periods while they are on "the shot".
Another way that women stop periods altogether is by means of a hysterectomy. A hysterectomy is the removal of some or all of the internal reproductive organs and is irreversible. Most women do not do this until they have already had all the children they want, and sometimes not even until there are medical complications. It is a major surgery.
The hormones that prevent periods does not hurt her, it is not bad. Her body continues to function normally, just without the ability to reproduce. Birth control can be stopped and she will soon be just as fertile as before she took them.



Some women experience emotional ups and downs before, during and sometimes even after their periods. They can be depressed, moody, irritable and are usually very uncomfortable in their bodies. The menstrual cycle can make a woman very bloated, achy, fatigued and like I said, extremely emotional.



It is not easy to judge how to show your love to your girlfriend or wife while she's on her period. Not all women are the same. My boyfriend has learned after five years of supporting me that the best way to show his love for me is to offer to take care of household duties when he knows I'm physically uncomfortable, tuck me into the bed with a heating pad on my back or stomach, bring me medication (tylenol, midol, pamprin or sometimes, when it's bad, darvocet), and last but not least and most importantly, he *asks* what he can do. If I say there is nothing he can do, he usually stays by my side, but doesn't touch me unless I ask him to. I usually appreciate how much he cares, and since I know he's miserable watching me being miserable, I ask him to go play a video game or put a movie in.  This pain usually only lasts a day or two. She should be back on her feet and feeling better even before her period is over.



But some women just want to be left alone. You will just have to get to know her style first.



Sex is possible during her period, but a lot of women do not like to, where as some women experience the most intense orgasms during their periods. To some women it is too painful. One way or the other, it is a very messy affair.



I hope I answered all of your questions well enough. If you have any more, please don't be too uncomfortable to ask.

Some birth control pills stop periods - or if she's pregnant



It's a fact of life - not necessarily good or bad - depends on the woman.



Women are emotional roller coasters at different times in their cycles.



Show love the same way as always.
Usually the strongest emotions come before the period.



Remember the woman is always right, expecially before and during her period.  Don't confront her.



You can have sex if she's up for it.

Menstruation is unavoidable for nomal women, it starts in puberty/early adolescence ( 9-16) and menstruation stops when a woman reaches menopause (this varies 40's-50's).



Painful Menstrual period occurs to some of the women. It could be normal to some, though others have underlying disorder like endometriosis and hormonal imbalance. Sometimes the woman is moody, depressed feelings yeah and yes you need to understand her.



Hormonal imbalance deepens signs and symptoms of Pre menstrual syndrome, mood swings, bloating, cramping, lower back pain etc.



Don't leave her alone - treat it just like normal days, just show your caring side.



Sex, ask for her consent  (though majority of the women don't do this during their menstrual period) and if possible wear a condom coz... it's gonna be direct contact to blood.

All women are different.  You should tell her you're thoughts and talk to her about it.



Pain... Some women don't get any at all, some women black out from the pain.  If you're in the black out category, you can tell when it's coming and take care of it.



Depression... some do, some don't.  Sometimes you're so emotional THAT makes you depressed.  Sometimes you're fine.



Love... if she's blacking out and really pissed off, you could probably run a bath and give her some motrin... that would be great!  If she's normal and fine, get your snuggles!  But, it depends on the woman.



Space... It's all on her.  If she's ok, you're ok.  If she needs space, the red eyes, clenched fists, and snarling might be a good indication that you should throw some chocolate at that chick and hide yourself fast.  Because if she was about to black out and you decided you needed some love, you're going to have a terminator on your hands!



Don't have sex with a chick on her period.  That's gross.  And it's actually not at all good for her.  I mean, it's bad for her health.  Be sweet, run a bath, give her some choclate, give her a back massage, she'll get you back later.



Look into NFP.  It's easy.  Once she gets to know her cycle, she can see when it's coming to controll her body and emotions naturally.  It helps so much.

Is it avoidable? Yes, some birth controls will make it so she has as little periods as possible, probably none-3 a year.
Is it good or Bad? Depends how you look at it. It proves she's not pregnant.
Do they feel depressed during this time? YES. It will have them bloated, crying, and hungry.
How should i show my love during this time? Just do what she says, confort her. Don't annoy her. She will bite your head off.
Should i leave her alone? If she says so.
Can we have sex during this period? You CAN, but I don't think you or her would want to.
It would be messy, and you WOULD need to use a condom, because she can still get pregnant.



By the way, I think it is sweet for you to care. :)

avoidable by pregnancy and kind of with some kinds of birth control and medications
not good or bad as far as health goes, just bad in an annoying sense
depressed - kind of, more just easily pissed off
you should be affectionate and try not to piss her off
depends on the girl
you can have sex.

It's not really avoidable, pretty much all healthy women have periods (there are exceptions, but they're pretty rare).  I think of it as a good thing, like a reminder that everything's still working properly.  However, lots of women do get cramps, which can be really mild to severe (I've had bad cramps to the point where I couldn't walk).  You can usually get rid of cramps (or at least make them less painful) by taking OTC painkillers like ibuprofen, and using heating pads.  Hot drinks can help, or a warm bath, and I've found that sleeping actually helps a lot.



Lots of women can get depressed or irritable before and during their period, the lovely phenomenon known as PMS.  It's actually really annoying to deal with, when you're the one with PMS or when you're around someone who has it.  It can cause moodswings, so one minute your woman could be fine, then depressed, then mad, etc.  I'd say wait until you know how her PMS goes; if she's the angry type, stay out of her way, but if she's the depressed type, just give her a hug and a kiss and let her know you love her, she'll appreciate it :)  And if she's the moodswing type, then just be cautious, and if she snaps at you, don't take it personally.  I know when I'm mad with PMS I often don't mean it when I get snappy with people...just wait for it to pass, because it will :)  And you can always buy her chocolate, that often helps with PMS a lot.



I've heard about people having sex while on their period, and as far as I know, it doesn't hurt anything and doesn't cause any problems.  I personally wouldn't do it, at least not in bed, for fear of staining the sheets XD  But if she wants to, and you want to, then there's nothing necessarily wrong with it.  Just make sure she's up for it first :)



Let me just say, it's really sweet of you to be asking this :)  I think a lot of guys just go through life ignorant until they get married and it's dumped on them all of a sudden...it's nice to see guys who care and want to make things good for their wives :)

Here's a secret your daddy won't tell you: PMS stands for penises must suffer. Women's "periods" are just a myth. Like Bigfoot. What happens is that when the wimmins become of age, their mom or someone around them tells the about the whole "period" trick. All the young ones know is to fake a tummy ache, whisper the words 'wimmin problems' to get out of things, and that they can freely hate men w/o reprocussion. As they get older, they get lazy and just yell at you and tell you of myserious and impossible to prove "cramps". They get picky about the 'relations' between men and women, and take this time to just eat whatever the hell they want, even if its yours. And the pity. We all love a pity party but its hard to find a legitamate manly excuse (legs mauled off?) But on these "periods" its pity party TIME! Just be careful dude.

I have started having phases of this. I have tried canesten (though I know its not thrush) and that helps a bit. The strange thing is there is nothing there to itch but it do, often in the middle of the night. It lasts about 3 weeks then goes again. I just watch what I put in the bath and washing powder. If you find a cure let me know.

It might be an allergic reaction to the clothes your wearing. Do you wear synthetic fabric panties? Switch to cotton, check your pants for metals or synthetic fabrics.



Try calamine lotion or a medicated itch cream to alleviate the itch. Try wearing only cotton clothes for a while and see if that makes a difference.



If it doesn't clear up in a week or so you should go see your GP doctor.

by the sounds of it it could be a wet ex-ma. i get it a lot because of how big i am but also it is from just getting really sweaty down there. go to your GP (doc) and get some cream for it. don't be embarrassed about it because it is commen. also lost of showers at the time you get it helps with it being itchy and will sooth it. you can also have a salt bath but the bath must be hot but not scalding. hot enough for you to put your body in with out going red. best salt to use is sea salt because of the minerals in the salt will help not only heal but to help your new skin grow...
hope it helps remember go see your GP.

You could be pregnant, but give it a couple more days. It could just be PMS symptoms which are very common. You'll probably get it in a day or two. I always get the cramps and bloating a few days before my period actually starts.

It is possible to get pregnant when on your period.



Your best bet is to visit your doctor for a test or go get a home one from the supermarket. You will need to take another one two weeks after if its negative (unless your period has come), to be sure.



Im afraid the only surefire answer to this is using protection, whether it be the pill, the injection or simple condoms.



End of the day your boyfriend wants sex, so he should have no problem putting on a condom, if he refuses, then you should stick to your guns and say no.



Im a guy and to be jhonest its only a few guys who will say no to wearing one, most carry them about in their wallet, so that kind of shows its not somthing to be worried about saying "in case you upset him"



Also you need to bear in mind STI's, they are very common and Im sure everyone who caught one said "I won't get anything, Im clean"



Anyways, back to the main question. Use a home test. If negative repeat after two weeks. Or go to the doctor, they can do a test but they will have to wait if your period comes as well.



If you are concerned you really may be pregnant it can never hurt to be prepared for what you want to do with the pregnancy. Its not everyones cup of tea, but you could keep it, or end the pregnancy. In the latter case, the earlier you think about it and get the wheels in motion, the less traumatic for you and your body.



In any case, seek professional medical advice, don't rely on hearsay and what people "say is right".

Okay I have never really been really on a sleep schedule. I know that you are supposed to get at least 8 hours of sleep but I'm lucky if I even get four.  For the past six months it has gotten worse  I try to at least go to bed at 11 but that doesn't help. I even  stopped drinking caffeine at night.  For the past week I had to work a 14 hour shift .  Last night I only got a half hour of sleep.  One time I was up for four days straight with no sleep



I have a lot of stuff that has been on my mind  I don't want to go on sleeping pills that is something I would never do. Can somebody help Also how do you get rid of  bags under the eyes?

Yeah, because buying "breast enhancement" pills from some stranger off the internet is really safe...don't be so naive.



They don't work. The only way to gain larger breasts is to either gain weight, become pregnant or get surgical implants.



I don't mean to lecture, but you should never buy any prescription/medical related pills off the internet unless it's from a credible pharmaceutical company (and that's AFTER you've consulted with your doctor). You have no idea what you're getting.

Hi Sammylou,



How long were you on the pill for and how old are you? There could be a fair few explanations for this but don't panic. My guess is that your body is still adjusting from the pill if you have been on them for a long time. Have you had unprotected sex since then? If so I would certainly take a pregnancy test and get checked for STI's (this is common practice so don't feel embarrassed). If you normally come on on sunday though it is still only a few days so please don't panic too much yet. I would make an appointment with your GP for the weekend if there is no change by then, they will be able to rule out a lot more and diagnose you better with more info.



Hope this helps

Your body is probably just adjusting from being off the pill, you should drink a tension tamer hot tea and take ibuprofen, if this continues for more than 2 days you should really go see your doctor, if its too much to handle you should go to urgent care/ER.

Anorexia can cause infertility in some cases as it can stop your womb removing your egg. Most anorexics periods will stop due to their body being malnourished causing vital and reproductive organs to stop functioning.



Depending on how long your illness lasts for, you may become infertile, but some near death anorexics have gone on to have children decades after recovery.

yes anorexia often stops periods, which can cause infertility in later life.



often though, anorexics do go on to have children but it takes them much longer and is much harder to get pregnant.



no, anorexics very rarely get pregnant when their periods stop.

Anorexics can get pregnant. But don't ever get pregnant until you have fully recovered. The baby will suffer from a lack of vital nurtients which can cause very serious problems. There unfortunately are deformities, brain problems a whole list of what happens to a baby who's mother is anorexic.  Please take care!

In order for a woman to menstruate, become pregnant, and give birth to a healthy baby she needs body fat. Many anorexic girls and women either never get their period or their period stops due to extreme weight loss. The cessation of menstruation, (amenorrhea), can be permanent depending on how long a woman has been suffering from anorexia, and if this is the case then they will be infertile. But for most women menstruation will start up when they begin to gain weight. Roughly 80% of anorexic women who successfully treat their eating disorder will regain their ability to conceive.



When a woman's percentage of body fat falls below a certain minimum her body doesn't produce the levels of hormones necessary to stimulate ovulation. Rapid weight loss and undernourishment leads a woman's body into a state of emergency and she will not menstruate if she is just barely surviving. Most women in this state will not be able to conceive. For those women who are able to conceive while suffering from anorexia they seriously jeopardize their own health and the health of their fetus. Pregnancy presents enormous strain on a woman's body. As the fetus develops it will take nourishment from the mother. If she suffers from an eating disorder this can seriously deplete her own scant reserves and she may begin to experience the exhaustion and depression that accompany malnourishment. If she brings the pregnancy to full-term she also may lack the energy required to meet the demands of a newborn while remaining healthy herself. Women with eating disorders also have higher rates of miscarriage and an increased risk of giving birth to a low weight baby.



And, just to let you know, anorexia is the medical term for loss of hunger. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder.

A person who is currently involved with anorexia nervosa which means many things, cannot become pregnant.  There are many classifications to follow when diagnosing someone with anorexia nervosa but one of course being very low body fat percentage, and the loss of at least three (some say 2) consecutive periods.  When you do not have your period, your body is not producing the egg that is needed to properly form a fetus, and later on..your baby.  What is happening is that when your body continualy lacks nutirion, certain body functions begin to slow or shut down in order to conserve energy.  When your reproductive organs shut down, they can in fact "get better" and once you recover and begin to live life in a more healthy way, you can concieve.  However, the longer you continue to engage in any "dangerous" addiction or behavior, the more likely you will be to have a long list of medical problems.  I answered a question on here from you before and as you know I told you that I too had anorexia nervosa for many years but after a year of treatment, and a lot of hard work I recovered, got married, and just had my first baby, all of which I never thought I would be able to do.  So here is my final piece of advice.  Just don't do it.  The risks and health problems you and a possible unborn child will encounter are not worth it.  For example, my best friend just had heart surgery, and had a stroke.  Sounds like I am talking about an 80 year old woman right?  No...She is 27 years old and has almost died many times.  The main reason you will want to be fully recovered before you have or think about having any children is that you need to support them in so many ways that if you yourself are not healthy, your life and your child will suffer.  I know of many close friends I met either while I was in treatment, or in support groups that got pregnant and were very scared of gaining the weight you do when you are pregnant so they began to restrict again and due to the lack of nutrition lost their babies.. Bottom of the line, recovery is possible, and recovery is necessary for you and your future child to have a healthy happy life.  Best of life girl I know you can do it!

Multiple orgasms is having more than one orgasm during sex.
When you have an orgasm, your parts become very sensitive. If it is uncomfortable to go on, take a break and cool down for a minute.

The majority of women react to orgasms as you do, but a very small percentage are able to have multiple ones, one right after the other with very little pause in between. You are probably not a part of that percentage, but really it falls upon your mental state: ask yourself "am I satisfied yet?" If so then you don't need to 'get through' anything. But if you aren't done playing then by all means! ;)

Hi,



The simple answer is more than one orgasm in the same sex session. But in reality it is a little more complicated as no one woman experiences this in the same way.



Some women experience 'waves' - a slow build up, orgasm, a dip then another slow build up, orgasm, another dip and another slow build up, another orgasm, etc.



Others experience constant multiple orgasms, a long build up followed by very short powerful orgasms one after the other continously as long as their partner keeps going.



Other women experience long, slow sensual orgasms ...



Some women can only have the one orgasm then have to wait a while before another session (a bit like men!)



You get my drift here, every woman is different.



So I would say don't worry, just lie back and enjoy it (excuse the expression!)

If you are having spotting (brown to reddish discharge that's really light for a day or two) that's different than a period (substantial bleeding for a few days).



Spotting can be normal after sex if you have a sensitive cervix.



If you are having sex, I'd consider birth control as well as using condoms. Better to be safe than sorry.

There is probably nothing wrong, having sex releases hormones, these hormones may be responsible for bringing on the start of your period.  If you want to be more regular, you should start on some form of hormonal birth control as they usually help with this.  Definitely, under no circumstances should you use the calendar or family planning method of birth control because that depends on you being regular!

maybe ask a doctor?
but you know it could be that the area down there is opening up so you can have your flow, i know some ppl don't get regular periods till they have sex, but i guess since you are pretty young and still at the developing stage, after it "opens" you get your period, but then it closes back to normal (cuz you are still young and growing), and then you are irregular till next time
this is just a theory, but i know someone who had sex around 25 and then got a regular period till this day (sex not needed to get her period though, just after the first time, it became regular, and since she's older, it just became normal) (when she had irregular periods, the doctor told her that after she had sex when she is done developing, then it would go back to normal, maybe it's the same thing for you?)



because of this period business, maybe you should wait awhile until you are more developed to have sex? may be better for you in the long run...



also, this is a theory, may want to talk to a doctor

I would say maybe the prostglandin is his sperm is starting your periods process much like it helps to start labor but that depends on whether or not you are using condoms or another barrier. I remember hearing about how sometimes a girls hymen( a thin covering that breaks usually upon the loss of her virginity) can grow back over. "popping" everytime you have sex. If you'd like to have a regular period go see a gynecologist. Birth control can help regulate periods as well as get rid of acne, etc. Hope I gave you some insight.

People here seem to disagree but my older sis. says that starting your period can happen after sex...IDK I'm not an OB-GYN. My advice is go to the doctor... I need to go too.

Bad cramping, brown, stringy discharge while on BC?



I started taking Seasonique in August. It's a three month pack of pills and I'm now on my last month. The beginning of week ten, I had a little bit of discharge, but not enough to wear a pad. A few days after that, my cramps got SO bad and I'm having to wear pads and change them every 2-3 hours. I'm in the middle of the next week of pills and still dealing with the pain. Midol does not help. The discharge is brown and stringy, with little blood clots at the end. I started taking Seasonique because my doctors think I have endometriosis and that it flares up around my period. Less periods=less pain. But it's not helping at all and I don't want to be having blood and discharge coming out of me for a whole month... it's not worth it.



Is this normal for those taking Seasonique? I know a lot of women have bleeding on birth control, but I've tried three different kinds before Seasonique and never had any bleeding.

Simple answer; no.



When you start your periods it means the egg is ready to be fertilized. You cannot have a baby during one either, as the egg is being removed from the body and replaced with a new one. So you can only be pregnant after you start!

Do you mean a girl who has never had her first period?
Probably not. Unless she has had her first ovulation and doesn't know it yet.
Or in the case where she has started ovulating, but may have a medical condition or hormone imbalance that would cause her not to get her period. For example my sister in law has Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome and never had a normal period *at All* unless she was on birth control pills. But she was apparently ovulating some because she has a 2 and 1/2 yr old daughter.

this has happened to me a couple of times. it's usually when i'm really excited and relaxed and really enjoying sex with your partner. a fluid is released when you orgasm. it feels really strange the first time, 'cos you think you just peed, but it is NOT urine.

It seems to be UTI (urinary track infection) and especially inflammation in your urinary bladder.This condition is very common in women in reproductive age.
Take antibiotics and drink more water so that bacterias will be washed from your bladder & urethra.

Drink lots and lots of cranberry juice, you can also buy cranberry pills and things that can help any urinary pain until you go to the doctor, sometimes the cranberry will work and you won't have to but if it gets worse make an appt, it's just a urine test. (AZO is the brand of UTI stuff at like Wal-mart or wherever that can help)

Im peeing alot? what can it be?



well this has been happening for a year or so now but recently its been alot. I went to the doctors twice to check what was wrong with me. Its not diabetes or an overactive bladder and its also not a urinary tract infection. I have no other symptoms besides just being very frequently. I also have very bad anxiety at times. So i was wondering if that can be one of the problems why im always urinating?

my friend also had this once. he undergone several labs related to such condition, but found out everything just seems to be normal. the doc suggested it to be more of psychological. try to empty your mind with this thing.  divert your attention to other things. try not to think that by any minute you'll have to pee.



or maybe its hormonal. hehehe. i remember back when i was pregnant.

It sounds like  you may be in the process of going through menopause.  I know I went through some strange body changes when I went through it.  Even now I may cramp when my cycle was suppose to be.  Menopause can last a while too.  Go to the doctor and see though.  I wish I would have gone.

I'm sorry that you are experiencing this. Have you consulted a doctor regarding this? There could be many reasons why your cycle is extremely long.
You could be anemic, but you said that it's not heavy. I know someone who had their period for about 5 weeks, bleeding heavily at 39. The doctor said she was anemic and had to give her medicine.
Some women have a problem with the blood's ability to clot properly; diseases such as Von Willibrand's can produce heavy periods, as well as nosebleeds and easy bruising.



My possible guess is that you have endometriosis, or you have cysts, that are being pushed around or overgrowing to cause you long term bleeding. I'd highly suggest to go see a doctor so he or she can get a ultrasound and a physical exam. I hope that I've helped you

There are a variety of possibilities, and that's why you need to go to the doctor. It could be peri-menopause, but it could also be fibroids, or something serious. No way to tell from here without an examination. Good luck!

Woman problem down belowww....?



Over the past few days i've very bad itching down below..sort of feels like on the outisde and the inside. its gotten so itchy that sometimes it hurts [around inner labia areas]
and its the sort of irritating feeling, slightly sharp, dry feeling when i walk, its very uncomfortable.
Im not sure if it is a lump, but near the opening the left labia sort of swells out into a larger lump/flap, which i think is causing the irritation
i am sexually active with my boyfriend but we always use protection
any idea what this could be as i am quite confused :S

Probably a yeast infection (thrush). The irritation from it can cause your labia to swell up a bit. If you don't have the tell-tale thick white discharge of a yeast infection there are other vaginal infections that can cause you to itch, and be irritated like that. And they aren't STDs.
So go to the doctor they will diagnose what you have and tell you how to treat it properly.

There are a number of things that this could be.



For the itching, I recommend Vagisil.  Aside from that, you will need to see a gynecologist to properly diagnose the issue.  It could be a yeast infection, but the symptoms are also similar to that of an STI.



In the meantime, get some Vagisil for the itching and head on over to the doctor's office as soon as you're able.  You can never be too careful.



Good luck and I hope you get this sorted soon.  I know how scary this kind of stuff can be.  x

Considering that at some point in their lives, 60-80% of sexually active women will get HPV, abnormal pap smears are actually quite common.



99% of the time an abnormal pap is caused by HPV, which causes changes in the cells of your cervix, but sometimes it can be from other things such as pregnancy. But, HPV is basically always the culprit.



This isn't something to freak out about at all. What was most likely found in your smear was low-grad dysplasia, which will usually go away on its own within a year or so. Some women experience persistent dysplasia that just doesn't go way though, but doesn't really progress either (I'm one of them). I've had HPV for 9 years, and have gone back and forth between normal paps and low-grade dysplasia.



There are a couple important things you can do. 1) Ask your doc for an HPV test - specially a DNA test so you know which strain your dealing with. 2) ALWAYS go in as often as your doctor says. You'll probably be going in every 3-6 months until your doctor thinks its safe to come in once a year again. 3) HPV and dysplasia have been shown to regress in women who have high concentrations of antioxidants (i.e. Vit A, Vit C, Vit E, lycopene, beta-carotene) in their blood, so make sure you are eating a very healthy diet and take a multi-vitamin as well. Other things that can help keep HPV/dysplasia at bay are not smoking, exercising, getting adequate sleep, and using condoms. Even if you are in a monogamous relationship, some studies show that using condoms helps decrease the viral load being passed between partners, which helps the body clear the HPV faster.



At any rate, this is nothing to be alarmed about. Just take good care of yourself and follow your doctor's instructions. You'll be fine!

You didn't just have your baby- it was 3 months ago. If your Dr. has cleared you and everything is OK physically, then you should not have problem having sex (avg. is 6-8 weeks) I understand that is doesn't sound appealing right now - you're tired, stressed with caring for a baby, etc. But, for the sake of your marriage, you do need to make an attempt.  Sex is 90% mental - and you need to work on that. If you can leave the baby with a grandparent or sitter for a few hours (he'll be fine), you and your husband need a date. You need time away from the baby to give your husband some attention - go out to dinner, maybe even a motel (or the house, if baby isn't there) - spend time just being with each other. If you continue to feel adverse to sex, discuss it with your Dr. - and at least cuddle, kiss and offer other sexual release for your husband.

It takes time for romance to come back after having a baby.  I had bad post-partum depression and sex didn't sound good for me either after I had my son.  I talked to my husband about it, and to my OB.  She gave me a prescription for anti-depressants and a few months of therapy on those helped me a lot.  Also, the stress of a new baby is causing part of that, too.  If your husband is concerned, then tell him he can help by making you feel sexy and desirable and tell you how beautiful you are everyday, before and after sex.  This is a self-esteem/post-partum depression problem.  It's normal.

Nothing is wrong with you. This happens to most of the mom's I've known including myself. It's hard to summon up interest when you are constantly attached to this small squalling thing that you can well remember pushing out of that delicate area only a few months ago.



First - reassure him that it's normal and not just you. It comes back.



Second - if you can manage it, how about gratifying him with other means?



Third - find some mom friends and share. It helps a lot to have that support.

Your hormones and body are out of whack for at least a yr after having a baby.  Did you know that?  It's only been 3 months, you're exhausted from a newborn and your body is trying to adjust back to normal.  Give it time.  If you are super worried, ask your doctor.

Not at all, it's just your hormones and everything that is going on with your body. Having a baby changes everything with your body and it takes some time to get back to normal.

WELL LET me tell you, my girlfriend has larger breast than you do and it is more than possible to keep them perky. A lot of this has to do with the muscles underneath the breasts which helps tone and elevate the breast. If your breasts are not as perky as you would like them to be then ask an exercise instructor what exercises you can do to firm and lift them.

Private Problems (Medical)?



Okay, so I am an 18 year old who has just recently started having regular sex. A few days ago I noticed that my "private area" had an odd discharge from it-yellowish, and odorless. It's not just coming from the vagina, it's on the sensitive skin around it, too. It's also making sex somewhat painful, since it's also unusually dry "down there". Anybody know what it could be?

you might have a STD. GO to your doctor/gyno and have it checked out for sure. I wouldn't be having sex either with weird discharge and pain. Sounds like chlamydia. Also if it is an STD make sure you tell the person/person's you are sleeping with.

Odorless can be normal, yellowish is usually not. Check out this site http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/femalehe... and please get yourself to a doctor as soon as possible -- if you have an STD, you're risking the health of both your partner and yourself: leaving STDs and other infections untreated can seriously, permanently damage your body and cause serious health problems in the future. Be safe, get it checked out!

It is probably not an STD because it has no smell to it.
You must decide if the discharge is "burning" your lips or not. If so, it could be a UTI.
If not, then it is a normal thing. Simply take a bath in mild water and add a cupful of coarse salt to the water.
Allow the water to soak on and inside your private area.
Use CANESTEN vaginal cream in and outside your vagina for about three days before having sex again.

i honestly don't know- if it not coming from your vagina, then it has to be a sore down there thats opened. Go see your doctor. If you are dry too, that could be a problem with you becoming aroused. If it hurts to pee or burns=UTI.

Keep on working with your doctor.  But find out what you can do nutritionally as well.  Most meats have hormones in them.  The meat industry says that there is no effect from that.  However, it may be beneficial for you to buy any meats from the store that are hormone free.  Whole Foods has all of their meat hormone free.  You might try eating organic fruits and vegetables as well.  And I would get high quality nutritional supplements that can help you hormonally as well.  Drink plenty of good filtered water everyday.  Try to get at least 8 eight ounce glasses in you.



I have a list of superfoods that might be of help to you as well.  You're welcome to email me.  I'd love to hear if this helps.

PCOS and breastfeeding?



I have PCOS and my baby is 3 months old, I exclusively breastfeed. My doctor said the PCOS symptoms are suppressed during pregnancy and breastfeeding for some women with PCOS but I'm already having low blood sugar type symptoms and no weight loss since the birth. I know it's good to breastfeed 2 years and that's what I planned on doing but there is no way I think I could with the PCOS symptoms and not taking my insulin medication metformin for 2 yrs. My question is how long should I wait? I want my son to get the benefits of breastfeeding but I also want to be healthy and feel good and having extra weight on that won't come off till I'm back on my meds and feeling dizzy and craving carbs also won't go away till I'm back on my medication is not very fun.

probably not, but still possible.  be carfeul!



women can only get pregnant during ovulation.  if your periods are irregular, you probably can't figure out when that is happening.  so you should consider yourself at risk EVERY DAY.  however, even if your periods are irregular, it is unlikely that you will ovulate on the first day of menses (unlikely, but not impossible).



bottom line:  you probably got away with it this time, but USE A CONDOM.

Yes, a very big chance. You can get pregnant during your period, before or after. Anytime, all it takes is once. Some women get some periods even while they're pregnant.
Get the morning after pill just to be sure, its more effective the next morning but it still is effective up to 5 days after sex.
Good luck, & next time use protection.

Wow.  That is f****** freaky. Look, that type of behavior IS NOT normal.  I would find out more about your boyfriend before you marry him.  Think about it:  he's 30+, living with his mother (adopted mother), and neither one of them mind seeing each other nude.  The only time I ever saw my mom nude was when I forgot to knock on her door before I went in her room. Let me tell you, I had a HUGE problem with seeing that for even a fleeting instant.  Something is going on here that you are sensing yet not completely aware of.

I couldn't understand half of your story, but what the gist that I got was that your 30+ boyfriend is still living at home with mama.



Are you serious? Do you realize that he is still emotionally a teenager and that he'll likely NEVER leave his mom until she passes? Don't you wonder WHY a 30+ year old "man" doesn't want to move out on his own? Don't even think about marrying him, if it does happen (not likely), he's not going to abandon his mom, which at his and the mom's age is what they'll think is happening. And as a momma's boy, he's going to hold her above everything else, even you. I'm sure you know all of this by now, and are just denying it. Well wake up!



Please, save yourself even more heartache and find a REAL man.

If you're that close with your boyfriend that you take showers together, then just tell him you have to pee. Make sure to squat or aim by the drain so none gets on him. Not because it's nasty, I mean, you're in the shower right? You can just wash again, but because it's polite. You could ask him to turn around too, lol.



EDIT: That's funny John. I bet my boyfriend would do the same thing, but I KNOW he'd tell me it was pee. [him "I'm peeing on you, hahahah." me "ugh, so gross. You're lucky I always pee before taking a shower...."]

Period One Week Early ??? PLZ HELP.?



I just had a baby 9 weeks ago. I've been having withdrawl sex with my fiance since I was 4 weeks pregnant. ( I felt ready and it DID NOT hurt) (I am fully healed up according to my doctor)



Well I took plan b the 1st week of oct. got a period on the 12th. Than I just got a period again on the 31st. One week early. It started off brown and pink, than I bled for 2 days, kinda heavy. Than it stopped.



I felt ovulation pains on my side and I had sex the withdrawl way and than we talked and decided to just have sex with out him pulling out anymore. Is there a reason why I am early? I STILL FEEL LITTLE TWINGES ON MY SIDE LIKE WHEN I OVULATE, BUT NOT LIKE WHEN I WAS OVULATING ON THE 25TH.



What's going on ????



I've tooken plan b before and I'd get a period, but my cycle would just start over and 4 weeks later get it again...why is it different this time? I still occasionily feel nauseated and YES I AM STILL BREASTFEEDING BUT I DON'T REALLY FEED HIM LIKE THIS DUE TO WORK.

It's called discharge, and it's completely normal.



it doesn't necessarily mean you will get your period though.
if there is a change or increase in it, then yes. It may mean you will.



But if it has an odd color, or smell, it may mean you have an infection.
so watch for it.

This is discharge, no need to be scared. All girls get this normally 6months - 1 year before you first period. Sometimes it can be as much as 4 years, and as little as a week.



Discharge can vary from clear, yellow and white. If it becomes green, or smells bad, then this means that you probably have a yeast infection.



When did your mom get her period? You will probably get yours around the same time as her. :)



Also, if the discharge becomes heavy, which mine did. Then i suggest wearing a pantliner, so it doesnt become uncomfortable. I also suggest putting some pads in your bag, so when you do get your period, you are ready. :)



GOOD LUCK !

this stuff is discharge from your vagina, which is just a fancy way of saying its cleaning itself out. this is a sigh of puberty but can't tell you exactly when your going to get your period, but if it starts to come out a darker color of red or brown most of the time your period is near when that happens.

Dude,



You can't OD on weed. That pain in your side is probably from all the actual smoke, weed smoke is worse for you than cigarette smoke.



That pain might also be from all the Doritos you shotgunned 5 minutes ago - it is called heartburn.



Chill out, drink some water, and watch the Family guy. You will be OK

My left labium minor is thick and large, with deep color.  I feel upset about it.  What can I do? ?



I haven't got married and is still a virgin.  When I walk I feel uncomfortable since it rubs my pants.  What worries me most is that I am afraid that my future husband will dislike it.  The country I am living is conservative about these stuff.  Do any other females have the same problems as I do?  Will it affect my marriage life?  Is there anything I can do to make the color pink or make it smaller?  I am very much upset. I hate my ugly labium.

In no way will it effect a marriage as many men find it attractive or a turn on.



The fact you say it makes it uncomfortable because it rubs your jeans is concerning. Some women with large labia report that the rubbing can actually cause pleasure.So please focus on the good.

my boobs are round, but small.. my vaginal area is slightly darker than what i would like.. but you know what? im stuck with it and rather not have surgery..its not worth it..! if its gonna make u happy than do it.. but otherwise, i find it completely worthless in my opinion.. a man should love you for you regardless of how u look when ur naked... i would be more concerned if the labium caused you to have painful sex of some sort..then i would suggest surgery..but if its just based on looks..then i dont think its worth it..  my boyfriend loves me for me.. probably will be marryin him within 3 years from now.. ive been with him for a long time now..and he accepts every flaw i have..  i understand women have hang ups about the way they look bc society can portray and make things seem perfect when reality, everyone is different and thats what makes the world go around..



i dont know what else to say, but u should learn to love urself..if u want.. seek a consultation with a doctor about ur labia and see if they can do something.. u may need a pep talk to love yourself the way you are... heh..the price of the surgery procedure may just shut u down when u realize it costs thousands of dollars for such a unnecessary procedure if its not life or death..  think about it..  seek help.

Perhaps try some relaxation techniques. Guided Imagery is a great way to help relieve stress. Sit down in a dark, quiet room. Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing. After a few breaths imagine yourself in the most relaxing place you can think of. It can be on a secluded beach, in a forest near a brook, in the mountains looking over at the scenerey, what ever makes you feel comfotable. Next, focus on the feel of the sun on your face. Feel its warmth. Listen to the sounds around you, the wildlife, a near by stream, etc. Stay in this mental place and feel yourself relax.



If it is difficult for you to do something like this in on your own, there are many CDs you can purchas that will help.

Does sex hurt for the guy when a girl loses her virginity?



I am a guy, and a virgin, and I always thought sex would hurt with a girl that had hymen. For the same reason it would hurt if i pushed the head of my penis against a guitar string.



Seriously, does it hurt for the guy?

The hymen is a very thin membrane that you probably will barely feel. No, it is very thin and erodes and breaks very easily. It is also very elastic and can be pushed out of the way without your knowledge. She, on the other hand, may feel pressure, slight bleeding and pain, so if you do have sex with a girl that has not broken her hymen, please be very careful. Go slowly with her.



Unless she is very small and you are very large, no, it should not hurt you.  Good luck and be careful! (use protection!)

I think this question belongs in the men's health category but I'll tell you what I can. From my understanding it does not hurt for the guy if he has sex with a virgin who still has her hymen intact. Depending on the age of the girl, the hymen may already be broken for many reasons. Girls who are active in sports, especially something like horseback riding, have their hymen broken with out realizing. I have heard several of my guy friends talking about their experiences with girls who were virgins at the time and neither one said anythin about the experience being painful for them. The only real caution that I am aware of is to be prepared for the girl to bleed a little.

Is anyone out there? I'm so depressed.?



Over the summer i finally lost the weight i had been trying to lose forever and once i lost it i was SO happy and confident! I felt like i didn't need to hide anymore, and i did it for myself. Now i have gained back the weight and I'm just as big as i was before i lost the weight..the only thing is now I'm more aware of it! Because i know what its like to be small. I've gained about 10 pounds (and i know that doesn't sound like a lot, but its about 2 sizes for me and i look like I have gained 20!) Its horrible, I feel worthless. Every day i look at all the tiny size 4 clothes i bought during the summer (That i cant even button now) and feel HORRIBLE, like i want to die. And it takes forever for me to lose inches. I just want to be tiny again, I need to do it for me. But now the rest of my life is falling apart as well, and i just want to crawl up in a little ball and die. Also i recently moved (its a long story, but i have no one right now). I really just need someone, someone to tell me what to do..someone who cares. I'm alone. And i wont kill myself because I'm a christian and i don't believe in that. How can i pick myself up? Everytime i try i fail. I'll start exercising and then I will end up hurting myself and not be able to workout for a week...and a week turns into forever..ugh please help me.



and not that i should even bring this up because it depresses me so much even to write it but theres the guy (my first love) and a couple years ago he chose another girl over me (she was much skinnier) and i was devastated!!! Ever since then i had wanted to lose weight so he would like me and guess what...this summer when i showed him the new me he was obsessed! So much so that I didn't like him back, it was kind of closure for me.. i finally achieved what i had wanted to for the last few years. But that strangely depresses me all the more... and makes my self worth even lower. Like some how it proved to me that I will never find someone that just loves me for who I am..not what i look like.

oh honey, its fine. If you're 9 years old you shouldnt be worrying or reading about these type of things! Or be on yahoo answers really. I'm sorry that you stumbled upon my question :( and some times adults say things but dont really mean what they say. When your mom said that she was probably just sad and was over exaggerating. However if she ever says it again call 911 right away! And please don't worry about these things and enjoy being 9 years old :)

i don't know where to start with this, if you are serious( and it sound as though you are) you need to speak to a friend or family member or better still your priest. i know this sounds corny but it's whats on the inside that matters. i use to be small and now i'm quite big and i understand how you feel. you will find someone and they will love and respect you for you not what society thinks is normal, it will be worth waiting for. if you are healthy than you should concentrate on staying that way, good luck

I am a UK size 12-14 which in America is an 8-10 and I am happy with my body. When I was a teenager I was a UK size 8 which is a size 4 US and I felt fat then. The thing is, it doesn't matter how big you are as long as you feel happy within yourself. I bet if you were always a size 4 US eventually you would stop appreciating it and you will slip back into depression about something else you don't like about yourself. In order to overcome this you need to have a busy lifestyle so that you don't have time to think about these things too deeply. You are who you are and no matter what you look like only you can overcome your problems but I am here for you.



Oh and about the guy, he is not worth it! You need someone who will appreciate you no matter what your size. People like that are always looking for the best and competing girls against each other. What is the point of living like that when you could meet someone better who will love you and you alone.



Good luck and I am here for you x

What should I expect when getting off the Depo Shot?



I have been on the Depo Shot for four years and just recently decided to get off of it. I have been off for about a month, I have read it takes 6 months to a year for your period. But my emotions are out of whack, I cry more than normal, get anxiety attacks, etc. Should I get on another form of birth control to control this? I want a birth control with less side effects.

You tend to stop getting taller around 16-18, but growth spurts around 20 isn't that uncommon.  I'm still the same height that I was at 16.  Your body doesn't finish developing until you are 25 years old.

Do you ever feel like this when you're PMSing?



I feel kind of panicky and like the walls are closing in on me, and I feel depressed and like everything is coming to an end. I love my boyfriend but right now I feel like I just want him to stay away from me and I feel like crying my eyes out for no particular reason. Have any of you  felt like this while PMSing? I feel awful. :(

I feel like this sometimes when I'm PMSing, don't worry its normal. But if you really want to get rid of it and its bothering you, go to the doctors and they should have medication for it.



it used to happen to me more often but yeah I used to get really..almost like a gray cloud over my head, just really down and like you said-like walls are caving in on you and at work I'd be in a sad mood, and just wanted to stay in my room and didn't want anyone to come near me.



just let it pass :] I found it really soothing to listen to music or just do what feels better for you and don't worry about it its natural we all go through it, PMS isnt a known as a big pain in the *** for nothing!

Yeah.  This is normal.  don't worry about it too much.  But you might want to talk to your doctor if you're really worried.  There is a thing called PMDD (Premenstrual dysphoric disorder).  It's basically when you have severe emotional and physical problems that are linked closely to the menstrual cycle.  You can research it and then your doctor (if you have it) can prescribe something like YAZ.  it is a birth control that proves to lessen and sometimes stop the effects of PMDD.



Hope this helps.

I'm 53 now but spent most of my 20s and 30s that way. I found out thru my gynecologist I had a condition that i now have forgotten the name of it. Anyway its right before you become diabetic, and he put me on metformin.  I'd tell your doc for sure because one of the symptoms is bad pms.  Also beef up your b vitamins. Drink camomile tea, and just avoid everything you can't handle. Be good to yourself, cause you deserve it!

If GOD did not intend for humans to masturbate he would have given shorter arms.



To check your Hymen.......Sit in front of a mirror. Undress and spread your legs. Using your fingers spread apart your labia minora or inner lips and take a look. First find your Clitoris, just below it will be your urethra and just as you keep looking down you will see your vaginal opening.Your hymen should look like a thin membrane covering a small section of your vaginal opening.



Don't be embarrassed be comfortable with your body.



Note Some women lose the hymen doing normal activity such as riding a bike , horseback riding, etc....

Hey!



I find a brand called Uvelex. really comfy!
I don't if it's Uvelex or Ulvex...something like that!



They are a new sort of brand but most supermarkets I've been to have them!
On the front there is just a big U and it's a black pack with lot's of different coloured swirls on it.



The pads are thin but absorbant!
I really like them cause they are so comfy I forget they are there!!! (I sound like a TV add!!! lol)



Anyway!
Hope this helps you

You dont need soap in that area...Just clear water is all thats needed...you may want to use a scented soapfree shower wash to wash around the outside area but dont get any inside on the pink bits.  The inside is self cleansing and has a delicate PH balance that is easily upset with soaps etc.

No soap is best of all. You can use any soap you like on your labia.. just don't get any bubbles in your snapper because the soap will upset the delicate natural chemical balance that prevents yeast infections.

Well, I use Dial soap. That's regular soap, but I usually use a little bit of soap on a washcloth and then wash myself.



Use a soap that isn't scented. things like that can irritate the vaginal area.

My right breast is always sore :(?



When I press down on my right breast on the left hand side near the chest bone(middle) where my right breast begins it hurts and feels swollen. my other breast is fine it's just this one. I've been feeling it and I don't know if there's any lumps or it's just swollen tissue there, but it does feel a bit different to my left breast tissue. I don't feel the pain without touching it, but it can be uncomfortable as i'm aware of it, it's just when i press on it. Had this for over month and take nurofen but its not going away, some days worse than others. I'm only 20 so don't know what it could be?

Masturbating vs. with someone?



Strictly in the physical sense, which is better? Personally, I can orgasm through masturbation, but I've never given myself an intense one or found anything that works really well. It's more of something to deal with horniness. But with my boyfriend, it's a different story. I've still never experienced a vaginal orgasm, only clitoral, but he can do me so much better than I can. It's weird, but things that don't do much at all for me when I'm by myself feel really good when done by my boyfriend. What're your experiences?

I totally agree that orgasm given by your significant other is so much more intense.  I think this is because you relinquish your power to that person at that moment and are entirely theirs.  I have been married for many, many years to the same person, and have not had many vaginal orgasms, but have had many at his hand and can get turned on thinking about the moment that you reach orgasm through love.

strictly in the physical sense..
someone else is almost always gonna make you feel better than you can do with yourself.
like you said, masturbation is a way to 'deal with' horniness.
the way you look at it is like business. get it, get the job done, get out.
when you're with someone else, there's passion, there's emotion, there's all that good stuff that can make it really really good.
especially if it's with someone you're close to, versus a one night stand.
have you tried mutual masturbation?
that would be altogether different as well!

I usually have better luck on my own most of the time. I picked up a small vibrating rocket thing, because I can only orgasm with clitoral stimulation. But there are other toys that you can get that give the same/ or close too the feel of him, that you can use on your own. =)

Get yourself a Jack rabbit..ive had one for a while and absolutely love it..i feel that if you masturbate and become confident of how you like to ***..you can experience new heights with your boyfriend.



Get together and watch some porn and you'll reach orgasm a lot faster too...



if your boyfriend cums quickly..try to play with him and go for 2nds..guys can usually hold better the 2nd time around..so he will be in you longer and harder..making you *** multiple times...

Another question about Vicodin and Pregnancy?



I was prescribed vicodin and am 25 weeks pregnant and have been getting some scary responses about taking it. People are saying that the baby could be addicted now and I am very upset. I took 2 per night for 4 nights straight and then stopped, and then now 2 weeks later I took one last night and one today for kidney stone pain. Do you think I have hurt the baby? Do you think he could be addicted right now with that much??



My midwife told me it was okay and even prescribed me 30 more pills (which I have not taken) and I don't think I will take them anymore. I also cant go to the hospital either because when I get there for kidney stone pain they shoot me up with morphine and demerol. The pain is very extreme, but I'm scared for my babys life.



</question>



<additional details>



Please don't answer with guesses, I need people to answer who have actual knowlege in this area. My midwife keeps saying its ok and so has a doctor.



She is a certified nurse midwife. Not some random lady who wants to deliver my baby lol.

Doctors and nurses are certified and educated, they would not give you anything that would remotely harm your child.  Don't abuse the vicodin, take as prescribed and you will be fine.  Don't over do it, and if you are uncomfortable with taking the pain killers, then try to take them as sparingly as you can.  Also re: Kamillias answer.....she went to a dentist...unless they specialize in pulling teeth and baby's out of the womb...then they don't know squat.  Trust what you midwife and doctor tell you....they do a lot of research...they wouldn't ever jepordize getting sued, over something like this...they know what is best for you.

The quantity and frequency that you are using it are not sufficient to addict your baby.  If you were using it daily for several months, then sure, but for a few days here and there there's nothing to worry about - which is why your doctor and midwife both say it's okay.

It will be okay, as long as you take it in moderation, and as prescribed. DO not use it everynight, the baby is a part of you. SO if you become dependent and need it every night then the baby will be dependent as well.

Can I change when I get my period with Birth Control?



Would I be able to skip some sugar pills and move on to my next pack of birth control right away in order to change the day that I get my period?



I start my sugar pills on Wednesday and get my period on the Saturday (So my period ruins my whole weekend!)



I was thinking of only taking 2 sugar pills and then going straight into my next pack so that I would end up starting the sugar pills on a Friday and then getting my period on Monday.



Does this work?  Is it OK to do?



Thanks!

It would be fine.



Calculate it out so that you start your next pack of pills on Thursday (so that your first sugar pill would be taken on Friday).  This way you'll get your period Monday or Tuesday and usually will be done by Friday.

Every single woman is different. Some are quiet, some are not.  Depending on your living situation, you may want a quiet one.
One sure(ish) way to tell if she is really enjoying it is to pay attention to her facial expressions and her body movements.  sex is an active process that stimulates both people, if she's enjoying it, just pay attention to her face and judge.
Also, another test if the level of wetness/lubrication of her vagina.  If she is enjoying it, her vagina will be wet continuously as the brain wants to continue the pleasurable activiity.
wet vagina and possibly erect nipples..
One final note, dont think of urself as some sexual god or u might not realize if she's acting or not.
Good luck

lol, you had seen porn too much. Intimidate love doesn't require screaming or yelling like porn movie. A whisper, a moan may replace that better. What most important for woman is your eyes, the more you stare at her, she will feel be loved. The more she will be turn on, the more she will get quick orgasm.

Hormonal fluctuations can influence the amount of shedding of the uterine wall.  Perhaps you have been under unexpected stress? Many things can affect your hormone levels and thus ur bleeding when having your period.
As long as the bleeding occured when you expected your period then all shud be good so no worries...

Horrible pains and random bleeding?



please dont just tell me to go doctors!



okay so im a lil worried, the last few times i have had sex, when ive gone to the toilet after there has been tiny spotting (so small its only there when wipe once then all gone) i have been geting constipatied recently and was wondering if its because of that?! also my belly is swollen (only slightly) and have been gettin sharp pains around near my belly button, oh and my last couple of periods have been a lot lighter than usual and the last period i was having trouble gettin a tampon in!
the swollen belly i find strange because i have actually lost a few pounds but my belly looks bigger! i dont understand! so what is it all about?



im 20 yrs old by the way,

Too many unrelated symptoms to properly diagnose.  Your vagina is not directly connected to your stomach...too many other questions, were u a virgin until recently? did u use a condom? multiple partners? has ur partner been faithful? any discharge other then blood?
My suggestion outright is to see a doctor immediatly.
Something is definitely off and its not only the bleeding that u shud be concerned about.
See a doctor or a consulting nurse asap please.  And put off the sex for now.

Stretch marks are hard to get rid of..some go away naturally.
Do you expose your boobs often and hence u dont want people to see the marks?
Try hiding it with makeup for a while and exercise more(Cardio) to get more healthy and take womens multivitamins for overall health and well being.
There are tonns of products that MIGHT help, but results vary.
You may also try having a bra that gives your boods more support to relieve teh "stretching"

Natural Vitamin E oil applied topically and take about 500mg daily Plus Vitamin C which your body uses to synthesise collagen the protein builder that makes your skin stronger & more elastic.



Get plenty of fresh air and exercise.



Eat fresh living food that is fruit & Veggies. avoid wearing tight bras, the more freely your breasts can move the quicker the marks can heal. (The movement allows better lymphatic drainage & circulation.)



Some studies show that women who don't wear bras have less than 1% of the breast cancer risk of those who wear bras.

yes sure,



usually we do heavy weight with 12-15 repetition, this increase the size of your muscle.



use low weight and increase the repetition 20-30. it will make your muscle firm and also help to loose your weight.

Well obviously dont work out your arms lol. I think the best thing is to do lots of cardio, running, eliptical, biking , swimming is really good too.  you might tone your legs up a bit from it but cardio is mainly for weight loss. Swimming great too cause it doesnt make you all bulky but the weight goes away pretty quick.

Easy, Fewer repetitions with heavy weights = muscle gain
More repetitions of lighter weight = fitness & weight loss without muscle gain.
Also keep protein intake to a moderate level, eat plenty of fresh veges, sure have some meat eggs fish etc if you like but in smaller portions once a day or less.

Yes.  Stop increasing the weight.  Your muslces get bigger to handle bigger loads.  Maintain a constant weight load or even lighten it a bit..ur muslces will get more efficient for their size and wont grow that much.
Keep it up

Though you said you definitely don't think it's your period, sometimes cycles can fluctuate unexpectedly, so that could still be it! As far as "highly doubt"ing you're pregnant, if that means there's still a chance, I'd make sure! Other than that, I'm sure there are probably lots of other totally normaly reasons for your pain, but I would definitely go get checked out by a doctor to find out what's up!



Good luck!

To be honest.  Working out can be the cause depending on if its the muscle underneath the boob or within the bood itself.
If you have been working out ur pectorals(chest) a lot and been having sexual activities that are rough with the boob, then expect pain.  sucking on them really hard might hurt since it ruptures the capillaries in the skin and surrounding tissue of the boob...since there is general damage from working out, the additional damage may take a while to heal.. Its not serious at all unless its red and or swollen. And red from hickies/sucking doesnt count.
Good luck

An abcess.  Just either wait for it to break open or wait until it comes to a head and pop it.  If you go to the Dr., all they'll do is lancet it open and let it drain.  It could be cause by an ingrown armpit hair.

I would trust in your doctor.  He/She has chosen the most common reason you haven't had it do to your circumstances.  Give it more time.  I've gone a year or so before, not having it.  You are irregular to start and lost weight quickly right after.  Don't worry about it.

It's often completely normal for women to have weird cycles the first few years of their menstrual cycles -- or it could be due to your weight loss or stress level, like your doctor believes. Most likely, you're perfectly fine, and your period will come back when you least expect it to. I would trust your doctor, but get a second opinion or have more frequent check ups if it's really bothering you! Good luck! :)

omg i wouldn't recommend you have sex at your age cos you are WAY too young the best for you to do is wait a couple more years at least until your more mature and not all 13 year olds have sex hardly any of them do so don't just do it cos you think everyone else is doing it



wait until you meet a guy who you have strong feelings for and yeah.. it hurts a bit the first time and some girls bleed but other don't everyones different. nah the guy shouldnt back away if you bleed or whatever and if he does he a total d*** head! :)

Just because 'everyone does it' means that you should. Everyone kills, cheats, lies and steals. Does that mean you should?
You are way too young to be able to cope with what sex can do. Sure it feels great, but it's much more emotional for a girl. When that boy breaks up with you you will be even more heartbroken than you would have been if you didn't have sex.
Will you even use protection? Do you know that not one contraception is 100% effective? Condoms can break and be ineffective. What about STD's? You know condoms don't protect you against cervical cancer? And then there's the pap smear.
And yes it hurts, especially if you have a smaller frame.



You're still a kid. Study hard so you will be able to have a career when you grow up. Hang out with friends and play sports.



Only have sex when you are ready and in love.



You'll regret having sex this young later in life. Trust me.

Please, do yourself a favor and do not have sex right now. You're right, practically everyone does it, but NOT everyone does it at young ages, even if that's what your friends/school/media makes it seem like. I'm nearly 20 and still a virgin, and I couldn't be happier with that! Currently I'm in a wonderful relationship with the love of my life -- we've been together for 2 years this month and have been waiting until we're both completely sure we're ready to have sex before we take that step, and I know that when we do, it will be really special and a good thing for the both of us.



As for pain, yes, for most people, the first time (or even the first few times) can hurt quite a lot for females, ESPECIALLY for those who do it at very young ages, like you.



But aside from that, you should know that sex comes with not only physical consequences (such as the pain you mentioned, as well as possible STDs and unplanned pregnancies), but also very intense emotional consequences. Whether you think so or not right now, sex does and will change everything. It will change the relationship between you and the person you have sex with, and the relationship you have with yourself. When you are 100% ready in every way, sex can be a wonderful and beautiful thing -- BUT, when you choose to have sex before you're ready, it will almost ALWAYS bring up emotions you never expected to feel (such as guilt, insecurity, sadness, and intense regret, to name a few).



Please, please, there is absolutely NO rush to have sex. You have your whole life to experience it -- why not wait for the right person and the right time, when you'll really be ready to fully understand and enjoy it with someone you love and trust who truly cares about you?

No. Not everyone does it, at least not at your age. Most people lose their virginity around the age of 16-17, VERY FEW lose at the age of 13. So wait!! If the guy who's trying to get you to do it, then he's definately an asshole. Don't even bother. You'll regret it.



It hurts for some people more than others. It depends on if your hymen is broken or not.

What happens with cysts in PCOS?



I am 25 years old, a type one diabetic, and was diagnosed with PCOS about two to three months ago. I was put on progestreone, and clomid.  After using the clomid, I was told to come in for a check up to see if the medicaiton had caused cyst. I went in, and turns out it caused a bog one, about a golf ball size one. I odnt know if there were more than that... but im going in for an ultrasound, and then i may be allowed back on clomid which is what im hoping? What does a cyst have to do with being put back on the medication, and should I be worried about the cyst, i mean what could go wrong?

I also have PCOS and am having complications because of it at the moment. A cyst that big can rupture and as a result of that it can flip and when that happens let me tell you you see stars ( just when it ruptures), the pain is so bad you feel like your uterus and everything in there is going to be ripped out of you in cold blood and then you start to bleed internally (that's what happened to me).I was hospitalized twice for the same thing. The flip happens if and when the cyst ruptures, the impact of the rupture can make your ovary flip causing circulation to be cut off and that is more of an intermittent pain with extreme nausea and vomiting. Don't let that happen to you.

I have a long history of PCOS, cysts and clomid, so trust me.  All eggs released at ovulation start out as a small cyst that bursts and pushes the egg into the fallopian tubes.  When that cyst doesn't burst it can fill with fluid and cause pain.  Some cysts will stop growing once they form and just shrink and go away on their own. Others will continue growing.  Some cysts grow very slowly, some rapidly. Even small cysts that burst can be very painful, I have had them range from the size you describe up to one that was 11 cm....about the size of a baby's head.  Many of mine just went away, but I ended up having surgery 5 times to remove larger cysts, or ones that bled out when they ruptured.  PCOS just makes you much more likely to develop cysts, and clomid is inducing your body to ovulate more than one egg at a time, so it can be risky and require watching.  Your doctor is smart to watch this closely by ultrasound, because obviously if you get a cyst that doesn't go away or ruptures and bleeds out it can be life threatening.  This treatment does work though, you just have to be careful.  Has your doctor considered putting you on Metformin?  That diabetes medication can actually control PCOS and induce ovulation better and with less risk than clomid.  It took me 3 years on clomid to get pregnant.  After 3 months on metformin I got pregnant.  Good luck and God Bless !!

Hi



One of the commonest forms of hair loss in women (and men) is a condition called telogen effluvium, in which there is a diffuse (or widely spread out) shedding of hairs around the scalp and elsewhere on the body.



This is usually a reaction to intense stress on the body's physical or hormonal systems, or as a reaction to medication.



The condition, which can occur at any age, generally begins fairly suddenly and gets better on its own within about six months, although for a few people it can become a chronic problem.



Because telogen effluvium develops a while after its trigger, and causes generalised thinning of hair density rather than a bald patch, women with the condition can easily be diagnosed as overanxious or neurotic.



Fortunately, it often gets better with time. Telogen effluvium is a phenomenon related to the growth cycles of hair.



Hair growth cycles alternate between a growth phase (called anagen, it lasts about three years) and a resting phase (telogen, which lasts about three months). During telogen, the hair remains in the follicle until it is pushed out by the growth of a new hair in the anagen phase.



At any one time, up to about 15 per cent of hairs are in telogen. But a sudden stress on the body can trigger large numbers of hairs to enter the telogen phase at the same time. Then, about three months later, this large number of hairs will be shed. As the new hairs start to grow out, so the density of hair may thicken again.



Many adults have had an episode of telogen effluvium at some point in their lives, reflecting episodes of illness or stress.



Another common type of hair loss in women is androgenetic alopecia, which is related to hormone levels in the body. There's a large genetic predisposition, which may be inherited from the father or mother.



Androgenetic alopecia affects roughly 50 per cent of men (this is the main cause of the usual pattern of balding seen as men age) and perhaps as many women over the age of 40.



Research shows that up to 13 per cent of women have some degree of this sort of hair loss before the menopause, and afterwards it becomes far more common - one piece of research suggests that over the age of 65 as many as 75 per cent of women are affected.



The cause of hair loss in this condition is a chemical called dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, which is made from androgens (male hormones that all men and women produce) by the action of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase.

Have you been having periods for a long time, or did you just recently start? For most women, our menstrual cycles are never perfectly in sync the first few years -- some women's are always a little off! That's perfectly normal, and so is spotting between periods, which is what it sounds like you are experiencing. Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you. :)
If you have any other questions or are still worried about it, take a trip to see your doctor -- they can most likely tell you exactly what's up and ease your mind!

well how old are you?
and weight yourself right when you wake up and at night you will see there is maybe about a 4 pound difference its because of water weight.
you are pretty normal so don't worry if you really do want to loose weight loose no more then 7 pounds and do it the correct and healthy way.

NO way!  There is no way that you are fat and don't listen to anyone who tells you that you are.  A healthy weight for your height is anywhere between 100 and 125 pounds and you are right in the middle, so that's perfect!  If you insist on losing weight, then don't try to lose more than 5 - 10 pounds.  But really, I think you're just perfect and don't need to change a thing.

Going by your weight and height, you have a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 21.1.
This is the ideal weight for your height.
However, if you feel that you are not happy with your body shape, you could always do a few simple toning exercises. even while at your computer, for example, twisting your upper body from the waist.

A size 6-8 is not fat at all!

Please remember that you will bloat around your period/after eating or retain water.

If you didnt alot of fizzy drinks it would be advisible to cut down on them or change to water or non-carbonated drinks.

Hope this has helped.

Periods are irregular when your younger and get more regular as you get older.  There isn't a way to make them regular unless you take birth control.  Teas and anything else that claims to help, none of it does so don't waste your money.

The only way to "reverse" them is to continue to wear supportive bras, and to possibly get a breast lift.

90% of girls have their first period between 11 and 14.

10% will have theirs before 11.

Anything between 10 and 16 is considered normal.



First period before 10 or after 16 is something that can be due to body weight issues.  If a girl is too thin, she may not have enough body fat to menstruate.  If a girl gets her period before 10, it may be because of obesity.

Most likely it isn't. Unless you have injured it or do a lot of horseback riding. Things like that.
The only way to know for sure is to go to the Doctor. They can look and tell you if it is or not.



Here's a tip though....if you don't wanna go to the doctor and you are going to have sex...Do some stretching of your Vag. Use a toy or you fingers and stretch it out. The more you do that the easier it will be.

do you use tampons because sometimes this will have broken your hymen. but honestly if it is or if it isn't it's not that big a deal. just make sure that when u do get round to doing the deed that you use protection or the next question u'll be asking on YA is 'am i pregnant?'

Your gyn can tell you, i really do not think working out will break your hymen. If it broke then, you would notice blood.



And no even if it is broken it will not effect the pain, it will still be pretty painful, because of the muscels being really tight and all. You could not check yourself however. If you have sex and you bleed then you know that you broke it.

The difference is going to be minimal, so it doesn't really matter.

If your b/f really cares about you he will be gentle for your first time. Discuss this with your b/f, it is such a big step that you shouldn't even think about it without talking about it first anyway.

Hi Sheryl ,



Only a doc can speak about you for sure. A lot of girls break theirs when they are little from falling on that "crotch bar" on bikes. You can also break it next to a tampon. It's lately a bare membrane so if you broke it you would bleed for a moment. It doesn't receive any diff. though as far as reproduction or sex. No one, not even that special guy, will be capable of speak about. Also, if it is broken and you've never have sex, you ARE still a virgin no situation what anybody say.

Good luck Hun and enjoy your selves.

It is a possibility, many women break their hymen through swimming horse riding etc, although I didn't. I have ridden horses all my life and the horse riding didn't break my hymen. To be honest, the hymen is a very thin piece of skin and is partially open anyway, and it's a fairly quick pain when 'broken', there may be a little bleeding,..but not always. Sex may be a little uncomfortable the first few times, but after that, there shouldn't be an issue

If you have a menstrual flow, your hymen is already "broken."

Most women have hymens that are not entirely closed to begin with.  About one in two thousand women have "imperforate hymens" that actually block the entire entrance to the vagina; these are easy to spot because they block menstruation, and usually a doctor has to open the hymen surgically.  More commonly, the hymen is a ring of tissue with a central opening that may or may not tear during intercourse.

The condition of the hymen is not a reliable way to determine whether or not a woman is a virgin, since it's almost always open to begin with.

The vagina is always moist and produces natural lubrication when aroused. Discharge is normal, although a foul smelling discharge can be an indication of infection.

If your panties are too tight or not aerated enough, and you don't use powders and whatnot (some people don't) then you will sweat a lot during the day.

If you've got some kind of stuff coming out, you might want to get checked for all possibilities, including burst cysts, allergies/sensitivities, stds, pregnancy. Some people have it a lot coz they put on lotions or powders where they shouldn't and the body "washes" it away, causing discharge.

Some women have a wet vagina more than others, nothing is normal. It can also change depending on which part of your cycle you are on. Sometimes before you get your period you will be wetter than what you are after it but it's different with everyone. 
As long as it's not smelly/itchy etc then your perfectly fine.

You are right.All women have a discharge and there will always be some "moisture" in that area.If you are constantly experiencing wetness you might have an infection.Naturally the vagina self cleans,and that is why women have discharge.It cleans itself of all harmful bacteria.Is there a color to it? If it is clear or white colored then there shouldn't be a problem.Are you getting aroused before it takes place?If it is yellowish or has a foul odor please make an appointment with your obgyn just to rule out any infections and maybe she can give you more advice.Until then,use pantyliners.

You can eat the bananas, but it take a while to relieve the pain. My advice to take a midol as long don't drink any caffeine, like coffee, tea, coke or so.You need stay away sugar from them. It will help you to relieve the pain when you are taking the midol. And you can put the heating pad on your tummy, while you are lie down the bed. It's will take a while to relieve it.

That is exactly what happened to me.  It could be your period.  Or it could be your body trying to start your period.  Before I got my period,  I got a reddish-brown stain in february that lasted and hour.  Then 5 months later, i got another reddish brown stain, and brownish discharge that lasted a day.



Then a week later, I got my actual period!  (it was really light and spotty)

So it could very well be your period, or it could just be trying to start.  Keep a watch on it and if it lasts more than 2 days, it's most likly your period.  This is how most girls start their periods, light and spotty.  Either way is normal.  I know this is confusing, but i hope i helped!

Yes hun it sure sounds like it.
Have you told your mother yet?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, so don't be ok. 
When my daughter started her periods I threw her a " becoming a woman party ", with a cake & candles too & a pamper night.
Perhaps you & your mother can do something similar.

Good Luck. X :-)

It sounds like it. When you first start your period you can have odd days of brown stains and sometimes a couple of days of actual bloody stains. Any discharge is usually a sign of your period. Now that you have had some brown staining, you will probably get some more seroius staining in the future. When I started my period, it took about four months for me to establish a sort of normal cycle. if you are at all worried, have a wee word with your GP who will put your mind at rest...

Dont fret about it, the more you worry, the more painful and slower its going to come. Sometimes thinking, talking or hearing about it can help! Its true because i told my mum they were like 5 days late and the next day BAM! Thn some girls in my english class were being 'themselves' and askin everyone (even the boys!) if they had 'started' then the next say there they were, and sometimes when  think about it it doesnt hurt so much, or they start!

Nipple Discharge/Almost like it's Sweating. Scared and Confused, PLEASE HELP!?



Last week Wednesday I wrote on here worrying about my right nipple excreting a form of clear liquid. Now again, Wednesday, a week later it's happening AGAIN! The ONLY thing that is common about these past Wednesday's is I got really hot and sweaty both days. I am emotionally strained at this point, and my period should be coming.

Could it be that I just have an overactive gland? Do I have a hormone imbalance? I need help! Could this be something else more serious?

I have been to the breast doctor already, I am calling her again today to tell her about the situation. She said there shouldn't be reason to worry, but this has never happened before...and how odd is it that it happened around the same time both Wednesdays?

It's so hard because I keep thinking this has something to do with pregnancy. Even though I've never had intercourse, I keep reading about all this things about nipple discharge/sweating linking to pregnancy...but there is no way.



so please help!

Limescale is supposed to be good for your arteries. Even bottled water contains natural minerals that it flows through. Volvic even boast about it.

I know that if you lay out in the sun and then drink cold water fast it can make you sick and have stomach problems. It's why most people have stomach problems on holiday.



Maybe your doctor can send you to a place to get tested to see if there's anything in tap water that you can't have?

Other than that, are you sure it isn't anxiety? That can make you feel sick and dizzy.

your doctor would know better than anyone on this unless they themselves were a doctor. so go to the doctor if you are really worried about it. it could just be a birth mark or a mole or something. but definitely see your doctor if it worries you because there is a chance it could be something more serious (possibly a third nipple)

it definatly sounds harmless, as you say she is very young. to put your mind at rest just go to the doctors i doubt there is anything wrong, it is extremely rare for young girls to have any serious illnesses with their breasts.

it would be a good learning experience for your daughter too, so she can learn about how to check her breasts and look out for any changes in the future.

Hard to tell from an internet description. I know you probably don't want to embarrass her by dragging her to a doc at such a sensitive age. Keep an eye on it and deal with it as you would your own breast. If it changes, gets bigger, take her to the doc. I have a couple of them, have had for years, Ive had breast checks, not for this,  and the doc hasn't commented.

sounds like a skin tag , skintags are not dangerous they usually 
just fall off and die with little bother some bleed a bit when they come off. Indians and blacks have tem occur the most but also south pacific
islanders mixed with euro asian carry the genes to have them on them
usually under the arms andon the neck around the collar but they can
pop up almost anywhere on the body sometimes on or around the eye
lid which can be the most discomforting and may on the face disfigure
a unblemished snap shot. they can become bad if they turn black and
then bleed  the can allow infection in areas like the neck or under the arms and ge cut off when trimming up or during haircuts. Most skin doctors will remove them with freezing or by tieing them off without ablood suppply they quickly die tied off at the base and
they can be fine in a week or two just keep them cleaned with alcohol
and neosporin and change a dressing several times a day with new
alcohol and neosporin after each tag till healed.
If it grows beyond the size of apencil eraser have a skin doctor
remove it by lacerating it off at the base or burning it off
or he might tie it at the base and let the tag fall off as dead skin.
Totally benign. Always consult a skin doctor if it starts to grow larger than a pencil eraser.. cheers they are harmless. Ive dealt with them
cutting off a few shaving during the years. they bleed a bit but no more
severe than a small paper cut. perfectly normal.

<question>



I haven't gotten my period in a while, do i have a reason to be worried?



first of all: i'm not pregnant. i'm a virgin.
second of all: i don't do drugs, i'm not on birth control, and i don't take any medication.

okay so in the beginning of july i weighed 136. i'm 5'6" and i'm 17. i used to always eat really healthily during the week and then eat really unhealthily on the weekends. so i got stricter and started eating less and not breaking down on the weekends. now it's the middle of august and i weigh about 125. i never got my period in july and so far i haven't gotten it this month. at some point in july i had a little bit of blood one night after taking a bath, and then i had brown discharge (which i guess is dead blood?) for about 5 days after that. was that what replaced my usual period? i don't really know what that was about. it kind of scared me while it was going on but once it ended i stopped thinking about it. could i have missed my period as a result of losing weight? mind you i've also been kind of stressed. do you think solely losing about 10 pounds could have thrown off my cycle? i've never wished more for a period in my life. i'm getting so sick of thinking about this and wondering if something is wrong with me. if you have anything to say at all, please say it, i need all the answers i can get. thanks.

Take another one. There's no guaranteeing that it's been absorbed and it's completely safe to take 2 within 24 hours.

You probably shouldn't do that unless it's a birth control that's designed to let you skip periods. If you want one that does that, you should talk to your doctor and they can change your prescription.

This is not a safe thing to do on an ongoing basis, you must allow yourself to have periods most of the time. Continuous use of the pill, without your 7 day breaks does not allow the endometrial lining of the uterus to shed. This increases the risk of uterine cancer.

Is it normal to have a brownish sort of blood near the end of your period? I'm pretty sure it's not an infection because it happens at the end of most of my periods and I'm not in any more pain than usual. I'm 15 by the way, got my first period when I was 13 and they're pretty regular.

YES, completely normal.  It turns brown because the blood is old.  When your period is coming to an end, it flushes the remaining blood out of you.

i got my first period when i was 11 so you might be getting it or you could have some sort of yeast infection but if you aren't itchy down their and you don't feel it it is unlikely but for now wear liners to ensure it doesn't get on your clothes and stain them. scented liners help mask the stench of your period but you need to change frequently, around 3 times a day for it to help. liners and pads have a sticky side to stick to your underwear the wings have the same sticky stuff but it is to help ensure the pad doesn't move much as you are moving. you replace your pads/ liners during breaks like passing through classes or at lunch just bring some with you and if you forget im sure the nurses office has some, just ask it is very normal so don't be embarrassed.

It is very personal and pre-menstrual "signals" (strange discharges, breast tense, abdomen pain, etc.) can come 1-2 days or 2-3 months or 11-12 months in advance. Some girls don’t have any pre-menstruation "signals".  It depends how sensitive are you and how fast your hormones will jump up. Just don't be stressed because stress itself could make a delay. Everything has it’s time.

okay so
I'm 5'2"-5'3"
I weigh 95-100 pounds
I have hair.. and I don't mean on my head.
I don't have boobs yet (32AA).
I have been getting discharge for about a year.

Oh yeah and my mom got her's when she was mid thirteen.
And one of my sisters got her's when she was 13 and one got her's when she was 14.



Oh and my doctor is full of crap because she said that the reason why other girls were getting their periods is because they are heavier than me and like half the people I know who have it are smaller than me.

it just depends on the person.
you cant calculate it from height or weight it just happens when it happens.
but since your mom and sisters got it around ages 13-14 you probably will too. 
once you notice kind of brownish discharge you'll probably get it soon
and dont worry if you are the last one to get it your LUCKY.
the less you have to deal with it the better.

there is no set time for all girls. you could have it by the age of 13, or it could be 17 or even later. every girl is different, and no body has the exact same starting time. just relax, and it will happen when it is right for your body, you cant rush it.

Do you reckon this was just a weird period? Please help!?



Hi

Well ok, Im not due on my period until next Thursday, but since stopping depo may 2007 in order to ttc, my periods are still all over the place. On wednesday this week, I started spotting, literally only when I wiped - not enough to mark a pantyliner or anything. Then yesterday, I had a day of bleeding so I assumed that my period had come a week early. And now today, nothing. No bleeding at all. Do you think its just a weird short period. I didnt have any period pains at all, and they normally last around 4-5 days. Any thoughts?

It could have been your period.  But chances are that it wasn't.  I would just be cautious and make sure to be prepared for your period to start soon.  I know that when I got off depo, it took a long time for me to get back to a normal cycle and until then, I was getting my period every 2 to 3 weeks.

You could go on birth control. Thats what I did when I has awful cramps.....I didn't go to school for like to days when I would start my period. You can also take pain reliever like advil or ibprofen or even better midol (don't know how to spell it but I'm sure you get what I mean). Another great thing to do is take a hot bath or put a heating pad on your lower abdomen....this helps a lot with the pain.

First of all, keep track of your periods on a calendar.  Make note of cramps that you get.  If you've been having them for over a year, they should be fairly regular.

The first day of your period, take a mild pain reliever whether or not you are having cramps.  If you are at home, you can use a heating pad to help the pain.  If not, there are several things you can stick to the inside of your panties that produce heat.  I use Thermacare myself.

Oh girl, I totally feel you. I had severe cramps about two years ago, when I was in high school. They felt like my uterus was trying to kill me.

Here are my favorite ways (coming from a woman who also has a murderous uterus) to lessen those cramps...or get rid of them!

1) Take an old sock and fill it with rice. Then microwave the rice sock for about a minute. Then, put the rice sock on your lower abdomen. The heat relaxes your uterine muscles and it feels *so* good.

2) Chamomile tea. It's great stuff.

3) Midol and ibuprofen. Midol is MAGIC stuff, I swear.

4) Avoid caffeine before  and during your period. Caffeine only makes muscle cramps more painful. And try eating more bananas toward your period. Bananas are full of potassium which help lessen cramps.

5) If all else fails, I try to take a short nap. It's hard to fall asleep because of my stupid uterus, but once I do, it doesn't hurt me anymore :) And usually I wake up feeling much better.

Good luck, lady. I know exactly how it feels.

You should tell your doctor about your pain.  You could have something call Ploy cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).  It will also make you have irregular periods.  If your periods a really bad you may want to get on birth control it will help you with the pain as well.

I have quite a high pain tolerance (thanks to two older rough brothers) and I usually just ignore the cramps.



Sure sometimes it feels like I'm being shredded apart inside, but I just go for a walk instead of focusing on the pain. Our PE teacher at school said that exercising the muscles relieves tension, and trust me it does. Also, take some painkillers. That's what I do if it gets too painful or if I'm going out or something and I'm fine half an hour after for hours.

Also, I've never missed a day of school for my period. It's just something I learn to live with and I find being with my friends helps take my mind off the pain.

gain weight.  i think your weight is affecting your period thing(idk the name of it yet lol).



and also, you should only be worried about starting your period if you are 17.  girls usually start their period between 12-16.



you shouldn't be 68 lbs. at the age of 13.

I intermittently bled and had cramps.



Edit to the responder below. It is normal. If it is spotting it's fine-if it's alot get to a doctor- The farther along you are the more bleeding. I was 8 weeks. I had bad cramps for 2 weeks. After that I'd spot. Than the clots came out again-Than I was normal. The doctor told me I could bleed untill my next period.

It is not normal to bleed for 23 straight days under any circumstances.  Go to the ER.  It's better to be safe than sorry.

Edit: I do realize that some bleeding is normal.  But 23 days, to the point of "I feel like I'm dying," merits a visit to the ER in my opinion.

Bleeding after abortion is normal. How long you bleed for after the abortion depends on the abortion method. Bleeding can vary, some women bleed for long periods of time and some do not have much bleeding at all. Bleeding after medical abortion can last for several weeks – this might be spotting or heavy. Bleeding after surgical methods can last for about two weeks; this might be spotting or heavy. If you have very heavy bleeding you should seek advice straightaway.

if its enough to worry you, you should go see your gp again and ask them. It could be nothing but 23 days is long, esp with passing clots, if it is not your normal period which you are passing, then go back and get another opinion. It could be that you do need a scrape but only the doc can say for sure. If you need one, its best to get it done now rather than leaving it and it gets worse and you do end up getting an infection. Just be brave and phone the surgery. If you pass any big clots, (bigger than a 50p) save it and take it along to the Gp to show, or you could phone the family planning or even the doctor who managed the procedure. They really should have given you some information about what to expect and what to do if you have prolonged bleeding etc.
Hope this helps and its gets sorted for you soon.
Good Luck, you will be fine.

Bleeding is very common - the only thing you need to keep an eye on is infection.  If you get a lot pain, the bleeding continues and you develop a temperature then you must get help.
See how things go, try to rest a bit and if it continues, go back to the doctor.

I do hope you start to feel better soon.
Take good care of yourself.

Please dont judge me because I'm truely scared for her!  So please be nice!?



Ok~my best friend is addicted to Vicoden BAD...she is 25 and she has her own place and stuff so her mom cant help her because they dont get along.  But she takes anywhere from 10 to 20 (1000mg) pills a DAY! I think they are the 10/650's idk...the really strong ones.  And if she runs out then she gets REALLY sick for like 7 days.  She calls me begging for me to go to the hospital to fake something to get her some.  She gets 360 pills a month or more!  And she wont go to rehab because she is afraid of the withdrawls...what do I do?  She is my best friend and I dont want her to die.  Could this kill her?  And at the rate that she is going....how long could it take for the pills to kill her?  She has been doing this steadily for 5 years now!!!!



</question>

oh i forgot to say that I REFUSE to go to the hospital for her because i cant afford the co-pays through my insurance then pay for her to have the perscription. And she gets like really upset and desperate to the point of buying them off of the streets.  How can someone go through that many pills a month????  My god!

First off, I think ur a really good friend to do this for her. Now, when she calls you to go to the hospital to fake an injury or ailment, you should tell her that you love her but you can't contribute to her hurting herself. As her best friend you should feel comfortable enough to sit and talk to her and help her get to the root of her addiction, but don't be critical of her reasons also, try to find her professional help because her drug use is very dangerous and it could kill her. Try to spend as much time with her as you possibly can just so she knows you are in her corner and to have her back to the fullest!!! I hope I've helped you a little, good luck.

Yes, this could kill her.  And it could escalate into another addiction.

She won't stop until she has a damn good reason to stop.  Until she loses everything she cares about, she won't have any reason to stop.  You need to stop talking to her.  Tell her she has one chance and one chance only to check herself into rehab; if she refuses, you are done associating with her and will never speak to her again.  Be prepared for her to tell you to F off, and be prepared to walk away and never talk to her again.

This is the only way to deal with addicts.

She is destroying herself and has a serious addiction. Yes, if she goes to rehab she will go through withdrawals. She already goes through them when she runs out of pills. I know think you are helping her but you are enabling her basically to kill herself. Do not fake illnesses to get her more drugs! Get her into rehab before it's too late. If anything happens to her and you didn't try you will in some way blame yourself. If you at least try, you will know you did the best you could for her. Really it's up to her. She has to want to help herself.

How to Stop Thumbsucking
Thumb-sucking is a very natural process of sucking a thumb, or sometimes finger, for comfort. Most babies do this in the womb before birth and the habit normally stops about 2-5 years of age. However, this isn't the case for many people well past this age and the habit continues into the teenage and adult years. Some people find this shameful at an older age or it could be doing hard to your teeth. Fear not Thumbsuckers, Read this wikihow to get you started on a world free from your thumb!

[edit] StepsAsk yourself why you suck your thumb. Are you simply addicted to the habit? Does it bring you comfort? Help you sleep? Upon discovering your reasons for thumb/finger sucking, try and ask yourself why you want to quit. Are you doing this for yourself or someone else? Are you ashamed? Are your teeth damaged? Record these questions and answers in a journal and keep these thoughts in mind. 
Try and accept your thumb-sucking. Of course, you are trying to stop the habit, not continue it, but once you accept your habits they will be much easier to break. Don't insist to yourself you must stop because it is most likely a habit you've possessed your entire life. Accept the fact you will not break it in a week. 
In your journal, record the times of day you find yourself sucking. If it is before bed, try painting your nails before hand or rubbing your thumb with nail polish remover [cheaper then most icky tasting nail polishes and does the trick!]. If it is when you come home from school/work then have a lollipop on hand to keep yourself from indulging in your digits. 
Once you are cutting back more, try and get support if possible. Try not being alone too much when you its just you and your finger/thumb. Keep yourself nice and busy but not stressed because you'll just be tempted to suck. 
Eventually, the urge to thumbsuck will be less and less. It is good to set aside a day or hour during of the week when you don't have to worry about not thumbsucking. Letting yourself know that the comfort of having your thumb available will make it easier to stop. Soon you won't even care to indulge and your habit will be practically vanished.



[edit] TipsThumb-sucking has no harm besides dental problems for some. It is safer then drugs. Less risky then sex. Healthier then indulging on fatty foods. It is a natural drug on hand and can even be a gift depending on how you look at it! If you don't want to give it up, don't. If you do, try your best. 
There are many methods to stop TSing. Some use the good ol' sock over the hand before bed. Some do better with the nail polishes. Or oral devices you can get from a dentist. You can try everything you can think of and see what works for you. There is no one way, really.



[edit] WarningsNever replace your habit with something worse. As I have said, thumbsucking is one of the safer addictions. If you are going to either be a crack-addict or a thumbsucker, stick to the thumb. 
Don't change your habit for anyone but yourself. This will complicate things and doing it because your parents/sig/friend says you should doesn't mean you are ready to. Thus, making it 10 times harder to quit. 
Keep away from triggers. Such as stress, stuffed animals, blankets, ext. that remind you of TSing when you are still vulenerable. It'll backfire on your progress. 
Don't share your thumbsucking with anyone until you quit. People will probably tease like they often do and it'll hinder your progress once more. If you must share, do it when you are 100% habit free.

What to do is get a mouth guard (you can buy them cheap from sports shops for like a pound) and put it in before you go to sleep at night, it'll be impossible for you to suck your thumb with that in! I used it when I was grinding my teeth in my sleep and it worked wonders, I don't need to use it anymore. If you keep using it for a few weeks, you'll get out of the habit of doing it, then you can throw away the mouth guard as well.

When is a safe period for sex if you are on the pill?



Obviously, if you are on the pill, I'm taking it that it is highly unlikely you will conceive.  Saying that, when you are on the pill there are some days where you don't take the pill.  Are you still 'safe' at that point?  Any help or advice welcome.

Really, unless you know all of the factors, you are never truly safe... even if you do have a MD in the "cycle" many women are not regular, especially the young and older.



On average, ovulation occurs in the middle of the cycle somewhere on the 10th to 14th day plus or minus based on the girl. The egg survives typically 2-3 days. Sperm about 48 hours. So anywhere between day 8-18 are the typical conception days.



Birth control works by blocking the hormones LH (lutenizing hormone) and FSH(follicle stimulating hormone) which are in control of turning a follicle(egg) into an ovum (a baby making egg). A combination of differing concentrations of estrogen and progesterone are used for this end.



Theorectically, the pill is fairly effective, in or around the 90 percentile range. You would probably help your chances by having sex when she is on her period or in the early days of the cycle.

Best bet though, is that if you do not want the possibilty to be connected to someone for the rest of your life or you still live with your parents, settle for third base and leave the runs for marriage.

It depends upon which pill you are on, some you get a manufactured period (a chemically induced one), some a genuine one.

Pills with a genuine period may in theory offer less protection at the beginning of the next cycle, however, this is a very tenuous link.

Your patient information leaflet within your tablet box should contain do's and dont's.

In truth after a few weeks you should be protected without issue...

Like if you take it at 4:00, take it at 4:00 the next day. 4:05 is OK. 5:00 is not.) every day it will keep you from ovulating, thus making it totally impossible to get preggers. Don't worry.

I would be worried too.

Your body needs time to adjust to the hormones in the pill. They usually recommend that you use a back-up method of contraception for AT LEAST the first 2 weeks you are on the pill...but others say you need a full month of the pill before you can actually rely on it. I'm very surprised that your doctor didn't say something about this to you.

I think it's probably a good idea for you to call your doctor or read the information on the stuff that came with your pill for more information about what you should be doing now. (Like if you need to get the morning after pill.)

Please offer me some advice...?



I am 20, and I broke up with my first love about 3 years ago (he cheated on me with my sisters friend...and lied about it...it hurt me so bad) and I thought I was over him. I started dating another guy about a year and a half ago, and I am so happy with him and so in love. But for some reason lately I keep thinking about my ex. He had tried to talk to me, and tried to be friends with me but I told him absolutely not. He's apologized to me numerous times but I just wanted to forget about him.

I just don't know why I can't. I haven't told anyone and I just would like some advice on what to do here. It's killing me I can't forget him, even though I have a man who is so great to me.

I think it's just one of those things that will lessen with time, although he will probably always hold a certain place in your heart. (Despite his betrayal.) Your "first love" can really haunt you for a long, long time. There's really nothing you can do but continue to distance yourself from him. If you try to meet up with him to "get closure" you may fall even more victim to those old feelings from the past. Just try your best to let him go, and keep working on making your new relationship stronger.

Thanks so much. I was debating meeting up with him for one last time but after you said it might work the opposite way I realized how stupid that actually was. He was a big part of my life and I guess I won't ever completely forget about him.



Thank you so much.

All I can tell you is, you might never forget him, but don't ever stop appreciating how wonderful your man is who you have now, and never let yourself think that it would be a good idea to let your cheating ex back into your life!  You were smart to tell him it's over and that you won't even be friends with him.  Cheating doesn't deserve any second chances.  It's cruel.

This is in the wrong section, but darling you need to force yourself to stop.

Its natural for you to want to make things right with your ex, and its natural not to forget him. He was your first love. No one forgets their first love.

However, he hurt you. Don't forget that. And if he hurt you once, he can do it again, no matter how much he says he won't and that he's sorry. You have a wonderful man now who loves you and adores you and hasn't hurt you.

Be a smart woman and stick with your current man. He's the one who treats you with respect.

Help my GP can't find my coil!?



I had a coil fitted 6 weeks ago for heavy periods.  At my 1st check up my GP can't locate the threads and I'm due a scan shortly.

My GP thinks the coil is still there and has suggested trying to pull the threads down using some sort of contraption.  This sounds horrifying to me.  Has anyone had this done?

This is not a rare problem. The device he is talking about is a thin plastic coil retrieval hook. It is designed specifically for this purpose. The procedure is quick, easy and less traumatic than coil insertion, so don't worry even if he has to do this. It is not as bad as it sounds.

I was reading about the pill, is this true? ?



I was reading a BBC article and there's a quote from the organisation called Life that said this:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/884364...
&lt;A spokesman for the pro-family charity Life suggested the pill was responsible for a rise in sexually transmitted diseases. 
"The pill is not a contraceptive. It causes early abortion and women are being conned about what they are doing to their body&lt;&lt;

I was wondering if it's true that the pill causes early abortion? I thought it prevented an egg being released, so how can it cause early abortion? If their quite is untrue, it seems irresponsible for them to say it.

The pill encourages immorality- thus the spread of disease.  People think they're safe frome verything, just because they;re safe from pregnancy.

Yes the pill causes eggs NOT to be released- but in the event that you do get pregnant, it can keep the egg from attaching (mostly this is only true with IUD's though)

Oral contraceptives do not always prevent ovulation and fertilization.  If an egg is fertilized, it usually cannot implant because the endometrium (uterine lining) is very thin and not hospitable.  In those cases, early spontaneous abortion does occur.

Having said that, though...taking the pill responsibly and correctly will prevent ovulation almost 100% of the time.  And condoms should always be used because you don't know who the other person has been with.  The only other option is abstinence - the smartest choice by far for those who are not married and don't want to have kids.

Its not true.  that is just a quote from the woman representing a pro-life group that the newspaper is reporting on.  she may be saying this because the pill usually prevents the egg from being released but if the egg is released and fertilized, it prevents it from implanting and some people consider this an abortion.  Its a very extreme position to take, but its the spokesperson's opinion.



The newspaper isn't saying this is true, its reporting someone's story, and it quotes the person, thereby indicating to us, the audience that it is something someone said and not necessarily fact.

You're absolutely right that birth control pills prevent an egg from being releases.  Without an egg to be fertilized, there can't be a pregnancy.  And without a pregnancy, there can't be an abortion.  However, there's something called the "morning after" pill, which is used after somebody has had sex WITHOUT contraceptive protection.  Here's some information about the morning-after pill.



The active ingredients in morning-after pills are similar to those in birth control pills, except in higher doses. Some morning-after pills contain only one hormone, levonorgestrel (Plan B), and others contain two, progestin and estrogen. Progestin prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and keeps a fertilized egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus (implantation). Estrogen stops the ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation) that can be fertilized by sperm.



In any case, the statement that "the pill is not a contraceptive" is a blatant lie and if I were you, I wouldn't pay too much attention to fanatics.

Firstly STIs were rife way before the pill was invented. Secondly it works mainly by inhibiting ovulation, however it also produces cervical mucous hostility, preventing implantation.

If she is 5'6 - 5'11 the BMI chart suggests this is a healthy weight. If she is smaller than this, she is classified as being overweight. I would try get her to do more exercise if you are worried, maybe suggest going swimming or for a bike ride somewhere. If you are really worried, discuss it with your guardian and see if you can try to get the whole family eating more healthily, so she doesnt feel like you are being nasty to her.

You are correct. Douching does throw off the pH balance and can make a woman more susceptible to various infections. A woman should never douche, unless it is specifically prescribed by a doctor, in which case he or she will likely provide the patient with a recipe for a natural douche.

I have also experienced food poisoning and it is not fun - I understand what you are going through.  However, when I had it I went to the emergency room and I was hooked up to and IV.



The bump in your stomach I do not believe is normal though.  Have you had it checked out?  It could be a stone, an infection maybe an ulcer.  I would have it looked at just incase it is the sign of something more serious.

You could still be having problems with cysts since they sometimes interfere with your cycle.  I have that problem.  You could just be having unrelated hormone issues and that could really mess things up for you.  Talk to your doctor about all your symptoms.  There are ways that they can try to readjust your body so it's on a normal cycle.  You could be ovulating at odd times since your period is so out of whack.  Definitely speak to a doctor and if they don't help you, seek more help until you get it.

You don't have to. Be patience and let the pill works. Take a rest. You need it for the better condition. Take another pill can't solve your problem. Come and see your doctor, please... You should hear the advice from a professional.

Do birth control pills always give bad side effects?



I've heard they can cause weight gain, nasea, etc... What has been your experience with The Pill? yes, i know each person can respond differently. But overall did the side effects go away after a few weeks?? I just got a prescription for one (mircette). it is a low-dose pill. After all the horror stories, bad effects I've heard I'm getting nervous.. Any input/insight greatly appreciated. thx!!

I was on the pill and i only got kind of nauseas for about 2 weeks then that went away along with the mild headaches. Also i had weight gain your just more hungry but to help control that dont eat the much salty foods and that keeps bloating down. But the entire time i was on it i had extremly sore boobs and that never stopped for some reason. But my period was lighter and my body reacted different to it and i actually got cramps on it when i never had gotton them before.

For me yes,I even vomited on them. I took Mircette and the generic Kariva. Ive tried others too. I just gave up. The worst ones were the nausea and the thirst. Those made me so thirsty and tired. Ive heard nuva ring is good though because it works a different way than the oral pill.

Do you prefer asking personal health questions on here than asking your friends?



I have few queries that I've only been able to find answers for on here. I myself get embarrassed talking about periods to friends and I find it so much easier on here where no one knows who I am. Also, I wouldn't be comfortable with my friends knowing something that personal about me. I think girls would be a lot less worried about things if they just came on here and talked to other women who are probably going through the same things. Being a worried teenage girl I often find myself stressing over something thinking "Oh my God, is this normal?"

I cannot begin to describe the love I have for my father. I had a very special bond with my father ever since a baby, I bonded more with my father than my mother. I've been on Answers more these last few days because I fell off my horse and have cracked 2 ribs, and still, after all this time (I left home with I was 17 almost 18 now almost 23) it's my father who I wanted. Although, Chris is the love of my life, I'll never love another man the way I love my father. It's not incestuous just to be close to your father. It's a natural bond a child has with his/her parents. Look don't feel bad, I've even taken my dad on nights out before, people assume he's my boyfriend! My dad is very sporty so he does look young for his age. I get comments all the time regarding it, people always assumed I would grow up to marry a Doctor because my father is one. Just ignore ignorant people. I've never cared what people think. It does mildly irritate my boyfriend, he kinda feels left out sometimes that me and my father have such a close relationship...I try to tone it down as much as possible. I talk on the phone to my dad for hours at a time, almost daily. Trust me, i'm a lot worse than you! I'm obsessed! People who are critising you are generally people who don't have a close bond with their father or parents. It's perhaps one of those things one must experience before they can indeed realise how close a father/daughter's bond can be.

edit
Totally agree with rat dog, we have entered a 'paedophile frenzy' soceity where men are afraid to show affection to even their own children for fear of being branded a pervert. I'm all over my dad, I hug and kiss him all the time.I still  sit on his lap!

Personally, I am not extremely close with my father...of course I love him and he has supported me through a lot.  As a family we have been through very rough times and such, but I feel as though I am closer with my mom.  I don't go shopping with my dad, we don't have conversations about my personal life like guys and such, but we do go hiking and do outdoor activites.  I help him do yard work and I'll help him cook dinner...I guess those are our bonding activities...but as I said I feel as though I am closer with my mother...I tell her everything
but I wonder what you must be doing that makes people believe that you are being incestuous...are people saying this to your father as well?  we need more info...but as long as everything physical is strictly hugging and a kiss on the cheek, then i dont see how your relationship with him is incestuous

It drives me crazy when dads are too scared to even hug their children for fear of being called a paedophile! This happened to my friend's dad when he dropped us off at the cinema and hugged his daughter goodbye. Some idiot shouted "Eww, you dirty old man!" at him. He ignored them, but I was in shock that someone would actually have the balls to shout something like that.



I regularly hug my dad and kiss him on the cheek goodnight. If someone ever said that was incestuous I would tell them to f**k off and get a life.

Okay people may find this question very weird but please help me!?



My daughter is at a very curious age, with her little friend (if you catch my drift)
I was HIV and I spread it to her without realising....Can her friend get HIV? When I walked into their room they were naked on top of each other (Nope, I've no idea what they were doing) but I think if children do have those kind of bodily fluid (not a paedophile wouldn't know) then the infection could be spread. She's eight and no she had no idea what she was doing she was just curios, don't flame me for being a bad mother because I put a stop to it and I've no idea what was going on.
So the question is.....Do children have those sort of bodily fluids? (Don't know how to phrase that sorry)



</question>



<additional details>



They're both girls btw.
If you dare say anything about my child you're being reported, that would be disgusting!



Snagler you never followed the community guide lines, I'm reporting you
Thanks for helping but a child could be sick and you could help but your life is more important



My doctor told me HIV couldn't be spread through saliva or sweat
And I'm talking about fluids from down there that's all I want to know please



I already told her what she was doing was wrong!I didn't know this was going on until I walked in (she didn't seem ashamed or anything, she didn't understand) I am not bringing her to a councillor. This could possibly be early signs of her sexuality...But what makes you think she needs a therapist for that?



I told her already about cuts transmitting and she's very careful and aware.
I talked to the other woman, it's five in the morning and it's to late to go ask our doctor lol.
So we decided by starting off asking here so telling me to go doctors isn't helping but thanks anyway to everyone that is.



I've told her about cuts on her body yes, and I doubt there was any contact because I made it clear, if you read my details you'd realise she's aware of what she has.

I think it's very important that you tell her not to do those things, yes she is curious, but you don't want to have it spread.  Humans have bodily fluids therefore she can spread it.  Please talk to her at a way she can understand and talk to a counselor about what you can do to make her life a bit easier as she goes through growing up.

***Edit***
Okay than from your extra info you wrote I believe you have done all you can.  If she knows not to mix fluids shes good to go.

The HIV virus can be transmitted through blood, cant be transmitted through saliva or sweat, dont know about down below regions though.

i think you got to explain to her that she shouldnt be doing things like that, and what could happen.



Edit_

HIV can be spread through fluids down there, but would a 8 year old produce them.



i dont think you have to worry. take that huge sigh of reliefe now. it can only be transmitted if 'sexual fluids' enter the blood stream.

I think they do, but unless the children were in such a position as to be able to come in contact with each others bodily fluids, I don't think she would spread HIV to her friend.  Also, women excrete fluid in the genital area when they are sexually aroused, and since the kids are so young and just being curious, I doubt that they were aroused in that way, they were just checking things out.  That is normal for kids to have curiosity at that age, but you were right to put a stop to it, and should definitely have a talk with her about what is appropriate and what is not.  And since she does have the HIV virus, now is probably a good time to start talking to her a little about being careful not to allow her bodily fluids to touch others, like in case she gets a scrape on the playground that bleeds or something like that.

HIV can be transmitted in *any* bodily fluids, not just fluids associated with sex.

And males don't secret semen until puberty, but a girl's vagina is still lined with mucus to keep bacteria out. This mucus *is* a bodily fluid.

Being a responsible adult, I would tell the other child's mother what happened and what the circumstances are. I don't know what kind of "investigating" the children were doing, but if they were sharing *any* bodily fluids (not just sexual body fluids!) there could be a chance that HIV was transmitted.

If it was just two bodies laying on top of each other naked I don't think it is possible. The virus candifferentlyy be spread through her blood and body fluids. I don't see how body fluids would have been involved since it was two females and nopenilelpenetrationn was present. Unless the other girl had a cut on her hand for example and body fluids got on the hands. HIV is not a strong virus and you need a large inoculatee load to spread it. I think the other child is okay but I would watch this in the future. Also I hope you daughter is on meds. HIV use to be such a death sentence. With the new drugs people are living to a ripe old age. So much better now days. I wish you and your daughter the best.

whatever happened between your girl and her friend, which is doubtful, but who knows, you HAVE to tell your daughter she has HIV and she can infect people. tell her dont worry, she might live a long age, i know people that have had it for twenty years so far and are still healthy, but she MUST know the risks about passing it on and about sex even at the age of 8. one is never too young to know the facts. my mother gave me cold sores, yes, herpes simplex, in my eye, as i touched her nose and rubbed my eye so i got the virus in my eye. PLEASE tell your daughter, she doesnt have to be scared, its ok, but she has to be careful. there is nothing you can do if her friend caught it, which is doubtful, but you have to explain sex and HIV to your daughter, its nothing to be ashamed of.

Do the other childs parents know that you and your child are HIV positive ??
Common sense knows that accidents happen with kids, and cuts and scrapes are part of growing up.
Why put other innocent childrens lives at risk by withholding essential information, ??

Anna,Abortions are not the easiest things to get over.  It would be as if you are killing a living being yourself.  If it helps some,I am not to judge you about this.  Sometimes the best thing that we can do for an unborn baby is to make sure it doesn't have to suffer long.  If there was complications for both you and the baby,And then yes,Abortion could be the right thing to do.  You would lose the baby,But in return,This baby's death saved your life.  Please don't be too hard on yourself,Anna.  You know how many teenage girls have abortions because they just aren't ready to become a mother?  I don't know but that is a awful crummy reason to have an abortion.  The child didn't have a choice to be born.  It just happened.  And yet,The teenage mother had a choice whether or not to keep this baby.  Anna,I don't quite know you that well.  But I would like to help you cope through this if I may.  It sounds like some people have been giving you heat about what you did.  Well,You know what?  They don't know you.  How dare they pass judgement on you when they don't even know you.  These people are such a**holes.  I'm sorry for my language,But that's what they are.  If you need someone to talk to,Someone to listen,I'd be honored to help.  You have a goodnight and sweet dreams,Anna.  Bye for now.

There is no point in telling someone abortion is wrong after the event - unless they are planning on doing it again.
In your case you don't sound like you will so ignore the comments that have upset you and move on with your life.
You didn't have to do it - you had a choice and you made a choice - now stand by the choice you made.
If you want to move on but feel too much guilt try to turn something positive out of your experience - warn others how you felt afterwards so that they understand the choice they are making better.
Light a candle for your baby and ask God to let you have that child come to you again in the future at a time when you are ready for it - maybe even through adoption you may meet this child who knows.
Then move on - don't look back again - and think only positive thoughts. We all make descisions in our life we regret sometimes - but at the time you thought it was right and the person you were then is not the person you are now - live as this new person and love this new person. And don't read any negative comments - they are not intended for you but the person you used to be.

Hi 
in order for you to make a decision like this it would have taken allot of thinking and probably allot of medical issues for this to be your choice.
I personally am against abortion just because the person does not want the baby but I DO AGREE if it is for medical reasons



there are reasons that doctors tell expectant mothers of the health issues with their unborn baby



SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION



If you know in your heart that you made then right choice then dont worry about what other people say to you because they were not in your position

This decision is not easy no matter the point of view, it cannot be said that the decision was right or wrong. It will take a long time before you feel better and you will need all your family & partner's support and love. I know you didn't wanted to do it deep inside and that you felt (and still feel ) a strong pain deep inside, this doesn't make you a bad person; is just you had no other way out.  Leaving aside the "is a sin" issue, see it from this side:

You returned an innocent angel back to the sky where he/she belongs, instead of this world of sin.

You were not prepared to be a mother and neither your partner to be a father, this child would have suffered and have a hard life because of being a gift that came earlier before the right time.

When you think these things, then you realize it was the only way out.



Keep strong and many blessings, never repeat it again.

Most of the people who say horrible things just say it to make themselves look good. If they had to look after all the sick and unwanted children in the world, they would keep their mouth shut. They're sick, as they care more about fertilised eggs than living people and try to make brave people like you feel bad. If they like making people feel bad if they have serious health implications, then they obviously don't care about people.

Help! I'm 14! Tampon/ Vaginismus!?



I'm 14 and I've had my period for about 2 years. I always seem to get it at the most in convenient of times, and really wanted to start using tampons. However, I've tried MANY MANY TIMES to insert a really small one, and I just find it impossible! I've tried all the tips and everything, tried relaxing etc. but once it gets past a certain point it hurts so much, and feel so uncomfortable to continue. I almost feel as if I'm scared it will get lose inside of me, or have a fear of something.

I remember a few years ago going to my doctor, and getting checked down there for an infection. I was screaming and crying when she was getting a sample down there, to the point where my mum and her thought i might have been abused or something as a child, without them knowing. Nothings happened to me though!

I'm thinking I might have Vaginismus, which is when my vaginal walls clamp up and make any kind penetration impossible.

I honestly have no idea, and I'm really scared.

This is a common problem in women, try some KY with the tampon, when you try to insert a tampon rather lock you bedroom door relax, and try again. Check the reference below.

Also they recommend masturbation which I must admit I am not sure of but I do agree with the concept of exercising the muscular walls of the vagina.

I know this probably sounds really silly, but make sure you are going into the correct opening.  The vagina and the urethra are fairly close together and if you are noticing that much resistance it may be your urethra.  If you are trying to put a tampon in the correct opening, then try something like the Playtex Gentle Glide, and try to relax about it.  The string is there on the tampons to prevent it from getting away from you, and being in medicine I can tell you it won't get lost inside of you because your cervix prevents the tampon from actually going into the uterus.

Yes, it's normal. I still get sore down there and I have been married for 6 years. Especially when we are a bit wild.



Just soak in hot water with some salt it should ease up a bit.

<question>



Since being pregnant I have no energy & my body feels twice the weight I am plus I am tired all the time. Why?



I can understand not having enough energy and being tired etc when you are tired. I also know that your body takes a while to bounce back.



My son is now nearly 8 months old. I have stiff feet that are sore on the top of the foot when I stand up or get out of bed. I have no motivation and am tired a lot of the time even though my baby has been sleeping through the night since 1 month old.



I find it really hard to move around and it is like I have 10 tonnes of potato sacks on me. Every movement is a huge effort and I find that I sit on the lounge cause moving around tires me out quickly.

Anyone know what might be wrong before I head off to the doctors again. They have done full blood workup and everything is normal.



</question>



<additional details>



Edited to correct first sentence... should end in pregnant.



Laura: Thanks for the reply. I agree and I do take time out for me sometimes. I go out with the girls at least once a month for dinner. Sometimes I take bubs and sometimes not.



I agree that I might be suffering some post partum depression from what I have googled. I am going back to work in the next couple of weeks because of the way I feel and I am hoping that it will perk me up.



I am concerned though that I will be too tired all the time and with the effort of moving, it will make it hard.



Is there anything you can take short tern for post partum depression?

Honey, first of all you have an eight month old, which although he is sleeping through the night you probably aren't.... I think that this might be more mental than physical.... You may be suffering from a light case of postpartum depression....I think what you need to do first of all is get up in the morning and get dressed.... Then when your little guy gets up and before he takes a nap, you and him need to get out and get walking...Even if it is just around the block the first few days...  This will serve many purposes, One, you will be exercising which releases good feeling endorphins and two you will be getting some sunshine which is always a mood lifter... Your son will also be looking at things around him and be entertained...... Also you need to schedule a little "me" time all by yourself exclusive of the baby.... Even if it is getting a cup of coffee at Starbucks or something..... To be a good mama you have to take care of yourself.... we as mothers always put ourselves last..... Not that we should be first necessarily but we don't have to be last either.... Take care and respond back...

If you can't get into see your doctor, I'm sure that you could leave a message for her/him to call you.  They may have something to recommend.  They will also be able to tell you if you need to worry or not (you probably don't).  If they think it's something that needs to be seen, they will tell the receptionist to make an opening for you.  Most receptionists only know when the next opening in the doctor's schedule is.  It's hard for them to know whether they need to make an opening.  Leave a message for your doctor to call you, and then explain the problem.  (If your doctor won't call you back, then it's time for another doctor.)

It is normal for all women to have about 2 anovulatory menstrual cycles per year...which means no ovulation.  That will temporarily throw off your cycle.  However, it could be due to a fibroid, or less likely since there is no pain--an ovarian cyst.  If bleeding continues, I would go to your health care provider.

Period usually come every 28 days or so. August to November is longer than that. Unless that is normal for you of course.

Stop using the Tampax in this incident. Use a small towel. No point suffering.

You should see the doctor who will sort this. You can be pregnant and bleed a little.

once your body hits puberty, you develop the ability to have kids. Every month, an "egg" is released from an area in your body called the Fallopian tubes. It releases the egg into the uterine canal, where male sperm swim toward it to fertilize it. Once a sperm penetrates the egg, it divides into 2 cells, and  no more sperm can enter. From that point on, the cells keep splitting until' there is a big enough clump that it attaches itself to the uterine wall. This is where it will stay and grow into a a baby until it's time for the baby to be born.

Your PERIOD is a short way of saying "menstrual cycle". A girl's cycle lasts about 22 to 24 days, at which point her period begins. But ONLY if she's not pregnant. The period blood occurs when  the egg that was set to be fertilized, does not GET fertilized.



It pulls away from the uterine wall, and is shed with the blood of your period. The menstrual blood is the only blood called your period, and it passes out of your body through the vagina. In approximately 5 to 7 days, the period stops, and the whole cycle of preparing for a baby starts all over again.

To keep this period blood from getting all over her clothes, a female with her period uses what are called tampons. They are  inserted into the vagina, and absorb the blood until  saturated. At that point it is removed, and a new one put in its place

About 15-25% of my patients have pain during and/or after her mammogram. It is normal. Some women bruise.



Take a buffered aspirin, motrin or tylenol for the pain.



If you feel it was the technologist, next time ask that a different tech do your next mammogram. They can look it up. It is OK, we don't take it personally.

I have an ovarian cyst and...?



Well I was just found out the other day that I have a "simple" cyst, which I can't find much information about online.  For the past week or so I noticed my breasts are HUGE.  They have grown a FULL cup size within a week, and they are very round and shiny.  Can the cyst be causing this?  They don't hurt at all, they're just enormous.

Do not waste your time checking on the net about what you have now.  Or ask anyone else's opinion.  If you really have what you said you have, go to the specialist right away and not to just any doctors.  Do not think of saving some money by going to just any doctors coz they might give you a false result or opinion.  Go right away to a specialist and get the accurate result and medication.  Good luck to you and hope you'll get better.

you are having a wet dream when the white discharge is occurring.

men have an average of 5 erections during sleep.
you may be waking up with an erection.

not a disease.
very normal.

the salty milk is ***, or sperm.

if you wake up with an erection that won't go away, massage it with lotion until you ejaculate. then your erection will subside.

Ladies, do you think he has feelings for me?



He's in an open marriage (it really is an open marriage, we have mutual friends so I'm sure. Both he and his wife see other people). I did not know that when we were sleeping together, ended things immediately when I found out because I wasn't comfortable with the situation. It's a very long and complicated story.

We remained friends, and now he says he can't take me out of his mind. I told him 'no' MANY times, he says he can't help it and misses me. He's already sleeping with girls (that are hotter than me), and his wife - so he does not need me for sex or anything. Also I live very far from him, he wants to come here to visit me. Does he have feelings for me? Or what?



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry for the wrong category, it was an accident.



I'm not his mistress. It was like we were dating. I'm an independent woman, he does not pay my bills or anything, I would never want that

There is something about you that is keeping him interested in you but you have to be careful especially if you’re sleeping with him as well.  You have to ask yourself do you want someone who has many others (meaning women)?  Because you will NEVER be the only one.  Now if he is paying your bill, taking you out, treating you good then that’s a different story.  But still what about his WIFE because she has ties in everything and I mean everything.  If he loses whatever he has do you still want him?

Zareena getting older can be a hard thing to get your head around watching the years pass by the reason you are probably wanting to remain a girl and not become a woman is because of the good memories you have had as a girl and the stresses and responsibilities you might get as you become a woman.



However its not all doom and gloom at all just because you get older does not mean that you have to lose your inner child you would be surpised at the amount of older people who still have that inner child that comes out you can still go on adventures and things they will just be more sophisticated I hope this helps enjoy your life :)

I sometimes wish I didn't have to grow up as well. I hate my periods, and my health has got worse since I was young, but there is no way to return to the past physically. Even surgery and drugs can't change what's inside of you. Because you had an unhappy childhood, you probably want to make up for what you missed, but you can do most things at any age. I still enjoy loads of things I did when I was younger. One can't keep a child's body forever. Adult bodies can be annoying, but not really dirty. Inside you can and will always be the same, but adult life can be scary, with loads of cares and responsibilities. I'm so sorry you're so sad about it, but keep going and still just be you. Being older does have compensations.

You said you were 20, shouldn't you have past puberty already? Normally girls go through puberty as early as 10 years old. My mom got her period at 10 and I got mine at 11. By that logic, you've been a woman almost half your life.

Um. You're 20?
Puberty traditionally begins around ages 10-13. You can't delay it because it's already started, and you can't reverse it through medication.
You're physically a woman now. If you want to be mentally a child for the rest of your life, okay. Just stay they way you are and don't change.

Actually you are as old as u think you are.Choose to remain a child and your attitude will make you live like one.
However you will definately mature and get wiser and realise that so many things about life that you took for granted but about feeling young its all your choice.

The results take 2 weeks usually.  They don't call you if everything is fine, so I'm sure that's what it is.  It never hurts to call though.  Why not just know for sure?  I personally think it's annoying and that they should call you with results either way.  For some reason, no call means good and call means bad though.  lol  Take a deep breath, you're fine!  : )

Next time you go tell them to call you with your results.  If you request it, they will call you no matter what.

I dont think so. Just any form of intercourse can bring backa a UTI almost instantly. Just use positions that have the least contact on your clitoris.



Ways you can redsuce the chance and still have sex are to:



Drink as much water as you can stomach around the time you have sex
Pee straight after you finish to flush away germs
Drink cranberry juice for a few weeks after



Good luck :)

Yes it can.
The Urinary orifice takes a lot of beating during sexual activity and can therefor become prone to infections while having sex.
Try to stick to positions that will minimize contact with your partner as far as the urethra goes.
Standing on all four so that he enters the vagina from behind is a natural way of preventing re-occurring UTI infections.

Do I need the prescription yeast infection treatment?



My boyfriend said he had like the male version of a yeast infection so I should get checked for it. The doctor gave him a medication that will cure him in one and a half weeks. I've noticed symptoms of a yeast infection on myself, but do I have to go get "checked"? I Do you think it would be okay if I just went to the drugstore and bought an over the counter yeast infection treatment? or do I have to buy the prescription one like my boyfriend did? Suggestions?

You can buy stuff for thrush over the counter(here it is called Canestan cream) but if it takes more than a week for your boyfriends to clear then I'd really be getting myself along to a STD clinic to get tested just in case. Things like cchlamydiacan look like thrush but be far worse and lead to infertility. Better safe than sorry.

First of pee is sterile.  Second of all, what are you worried about getting into your blood stream, diabetes is not contagious or blood related.  Thirdly...wouldn't you rather wear shoes in the house anyways if there is pee on the floor?  Just stick a band aid or something on your foot and watch out for pee I guess.

What is it about unavailable men that makes them so attractive?



Time for another q from me :)



Basically I am referring to a guy I was with for a very brief period (3 dates) a loooong time ago (7yrs ) but he was my first lover in the physical sense so no matter what I do I will remember him (dammit!).  He was cheating on either his wife or girlfriend at the time with me (I found out and ended it - hence the 3 dates only!) - I'm not sure if they were married then or if they married afterwards but they are now - plus their child was born around the time he cheated with me.  So I was pretty hurt by it all, him being my first etc  But I just let it go at the time as I knew that I'd been played and nothing would change that.



What I wanted to ask was -  I know intellectually that no guy is a perfect man for any girl.  But in my mind this guy seems to have all the attractive features a girl (like me) could want: he's cute and scruffy and hardworking and knows how to fix things and be practical, he earns mega $$ and buys and sells property for $mils, he's not educated but very clever and makes good decisions, he's now probably quite the faithful family man after he 'sowed his seeds' with me, he's close with his family and has great friends, and he is funny and lighthearted most of the time, but quiet and brooding when upset about something and he loves to have fun!



I found out most of that about him in the short time we had together and recently a friend told me some more she knew of him (ie he's married to the gf/wife still etc).  And although I have since married my best friend and lover who seems to just fit me, I can't stop being hurt by him and thinking how great he and his wife seem to have it.  Like she got this guy who has it all, and I was just a stepping stone.



I'll try to make my question clearer :) - why does he appear to be such a 'good catch' to me?  I know he probably has problems like everyone else but why is it that he seems to be such a good package?  Is it because I couldn't have him?



Please don't assume I don't love or want to cheat on my husband - that is not the case:) This is just to do with me:)

Your first 'love' will always be the strongest thats normal.  You sound like you are looking for all the right things about him and miserably missing all the other things. Stop building him up, he's not perfect - I'll bet he has numerous faults (we all do) you just weren't with him long enough to see them.



The fact that you mention money and how much he makes is not a positive.  The best people in the world aren't rich in wealth but rich in soul, experience and their nature.  (Thats not to say that rich people can't be nice too!) Come on, stop putting yourself in the victim role of being the 'stepping stone' this is a normal part of our growth as a human.  You don't just date one person, marry them and die with them. We all date numerous people and from each one we learn a little bit more about ourselves.



Move on, don't play the victim in your head and accept that it was what it was - a fling for him and just a few dates for you.  You too 'have it all' - you have a man who loves you.

What I suggest doing is that if she has a registry at Target or anywhere else, to get her registry number and all that and buy stuff that is directly on that registry. What I see nowadays is that people will just buy what they think is cute and not what the mother to be thinks is cute or they just buy random things and end up with 2 or 3 of the same. However, if you're giving money it's totally up to you. I just became an Aunt and spent about 150 dollars so far.

Best things to get are the simple things. Go out and buy a box or basket and fill it with everyday things. Baby bath, shampoo,lotion and talc.  But add some things like baby thermometer, nail scissors, gripe water,sudacrem( nappy rash cream). If you go into your local chemist or some where like boots and tell them what you are doing I'm sure that someone will help[ you out and I think that buying something like that will mean a lot more to your friends than just giving them money.It just shows that you have given a bit of thought to them.

Yes, talk to her about it that is not normal i MAYBE can understand a 2year old but 12 NO WAY there is definitely some mental disturbances there. if you want this relationship to work just ask yourself this one question was your fiance concerned at all about whether or not you were hurt , that instant should tell you right there whether to continue this relationship. ~Lexi

Ewwwww!  What a little freak!!  She shouldn't have slapped you.  I would have kicked the little bast ards *** on purpose, not just reflex.  You were not wrong, and she owes you an apology - in fact I would say she owes you an two, one for slapping you and one for having a freaky little brother that bit you like that.



I don't think this one event is a good reason to break up a relationship but I would ask her if she's always going to take others sides before yours.  A spouse should always take their partners side.  Whether it's against their mom, dad, siblings, whoever it doesn't matter.

I would have the little s**t arrested for assault and battery.  He should not be allowed to walk the streets.  What is wrong with her parents that he doesn't know any better than that.



My guess is that he didn't mean to hurt you, but is just jealous of the attention you pay to his sister.  He probably really likes you and wants you to do things with him.  Maybe he looks up to you.  You are taking his sister away and there is resentment.



You were not wrong to defend yourself against attack by this child.  Tell her she was wrong to hit you.  Did she hit you before she knew the facts?  She might not have known you were really hurt by the brother.



Marry her and get away from her crazy family.

That's really nasty. I think the boy doesn't like you. You should try to talk to your girlfriend calmly that it wasn't your fault. It was just out of reflexes. She will eventually understand. you''ll be fine. About the kid. talk to his parents about the biting.

38 weeks along..... has anyone felt this before?



This maybe too much info.... but I'm 38 weeks today and when I go pee it feels different than it did before kinda feels like something else is opening up to like a different porthole or something, could this mean I'm dilated, can you feel when you've dilated?

no u should not be able to feel when u r dilated. u can only know that by having your cervix checked by the doctor. i am not really to sure what u r feeling maybe just alot of pressure on your pelvis from the baby's head, is my guess. just to be safe call your doctor and they should have an oncall nurse who should be able to ansewer your question. when ever a woman is this far along and she has questions like these u should really ask your doctor just to be sure,ok. i had 3 kids and anytime i was not sure what was going on i always asked my doc or his nurse. git out the phone and make a call.

Could Stress Be the reason I havent gotten my period?



Its been almost 6 weeks since i havent gotten my period. I last had it around sept. 12 and now is the 21st of Oct. I just started to think if it was possible I was pregnant the past two days because 90 something percent of the time I get mine 5 weeks later (I dont know if thats weird). I dont know what to really think because me and my bf did use proctection the last time we had sex (around sept. 27).



But i know that I been stressing like NO OTHER. So I just need some advice. And if it continue not to arrive when would be the time to take a home pregnancy test



</question>



<additional details>



Also for the past week and 1/2 I have been getting cramps and having the symptoms I usually have when my period is about to come....so is that a sign that its coming?

stress is a MAJOR factor in a missed period. It could also be medication if you are taking any. What type of protection did you use? i hope you didn't use the pull out method. Do you keep track of you're cycles? are they normally out of whack? day one of you're cycle is the day You see spotting or any kind of blood. and then the day before you're period is due is the last day of you're cycle. i started my period on the 8th and it is due again on the 10th making that a 33 day cycle. if you'res is normally out of whack, talk with you're doctor. He may prescribe birth control until you're cycles get normal. However, sometimes women's cycles will just go haywire  sometimes due to stress, illness or medication or just because that's what out body decided to do. IF you think you are pregnant take a test. It would give you an accurate reading by now.



by the way, if you're cycles are normal it sounds ot me like you had sex around you're time of ovulation. not trying to scare you, but if you used the pull out method then there is a good chance you are pregnant. You could be getting ready to start but cramping is also a sign of pregnancy. I cramped when i was pregnant. Like i said a test would definitely work now. any brand will work.

It could be for any reason, stress included. The fact that you say you often get it late and that you've had symptoms of it coming suggests it's probably coming. But don't rule pregnancy out, even with protection it's still possible.

In my personal experience when that happened to me i was pregnant. The other time it came from me starting birth control not waiting for the Sunday after my period. Or if you recently stopped taking birth control that can cause spotting. Rough sex?? It could also be stress!!! If it continues to happen you should just make an appointment with your doctor.

If you had it for a couple of days that sounds like a migraine and I know how you feel. You probably need to tell someone about these headaches. But in the mean time ask your parents to get you some Excedrin. That works for me!! Try to get some sleep too that helps sometimes too!!!

they are milk ducts ... when you nurse the baby takes in the entire nipple - everything inside the aerola and sometimes they are even just raised hair pores. some girls get little hairs around their nipples too

When a women has her period it does indeed affect every part of that area of your body. Remember all month long your body has been getting ready to grow a baby, storing fluids in your uterus. When the egg passes the body has to get rid of those fluids. This is why we feel bloated, which affects the room in that area and crowds the bowel. Also putting pressure on the bladder. There is a tea that you can buy at the store, called Smooth move, this will help you evacuate your large intestine easier around the time of your period. This will help the smell of your farts. Good luck.

your period cannot make you fart, you must just think it or something, because your period has nothing to do with that. you always having to pee, same thing. you can't prevent urine, unless stop drinking, but that's unhealthy. prevent the farting? umm, tums/rolaids work well? lay off the beans!

You can't think of anything else. it consumes your thoughts, you get irritable, you start devising ways you can maybe sneak one.. even on a plane where you'd be arrested!!

are you crazy?
thats the stupidest question ever.



have you seen how much the government is spending to PREVENT people from starting to smoke!
don't do it! you'll get addicted and also research has proven that even though you give up smoking during birth, it can still harm your child causing long term effects in the future.
why would you start, when so many people are trying to quit.



to save their lives, and their liver.

You already know the answer to this,DON'T START!! not only will it affect your health but it will also cost you or rather your parents a lot of money.
Presumably you are not yet working,smoking is very addictive,makes your hair ,clothes & breath stink.It wont make you look any older with a cigarette in your hand.There are also few places to smoke publicly now.
Please be sensible!!

Its up to you, but as a smoker, you will prob regret it later in life. I have been smoking since I was 12, I am 25 now and have been struggling to stop for years. So I would say no. If I could turn back time I would never have started.

No! My mum said it was the biggest mistake she ever made in her life!
Plus its very expensive.
If you are around smokers just think of all the money it will end up costing you if you do start. Wouldn't you rather spend that money on something else like clothes, going to concerts, going on nights out things like that.
I know your only 15 now,and its not something you'll be thinking about,but smoking is seriously bad for your health.You know if you do start that in a few years you'll struggle to do things you take for granted now,like running around without getting out of breath.
I hope this helped.
Don't start please for your own good.

almost an invalid,  hardly do anything without getting out of breath.  Walk about 10 yards, Crawled up the stairs.

It is part and parcel of how you are wired together.  It's supposed to feel pleasant to relieve the bladder pressure, and some folks do seem to get a bit more bang for the buck.  There is a certain portion of the people who do get a charge from going to the bathroom.  It's something we learn as babies, and probably just sticks with us as we grow up.  Nerves in the area are wired in bundles, and stimulating one area will often stir up others.  It's not weird at all, though perhaps just not one folks mention a lot.  I think fellows are more likely to really get a jolt from it, as I notice guys seem really satisfied after that first morning trip- even in the hospital setting, they always seem to sigh and I don't think it's all in relief, if you get the drift.  I shouldn't think it was a major problem, though- and not something you would want to fix really.

yeah i got it my dr recommend it. have you ever had a rubella needle, it kinda feels like that. it hurts,and the muscle around it hurts for a couple days but its worth it.
you have to get three all up. after the first i think it was 2 months later you get another,and then 4 months later.and then thats it, but you have to get all three for it to work.

the problem with the shot, is it tends to force weight gain. my friend was on it and gained quite a bit of weight. there is the pill, the thing they stick inside her, she could get her tubes tied, you could get cleaned out. it all depends on what sounds good

1. Getting on birth control should help her periods be more normal because they will help even out her hormones.
2. Seasonale gives women 4 periods a year. Instead of taking the sugar pills that are in most birth control packs you just skip them and go straight to the hormones for 3 months straight. I would be kind of wary of this though, since I think having your period is natural and cleans out your uterus. Also, people have had spotty bleeding on forms of birth control (including the shot) that get rid of the period.



3. I would recommend Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. It has a lower dose of hormones but still protects against pregnancy. A lower dose of hormones means less bad symptoms like bloating, weight gain, tender boobies, excess irritability, etc.

The Depo shot is not for everyone...it was horrible for me. I had bleeding and cramps and migranes for about 3 months straight (about as long as it lasts). I now have the Mirena IUD and it's been awesome! About two months after I got it, I stopped having my period, no monthly cramping, headaches, backaches, bloating, or pms!!! I've been sooo happy with this form of birth control. My husband and I had sex the very next night after I got it put in...and no unplanned pregnancy! One of the best parts is that it lasts for 5 years! And at any time, it can be taken out! Good luck with your search!

You can always try the Mirena IUD.



It's put in the uterus by a doctor, can be removed at any time and lasts 5 years. It reduces your menstrual flow by 90% and stops it in 20% of cases.



It has lower hormones and fewer side effects than the Depo Shot. A study found no increased risk of weight gain. Like Depo it is no maintenance.

I have the IUD and have had it for about 2 months and haven't had any problems with you. There's two you can choose from, paragard and mirena. I have the mirena. You have to go to a doctor where they will give her a pap smear and insert the IUD. Its good for 5-10 yrs but you can have it taken out ANYTIME. She doesn't have to remember to take a pill, wear a funny patch or get shot. Here's the website for more details...

Remember, that birth control effects every girl differently and you guys should do some research and talk to a gyno before making the decision, Good luck!!

I know a girl who has a flap over the hole of her vagina, is there anywhere I can find a picture for reference?



I ask this because I have never seen it and she said she has sex and I have to see a flapped over vagina to better understand how she could possibly have sex.  I don't know if she can lift it up or what and I am curious but can't ask her because if I get within 12 feet of her, I smell her unclean self and the fumes cause my brain cells to die.  The curiosity is killing me and if anyone knows where I can get a picture, I'd greatly appreciate it.
