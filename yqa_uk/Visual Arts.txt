Are you in college?  If so don't worry about it until the first day of class, because art classes cast a bundle.  Always have on hand a #2 pencil, but be prepared you may need a pencil set with the different shades. Ex. H, #2, #5, etc.  You could always e-mail your instructor and ask or ask at the book store.  Before you buy at the college book store check at the local arts and craft stores, sometimes they are a whole lot cheaper.  Consider a sketch book, but the instructor may want you to purchase a certain size or paper quality.  Good Luck You Will Do Fine!

It would be helpful if you had some ability, talent and a desire to art. It is a hard row to hoe to become famous or successful as a fine artist. It can be done but there are no guarantees.

if you're starting college then a range of pencils, oil pastels, paint brushes and soft pastels to start of with would be a good idea, go to an art shop and explain to the shopkeeper what your situation is and they should be able to help you out a bit, i wouldn't recommend buying a sketchbook just yet, lecturers often request a certain sized one for certain project,

Go to a craft store and get some thin but sturdy wire; shape them into wings and wrap some thin netting around them.  Then decorate the netting with some glitter or sequins.

moderately thick wire, like from a clothes hangar.  bend them into the shape you want.  cover them with coloured tights/pantyhose.  put a line of glue around the edges and trim off the excess bit of nylons.  spray with aerosol adhesive and add just the tiniest bit of glitter before it dries.attach some elastic to loop around your arms so it will hang off your back.

The very simplest way is to attach the fabric you are using to the centre back of the dress and then attach the ends of it to the wrists by means of elastic, in such a way that when the arms are raised the 'wings' are raised.  Hope this is understandable!

These are great sketches!  First, you have to realize that each artist has their own style.  Your second picture is very basic... yet your first picture shows us some form of style... one that could be representative of your artistic abilities.  Everything gets better with practice, so continue to work on it, and remember... most artists are never 100% happy with their work... they usually feel there is room for improvement... so draw what makes you happy and keep at it!  Good Luck.

Depends really, you need to keep at it all the time in order to improve, you can't stop when you think you've got it good or else you lose it! Takes you a while to get back into things and up above starts over again

What took me the longest to learn (and it's a matter of practice) is to draw what you "see"...sounds easy right? But it's not because we have all these preconcieved notions of how things look already in our minds. So we gravitate to draw according to that. For example...if you draw a face...you draw a sort of oval shape, two eyes on the top part, nose and mouth. But when you actually look at a person, really look, then you would see that the head is really a different shape, the eyes are more in the center and so on. 
Our teacher made us practice drawing without looking at the subject first...so you can "feel" every countour, every edge. In this stage it doesn't matter what it looks like. Focus on the pressure and line work....just practice and go from there..

If you continue to practice you will get better. Your drawings are already really good just



be careful about proportion. The first one looks like his ear is too high up and the second one needs the hips to be wider because the girl looks as though her shoulders are abnormally large.

Good attempt though!

Not bad for starters. Yes, you should get better by practicing and gaining more confidence in your abilities. Get your self some books on drawing, and also try drawing the models and other pictures in magazines. My younger sister does this constantly and she is excellent at portraits now.

Very good drawings! If you have taken Art as a GCSE subject, that will be a bonus as you will learn many skills. as you draw more and have learnt the skills you will become confident. This will start to show in your drawings!

Try taking a sketch book with you where ever you go, and make sketches of anything you see. This way, you will be more familiar with different angles, shadows, colours, patterns etc.



Maybe using different media to help you sketch and find out which one you feel most comfortable using. Maybe Charcoal or chalk might be beneficial. Also, try drawing on different materials; black card for instance, along with white chalk to give certain effects.

I would say your sketches are brilliant!  maybe you could add some shading/tone to your work to really bring your sketches to life.

Happy Drawing!

The first sketch shows you have good observation skills and i think, with practice, your drawing ability will improve. If you look at your subject as a 3 dimensional object and understand how parts of the body relate to one another considering their proportions and what is happening under the skin i.e. muscle/fat/bone structure, then your images will look more life like. As with most things, practice makes perfect and it does take time to develop good skills and create a style of drawing that you're comfortable with. If you want to concentrate on the human body, you could go to a museum like The British Museum in London and draw from the large collection of sculptures they have there.

Yes, but the safest way to deal with your images is to put them all on your computer as soon as you get back from shooting. ... then format the card to prevent any possible card corruption later.

If you just press the playback button on your camera you will see all the images on the card

It is a crime if it is done on public or private property which does not belong to the "artist".
The content may well have artistic merit but that does not mean the "artist" has the right to deface property which does not belong to them.

It's both.



Graffiti is vandalism because you're painting a design on something that you don't own, and somebody else paid for.  I mean, I'd be pretty pissed if I woke up one morning and somebody painted a big wildlife scene on my garage door complete with elk and pheasants.  I hate that kind of art!
If you work in "graffiti style" and you own the property then more power to you!
If the art itself is graffiti as vandalism as conceptual art - then do what you want as long and you're willing to take the risk.

<answer>



http://www.lms-patriot.org.uk/photos.htm...
top phot on that page is of 45509 in its unrebuilt form. This loco was never rebuilt with the Stanier 2A boiler and remained in this form until withdrawn. If by 'rebuilt' you are referring to the class's nominal status as rebuilds of scrapped 'Claughtons', this was never more than an accountant's paper excercise. Little or no material from the Claughtons would have been incorporated into 45509. The first two Patriots used wheel centres from scrapped Claughtons: these are indentifiable by their noticeably larger bosses.

Sure ... just remember to save the new image as a new file name so you do not overwrite the original file.

Next time you shoot through a window, either use a polarizing filter to reduce reflection or place the camera's lens directly on the glass.

I love the sky in that photo...very vivid.  Anyway, to answer your question, yes...you could photoshop it to clean up the whispy reflection.  It all depends on how much time and energy you want to invest into it.  Or you could just try taking the picture again.

The first thing that comes to my mind is a graphic-style piece, based around the kind of designs the previous poster mentions (The Who/Quadrophenia). You could look up 60's/ mod design on the internet and see if anything catches your eye. There are a variety of sources you could use for inspiration. If you're interested in music you could look at album covers of the period. If you're interested in fashion you could even extend the project to include textiles or something. Don't worry too much about sticking rigidly to the 'mods' theme, as the most important thing they'll be looking for is that you've used your creativity and really enjoyed working on the project. In my experience the most important thing is to show the development of your ideas.  Best of luck :)

If you can try to see the Who's film Quadrophenia.Mods were not necessarily better off than Rockers,they spent their money on clothes rather than bikes.Mod clothes were no more expensive than bike leathers, while scooters were cheaper than a good bike.I came from a rocker area but wore Mod clothes and rode a motor bike.

yes  ok  ..don't  know  if  this  will  help  ...mods  were  like  the  moshers  and  the  Ned's  ...as  in  semi  class  system



...sad  ain't  it  but  wat  comes  round  etc  . the  mods  were  like  the  better  off  kids  who  thought  they  had  it  made



..dressed  smart  had  latest  fashion  in  clothes  and  arrogance  ..well  that's  my  opinion  right  or  wrong  hope  it  helps

Be creative, and let your mind stem. Just start off with something random and create a masterpiece. Be completely unreal, like have an eye and have lines branching off with other random objects on it? It's all about what you want to draw. :]

cut out a paper frame and hold it up around the room and see if you can find a cool composition to try and draw. try something abstract... if you stink at drawing, it might be something you'd enjoy a  little more.

The proper name for this is Lampworking.  There is an article on Wikipedia which you will find interesting, and many good sites if you google 'lampworked glass' - try www.lampworkers.org  (this may not be the exact address, but it's something similar if not)

It would be best to try out some classes if there is any near you. Also there will be some equipment you will need to invest in, another thing you will need to remember is you will have to use compatible glass. If you use different glasses in the same piece there is a chance they will crack and break apart. I myself blow glass and if your interested in glass you should give this a go! It's a fantastic material to use, though blowing needs much more equipment, time and finishing. 
Get some books and contact some artist that use this technique and ask them some questions, I'm sure they would be happy to help. Some may offer you some experience if you did some volunteering for them!

Ok it depends on the size of the tattoo and the detail involved as well as the quality of the tattoo artist. Also I have found that the artists in larger cities tend to charge up to €40 more than those in smaller towns or cities eg. Kilkenny - where I live. I'm sorry to say there's nothing for it only to ask around.

Why dont you start by putting some of your photos on a website, or even begin your own website, see how much interest you get from that. Maybe try going into some art shops or shops that display photography and see what they think, ask them if they could tell you the best way of getting yourself out there, also find out about local exhibitions and try exhibit your work. Good luck!

Well Sophy, who knows what flies through the ether and rubs off on some of us. I think we all have psychic abilities, it's just that we never realise or attempt to hone them in some way.  You shouldn't be worried ..... you may have a marvellous gift ..... my advice is to simply keep cool about the whole thing, listen to your mind and heart at all times, and let your higher self guide you. IF you are indeed a natural psychic, time will unfold it all for you. In the meantime, simply read and research others and see what falls into place.  Good luck ...

This is in the wrong category, but I'll try to help.



I think it's a combination of your imagination and paranoia--to tell you the truth.  While you were at these places, did ANYTHING out of the ordinary happen?  I'm not saying I don't believe in spirits (because I really do), but all you've said is just baseless conjecture.  Have you found any information of the mentioned persons?  If you sensed that a spirit's name is Sarah London, and you uncovered records of her staying there at one point in time--then you could have something supernatural with you.  If not--well, you shouldn't jump the gun and trust everything your imagination conjures up.

There's a theory that excessive electromagnetic fields are responsible for the paranoia and the sense that you're being watched.

From reading that it does sound like you have some medium ability! Now though you have to decide whether you would like to use it or not? Do you believe strongly enough that you can do it? I have the same sort of thing, but stopped talking to them as I couldn't 'hear' any specific details to questions I asked! I would like to try again myself! A good way to see if you can do this properly is if your parents or friend has anyone close to them that's passed away (as long as they're not too emotional about it) and try to ask the spirit (I don't like the term ghost personally) something which only that person and your parent/friend would know! If you can get the right answer then you can do it properly!

No one particular place,charity shops are OK ,sometimes, as are flea markets. You visit them regularly and some times you get lucky.I went to a new town in West Yorkshire today and picked up an old brass jam kettle for a very good price. It's the joy of the hunt that matter.

It really depends on how much pain you can tolerate and where you get the tattoo. Here is a site I found useful...

http://tattoo.about.com/cs/pafterabvneck...

And a little sample from the site...
"Comparisons
It's true that everyone has a different threshold of pain. What one person considers not painful at all could be devastating to another. Some people describe the feeling as a "hot scratch". Some have said it was "annoying". Most say it was not nearly as bad as they feared. But there is a little more than pain alone to consider when getting a tattoo. "

They are painful but a lot of people like the pain (weird), and say they are addicted to it.  One of my friends calls it an adrenaline rush...Getting the tattoo is not the worst part of it though...it is getting one in the wrong spot or getting a design you decided you hate in a year.  Or, getting one on your shoulder and deciding 3 years down the road that your getting married, but you can't wear that strapless wedding dress without having to show your tattoo....so you have to go with the dress you really didn't want...lol (my experience)  I have 10 of them, in different areas all over and I regret every single one of them....they were years ago...and for what?  That is what I ask myself now!  Good luck

i've got three tattoos,and if they were that painfull i would'nt of gone back the second and third time. It all depends on where you get them, the more bony ( ankle,hip, spine, shoulder) the more painfull it will be, but after a while the area will go tingly and all you will feel is the tattooing impliment vibrating and a slight nip now and again. You can always ask for the local anaesthetic spray they use for piercings to be used to numb the area.It also depends on how much outlining there is to be done and how much dark colour there is, as outlining uses a thicker needle and the darker the ink, the more painfull it will be.

i have 2 tattoos 
its like a cat scratch but it also depends where on your body you have it done.
the adreniline takes away most of the pain and you also get used to it after a few minutes.
i think the noise of the needles can make it more scary you expect it to be painful. 
the outlines were worse than the colouring

they all hurt very badly...and can get infected. you could loose a limb over it. or your skin could slough off on and around it and you'd have a huge open sore there for the rest of you miserable little life and get staph and gangreen and lockjaw and die a horrible death.
besides if your mother finds out she'll skin you and the tatoo artist alive (NEVER underestimate the wrath of a mother when her kid gets a tatoo)

The main thing is:-  Is the picture of sufficient quality to enlarge to the size that you eventually decide?

If it has been taken at low/medium resolution, there's no way it would enlarge.

If the picture is suitable why not print it yourself on a good quality printer, using good photo paper?

Dependent on the subject of the picture, A4 is probably suitable but for a larger picture (A3) you would have to get it printed commercially but the original will have to be fairly large.

There are plenty of places that allow to send your photo on internet and print them for you (Target amongst others), for the list just follow this link:
http://www.google.com/search?q=+printing...

But make sure you send a very big picture otherwise the quality of the print may be disappointing. For example you could use high quality image enlargement before sending them, check this website for that:

standard quality for printed pictures is 300dpi (dots per inch)

make sure that your picture is at least this whatever the dimensions of it. You can boost the dpi on something like photoshop but only up to about double the original size without affecting the quality

If you print it yourself, you can make adjustments in terms of contrast, tone etc to your taste - all this assumes that you have a photo manipulation programme of some sort and know how to operate it.

Botticelli, Murillo, Giacomo Brogi, Picture?, Photo? Reproduction? Copy?



Can someone tell me how many cherubs there are in the original painting called the Immaculate Conception of De Soult by  Murillo?  Did they make reproductions of their original paintings  on some kind of board? or panel ? This picture is 4 feet by 4 feet and has 32 cherubs.
Is there anyone out there that would know if the original painting done by Sandro Botticelli called the La Madonna del Magnificat has encrypted letters A f B in the arm of the Angel on the right? Could it be possible that if a photographer took a picture of this painting that these letters would appear? Did the photographer's by any chance keep a record of who might have purchased their photo's? Anyone ever heard of Giacomo Brogi? This picture is on some kind of Linen cloth? there's a label on back of this picture
2658
La Madonna del Magnificat
Sondro Botticelli
Galleria Uffizi -Firenze

I think I could see the La Madonna del Magnificent has encrypted letters A f B in the arm of the Angel on the left, also if you view the picture from this link:  www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/...



The right arm of angel on the right looks cleaner than of the angel on the left, this is the reason.

Also for the original painting called the Immaculate Conception of De Soult by Bartholome Esteban Murillo the link is here: http://www.catholictradition.org/Mary/ga...

I can make out that are 31 cherub faces (one shows only top half of its forehead!) in the painting.

Giacomo Brogi (1822 - 1881) was an Italian photographer.

http://www.gruppometa.it/verdi/en/photo/...
Giacomo Brogi was born on 6 April 1822 and died on 29 November 1881. He started working on photography in 1856. He created his first studio in Corso Tintori, in Rome in 1864. He began traveling around Italy and later traveled to the Middle East in 1868 including Palestine, Egypt and Syria. Brogi was associated with the Photographic Society of Italy. He held studios in:
•	Florence. Via Tornabuoni 1. 
•	Napoli. Via Chiatamone 19 bis. 
•	Roma. Via del Corso 419. 
After death, his son Carlo continued his photographic work.

Psychological Meaning: The eagle is a powerful bird that may represent a powerful intellectual or spiritual abilities. For a Christian it may represent John the Evangelist and for an American it may be a symbol of your country.

Mystical Meaning: Early man considered eagles to be messengers from Sun god. In your dreams, it may be a messenger from your unconscious. Mythology often has stories of the eagle and the lion or the eagle and the snake. These stories are dream symbols that represent psychological opposites such as spiritual/animal, male/female, conscious/ unconscious and thought/instinct. Superstition says that to dream of an eagle is an omen for fame and fortune.

It looks Northern European,so I'd rule out Da Vinci and Botticelli.It is similar to Durer in some ways but the odd scale of the figures would rule him out too,although it is about his time.

None of the above.  It's an Italian Renaissance painting, which rules our Durer (German).  It's not in the style of Boticelli at all (he tended to emphasize a flat picture plane and stylized faces).  The faces don't look like da Vinci either.  I would guess another Italian Renaissance painter, maybe Tintoretto?

How Can I Find Out What The Top 10 Universites Are To Study Photography In The UK?



Everyone knows that Oxford and Cambridge are the best accademic universities in England but how can I get a shorttlist together of the best universities in creative arts?  By best I mean their results are in the top 10 of the league tables or the name alone is recognised as one of the best places to study.  I'd really appreciate your help because it's talking to others that is going to give me this info rather than Google.

I can't really recommend you any Universities, as I haven't been. I'm off to Uni next year, and like you I want to study Photography! I can only tell you the Universities that I have been looking at and they are:
- Southampton Solent University
- Kingston University
- Roehampton University (Photography is offered as a combined honours only here)
- Northampton University
- Hertfordshire University
- Middlesex University
- University of East London

I'm still looking around for different Universities that offer Photography courses.

It's going to be really hard to find league tables which show the top10 uni's for Photography courses. However, I am aware of some universities that are known to do exceptionally well in the creative arts sector- these are:

*Kingston University
*University of the Arts London- 1.London College of Communication



2.Camberwell College of Art



3.Chelsea College of Art



4.Wimbledon College of Art



5.London College of Fashion
*Westminister University
*University of the creative Arts (there is one in Epsom, and this is a fairly new university)

Colleges and universities offer many different courses within your desired discipline. Only by studying their prospectuses can you know where their specialisms lie.The town or city also has a lot to do with your choice,as the cost of living in,for example London can be very high,despite the obvious advantages of a London College.What is an obvious best choice for one person may not suit another.Photographic courses extend beyond the Creative Arts,it all depends what you want to achieve within the medium.Some courses may include Film,whereas others may have an emphasis towards Fashion,or Natural History.Explore as many courses as you can through their web sites and narrow your list to places as well as courses.

The Magi is the name for the Three Wise Men who travelled from the East following the Star of Bethlehem to where the baby Jesus was. The adoration part is them worshiping the Christ child as they knew he was the Messiah.I don't know what you would consider it being
famous for except that it is a very well known Renaissance painting and the painter depicted his patron Cosmo Medici and his family as part of the crowd.

Many people will tell you it's not. There seems to be this common misconception that people in creative professions hang around in brightly-colored offices and play all day. It's definitely a fun line of work, but it is also very challenging, highly competitive, and intensely deadline-driven - alll of which make it stressful at times.

If you are thinking about beginning a career in graphic design and would like to ask more questions, feel free to email me anytime: elblock@email.com.

Sure, you're only as finished as your next project. No time to relax-- get to work whether you feel like it or not. Hurry up and produce more!
Rush-- rush,  more deadlines to make or break you. But if you're good-- the money is great.

I really don't know the answer to this but I want to make a remark (:

Graphic design is a hot field right now!
I've looked into it (I'm in highschool)
It looks like loads of 'fun' if you're good at it.
Though, I'm probably going into computer engineering.
Maybe some graphic designing on the side.

It sounds like an edition was created by a printing company. In the time this was created an edition of engravings from famous art works were ways of making reproductions commercially. Images were not a easily reproduced, in the way we have photography and all the printed newspapers and magazines, with large circulation, today. 
It depends on who the printing company was, and if they are sought after, how many in the edition of prints, the quality, also how popular the image is.
The links below include info on your print. Check the print maker stated on your print. If it is Robert Sayer, as mentioned in the link about this image, he worked in London.(1725-1794)
Another way to check he going price is to search online print auctions for that title, artist, or name.
I hope the links below help.

You might want to use a watermark so it shows on top of your images such as a @ symbol or your website or business name.
Other than that when you import the images (I use photomechanic) add the copyright to the IPTC
Hope this helps.

Don't know how it is in the UK, but in the States, copyright is assumed at the time of creation. My D40 has the ability to implant my copyright info. I also keep the original files, in case a question of copyright infringement should arise. You can also imprint your own copyright text onto your images before posting, or use digital watermarking like Digimarc.

Just an FYI, even with copyrighted images, anything you post on the internet can (and likely will) be used by somebody somewhere without your knowledge. Copyrighting hardly stops anyone from using stuff they find on the web (just being realistic here). A better deterrent is to make any photos you post very low resolution and small in pixel dimension before you post them. That way, at least they can not be used for commercial print processes.

In all of Europe and the US, copyright exists the moment you make something original, so you don't need to treat copyright like a patent.

The problem is when someone rips you off and then you have to prove that the copyright was yours and not someone elses. People used to mail themselves a copy of the photo and leave it unopened, but that wouldn't work now as it's too easy to forge the postmark.

Now if you have digital versions of your photos, you can upload them to a special webpage and they fingerprint them and record the time you uploaded. This means that you have an independent record showing when you made it. No one will be able to argue with that! :)

I use a service called http://www.provemycopyright.com because you get 1Gb of space to upload lots of photoes.



Watermarking them would also be a good idea, but people can take the watermark off and it doesn't INDEPENDANTLY show the time that you originally made it.

Hope it helps

Well when annotating....

Use allot of adjectives.

Always describe how you feel and associate the emotion with the style and the color. e.g whether painting brings excitement, love, passion, energy, happiness and sadness.

Describe the use of colors, e.g weather they are complimentary colors, natural colors, Neutral colors, secondary colors and primary colors and how they could relate with the mood.

Describe the use of style, weather if its marks, dots, etc.

Describe the tonal qualities, which could be tone, texture,etc

And also describe weather if looks flat or dimensional.

With all these try and associate the feelings and moods.

the top three are pretty good (maybe the woman not so), the rest on that page look poorly worked out, even like drawn by a different person (body posture of characters in general stiff, not natural. 
Generally work on your shading and observation of nature.



I really like your Mr Bean drawing, I don't think the likeness is perfect, but I love the facial expression. You also seem to have taken most trouble with the shading. I think you are not really aware what you see, so you are pretty good in drawing from photographs, but not very good in drawing things from your mind. I would recommend as a next step to practice at least sometimes drawing still lives from real objects, not from photographs. That will teach you to see what's there and not what your brain tells you ought to be there. Pay attention to how the light values of a 3D object translates onto a 2D page and use this learning experience to draw things from your mind. Or draw hands, feet, faces over and over again until you really know how they look like. I think you can be really good if you practice enough and take enough effort with it.

Your drawings show you are very very talented. 
I especially like the picture of Johnny Depp, Beyonce' Knowles and Mr. Bean.
However some of the drawings seem better than others for example : it seems you spent alot of time on the top 3, yet the second row doesn't look like you put as much effort in.
Namingly because the piece named  -  Experiment with Body Poses inspired by a scene in Issue 3 of Genetics (The Possible Name for My Manga)  -  the bed sheets look poorly tended to, like you scribbled through.
I like the boldness of your work, but on some of the portraits you have drawn the nose or the eyes with big black outlines, and that makes it less realistic, there is also less tones to show emotions or more shape of the face.

On the whole, you are talented, maybe a bit more care with your Manga. (:

Hi Ash

Photography is an art that demands having a creative mind, imagination, and spur of the moment.
Sense of color, cropping, and composition is all you need. Its not the amount of pics you take that count but the quality. It is better to take less pictures that have more meaning than to take umpteen that end up in the garbage.

The lens of the camera is your eye. Always try to convey what you were thinking at the time of the shoot. This way the viewer can grasp what you were thinking at that moment in time.

Most people are good photographers...they just don't know it.



I'm just about to start my second year in A Level Photography. I had no idea about how to take a good photograph, or that I had an interest in it (obviously I had a slight interest in it in order for me to take it up as a course). After the first year, I have developed a passion for this subject. I turned out to be a good photographer...I uncovered a talent I didn't know I had.



I didn't look at things like a photographer would..but now I have adapted that trait into my photography and how I approach a subject. Doing a course in it will open your eyes a lot more, and generally tell you how to take a good photograph. With good practise and a lot of enthusiasm, you could turn out to be great!



Learning about photography will make you appreciate it a lot more. It's very easy to do, and everyone practises taking photographs all the time. A little bit more knowledge will take you a long way in Photography.

So the answer to your question is yes. You can learn to be a good photographer, but most of the time it is down to natural talents that are hidden. And yes, if you do a course, you will learn a lot more which will overall make you better.

If you would like to know anything else on photography please email me :)

Learning technique, how to use equipment, and composition is certainly possible. Ideally by taking classes, but also by reading books, studying images, and practice, practice, practice.

Learning to THINK like a photographer?  I'm not so sure that can be taught.

And the ability to SEE photographically?  Well, to a certain extent it comes with practice.



But I think there's also an innate sense of things (I don't know how else to describe it) that you either have or you don't.

Perhaps you'll know you've reached that point when you realize you never go anywhere without a camera, that you see every element of life and space around you as a potential photograph, and that you're driving everyone around you crazy with your compulsive behavior.

You can learn be a technicaly good photographer, you can learn all there is to know about lighting, filters processing, printing, etc, etc.

But I suspect that what you mean, by "Good Photographer", is artistic talent, and that is something that you have, or don't have.

I don't have.

I have been trying for sixty years to be a "Good Photographer".

You frame/take the picture, and I can do just about anything you want with it. But I can't take the picture my self.

No artistic talent. (:-(

I think it's a combination of both. The best photographers are able to see a photo before they even have a camera in their hands - that's just raw talent. They're similar to great painters and other visual artists in that way. The mid-range/good photographers can learn what makes a good image, and then replicate it with success on their own - that's really only a bit of original talent combined with education. I think most professional photographers fit in this category.

And obviously, the technical aspects of photography need to be learned. I can't think of anyone that was born knowing how to operate a camera or develop film.

It all depends on your NATURAL creative abilities and 'eye' for art. U can go to photography school and still NOT have an 'eye' for what might be a good photograph. Most of it must 'flow' within U, but with dedication and practice you can become good at ur game!!!!

Yes and no.

Photography is first and foremost an art form. Just like painting, or singing, or playing guitar. It takes some natural talent.



But anybody can learn things that make them a better photographer. There are photography magazines you can buy, literally hundreds of books, and many websites that offer help. And of course you can take photography classes.

But you will almost always find that the best photographers were quite talented before they became serious about their craft. Then through practice, experience and maybe schooling they refined their craft.

Nobody can decide for you if you have the talent and I certainly do not want to discourage you. Photography is fun no matter how serious you are with it and it is all the more enjoyable now with the rise of digital cameras. In the old days you had to shoot lots of film and have lots of images printed, which took time and cost money on top of the camera outfit you had to buy. Now with a good digital camera and a computer you get instant results and can simply delete the bad pictures--but not before you learn from the mistakes.

Good luck, God bless, and happy shooting.

Absolutely.  Spend time learning how your camera works, and reading about photography technique (so you don't have to figure out everything from scratch) but spend most of your time just taking pictures.  It is a skill that anyone can pick up and no one can perfect, so it is an ideal lifelong hobby.  Have fun!

but if you just go into a word document on your comp. go into insert, then picture from file. then just pick the foto you want to insert and copy and paste it into your paint program. from there you can do almost anything with your foto. you can insert any glittery writing you want. i do this all the time, sometimes its better than using sites actually made for it. hope iv helped.

Great stuff! Remember to fix her index finger so it isn't so fat on the end. Line values are good - lots of accuracy in them. The second drawing - just a suggestion - create a little more separation between main subject values and your background. I think some artists just let the background go totally white as it nears the front figure, to indicate a little separation between the two - a kind of dynamic tension results, giving the drawing more impact.

Your work is excellent. Do not take my words as criticism because they are not that. Your work is excellent and you have great accuracy in your line values. I hope you will continue to pursue this ability of yours, even if it may not be your primary livelihood, to my mind, it surely shows the substantial gift you have as an artist.

Hope you continue to make contributions of this sort, as you are clearly highly gifted and skilled not just in presentation, but in choice of how you arrange your subject matter.

Take good care now, and thank you for reading my comments. From Chris in South Portland, Maine, U.S.A. I am 65, and I was a perfectionist when I did black and white portraiture. It was relentless, and so was I - ! Have a great summer, now!  - Chris.

Before you think about jetting off to the slums..maybe you should try closer to home. London is home to some fantastic graffitti...how about takin a walk down the south bank and having a look you may even catch someone adding to there creation, which may be handy to your project...
or maybe even try the local colleges and universities..for candidates..many people there who are taking art or design may have hidden talents when it comes to graffitti.. if all else fails...you could also look into different shops that do graffitti designs on clothing, one place i know is a small shop inside the 'Tramms Center' in croydon jus before the Tram stop, they produce t-shirts using spray paint and have a nik at graffitti designs and i'm sure for a small fee would be happy to help...

awh...hunny!:(
what you need is confidence!
a photo is a photo!
if you have your own digital camera you could practice different poses and smiles!
such as:
1.See which side you look best on!
2.Practice smiles showing teeth, just a little smile without showing teeth, flashing your cheekbones....etc!

The camera hates no one!
Its the person who hates themselves!which is not good!:(

if this is really annoying you then you could even try out uncomfortable smiles!you could be suprised!:)

Don't worry....I bet your very photogenic.:)

When everyone smiles, there cheeks get big, there chin gets more curvy. Before picture day for me i stand in front of the mirror, you can always have a couple of smiles, a fake one, a closed one, one that shows your teeth, or maybe a smile off to the side. I bet you are photogenic, just keep practicing you'll get the perfect one, OH, and fake laugh, and keep your mouth open, and put your teeth together.
Most of the time it works.

Try having photos taken from slightly to the side. I always seem to turn my head to the right in pictures. Try different sorts of smiles in the mirror, then see what they look like when you take a picture of it. also try your pictures with and without flash, black and white, colour, sepia, negative, etc. all these small things make a difference.

Collect the information you need online and make your own portfolio.

You can't download everything, you know. You have to actually do some work on occasion in order to learn something.

I'm most likely going to invest in this tent and some studio lighting for photographing children. I'm assuming a light tent isn't necessarily the best option for this but for what I want to do it is farrrr more convenient!

I have no idea what sort of lights or how many of them to get to achieve even lighting throughout. I'm on a bit of a budget so just need something that does the job efficiently really. If you have any links or examples that'd be awesome.

Thanks :)

light tent for people? - make difussing screens, then place them infrount of the lights

even lighting? -for people? generally one tries to create shadow and depth with uneven lighting, shadow and depth makes a person look more 3d and less flat

get 3 flashes and then study lighting

EDIT: looked at your link, you intend to fit people in that tiny tent?

use grease proof paper and build some screens, they are bigger and you can move then around and change the amount of difussion, if you intend to shoot people get a white,black,gold and silver reflector

You should take a look at studiolighting.net and especially listen to their podcasts.

That light tent looks pretty small—better for taking pictures of products. (You put the object inside and your lights outside.)

What you probably want to start with is a strobe (or a flash you can fire off-camera {see http://photography-on-the.net/forum/show... }) and a softbox and a couple of reflector panels.  Once you have a strobe or two, you can start to get creative—diffusers and light modifiers are great for making light interesting.  These can be either things you buy, or things you make yourself.  I was doing a shoot the other day and found one slave strobe was too strong, so I diffused it by covering it with a crumpled white plastic bag.  You can make a strobe more focused by sticking a tube of cardboard on the front. If you want your light to look like daylight, put a flash behind a plant, to get dappled, leafy light, any time you want. Want a reflector umbrella?  Any old umbrella will do, if you have some white or silver paint. Reflector panels? Pieces of big, white foam core...

I was amazed to hear in that podcast how many professional photographers said they bought most of their lighting gear at Home Depot, too.

The main thing is, get creative and don't be afraid to try anything to get a nice effect.



Shoot in RAW mode, so that you can adjust white balance later and be sure to check your pictures on the computer while the model is still there.  Very often I'll find that the exposure is too dark or too bright, or that there is an unattractive shadow around the eyes or nose.  Check for that and re-shoot!

Get yourself a book of Essay Marks,which lists the quality of silver,its city of manufacture and it will have the year marks as well.
Other than that the only other thing I could suggest would be to read up about the items your buying or selling.
Most dealers are pretty honest,being highly regulated make sure you get a reciept.

Dealers by definition ( and by my personal knowledge of quite a few of them...) are not the people to expect to be totally honest. 
They are in business, right? And, generally speaking, their way of thinking is: Too bad for you if you are not aware of the value of what you bring to them. 
Also, be aware that if you live in a small place you stand a much bigger chance of being offered a  lower price than the one you would fetch in a big city.



Stamp marks identify silver.
They are different for every provenance, ( place of origin ), century and maker.
Sometimes they might be hard to read the, though, as they might be worn out by usage.

As auction houses usually provide a free value assessment, I would recommend you try them.

I would not touch Ebay until you have a better idea of what your objects are really worth.

Also, I would not sell them now unless you really need to.

It is probably best to keep them for when silver' prices are not as low as they are now.

Hope this is helpful. Obviously you have a good eye, so keep scouring boot sales and who knows...you might become a dealer too!

Best of luck

DeviantArt is a huge online community, where many choose to sell work. Go their and check out the sort of photography people are selling, and compare to yours to see if you think its good enough.



Also the site is good for getting feedback about your photos, as someone will usually leave a comment about your work, and you can use this to see how your pictures are portrayed.

there are varius places to sell postcard/calender shots but there are guidelines.  for instance publishers wont use work that is short with less than 5MGP, it may even be higher than that now.



maybe try a competition to get your work seen about, then it will be easier to get a publisher to use your work. this is a good one.  http://www.tpoty.com/
otherwise you could just sell them yourself on ebay, frame some up and advertise.

I would have to go with the second one because the contrast is much better.  To be honest, the selective coloring completely ruins the picture.  Either keep the whole thing in color or B&W.

It's personal preference really but I honestly prefer the second shot with more contrast.  It provides a much more punchier image against the strong use of red.

Neither!

You have not adjusted the black and white area sufficiently to compete with the over saturated colour area.

The eye goes automatically to the RED part of the photograph.

I do think the idea is great though!

Personally I really wouldn't get a Tattoo of THFC, doesn't matter if there your life as they're just a football team. The way its worded wouldn't look very good, i wouldn't even get the crest, or Tottenham tattoo like that, maybe Tottenham as a place if you was born there. I would get a image that represents Tottenham well, over than that they just look tacky and are way too common, my brother who's a tattooist hates doing them because you get so many wanting them.

Why don't you look at different surfaces and then get material to represent them, cover a small piece of a similar surface with that material and then sew them together like a patch work quilt?
For example....
Table - get some wood, cover it with brown material maybe decorated to look like wood.
Marbe - get a rock, cover it with material that looks like marble.

Or....you could make a textile house - like surfaces made out of material - sew a table, chairs etc.

what a great thing for coursework!! be totally out of this world... no idea is too crazy for fashion. if anything, the more different, the better! write a list of as many different types of surfaces you can think of, and really go for it... bricks, carpet, stone, the lot! then write a list of all the items you are able... and willing to make. mix and match the surfaces with the item, and one is bound to stand out.then somehow whther its the material you use, of the pattern you choose, just add in this 'surface' remember it doesnt have to completly cover the item. but still needs to show it off.... ill be interested to know what you make!
Good luck!

Texture.
This can mean anything and everything. Try multi layers of paints. Acrylics and PVA glue would be the best way to start, as is quick drying.
Start with something simple, abstractive on a decent sheet of paper.
Don't just do one, do as many as you can. It is remarkably quick and enjoyable. Then you can build up many differing styles of textures with either the paint alone, or mix with different materials. This means again, anything. . sand, shells, straw, bits of cloth. . anything.
Think about the beauty and Aesthetics of the forms and colors of said Works, and you should be well away.
Get stuck in, nothing is easy to begin with.
Let us all know how you fare with this task.

Devongod has a great idea there about the seas.



Make a textile painting on wood or hard cardboard.  You could outline in pencil a scene of the sea with the shoreline and then use shiny blues of various hues for the sea. Put some gossimer see-through fabrics in with the blue for effect and more detail. Bend the fabric to make waves and glue it down on the edges. Larger waves at the shore line crashing. For the sand use nubby type of fabric in brown or beige like the sand so you could feel the texture of it if you ran your hands over it.  Use multi-coloured smooth in browns and beiges to form rocks on the shoreline. Fold them so some are rounded and oblong and glue them along the shore.  Use some leather to create a waterlogged branch on the shore and some chenille to make the wings of a stylized bird in flight.  Just some wings and a basic body. You don't have to be a good artist to do this.  This folding of the fabric and placement will create the scene.



Make it more horizontal than vertical for interest and incorporate as many different types of textures as you can find .  I think that is the object of the project.  Get as many swatches as you can at the local textile store.  Have fun with it.

If it were me, I would think about the surface of the Earth, and how it is being polluted. You could make shoes or a table cloth of something based upon the idea of the surface of the Earth being polluted and make it out of rubbish, and recycled clothes.

Some people say "on the surface he is....., but really he is......" and you could make something about this, people being superficial, or about how people portray themselves a certain way.

You could make a quilt- to symbolise the layers people wrap themselves in

a purse, bag, Poncho, scarf, hat or maybe a childrens cuddly toy

I highly recommend the book "Photo portfolio success," by John Kaplan. It can definitely answer your question and more. I've read the book three times now it's so informative. The book will tell you everything you need to know about choosing your photographs, basic placements of the photographs, ect. Pretty much anything presentation related.

Here's some tips in case you don't purchase the book: 
1.Choose only your absolute best photographs.
2.Categorize them according to subject.
3.Your portfolio should only be one subject. Example: Nature. Then take a variety of photographs consisting of nature.



A portfolio should be minimum of 10 photographs. Most companies want less than 20.

You can buy a Portfolio Binder at any arts store. They range from $10-200+. Before purchasing the binder though, you need to decide what is going into it.

15-20. And NO RUBBISH ! Don't be tempted to 
"make up the numbers" with sub-standard images. Better to have one less, rather than 19 good ones and one that detracts from the rest of your work.

I don't think there is a clear set established for a portfolio.  You should showcase your best pictures and your portfolio could be 10 or a 100 pictures.
What I did is create a 20 page photo book from Costco and placed several pictures some full page, some collages, etc

If we have the right Bill Tipton, try this page as well which has quite a lot of information about him, it's the media package about his exhibition at Ouray:
http://www.ouraycountyhistoricalsociety....
I suspect that he is represented by a gallery which is why he is harder to find in a search than if he had his own website.

Maybe the material is designed for a 100% cotton shirt and maybe you are using a polyester blend.

Sounds awesome! U can paint a pic of the band in vibrant colors (red, blue, green, yellow, etc.) of them posing for a cd cover or of them playing their instruments. Be sure to have an awesome perspective of them ;)



U don't even have to paint them. U can color them in with color pencils or u can shade them in pencil then go over it again in ball point pen ;)
Have fun!

Incorporating technology into art?



i'm doing my higher art design unit and i have chosen to create a shoe for my final piece.



After helpful answers from another question i posted, i think i may create this shoe based on the theme of Pop Art and use the style of artists like Andy Warhol in my design.

I was trying to think of what to incorporate into the shoe based on this and one idea is technology as it is something which is a big part of culture today and has a massive influence worldwide, linking in with the definition of Pop Art.



How could i integrate technology into my shoe design? or what other ideas from Pop Art could i include? thanks, any help appreciated:)

When I did graphic art, my lecturer told me one important bit of advice.. Technology always comes last; a great idea comes first. Before you jump in with being pressured for 'modern' themes, pick something more personal; something you're strong with. Surprise the examiners... I did, and got an A-A!

Incorporate some low power LED lights into the shoe.  Take it a step farther than those kid's shoes with the flashing "strobe" lights and make an LED screen image on the shoe's open surfaces.  If you can be even more techie, design it so that the image can change, like those LED displays on signs.

You can make, either, images, or scrolling messages. And, by "something personal," you can have these graphics make a statement that is meaningful to YOU.  Something as simple as "Hi mom!" to a statement about man's inhumanity to other creatures.  The point being that, your art says something about you.

you will need to get a program called flash, that is a animation program, but it costs £500 you would need to get a keygen for it and they are ileagal and can carry a virus.

Try Xara Xtreme, it's a very useful program which lets you animate pictures into an animated GIF. They have a free trial download at www.xaraxtreme.com, plus tutorials.

If you want a movie file, try Windows Movie Maker, but it's kinda rubbish as a program. If you have a Mac, I'm afraid I don't know the exact program but there's probably a Movie Maker equivalent.

Good luck with the animations! :-)

Get some animation software. It lets you make a .GIF image by putting the pictures together. It doesn't matter what kind you get but be VERY careful if you download anything off the internet. I advise you not to at all. You might get a virus.

Has the ribbon on the wedding invitation in this link been made from a basic satin ribbon, or do you purchase the ribbons in this way?

You can purchase ribbons that way or you can make them.

To make them can be complicated depending on what you do. I think the simplest way which I've used before is just to layer the ribbon to get that tiered effect. Then, staple it down and wrap a small piece of ribbon around it to cover that middle part (with the staple or whatever you choose to use). That should do the trick. Make sure you get ribbon that's soft so it doesn't leave fold marks, etc.

PLEASE ANSWER (OR TRY TO ANSWER) THIS!!!!!!!!!?



I have asked this question twice already, with hardly any responses (3). My my art coursework I need to create a large textiles mural sort of thing which combines aboriginal and urban culture. I really need some ideas, because I have already wasted my time with it, as I had started, found it looked awful and am starting again. The canvas is a large square with bricks printed onto the top right hand corner and the bottom left hand corner. I also have a banksy figure on the bottom corner.
I need any ideas you can give me, ANY IDEAS PLEASE!!!!!

There are many beautiful patterns in Aboriginal art see, eg. http://www.aboriginalartstore.com.au/?g=...
Why don't you fill the whole space of your canvas with different patterns but leave a large sprawling area empty at the centre of yur canvas. Here one could put in buildings representing a modern city - e.g. high rise buildings, streets with cars. You could depict this built up area in such a way that the viewer gets the impression that a modern city is  gradually swallowing up land which was once the home of Aboriginees. (Land represented by their traditional patterns). 
I am not sure how the  banksy figure which you have already put in to your mural relates to this idea. But perhaps you can think of something, or else remove it completely.

I think I need to point out that this is YOUR coursework and by this time will have been attending lectures and should know how to find the answer yourself.
I mean it is all there, but YOU have to put the work in.
Just research and combine aboriginal and urban culture and guess what... put it onto a large textile mural!
You can do it, just put the blinking effort in and stop asking others.

By aboriginal do you mean native Australian or just native?

If native Australian the things most instantly recognisable are Ayer's Rock, I know but I have forgotten, and the boomerang and the didgereedoo.

Urban well bricks and mortar, buses and cars.

You could try an Ayer's Rock roundabout, with buses and cars whizzing around it.

Experience the beauty and wonder of the talent of these visual artists.



This Visual/Media Arts Showcase includes a virtual re-creation of some of our favourite exhibitions from over the years that were curated from the Saskatchewan Arts Board's permanent collection. Come on  take a look , and enjoy.



The colonization of Canada dramatically changed the lives of First Nations people. Europeans brought with them diseases of small pox, tuberculosis, and influenzas to which Indian people had no immunities. Native people were pushed from their lands and forced to relocate on reserves in order to make way for European settlers. Missionaries came to convert the Indians to their Christian religions. Native ceremonies were prohibited and paraphernalia were confiscated by authorities. The Canadian Government forced Native children to attend residential schools and speak languages that were foreign languages. Colonization and the "Doctrine of Discovery" resulted in similar consequences for indigenous people around the world.



At a later date the development of new technologies and mass media created new problems. Photographs, books and movies portrayed Indians as hostile, savage, childlike and subservient - people who had to be conquered and controlled. Generations of Native people grew up surrounded by stereotypes and negative images of themselves.

1) Try using a polarizer to reduce the flare of the sun.
2) Pretty good shot, but looks a little pixelated. Wouldn't blow up well...
3) Too much flash. The highlights are blown out. Try bouncing the flash off something else.
4) Still too much flash. See how the King card is washed out?
5) I like this the best. However, a polarizer would reduce the flare, or you could step to the side slightly and just get the rays coming through the leaves instead of the flare...

Just some constructive thoughts... Hope it is what you're looking for. Anyone can say, "Nice job!" But I think your looking for ways to make it even BETTER...



Keep up the good work and practice, practice, practice!!  ;o)

I think it's impossible, because I try and think about colours and I can't imagine a new completely different one. Is it possible to think up a new colour without mixing others together? I mean a colour that isn't a something like new shade of purple because that's just normal. Everyone knows what purple looks like.

I used to think so, until a few years ago, a Volvo parked next to where I was working.  I realised it was a pastel shade somewhere near a certain shade of Caucasian skin, but couldn't think that I had ever seen it, or could describe it.  A poll of my co-workers had us all agreeing it was just like it was a brand new colour!  You couldnt call it beige, nor brown, nor pink, it just didn't fit anywhere!

Haha! Nobody "thought of the colour blue"!

The answer is a big NO - whatever Volvo you saw!

The complete colour spectrum is sunlight shining through a prism, see here: http://cache.eb.com/eb/image?id=44791&re...

Other shades are created simply by adding white (all colours) or black (the absence of colour) to a colour or a mix of colours from the spectrum.

Excellent question by the way!

Opinions on my photographs / website would be much appreciated



I have recently started building a website to put up some of my photos. I would class myself as an advanced beginner and have still much to learn. I would very much appreciate any comments about my photographs. Are there any you particularly liked or you felt were weak ?

Also, any comments on the general layout and design of the site would be very welcome too. I have tried to keep a simple clean layout.

Wow.  I have only two suggestions:
a) drop the 'advanced beginner'
b) I noticed some slowness loading the pictures.  I'm not sure if this because the files are too large or your bandwidth might be limited

Other than that everything seems top notch.  Site layout and photography quality is impressive

Mhmm, anything and everything is art, there are no limits.
Most who are snobby enough[no offense] to say otherwise aren't really true artists, simply close-minded and presumptuous.
And a response to the first, plenty of anime stuff has hell of a lot more depth than that.

I think it is.  But if it were done I would suggest them not doing fanart because you can't sell fanart.  It's against copyright laws and such. But if it were done from your own piece of manga, like for instance if the character was only done by the artist and no one else.

actually anime and manga are considered one kind of art. however, many people loves anime and manga to the point where they give limits and requirements on how anime and manga should look like. the most common idea is the "chibi" form of anime. many people will probably say the size of the body needs to be "three heads" tall. or the eyes need to be a certain look. so you can say anime and manga is art as long as you believe there are no limits to this kind of drawing.

There are several books out there about using photos as reference, but none specifically about portraits that I know of.  The best advice I can give her is to study up on what to avoid when using photos, how to reduce photographic distortion, and what photos can not be used due to copyright issues.



Three things about doing portraits from photos:

1.  Never use professional photographs.  The photographer holds the copyright  . . . and besides that, copying his work means the artist is not making any artistic or compositional decisions.  Not original!

2.  Use photos taken in natural light.  Flash photos are the pits when it comes to getting a likeness, getting values and shadows right that lend an image form and volume, and they flatten out the image!

3.  Do not copy the photo, but use it as a guide.



A good portrait has the life of both the artist and the sitter in it . . . copying will give you that, a copy in paint!  Make your portrait original and alive . . . once you have a basic sketch and values established, put the photo away until you are close to finishing.  and then use it only to fine tune highlights and details. . . .

Yes it would be still handy, and that if you know how creative your mother really was! She can work it if she had enough of skill to do so. It will be tough, where shes just beginnin to learn to paint, though I don't think so worry to it seem like she did well already.

Turn the photo upside down to copy it. Copying from photos gives you a fixed perspective so it is better really to work from life but as this is not always possible go for it but do not slavishly copy everything. Leave room for your own creativity and let the medium dictate finish or detail.

Will the photo people develop my negatives?



I got a roll of film developed in another country and instead of cutting the negatives and sealing it in plastic (like they do in the U.S.), they give you the whole roll of negative film. So my question is, if I take it to costco, will they be able to develop the film into prints or not? Thanks

Yes.  The process is the exactly the same.  Imagine that when they get the new roll they open the canister and process the whole roll at once then they cut it.  It later on you want just one print you can bring the negatives and tell them the exposure number and they will print just that one in whatever size you need.

There is nothing to worry about in this case

I have been in the graphic design field for eleven years and have never heard of an employer reviewing an applicant's educational transcripts. Most employers will grant an interview based on your resume, then base their decision to hire you on the interview itself, and of course the quality of your portfolio.

I have known an employer to look at transcripts but your portfolio will make or break you.  You need to make sure you have all different kinds of samples of your work make sure it is very versatile and unique.  Also make sure it is very neat and all your artwork is mounted on black boards.

They would be interested in learning where you have learned your art. But the most important thing is your portfolio. For example, you could have gone to one of the best design schools in the country and have someone from community college get the Job if they had a more clean and unique portfolio.



You will want to make sure that you have everything mounted correctly and in a unique way. One of the worst mistakes I made starting out was going out for interviews with a portfolio I made at school. The design firm had seen so many of the same projects it was hard for them to see it as "creative". Make sure it expresses your art work and your design idea's. Even if you have to make up some projects of your own.

Good luck!

mark out with pencil and ruler and the (DAMMIT can't think of the name) level thing (think it's called a level) and then above the pencil line put some masking tape (the beige/eggshell papery kind as that doesn't bring off plaster) lateral to the line and paint, then when the paint is dry take off the tape and voila! you have a nice, neat, straight line

Hey. You should use the blue Painters Tape. It comes in different thicknesses so you choose whichever you want. I used it when I painted my room and everything came out nicely. And it comes of with a clean edge and doesn't rip or anything and it doesn't chip the paint off of the wall or ceiling or whatever you are going to paint. Hope I helped! also its pretty cheap too. You can go to a Home Depot or Lowes or any store like that. Even a paint store. Or a Walmart or Target might have it to. but your best bet is Home Depot or Lowes

Masking tape is great if you don't have popcorn textured ceilings.  I'm no professional painter, but I've found if you buy a good, tapered angled brush and use a steady hand, you can push the paint right up into the crease where the wall and the ceiling meet.  Don't over load the brush with too much paint and you should be fine.  Happy painting!

Learn how to cut in and feather edges. Then you don't have to use tape at all (is much cheaper and much faster.) Use a special tapered (45degree angle) China Bristle brush made for this purpose.

I learned how to in about 5 minutes and 1/2 hour later was very good. I could cut in windows, ceilings, floors and walls.

NEVER USE TAPE . It's difficult to get it right andwhen you take it off you can end up with a mess.
When you paint the ceiling overlap slightly on to the wall.
When the ceiling paint is dry start the walls at the top with a one inch brush cutting into the angle.
Do not overload the brush and do not make the first stroke in the angle but about an inch and a half away.
This gives you space to spread the paint into the angle and get a neat edge.
This way do the top two inches of the wall and then proceed as normal.
It takes patience and practice but it is the best way and the professional way.

I like it. I think if you posted it without the photograph next to it, you'd probably get more positive responses, since the two are next to each other our eyes will compare & the photo of course will win out. The drawing is nice, I don't care for the outlining of the hand/arm, I would lighten this up, maybe even just hint to the arm (Breaking the line up so it's not continuous.) The eyes are nice, but heavy so she looks like she has black eyes, & is slightly cross eyed. I definitly think it has potential though.

Hi Andre.  :))



I think it is a good representation of what you are trying to do with Corel Draw.



I would not take negative criticism personal, as these people don't know what you are trying to do.



Take first steps first... if you are trying to learn the program, I think it is fantastic.  Keep working with it until you get better and better.  Your drawings will get more technical and sophisticated as you go.



The more you work with the program,  the more you will understand the settings and how to make them work for you.  I do Photoshop.  When I first started,  my pictures were ok.  Nothing to scream about, but I did not know what I was doing.



I have been doing photoshop now for about 3 years, and my pictures now are awesome... I get compliments all of the time.  So just stay with it.  Have faith in yourself and your talent.  You could go really far!!!!  And besides that...ART is fun.



Good Luck.  Thanks for reading my post.

upload it on lunapic.com
under the headings "draw" or adjust"
you'll find "skin tanning", "skin smoother", and "blemish remover",
also you can try a higher saturation if you want it shiny.

to remove individual blemishes i would use the cloning tool, this means you can copy the colour from just slightly off the blemish and paste the exact same colour over the blemish to cover it
another way is you can blur it like other comments have said
or your can paste 8 layers of foundation
i think the face in that picture is a bit shiny and would advice u use some blotting paper before taking the image to reduce shine
happy editing

No it doesn't cost £25!
I quite often do my own t shirts.
Buy some t shirt transfer paper for your printer (A good brand of paper will be about £5 for 5 sheets - that's £1 a sheet).
Then go and buy a t shirt. Shouldn't cost anymore than a fiver.
Print out your design and then iron-on the transfer.
Total cost is no more than £6 per T shirt!

What's the best format in photoshop to save in, if i wish to open the file in corel draw (Vector)?



I'm getting t-shirts printed, and the printer uses corel draw X4/4X (One of the two :). I've seen how .EPS Vector images turn out when saved in photoshop CS and opened in Corel Draw (Very bad).



So does anyone know the best format i can save my graphics in so that they can be opened as a vector in Corel Draw and retain all of the quality?

I think it has to do with what is considered beautiful in that specific era. Surely, the people didn't  all look the same, but maybe the artist (knowingly or unknowingly) "changed" the subject a little to fit the fashion. You can see that done today too by all those street-artists who do people's portraits. They always come out more glamorous, dramatic and sexy than in real life.

Step in life and the daisy are the best ones in my opionion. I would work on improving composition. Try ususing subjects that will frame a photograph. Also try not to put things in the center because often (but not all the time) they can appear uninteresting. Try going on the web and reading about some photography tips. All and all, they are pretty good. P.S. Your cute.

The Rule of Thirds refers to composition.  Most people take snapshots with the subject right in the center and the Rule of Thirds explains a creative way to move away from this.  Imagine that you have the picture and on top of it there is a 'tick-tack-toe' grid, now place the eyes or the interesting part of the subject in any of the four intersection points.  This will take the subject off center

You are very good and in my honest opinion are in no need to be explained the 1/3 rule. You have a natural knack for cropping and composition. There are several photos that caught my eye right away. The first one (love B&W) the second one is VERY cool and the  b&w staircase.

keep up the good work. Keep shooting. Invest in digital skills with photoshop. Art is everywhere you look and you are showing that.
good luck

Yes. You can find it at office supply stores and online. Here's some from staples:

Make sure that you are allowed to use this for anything you need to turn in. It's fun to have, but I wasn't allowed to use anything but white in school.

Make sure you do your search for "colored filler paper."

Um...Maybe changing the highlight in the eye, that is if your not being really particular with the realism of the light source.

I guess you could also make the iris and pupil smaller so that you have the;



outline of the eye



the white bit



and the iris and pupil placed accordingly

Can't get you a picture to represent this and no sites come to mind at the moment. I hope someone else will be able to provide you with these though.



Good Luck!

Sorry you are looking for quick answers.  Your drawing is off to a wrong start, as the angle, shape and slant of the brows are good for one expression/direction. . . . so you would have to change it all.



If you were willing to be a little patient and take a little time,  this video would likely show you what you need to know. . . . . but you are in a hurry, so maybe I will watch it and then I will be a step ahead of you!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYHzcM32f...

I am sorry to be so snotty, but there are no quick answers, easy solutions, or fast fixes when you are learning to draw or paint.  And you are pretty demanding in your request . . . I think you have been lucky to get any responses at all!  You are sitting here with your hands on the internet and yet you are too lazy to take the time to use google or glance over some drawing instruction links or even slow down and learn!  This world will pass you by unless you park your hurry-up, instant-answers-only attitude, my friend, and get used to doing some of the work for yourself.

Do not use your flash, it only travels a few feet and will only light the atmosphere and the heads in front of you. The lights on the stage are almost as bright as daylight. Use the largest ISO you can on your camera without getting too much noise. Manual settings are always preferable.. Hold the camera close to your face, not out at arms length, to keep the camera steady when you shoot.

Have fun!

use the flash on your camera.
make sure its not turned off,
then when you come back edit them.
by adding more brightness so they won't be that dark.
but the flash will help mostly.
the flash on my camera is pretty strong :]
and plus the concert won't be that* dark.
there will be reasonable lighting.

What camera do you have? Is it a point and shoot? or do you have a dSLR?



It's the lens that is more important than the camera when it comes to a low light photography. The stage is brightly lit-but a flash, no matter how powerful, isn't too helpful. It destroys the effects that the light / stage designers intended. So you will need a decent dSLR and a lens with a larger aperture, like this:



http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...

or like this

http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...

But if you have a smaller camera, you'd need to set the ISO high. It might be pretty grainy--and you may have to hold the camera very steadily.



Like this:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/little_pook...

Practice it at home first if you can. Try different settings, too.

You'd better make sure that cameras are allowed.



If they aren't, you could have it taken away, or they won't let you in.  Flash is no good unless you are 10-12 feet from the stage.  And may concerts don't allow flash either!

the concise answer is about 11000 DPI.

I have a HND in photography; plus 35yrs experience.

whats the difference? the guy pressing the shutter... a 30 quid lubitol can make images almost as good as a 5000 hassleblad... (my cousin did the tests, for practical photography (he worked at Colab in the 90's)



pro's rarely use the camera flash.. they use lamps and reflectors... 
and they measure the light with a handheld meter... we know all about shadows and the like...



and they know how to handle their cameras...



most Dcams get left on auto, and johnny presses the button, never knowing what is possible...because he's happy with what he's got... why? well, mainly coz he doesnt know any different.



Dcams make life easy; theyre easy to use, and you can see what you got within seconds... no darkroom skills required at all...



but those darkroom skills transfer to PC's quite easily... because we know what were looking at, and what were trying to achieve.



whats the REAL difference? thousands of hours experience behind the lens... and a neg file with over 30`000 images per year... thats the real diffference... skill, ability and an eye.

well, in a studio, you have a professional photographer- they know what they are doing.
also, you have a stupid amount of mega pixels, and amazing lenses and flashes shoved into that lovely SLR camera, which cost stupid amount of Pounds.

you also have special lighting setups and backgrounds.

and on top of that- the models. They will be bery pretty for a start, and hte make up will make their face look perfect and will stop glare.



so, compare this with a standard 6mp camera, with no fancy lenses or lighting set ups, or pro photographer and no fancy models.
for fifty quid, i wouldn't complain!

In a studio there is complete control over the lighting.  There is a choice in the background and the pose.  And total control over the camera setting and time to experiment.  That is what is involved in making a portrait as opposed to taking a snapshot of a person.

Depends on who's taking the photo. Not all studios are professional... you don't need experience to work at portrait studios like JC Penny's, Walmart, Target, etc. For those, the only difference is lighting.

I would lower the contrast, under expose a bit, but jack up the saturation. If you need to brighten it anymore you can do it with software. This way you lose some of the shine and color but the saturation will makeup for the lost in color.

Well I am kinda new to photography myself but, maybe I can help. If you are not already using umbrellas and soft-boxes, try using them. If you are using them you can try lowering the power of your lights and using a lower f-stop. You could also try moving your lights back from your subject and shooting a lower f-stop. I hope this helps.

Soft,diffused light will work better than any make-up.Either use diffusers or bounce the light off a large reflector.Polarisers will reduce shine but only from certain angles and do cut the light down a lot.If you must have strong contrasty light then use a matte foundation powder.

A light dusting of translucent Cornsilk will absorb any oils on the skins surface. The nice part is that the translucent will work on all skin shades, all races. Have a box of tissues to apply it individually to each person without spreading germs or leaving lint on the faces (especially beards!). Do not powder over dark clothing without a cape over the clothing.

<answer>



use
vinegar apple with salad
use
Cyproterone Acetate Antiestrogens
or
Aluminum Chloride 
or
Iontophoresis
Aluminium chloride (hexahydrate) solution: While aluminium chloride is used in regular antiperspirants, hyperhidrosis sufferers need a much higher concentration to effectively treat the symptoms of the condition. A 15% aluminium chloride solution or higher usually takes about a week of nightly use to stop the sweating and one or two nightly applications per week to maintain the results[citation needed]. An aluminium chloride solution can be very effective, however a minority of patients cannot tolerate the irritation that it can cause. Also, the solution is usually not effective for palmar (hand) and plantar (foot) hyperhidrosis - for which iontophoresis (see below) may yield better results in some circumstances. For the severe cases of palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis there is a low level of success using conservative measures such as Aluminium chloride antiperspirants[citation needed]. 
Botulinum toxin type A (including Botox ): Injections of the botulinum toxin are used to disable the sweat glands.[1] The effects can last from 4-9 months depending on the site of injections. With proper anesthesia the hand and foot injections are almost painless. The procedure when used for underarm sweating has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and some American insurance companies pay partially for the treatments.[citation needed] 
Oral medication: There are several oral drugs available to treat the condition with varying degrees of success.[citation needed] 
A class of anticholinergic drugs is available that has been shown to reduce hyperhidrosis. Ditropan (generic name: oxybutynin) is one that has shown promise.[2] However, most people cannot tolerate the side effects associated with the drug, which include drowsiness, visual symptoms and dryness in the mouth and in other mucus membranes. A time release version of the drug is also available, called Ditropan XL , with purportedly reduced effectiveness. Robinul (generic name: glycopyrrolate) is another drug used on an off-label basis. The drug seems to be almost as effective as oxybutynin, with similar side-effects such as a dry mouth or dry throat often leading to pain in these areas. Other less effective anticholinergic agents that have been tried include propantheline bromide (Probanthine ) and benztropine (Cogentin ). 
A different class of drugs known as beta-blockers has also been tried, but does not seem to be very effective. 
Antidepressants and anxiolytics (anti-anxiety medications) are more archaic, related to the former, false belief that Primary Hyperhidrosis was related to an anxious personality style.

It's called "I'm Gonna Be" and it's by the Proclaimers.

Here are the lyrics:

When i wake up, well, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
When i go out, yeah, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you

If i get drunk, well, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if i haver, hey, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you

But i would walk five hundred miles
And i would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When i'm working, yes, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work i do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you

When i come home, oh, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if i grow old, well, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

But i would walk five hundred miles
And i would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When i'm lonely, well, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
And when i'm dreamin' well, i know i'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream about the time when i'm with you

When i go out, well, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
When i come home, yes, i know i'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home with you

But i would walk five hundred miles
And i would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

And i would walk five hundred miles
And i would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

These are great.  He has real talent.  I love the quick style of them, and the large brush strokes.  His use of color is amazing.  I really like these.  This is a style that I really like.  They are so lifelike but still abstracted a little.  There is so much movement implied in the strokes.  I really could go on and on.  They are so unpretentious too.  He should have a show, or at least have them in a coffee shop like the above poster said.  I have heard that some coffee shops only take a 15% commission, so I would look around.

So yeah, I would suggest selling them to an office or a lobby somewhere or something that would want some uniform artwork to decorate with. My dad's office is done entirely with sepia photographs of our town and they go down the hallways where he works. I have seen a lot of businesses do that. Hope it helps!

And also, ask if you could display the pictures somewhere, like a local coffee shop, with the prices on them and try to sell them through that business. Then you could give them 20 percent (as an example) of whatever you sell

Those are pretty fun!  I would see if your local arts commission has a gallery that he could apply to show at.  Or maybe even take a little portfolio of the images to some galleries and see if they would hang a show for him.  I would be happy to look at one every day!  :-)

You really need to feature all of his work in some type of exhibit. You could even sell them on eBay and get a lot of money for them. Really. You could also ask a local restaurant to put them in their dining area, and put the price on them. Or there are a lot of places that will let you display a business card or post a flyer featuring his paintings and the asking price. Tell him good luck for me!

Check for the same camera in Ebay to get an idea. Also, check to see if the camera is available on KEH or BH used department. Keep in mind, they are charging more than what they paid for it to make a profit, but you can get a good idea where to start pricing. You can also check Craigs List in a large city to try to find one listed and see what kind of price is being asked.



If all that fails, just base your asking price on what can be purchased in TODAY'S market. If you are asking $500 for it, but a person can buy a new camera that is much better for $400, then you have to base your pricing on that. It is sort of like an older computer. The newer ones get better and better, and cheaper and cheaper. You can never get near what you paid for an older computer.... and that is pretty much the same with a digital camera body.

Several approaches.

Change the color image to greyscale, and then to bitmap.  Play with the "threshold" controls to bring up the portitons you want to remain black,and bring down the areas you want to go white.

Or, from the greyscale mode, you can use the Image/Adjustments and play with the brightness, contrast controls, begining with high brightness and highe contrast.

Or, again, from the greyscale mode, go to filters and find the Posterize filter and play with that.

The best advice is you don't need any special programs or expertise, except design, to make that sort of picture, and if you want to learn how to make them well, if you do enough of them you will learn to.

Scan a picture into your computer, open it with any paint program, and make the changes necessary to have it look like what you want it to look like.

While Warhol was using modern technology to make his pictures, he certainly was not cutting edge.  When he began incorporating photographs into his pictures Nam June Paik was already cutting up machines and reassembling them into beautiful electronic sculptures which aren't yet appreciated, and among others the cartoonist Philippe Druillet was using computer graphics in his Lone Sloane.

When Warhol started using those photos he would photograph newspaper or other reproduced images, blow the prints up and use them as the basis for silk screens, print them, then paint over them or otherwise manipulate the image paying as careful attention to the mechanical equivalent of pixilation as he did to what he was creating an image of.  This tied in with his books, which he recorded then deliberately hired imperfect typists to transcribe and his early movies which covered such subjects as 24 unedited hours of the Empire State Building or real time footage of the poet John Giorno sleeping.

His work was as much about the LOSS of information as it was about information or his putative subjects.  Interview magazine, in its early years, was not subjected to conventional editing by deliberate policy (and stopped being interesting to some of us when  it was introduced).



His later work is of his famous friends, and usually started from pictures he took himself.  There is no question that he was an excellent photographer when he wanted to be, but his point was still to subject these pictures to the same -- homogenizing -- treatment then introduce design elements which pointed up what was missing as much as they did what was there (such as the unrealistic colors).

Paintshop Pro is as good a program to work on as any, but again, I assume you will want to include photographs.  Even if your pictures are on computer, print them out (preferably in black and white) and scan them in again.  Then use those as the basis for your imagery.

Move the pupils to the top right corner to look up and either move the pupil to look down or change the light tint in them. That usually works effectively depending on the eye style.

Metropolitan Museum NY--Modern Art--painting?



There is a painting in the Met's modern art wing that I love, but I can't remember the title or artist and I can't find it in their database. It's a seemingly ordinary landscape painting of a seemingly nondescript valley, rolling hills and distant roads and such, only all across the painting, in writing that's hard to see at first, the artist has inscribed personal stories about every spot on the landscape.



Anyone know it? I'm not even sure if it's still hanging in the wing--I haven't been there in two years (which is why I've forgotten the title).

Flickr is only for photography. There are a very small amount of art communities out there.  If you find a good one, let me know.

Personally I hate DA now, the new design is not user friendly at all. I've been on DA for 5 years and yes, it has done down since the Jark issue.

Sadly how bad dA is and has become, it will probably stay the top art site...

http://www.shadowness.com/  -  This site might be the next step down.  I know some great artists on dA also have stuff posted here.
http://www.daimartist.com/  -  Here is another.

I've never really explored either of these sites, only hear of them.  So i can't say how they fair.  But i hope they'll help.

Try searching the JSTOR database, its all art-related. Also, try googling the artist's name and finding out the exact name of the painting that you need information for. Also, please be more specific in what sort of information you are looking for.

Can some explain the numbers on art pencils?



I'm referring to the carbon and charcoal ones. I see HB, 2B and I also see things like no. 555, 2BP #597, When do you use charcoal over pencil and visa versa and could you please tell me how these numbers go??

there is a scale which varies from manufacturers, but generally goes from 9H (H=hardness) to 9B (B=blackness), which refers to the properties of the graphite itself.  A hard pencil gives you a hard line which smudges little and will sharpen to a strong point, whilst moving from grade B through 9B offer you varying grades of blackness or softness, meaning the  depth of tone you will achieve, and the "smudginess" of the mark. There is also an"F" grade (Finepoint) that sits in the middle  of these.

Personally i prefer not to mix charcoal and graphite in the same image as the graphite contains waxes progressively in the "B" range, and charcoal often doesn't sit well with this. If you were to use both together i would suggest using charcoal first, then the pencil over the top for this reason.

Wiki gives a good chart of the pencil grades, and i will put the link below :-)

I don't know exactly can't remember from being in art which ones are which but they are different shades. Like i think the HB is the lightest shade. You use charcoal over pencil when doing sketch's that require different shading

Does anyone know where i can download a free version of a professional photography edit software on PC?



I am becoming rapidly interested in photography generally and specifically, among such things from Special occasions; like Proms, Weddings, Parties to Art, and Natural events. And i am trying to figure out more ways to make an image more fun, attractive, sexy and appealing to viewers, however the programmes i am using at the moment via PC are not so great and do not work like i would want them too, and the kind of effects; is a small list. And i am looking for a wider variety of effects. This is why i am wondering if there are better editting or Picture quality and such, programmes i can download for free, which would make more of an effort for my images i upload..

I don't know of any decent programs you can DOWNLOAD for FREE that will do what you want. You can download a free trial of Photoshop, but there is no poiint in that in my opinion.

Your entire question seems at odds to me. You state and sound like you sincerely are interested in taking your photography to higher levels, and yet, you still want to cling to the idea that you are going to get GOOD editing software to download for free. C' mon... that sounds like the kids on here.

Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 is a magnificient program that cost under $100. If you are REALLY serious about your photography, you are going to have to get out of the whole "free" frame of mind thing.



Quality photographic equipment costs money... so does quality software... sorry... such is life.

If you are going to be a pro, you will have to spend the money on the equipment you need ... that not only includes professional level cameras and lenses, but the necessary accessories like lighting and yes Photoshop CS3 at a minimum.  Many of us use other programs like Kodak GEM, Dx0, Photo Mechanic and others with licenses for both our desktop and notebook computers.

Nothing is 'free' in the photo biz.  You just have to take those investments and costs into account when you put together your "price list"  Remember to include replacing your camera body every 18 months and upgrading all your photo related programs as well.

No, smiling on pictures always looks contrived on me. I try not to bee in too many pictures. Posing is a pain in a neck and feels ingenuine. I prefer candid shots since they are a window into a real point in time of someone's or something's existence. Portraits or a group shots where everyone is sat just right and preparations for one shot is over an hour are the worst as I see no point in it.

Have you tried looking at online photo galleries? Companies such as gettyimages.com, corbis.com, or alamy.com have loads of photos in reasonable resolution that you can copy across to a photoshop document. We use them in advertising a great deal. You have to have an account with them to get really high-res shots - though your college art department may already have one.



Hope that helps!

First and foremost Picasso: The idea of producing variations on a work from the past was probably inspired by Picasso who reinterpreted works by Grünewald, Delacroix, Manet, Gauguin and Velazquez himself. Bacon said, ‘Picasso is the reason why I paint. He is the father figure, who gave me the wish to paint………. Picasso was the first person to produce figurative paintings which overturned the rules of appearance; he suggested appearance without using the usual codes, without respecting the representational truth of form, but using a breath of irrationality instead, to make representation stronger and more direct; so that form could pass directly from the eye to the stomach without going through the brain.’ 
also Christian altarpieces. Bacon’s use of areligious format for a grotesque subject  probably inspired by the expressionist paintings of Max Beckmann http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciat...

Professional framing costs a boatload.  They put the picture on a mat, put a backing behind it, frame it, and add glass.

For a 20" x 30" print, you can expect $300-$500.  For smaller, "standard" sizes like 5" x 7" and 8" x 10", I just buy frames and mats myself and do it.

its difficult to say
it depends on what frame you want
what mounting (if any) you want
what type of glass.

The best thing to do is to take it to several framers and see what they suggest.

there is nothing magical or mysterious about framing, you can  do it yourself quite satisfactorily.. providing you can find a frame. the frame is often the fiddly thing. but I'm guessing your degree will be no more than say A4 so it should be possible to get a simple off the shelf frame from virtually anywhere including IKEA

Hi,

I guess that prices will vary alot and since I'm portuguese, I'm not aware of the prices practiced in USA or other countries.
Now, the framer will have to work taking into consideration the customer's budget and not only what should be done.
Of course that it's his/her job to advise the customer.
Nonetheless, supposing that money isn't an issue, the materials used in the framing process will be archival quality i.e. the mount and mat (if used) will be 100% rag thus acid free (mind that a mat can be acid free and not be archival quality since it may have been buffed with calcium carbonate but may become acid in the future).
The use of any glue will be done using an acid free glue such as weath starch and hinges will be used on paper works.
The materials will be reversible.
For some more info you may visit frametek.com

Kind regards,

Look in your Yellow Pages for Picture Framers.
You will probably find loads in your area, then give them a call.
Tell them what you want, then ask for a price.

I use Yahoo mail and downloaded incredimail the other day.  I have since deleted it, my computer was working so slow because of it, it was ridiculous!!  Anyway, just wondered if there are email back ground sites or animations I can use or add to Yahoo, I'm thinking that there isn't, as I don't know how you would be able to add them to a yahoo email, but thought I'd check.

sorry I don't know about yahoo email.



But if you use Outlook express you can create your own email backgrounds - they are known as stationery - go to message, new message using, select stationery, create stationery. If you want to do more sophisticated things go to edit and it will open frontpage. In this programme you can add moving image files (gif) or even background music. But you are going to have to learn a little about using frontpage.



There must be sites that you can download stuff - although the only one I know is very cheesy but there is one called banana milkshake on it which is pretty funny - hey I found the link again

What Should My "Occupation" Be?



Before the season, I made a bet w/ my friend Mindy (a Rays fan) that the Mariners would make the playoffs and the Rays wouldn't. It seemed safe, but I lost. Badly.



We both get really into Halloween, so the winner got to pick the loser's costume. Mindy is hot, so I thought I could pick out something skimpy for her--she turned the tables.

She said I have to dress as a girl for Halloween weekend--"shave my legs and everything" (whatever "everything" means?).

you can find TONS of stuff on Photobucket.com
You can search for something specific, or just browse through albums. If you dont want to start a (free) account with the site you can always just save the pictures you find and like onto your computer. 
good luck!

How do you transfer an image from thick magazine paper to reasonably thick cartridge paper?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It depends on the type of ink used for the magazine.Turps and soap in equal parts works on some inks but the result is a bit faint on others.You mix the two and stir well to make an emulsion,paint it on,leave it a few seconds ,then place it face down on your cartridge and rub the back with a spoon.If you need to soak it for quite a while use another sheet of paper to protect the original
You may need to experiment with different thinners if this doesn't work too well.Try adding a bit of meths as well.
There are proprietary chemicals but they are not always easy to get in Art shops.

Which artists use music in their work?



As in 'painting artists' those with pencils, etc - NOT music artists, etc.

It can be either incorporating musical instruments into their work, or music notes, or the treble clef, or even being inspired by music.



Could you tell me the artists name, and if possible, an example piece they have done including music?

Thank you!

Does anyone know of a book that gives instruction on drawing portraits 'a trois couleurs'?



I have always admired the drawings of classical artists, and would like to have a go at portraits using the colours sanguine, black and white but do not know where to start.  I have a number of art instruction books but none of them really covers this subject in very much depth.  If I know what to look for, the book does not have to be currently in print.

What was the Jim Lambie installation that was nominated for a Turner Prize in 2005?



I keep reading that it was called Mental Oyster, but ive also read articles that describe the installation containing over-sized bird sculptures which was The Kinks. So which one was it??



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



"The [Turner]Prize is awarded each year to : 'a British artist under fifty for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work in the twelve months preceding'.  "
http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerpri...

So  the answer to your question is both of these installations, Mental Oyster and The Kinks, as "Jim Lambie has been nominated for his exhibitions at Anton Kern Gallery, New York, and Sadie Coles HQ, London."
http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerpri...

Both of the Installations were shown at various galleries, gaining Lambie his nomination, in the twelve months preceding the 2005 Turner prize. The prize recognises all works shown by an artist during this twelve month period and is awarded for an outstanding contribution in this period of time.

Hey, i like the first and third ones. The second one? No, i don't like it that much, it's a little boring to me. I like the first one. However, as you should know, some photos are just more vertical, and should be taken in a vertical position. For both the first, and third one, you should have taken them in a vertical position. Both, so you could get more of the sea in the shot, and not just the sky. You can keep the same amount of sky- and the sea too, it'll make the photo look much better. Nice photographs though

A lot depends on the type of textile you are doing,printed,woven,knitted,embroidered.... with the fabric type and when you have that you may have a better idea what you intend to do.Using the obvious picture,The Kiss, there are many options from even a small section.
I've just seen the Vivienne Westwood show at Sheffield,her later tailoring is quite distinctive.She'd probably have done a patchwork fastened with safety pins,all done across the form.

You don't say if the pictures are b&w or colour. You could cut around them and mount them in a sort of 3D fashion by attaching a  piece of tiny sponge at the back of thepicture and making an imaginary town/city !! this can look very attractive and also gives the whole "picture"/collage a depth.  Good Luck. Sounds fun.

I used to do Photography at college. The best advice i can give you is to keep it simple! Good images can be lost if the mounting card is overcrowded, Select the best images in your opinion and mount them in a simple elegant way! THis gives you a classy final sheet that will show your work of to it's full potential, if you want to use the rest why not make a little booklet to go with it just get a nice looking sketch  book and place a picture on each page so people can flick through? Just go with your instincts, it is after all YOUR homework! Good luck!

Should you cover the red window on the back of a Kodak Brownie 127 camera?



I have just picked up a Kodak Brownie 127 (1950s), which has a red window on the back so you can see what number you're up to on the film. With modern EFKE 127 film, do I need to cover this window to stop fogging? And if so, how can I tell how far I need to wind the film on?

Well if the window is letting light in to the film itself then I would definitely blank it off... Have you taken a test spool to make sure?

If you do blank the window off I guess you'll need to work out how many turns for each exposure, but if there is no audible click for each one then you stand the risk of overlap.

No it's there for you to see the numbers when you wind the film on.
The film is fastened to a backing sheet of paper which has a light proof black layer inside.
Wind the film on 'til you see a set of spots and then the number 1,shoot then wind on straight away so you do not double expose the film.

The paper backing should be opaque, but protect the cameras back from long periods in direct sun as much as possible.  Your first roll will tell you more.

It should not be necessary. I shot modern film in a pre-WWII Voigtländer without problems (colour & B&W) - that camera even has two red windows and both are constantly open even the ERC has two holes so that can see the numbers when winding on. 
As said before - the first roll will tell but the backing paper should do it's work.
If uncertain you can always tape it over with black tape which you peel back when winding on.

Mac or PC, be sure it has at least 4GB of RAM, a 17 inch screen, the largest hard drive you can get on it, at least a 500 GB external drive and a computer that has an ExpressCard/34 or 54 port so you can copy image files from your CF cards at 2.5 Gbit/s (PCI Express mode).  In the 480 Mbit/s (USB mode) large cards can take a long time to copy to your computer.

I have been using HP's since I sold my Mac's (Photoshop CS2 ran faster on PC's, but Adobe promised that CS3 would run as fast in either Mac or PC platforms).

I do a lot of A/V presentations and interfaces at most meeting rooms are interfaced for PC's (and use standard Microsoft AV programs).

If you do buy a Mac, buy one that is dark gray.  White notebooks get real dirty, real fast.  Not something you want to use in front of your clients.

A Mac configured for a photographer will be about



$3700.

I would recommend googling "wearable art" for inspiration. Generally you could any artist to inspire you, though it probably should be one with a clear and well known style. E.g. it would be pretty easy to be inspired by Mondrian for this project. Or pick somebody who made the wearable art you liked most.

To the first question: if you're referring to attractiveness, well, DUHH?! Anime girls are drawn to be more desirable, with massive boobs and innocent girly expressions. Very attractive, I must say. But I can't say if they're better than real girls or not. Afterall, they're not real.

And to the second question, what's going on in your mind? Really. I haven't and I'm not going to try for fear that she might cap me.

No. The Olympus is not a good camera for the long term. On paper, the specs look good - but now go get lenses for it. Very different. Poor selection. Pricey and not very good. Eventually you will want to upgrade the camera body, but ... but Olympus has very little to offer.

x2 crop factor is great for some wildlife and lousy for landscapes. Absolutely horrible for landscapes. Do you love the wide angle landscape photo? If so, you will never see one from this camera.



The top end lenses for Olympus are okay, but ... but so are the top end lenses from Canon and Nikon. Canon and Nikon have a much better selection, and their bargain lenses are really bargains!

Don't listen to the canikon sheep. They only buy what the marketing execs want them to buy and pay what the marketing execs what them to pay.

They make great cameras bit they are not the only great cameras.

Other brands offer just as high quality but for much better value.

Olympus cameras are excellent and the e520 is a great "semi pro" camera.

I've had the e500 for years and love it.

But remember that it is the person behind the camera that matters not the camera itself. You can have a 10,000 dollar / euro camera and take terrible photos. Some people take amazing shots with pinhole camera.

I am using a Olympus E500 for the last two years. It is consistently producing excellent results. Recently I added a E520 with 14-42 kit lens to my existing equipment. The E520 is very fast, produces very sharp photos and quite cheap. The 14-42 lens is outstanding (read review at dpreview.com. It is the only kit lens with ED glass element. No other kit lens produces such sharp pictures. 
The E520 has in-built Image Stabilisation with works with all Olympus Zuiko Digital lenses.
The 9-18mm lens (coming shortly) is equivelent to 18-36mm in 35mm format. It will be a very good lens for landscape photography. No other manufacturer has such a lens (so wide zoom) in the standard category till date.
The 70-300 (140-600mm equivalent) is ideal for wild life. With built-in image stabilisation you will get sharp wild life pictures everytime.

Go for it. You will not regret.

Cheers and happy shooting.

I used to have an Olympus E500 and was not happy with it. There were noise issues at low ISO's, as well as it having issues in bright sunlight. I bought a Canon EOS 40D recently and find that it does not blow out highlights like the Olympus, and it also has a lower noise factor. I would definitely get a Canon or Nikon (as I've heard good things about them as well) before getting an Olympus.

Could you describe your work flow from when you take a RAW shot right through to printing?



I am especially interested in seeing what adjustments you make in the raw converter and those you leave to photoshop.

I have started shooting in raw and am particularly interested in this aspect.

You will get as many answers to this as there are photographers looking.
It depends on so many different factors such as type of shot, end client, conditions shot under, whether for print/web etc etc.

Basic colour/exposure correction should be done in RAW.
Depending on the program you are using then cataloguing/exif/iptc done in RAW

Everything else can be done in PS on a copy of the original file.

Try reading this - I haven't, it is just one thing out of a RAW workflow search.

I shoot RAW + JPEG Basic

I use Adobe Bridge to append all the images XMP files with my copyright notice, contact information, client or subject information and key words.

I edit (sort) all JPEG the images from the shoot using my file manager and pick the best of the best and place them in a new file folder.

Then I pick the matching RAW files and process only them, saving them as high quality JPEG or TIFF files as the client chooses.  JPEG images with the sRGB colour space are used to make photographic prints and TIFF with the Adobe RGB colour space when the images are going to be published

Then ALL the image files are saved to a backup DVD (or two)

<answer>



First I import the files off the card using Bridge, this tags my pictures with copyright and contact details automatically, gives them a meaningful name and simultaneously copies to one of my back up hard drives.

Using bridge I use a 'traffic light' system for grading the images, red means 'no hoper', yellow is a 'maybe' and green is a definite keeper.

I then view all the green files, any which can be grouped together because the lighting and exposure are all the same (all interior shots for instance) are selected in Bridge and opened in the Raw Converter. Here I settle colour balance, any exposure tweaks, contrast and saturation. I also apply a pre sharpening using low levels of USM. Here is where I would convert to B&W if that's called for by the client.



I try to do all 'global' adjustments in the Raw converter as it is totally none destructive, I use Photoshop when I want to apply changes to selections, cropping and any pictures that need individual attention (Cloning, Dodge and Burn etc.).

I have written a number of Actions that do such things as resizing for web or for various print sizes, converting to Tiff or Jpeg, applying a signature etc.. The beauty of having them as Actions is you can apply any or all of the Actions using batch processing which speeds things up enormously, this file is sent to the client usually via e-mail or ftp and has low res thumbnails of all the 'green' images in it. Individual attention is then given to the images that the client has responded to.

The actual output depends on the client, a web designer will only need fairly low res jpegs which can be e-mailed, publishers need high res Tiffs or Jpeg files often CMYK using ftp or on a memory card and galleries will want finished prints, I can only do up to A3+ any larger are sent as 16bit Tiffs to a local printer usually on a memory card in person and I pick them up a couple of days later.

Advert help? Polaroid possibly?



I need to find this advert, its quite old now, I don't think its on tv anymore... but there was some guy with what looked like giant Polaroid photo's [like the white frames with the middle bit cut out] which he'd hold in a certain position and the inside view of the frame would pause for a second[ looking like a photo] then when he'd move the frame it'd be a see through middle again, and he put it round his neck and stuff...

I probably didn't explain it to well, but its an interesting advert, very very clever, and I cant remember what it was for. I need it to *** to my graphics research.

You don't need the press, but be aware that you will not produce  a series like that; you won't be able to keep the pressure consistent with that. I've pulled more artist prints and state prints than series prints.

Picasso, and Mondrian are to reasonably different cubist painters. It's an early 20th century movement (not sure of exact dates) based around exploring new ways of portraying three dimensional objects on a two dimensional surface- picasso often paints the same object from more than one angle. Mondrian shows elements of later cubism in which depth is removed in favour of using the canvas plain, using the painting as an object in itself rather than a representation with an illusion of depth. Many cubist painters started to work with purely geometrical shapes and the idea of the grid. They started to use shape and colour to portray ideas, it was the first really abstract art. The cubist ideas went on to shape the manifestos of the abstract expressionists in the second half of the century. 
That's about all I can run off right now, you'd probably do well on google or even wikipedia ( as long as you're not expected to cite anything!)

For black and white photography, the developer is typically a mixture of Metol, Phenidone or Dimezone and hydroquinone. These are made up in aqueous solution with a suitable alkaline agent such as sodium carbonate, borax, etc. to create the appropriately high pH and with sodium sulfite to delay oxidation of the developing agents by atmospheric oxygen. Hydroquinone is superadditive with metol, meaning that it acts to "recharge" the metol after it has been oxidised in the process of reducing silver in the emulsion. Sulfite in a developer not only acts to prevent aerial oxidation of the developing agents in solution, it also facilitates the regeneration of metol by hydroquinone (reducing compensation and adjacency effects) and in high enough concentrations acts as a silver halide solvent.

Most developers also contain small amounts of potassium bromide to modify and restrain the action of the developer to suppress chemical fogging. Developers for high contrast work have higher concentrations of hydroquinone and lower concentrations of metol and tend to use strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide to push the pH up to around pH 11 to 12.

What do you think of this shot of a sega dancer in Mauritius, is there enough sharp detail ?



I took this shot in Mauritius last year. I wanted to show the movement of the dancer so used a slower shutter speed 2/5 sec and the slow sinc flash.



I wonder if I have perhaps captured too much movement and not captured enough sharp detail especially in the face. Any second opinions or other comments and critiques would be most appreciated.

Thanks.

I quite like it...you have enough movement there so that the picture isn't boring and static but you have the sharpness where its needed (her eyes)...i think you need the movement as thats what dance is all about..I think theres maybe a bit too much yellow in her face, though, from the movement of her dress...but is still a good shot

Hundreds of years ago, it was considered grotesque for the nude body be shown in art, it was grotesque for art to not have a religious them, it was grotesque for paint to be used as paint, Picasso was considered a loon, Impressionists were loons!, and now, Contemporary Artists are loons.

there are two sides to this; on the one hand, damien hirst's concepts are amazingly pretentious and only out there to shock, y'know he failed art A level?  (I don't personally like him) On the other hand he's merely having the last laugh- if idiots are willing to pay millions of dollars for a pickled cow why not take them for a ride? Really it's all Saatchi's fault, if he hadn't decided to buy hirsts work along with his contemporaries from goldsmith's it wouldn't be considered art and hirst would be forced to make a living off the kind of art normal people want to buy, i.e. good paintings. It's a shame hirst now believes his own BS!

Powerful art can evoke powerful emotions and apparently Hirst's work has evoked some really powerful emotions in you!  Lana has a good point - most artists are not appreciated or understood during there own lifetime. It usually takes a while for the public to "get it."



I don't understand who you are angry with. Are you angry with the artist or the people who buy the art? As far as the economy goes it seems like making, buying and selling things (art or otherwise) would help our floundering economy.

absolutely right. Constable and Michelangelo were artists and for Hirst`s work to be classed as art is an insult to all the old masters who had more talent in their finger than Hirst has in his entire body. Some people seem to have more money than sense.

HI I have a limited print of the Irish poet Brendan Behan called 'On The Dry' he is sitting at a pub table putting some drink from a soda syphon in a glass.  I can't read the artists name and would really like to know who painted the original.  All I can make out from the artists signature is that the first name starts with a P and looks something like 'Putin' and the surname starts with a K and looks like Knuttul.  I have ;googled' Brendan Behan but have had no luck finding this print.

Try to not have such high expectations of your art.  Go in with the idea of experimenting, and keep doing this over and over until you find certain things that you are really good at, or that you really like to do.  Then, do these things in combinations, and you will like your art better.

Hmmm, how about trying your own style of graffiti? Just start of with the letter of the alphabet, and doodle something on them, from there, try add to that.

NEVER rub anything that you think looks bad (unless you made a small error). This is great, because it'll show you how you can improve it. Good luck ^.^

Try Drawing Someone from InuYasha. The drawing style is fairly simple, but it comes out looking pretty professional- even if you don't go into a lot of detail. Maybe Kagome or Sango would do.

Also, you should DEFINITELY go to this site. It helps me so much. I'm sure you would love it as much as I do :D

Does anyone know how i can calibrate my monitor's colour manually?



i have discovered that when i print photographs they come out darker and slightly different in colour than on my computer screen. I can't afford to but a fancy device right now to calibrate my monitor but wondered if anyone has any ideas as to how i could alter things manually so i can get better prints??? :)

Well it depends if you have any knobs on the monitor to calibrate it like colour temperature and contrast and brilliance and a few more.
If you have then look at that print you did and fiddle around till the screen looks like the print.

If you haven't any adjustments then alter the angle of the monitor until you are looking at it and seeing the same result as your print. By rights if you draw a line  from your eyes to  the middle of the monitor there should be 90 degrees between the flat of the  screen and that line.
If not then there is something out in the calibration or the monitor is on its way out if it's old.  There are a few places  on the web that sells refurb monitors with adjustments and theyre not expensive.

I have used it successfully it wasn't too hard and I have found it to be accurate. One tip.. when you are adjusting the shade to match the tone of the stripy pattern.. I have found it helps if you squint your eyes together to make it slightly blurry. This will help you calibrate it more accurately. Good luck!

Just say copyright near or on the photo.

I am not absolutely certain, but I do know that a writer is already covered by copyright once they put their words down on paper, and I think it is the same for a photographer.

I was a photographer for some time, and to be honest with you, I never gave the copyright a though... and never had a problem with anyone stealing anything.

My advice is simply to go ahead and mark it copyright, and don't give it another though.

Getting them copywrited might be an expensive and labourious process.  Depends on their value I guess.

You can create a watermark quite easily in Photoshop (or download GIMP) and apply them to the photos.  It doesn't stop them being stolen but it would be hard to reuse them if they are watermarked.

A photographer has copyrights to all their photos. If you want you can just use some sort of software like photoshop that you can put text on an image. Then use the Copyright sign and your name.

You can also go to http://www.copyright.gov/
You can register your photos.

Some addtional info about Ebay. Depending what your photos are and what sizes you are selling, your photos may not sell. I've been doing research on Ebay, alot of photos do not sell. To me it looks like most people do not want to buy a typical today photograph of an 8x10 (unless it's something interesting). They want old antique paintings/photographs. Good Luck.

Everyone here is right you own the copyright from the moment you took the photos. But to protect that copyright the use of the copyright symbol, watermarks and adding copyright info to the EXIF data. will all help protect you Registering works is an even better way but that can be expensive for a photographer just starting out

If you took the picture, you own the copyright. Proving it is another matter, you will have the original file which will include when the picture was taken, but they can be edited. You can register your copyright - for a price, but you own it already. All my pictures have copyright notices, and my name, address and telephone number. I also fill in keywords (for search engines) included in the IPTC part of the EXIF file which is filled in automatically by Photoshop when I import my pictures.

Selling pictures on eBay is a waste of time, much better to submit your images to a good photo library, but they have to be good to sell. Everybody and their Grandmother has a digital camera, so why would they buy yours?

iStockphoto and fotolibra are good and look after their photographers, both offer advice as to what sells and which market to aim your pictures at. My best selling picture is of a steaming cup of coffee against a white background which make it easy for the ad boys to cut out, but it is perfectly exposed, colour balanced and available up to a 20Mb file. Pictures of 'beauty spots' rarely sell as there are thousands of them already, though I have just sold a picture of Whitby here in the UK, much to my surprise. Art pictures are a law unto themselves and if you have that kind of 'eye' then go with that, but just making it B&W does not make it an Art picture.LOL

Don't go for stock photos, go for 'rights managed' if they want to use my pic again for another print run they have to buy it again.

Both the sites above have good contacts with book, magazine and calendar publishers, but the real money is with the Ad men which they also do.

Give it a go, your pictures have to be technically perfect, make it easy for the client to use your image by including such things as cut out masks which can be included in the file and preferably taken with at least a 10Mp camera and nicely lit etc. etc., once you get into the swing of it its not difficult.

It would be advisable to copyright your images. It is not difficult at all and cost $45 . You can submit all images which are unpublished with the same submission. I make contact sheets in Photoshop and save them as jpeg  at 72 dpi and send in a Cd or DVD. The forms can be downloaded or you can call and send away for them.

Assuming you are in the UK.

Copyright is yours as soon as you press the shutter button (with a couple of exceptions regarding employment etc,) so you are free to do with the pictures what you want.

There is no need to have them registered anywhere for the copyright in the work to exist, doing so would be a waste of money in the vast majority of cases.

If you are posting pictures onto the WWW then there is always the chance they will be stolen and used elsewhere.
To try and limit the chances of that happening then any shots posted should only be low resolution and it would be advisable to put a watermark on them.
Also ensure that your details are embedded in the Exif/IPTC fields. This can be stripped out but it is something that you should in your workflow anyway.

Ensure that when you sell either a print or digital file that the buyer knows what they can use the picture for.

There is no foolproof way of ensuring that your shots will not be used elsewhere but if you take the basic steps to ensure people know they are your pictures then at least it puts off the "casual" copyright thieves.

If you are in the US.
Basically the same applies except that you can "register" the shots but all that means is that should someone use the shot illegally then you would be able to claim more from them.
The copyright again is yours from the time the shutter is pressed.

I'd put a watermark onto the eBay image so people have to buy it and can't just pinch the image- if you're talking about prints then you could just sign them.

The first one does not really work, the exposure is poor and very noisy. The second one shows potential though. you have followed the rule of thirds and used some nice framing althoughh the gate is a little distracting. The track leads the eye into the shot  which is always a good thing.

If you are really interested in photography, you should start learning the basics about exposure and composition. You don't need a fancy camera, any digital point and shoot will do the job. Simon Joinson's books are excellent for beginners.

I've worked out a basic way of dividing the figure for when I draw people in designs/ storyboards etc. You can divide the body into seven equal parts, based on the length of the head. The torso and legs (measured from the inside) are about equal, three heads each. The knees are half way down the legs and the torso can be further divided into three heads at the chest and the waist (measuring from shoulder to crotch). Because the neck is at an angle the chin appears almost level with the top of the back (which slopes up from the shoulders towards the back of the neck)
the slope of the shoulders should be roughly a third of a head, and the width of the shoulders is around two and a half to three times the width of the head. The arms reach to about half way down the thigh (on the outside) with the wrist level with the hips and the elbow level with the waist. Everyone's different of course but I find this useful for a starting point.

Are you drawing from life? If so you can make a frame and view the figure through that. If not why not try the library. There are lots of books devoted to drawing that will give you loads of advice. Your best option is to do some rough sketching, taking a pad out and noting people in different places. I'm afraid to master the human figure takes lots of practice!

Use your spot or small area metering mode to take a reading of just the sky portion of the scene, and use that. Sometimes a slight underexposure will bring out better color, so I often try another exposure a half-stop down.

You can also try setting the exposure as recommended above, dialling those settings in in manual mode and popping the flash up, having a friend in the foreground off to one side. The result will be a perfectly exposed sunset with your friend correctly exposed with the fill in flash in the foreground, the friend has to be within range of the flash.

Just something else to try.

It can be a pressure as there is no chance to retake the shots. But if you have experience with other shots you can pull this off. First of all go to the churck or at least call it and find out what their policy is on photographs during the service. In some places its a NO NO . Even if you are allowed to shoot during the service you probably cannot use a flash there so bump the ISO ( maybe as high as 400 or 800)up and if you have VR use it. Some people do use programs like Noise Ninja (from PictureCode.com ) to help with this.



Get a list of the pictures you need after the wedding from the bride and groom and family for before during and after the ceremony



1 day prior to the wedding date
Charge all camera/flash batteries and make sure you have more than enough batteries on hand. 
Format all memory cards. 
Remove dust from camera body imaging sensors. 
Clean lens elements. 
Pack camera bags/cases with all needed gear. 
Review all your information that you have (hopefully written). 
Make sure you have accurate directions (if needed),any written information about the details, group shots, etc. packed in your bag. 
Get a good nights sleep.

Wedding day, 2-5 hours before the ceremony
Eat something, you may not get a chance later. 
Pack all gear into car. Double check to see that batteries and memory cards are there.



Get to the church early and do some scouting. Take some readings and get a rough idea what white balance setting you need.



If you are shooting with a flash for these get the flash off the camera if you can, also you can use diffusers to soften the shadows. Even outdoors flash can be used for fill light so don't forget it there. Gather everyone togehter that will be in any shot right from the start. While they’re all sitting there, shoot the formal bride and groom portraits first. Next shoot the largest groups of people , and then once you’re done with a group (like the grandparents for example), send them off to the reception. For the large groups remember depth of field and set your aperature to give you the depth you need. If you have problems with people blinking when you’re ready to shoot the shot, have everybody close their eyes, and then on the count of three have them all open their eyes and smile. For full body shots think about camera height Standing, Full-Length Portrait: Position your camera on a good tripod at the bride’s waist height Keep your lens straight don’t aim up towards the bride’s face. 7/8 Shots (from the calf or knee up) - Putyour camera at the bride’s chest level and shoot with your lens straight from there. For head and shoulders shot put your camera at the bride’s eye level or slightly above. Be aware of objects behind the people that can look like its growing out of thier heads. Position the people close in the portraits, if you let them stand where they are comfortable they are usually too far apart.
If you can sneak some shots in here from a higher vantage point that can be interesting additons to the portraits



At the reception take lots of candids of everyone you can but remember THE BRIDE IS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. Oh did I say that too loud ..... Again have a list of shots they want there. Cutting the cake, first dance, throwing the bouquet etc. At the reception your feet are your best zoom. using long zoom lenses can give you a depth of field that is too shallow, flatten features of the subject, put you out of range of your flash and feel impersonal. So use a lens long enough that you are not intrusive but not so zoomed out that you have these problems



Bring lots and lots of memory cards
Bring extra batteries
A good tutorial and list of posible shots to take is here

Another good site to read over is here ( please don't get upset by the word amature in the title no insult was intended )

Stay calm, this is a fun thing to do, although it may seem a bit nerve racking. First off look at some wedding magazines check out poses, look online too at wedding photographers, this is a great way to get ideas, make a list of the shots you NEED to get like the kiss, exchanging of rings...and the family shots you need to get like father of bride with wife, grooms family, brides family...ect...(there can be alot of those) but they are rather easy, that will be the bulk of your posed images, and take time with the bride and groom for their pics, this is where you want to get some good candid ones also, make them act like you aren't even there, as for the guests...just random pics of people interacting can always be fun, also pay attention to the dance floor you will get some great shots from that,  and when the majority of the people are eating take that time to take detail pics, people don't usually like images of them with their mouth wide open eating food...ick...but take pics of the decorations details details details and have fun!

after all the good advice you have had and taken some wonderful shots, check out the web site at  www.jessops.com where the details can be found of making a book from selected pictures. a faux leather book XL costs £29.99



You need to find out the important people to keep in focus !!!  keep calm and take pictures which are natural andunusual. Good luck.

from my past experience of covering the shoot for 2 weddings::

1. Charge Properly the batteries.
2. Must take some picture of the bride and groom seperately.
3. Try to catch the couple moments with their close ones.
4. Try to use different colors to get the fill properly.
5. Monochrome colors can be used for specific moments.
6. Try to focus on the couples eye. They speak most than anything else in the ceremony.
7. Look out for the special smile that couple share together.
8. Catch the moody guests reacting to the ceremony.

Hope it helps you.Best of Luck.

Take photos of EVERYTHING.

Any shot is worth something, this event is can't be redone.



Try to bring extra batteries if at all possible. The worst thing is when you come to a photo shoot with dead batteries.



Always ask if you think someone doesn't want their photo taken.



And have fun!

1. Get a list of must have shots from the bride
2. Check out the lighting before the ceremony
3.  You will probably have to use a higher ISO during the ceremony
4.  Use a medium tele photo lens ( 70-300 works great)
5. Watch for color casts from stained glass windows
6. Stand where you have a clear field of view( back of the sanctuary during the ceremony)  Front of the sanctuary at the grand entrance( Father walking bride down the aisle)
7.  Figure out how to be 3 places at once!  LOL
8.  Use a flash bracket so you can get flash off to the side of and above the lens
9. If the bride is wearing a white gown- close down 1/2 to one stop ( slightly under expose) to keep the details in the gown and from blowing pout the highlights
10. Most important- have fun!  Weddings are a blast!

using tea is easy! just soak the tea bag in a little hot water then pull it out, squeeze it out a little so it doesn't soak your paper, then rub it on the paper it should discolor it and make it look old. do this before you write on it so the ink doesn't run.
also burn the edges a little, be careful with the fire and don't burn to much!

lightly burning the edges makes it look rather aged. Coffee usually ends up ruining your papers unless you are really good at it.

Coffee and tea both work well---you can spray the pages, soak them, drip on them, use cups to make rings :} Both are acidic though, so the archival quality is low. Experiment with different types and weights also. 
Nothing will prevent wrinkling after any wet treatment, but if you dry flat or hung on a clothesline and press with an iron, using a presscloth between the paper and the iron, it will help.

Please do not use any place that is free. If you want a website to show off your photos. Then buy a domain, pay for hosting, create a website.
Having free you'll end up with ads on your site. Advertisements are annoying. No matter where you get a free place there will always be a small limit amount of space.

Something quite classy would be something technically related to photography, like Aperture Photography or Focus Photography. How about "Scope Photography" as your business has a wide range of subjects to photograph, or "Wide Angle Photography" or Wide Shot Photography or Exposé (like exposure but frenched up to sound better lol)

thanks everyone for your input. we have taken a lot of the names down and we are gonna ask some of the locals on their opinions, as they are our target market. i like the idea of something technical, or classy but without drifting too far from the photography theme. i also like the idea of initials.

Why not use your and your sister's name. 
When having a photography business, professionally it's best to use your name. 
So for instance it could be..
Sue & Molly Photography.
Or use your last names. (if you're both married or not).

You also have to make sure whatever name you decide on...is not already taken. If you google Flair Photography, there are a couple of businesses with that name.

*obscure angles of the city
* weather in the city
etc
does anyone know any good artists that draw/paint wateva any of these. For example scafolding/buildings/old streets. etc.

i think im gonna base a bit on old streets like the shambles in york. so artists that specialize in street drawings etc would be BRILL!!!!!!

sorry this is such a long question, also the artist have to be quite famous, not like local artists.so that i can find alot of info and pictures of the artist.

If you are really serious about making photography a career then plan on attending photography school. The site http://www.photographyschools.com lists schools by state and discipline.

To get started, I always suggest a nice 100% manual 35mm film camera with the Owner's Manual and a 50mm f1.7 lens. The Pentax K1000 or a Minolta SRT-202 or a Canon FTb would all be good choices. Using a 100% manual camera will help you learn about f-stops and shutter speeds and ISO.

Buy the book "Object & Image: An Introduction To Photography, Third Edition" by George M. Craven and you will be on your way to learning about photography. You will begin to understand composition and light as well as f-stops and shutter speeds and ISO. The book "How To Select & Use Pentax/Minolta/Canon (choose your make) SLR Cameras" by Carl Shipman is also worth having. It is an expansion of the Owner's Manual.

I know most everyone else will tell you to buy a digital camera and just take 1,000's of pictures. IMO this is very poor advice since it does not encourage actually learning anything about photography. A person in here once said that if they took 1,000 pictures and got 1 good one they were happy. You'd get better results, IMO, if you just gave the camera to a chimpanzee.

Photography requires thinking. Thinking requires slowing down. Slowing down allows you to look at a scene from different angles and try different compositions.

Go to a library check out the photography section. Also google alot. There are so many websites out there to help you.
If you want to someday make photography your career, then buy a DSLR. There are so many brands, (Nikon, Canon, Sony etc..) You'll have to choice which is best for you.
Check out dpreview.com for reviews on cameras. Then go to a local store and play around with the cameras.
Keep in mind, photography is expensive. So first figure out what kind of photography you like to get into...
portrait
commercial
landscape
wildlife
etc..
Depending what you shoot will depend what kind of lens you need to buy.
I think you should buy a digital camera. I do believe starting out with film photography you learn more, but only in the sense if you are developing your own film. It's becoming harder to find the chemicals to develop the film. Plus if you want to develop your own film you'll have to also learn that trade.  If you get a digital camera, in a sense you'll still have to learn how to use the digital darkroom (photoshop) but I find it easier to use.
Lighting is very important when it comes to photography. Then theres composition (rule of thirds). Keep in mind, if you want to make this a career you're going to have to think out of the box to create photos that sell.

A BIG problem. Optical laws mean you need lots of light but to capture movement you need a fast shutter speed or a small aperture all with a fast setting.
Definitely prop the camera on a rest if you open the iris.
Flash will be useless unless you are really close.
Try ISO 400 or greater
f 8
shutter speed 1/60th*
Follow a dancer (Swivel camera on rest) and click.The dancer will be sharp but the rest will not be.
*It seems slow but if you and the dancer are moving together it will work.
Have fun.
ps try shooting any moving stuff with you following it before you do the gig to see what happens.

I know a lot about photography, but I love to learn new things about it, so I'm looking for an online photo class that is FREE to take. I really want one that is interactive and has a community/active teacher so that I can get my work critiqued. Once again it must be FREE to take the WHOLE class! It should also give out daily/weekly assignments and have lots of info to learn from. Thanks!

hp.com has free classes. They run about a week. You have assignments and quizzes. If you pass you even get a certificate. Now in the end I'm not sure how well these classes stand up against getting a photography job, but you do learn things. 
A professional photographer teaches the classes. There is a live chatroom and you can ask questions.

Is there a scientific term for the euphoric feeling one can get after viewing beautiful pieces of art?



I often get this feeling after going to the Art Institute of Chicago. It's a "high" feeling, similar to when one smokes weed.

You might be thinking of the word catharsis. The term was first used by Aristotle to describe a feeling of purification after experiencing an emotional climax watching a tragic play. Today, the term isn't necessarily constricted to describing drama. Scientifically, it was adopted by Freud to describe any emotional release in psychotherapy.

I get the same euphoric feeling walking through the Art Institute (I can't wait for the new modern wing!), and I would most certainly call it cathartic, also awed, inspired, exhilarated, uplifted, compelled... take your pick.

I had never heard of Keith Haring,while Mondrian is a major 20th century artist,who has had considerable influence on modern painting..Mondrian is one of the founding fathers of abstract painting,while Keith's work seems to be more in the primitive,decorative and Symbolist in character.
Both have superficial decorative 2 dimensional qualities but Mondrian's work appears more geometric and asymmetric in composition.
A side by side comparison of apparently similar works would be interesting if you can source work from both artists.Try to research their attitudes to Religion and see if that offers any leads.

I assume you'd be looking at Mondrian's later work. They're very different so I don't know where to start! Mondrian is a cubist painter, works with geometrical shapes focusing on interaction of form and colour. Keith haring is contemporary and does cartoon-like paintings, generally monochrome with white stick-men doing various things, a bit graffiti-like, there's a range of greetings cards with his stuff on. I suppose similarities would be formal; lack of depth and focus on surface, reduction of subject to simple forms and colours- although you'd argue that Mondrian's work is devoid of subject whereas Keith haring's still has representation in the form of figures and narrative.
Don't know if that's any help!

I have used both Nikon and Canon camera systems since the 1970's.  When Canon dumped their old camera system in 1988, I sold my Canon's and have been only buying Nikon products.  From time to time I do use Canon cameras when a client has a certain camera lens combination they need me to use that is not in my Nikon system or I am shooting in a high risk situation where the camera/lens can be damaged or destroyed ...  I use their cameras .. Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Minolta/Sony ... what ever they have.

By the way .... Canon is the camera company ... a cannon is a military weapon.

I am a Nikon person so I usually recommend Nikon But, all the major manufactures make good cameras. With Nikon and Canon having the largest market share. Most photographers are loyal to what they use and like. Go to the stores get them in your hand and find what you like. What fits your hand well, which has the features you want in an easy to use format

I use Nikon. So far I like Nikon. I have never used a Canon, but if someone gave me a canon I would have no problem using it. I would never buy a Canon for I would have to buy all new lenses.

I like Canon, but don't go by others opinions, go to the camera store, hold each one and play with the controls on each one.  Which one fits your hands better, which one do the controls come more natural for you to use, take a few shots with each one and compare the results, which one looks better to you.  Then get the one that fits your hands, the controls feel natural for you, and the one with the results that you like better- that's the camera for you! Be it  Canon or Nikon- both are excellent cameras!

Note: I tried the cannon- way too loud for me, and they make too much smoke too, and get really hot!  :-)  Just joking about the misspelling- You can make fun of me when I misspell something!

Have both.  Use both.

The cameras I use are there for one reason only - because they have the features I need, fit my hand, and fit my budget.

(Okay, so maybe that's three reasons ...)

For 30 years I shot nothing but Pentax.  For the past ten years, it's been Nikon and Canon - mostly because they're farther along in their development of digital than Pentax.

And once you get invested in a particular brand with accesories and lenses, you tend to stay there.  It's too expensive to switch.

I have used both. I learned on a Nikon and used them for several years. I now use Canon and that is mostly by accident. My first employer used Canon and I needed to buy a new camera anyways. The cameras I had at the time were 20 plus years old and I did not have much invested in lenses. It just made sense to get Canon so that I could use his lenses and flashes. I like both and honestly can't say which I would choose if I was starting over again. I guess I would have to go and try them out. Nikon might be better today but tomorrow Canon will be better. The two companies are very competitive and will go back and forth with new innovations. If one comes out with a major advancement the other will quickly follow.

I chose to go with Olympus instead of Nikon or Canon. Olympus provided a better value, more features for the money and still cost less. If I had to choose between Nikon and Canon, I would go with Canon. I recently read a Consumer Reports 2008 buying guide that showed that Olympus and Canon DSLR cameras had a repair rate of 4%, Sigma was 5%, while Nikon was at 7%. That's good enough for me.

The term secondary colours is used in several ways.
Basic colour theory,
Colour printing,reprographic.
Colour printing,chemical photography,this divides into several sections



pos/neg



neg/pos



- additive process



-subtractive process
Applications digital.-RGB



sRGB



CMYK
I know this is not quite what you asked but it will lead you into most aspects of colour work in Photography today.Knowing what questions to ask is half the battle,you can tailor your research to the specifics of your course.
Most books on Photography include some of these in their introductory section.The Focal Guide to Photography is a very good starting point.

You're probably best off streching your own canvas if you want one that's round  Or buy a pre-made, cardboard-backed canvas and cutting a circle out of it (provided you can find one big enough).  Your work feels much more satisfying when you've done all the work yourself.

If you only need a small canvas the wooden frames that are used for embroidery are available in most dress making shops,where you may also find a light weight canvas that is suitable.
Canvas can be glued onto plywood with PVA glue,if you can get a circular piece cut.

Does it have to be stretched canvas?



The reason I'm asking is because there are other ways of dealing with this. You could, for example, cut out some MDF in a circle, sandpaper it gently and put a primer on it, or you could turn it into a canvas board by soaking your canvas in either rabbin-skin glue or PVA glue and simply stretching over the board and neatly folding it around the back. You will need to make sure your board doesn't warp though, and the best way of doing this would be to attach it onto a square or frame of 2 by 1 pieces, to stabilise it.



Good luck!
