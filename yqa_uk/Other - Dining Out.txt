What lovely places are there to take a date for dinner in East Grinstead?  Why is it good...



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There are loads of places in East Grinstead!

I would say the nicest for a date would be either La Forola which is on the one way system, youcan choose to have tapas or choose from the normal menu. Portafino is halfway down London Road and thats a really nice italian. Prezzo is on the High Street and thats lovely too (i think that would be my favourite!)

Also there are a couple of chinese places, Wing Wah or Evergreen both on the one way system (go to evergreen)

Mae Ping is a thai place on Railway Approach

Indians (probably not so good for a date!) include:

Azad on the one way system, Nizam and Monsoon on the High Street or the new one on Kings Street next door to the atrium called Exquisite

Then you've got pizza house, pizza express and good old mcdonalds!

Have fun! x

Is it wrong to make sure an almost 2 year old boy is seated down at a restaurant? ?



i went out with my in laws and husband and my sister in law let her child run around the restaurant. at one point he ended up sitting with a family at their table. after that happened i was watching out for him, but i thought they should have made him sit down while we waiting for our food to arrive especially since he had crowns to draw with. is it really that difficult to have a 2 year old sit down? i am very annoyed that my sister in law barely paid attention to her son and i had to listen to her preteen child complain throughout the entire day. is it wrong if i don't go over to see them? they don't want to change anything and they always say how my niece behaves really well for me and they always want me to make sure she's good, but it's not my responsibility.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



no, there is nothing at all wrong with that. as a matter of fact, it is expected. if a person can not control their child to a degree in public they shouln"t take them out. maybe that person needs to re-evaluate who is the child and who is the parent in that family and work on making some changes to get some parental control or get some help if they don"t know what to do.

How about Indian? Thats what I'd chose. But Indian tends to be quite expensive, and fish and chips is probably the cheapest, but you can have that all the time. Chinese is also expensive, but really yummy. The trouble is, you will have to order quite alot in order to have a proper Chinese meal. Pizza is really yummy and also cheap, so here is my 'result table' =)

Pizza
Indian
Chinese 
Fish and Chips



So I'd pick pizza. Your choice, my friend!

thats a toughy.I would probably choose pepsi but I wouldn't want soda for the rest of my life compared to other drinks. and I'd probably choose a peanutbutter sandwich since that works well for both breakfast and lunch/dinner.it's not my fav food but I just choose it because it works either way,except I wouldn't want that with soda!if soda is the only drink choice,then pizza I guess...

Hmm, I agree with the above answer the type of font is important. If its a lame name a cool font can fix that, a graphic designer can fix that. I think a cool old looking font would be cool. And names hmm...

Love, wine (like a letter)

Can Panera workers help me out?



Hi, fellow Panera Bread employees! I've worked at Panera for about 7 months now and they are FINALLY going to start my training for line. Problem is, I have HORRIBLE memory skills and I know you must have that when making sammiches, if you want to do it quick enough.



Is there any way someone could tell me a technique they used to memorize how to make a sammich, what goes on that sammich, etc. etc.? For example... could you list all the current sandwiches and put the items that go on it in order of assembly?

Like... say... Bacon Turkey Bravo:
Tom basil.
Mayo
Bravo Sauce
Lettuce
Tomato
Turkey
Gouda
Bacon
Tom. Basil Bread

(see? I can't even remember if that's the correct way to make it!) I just need some help on this memorization stuff. I mean, it was easy to memorize bakery drinks because they are all mostly the same thing. But sandwiches are different. I just want to be good at my job.

Thanks so much for your help!

Anybody like the restaurant cracker barrel?



i love that place. 
the food is great and i could shop there all day. 
i first started going when we were on our way to florida. and every year i'd find things i really wanted and my parents would secretly buy them and then give them to me fro xmas. (we would go to florida at the end of november to it wasn't that long after i saw something awesome that i would get it.)
once i saw this troll doll that was a baby girl, it was like the size of a baby doll not really little like a troll. and it had pink hair and a pink sleeper on. its name was pukie and my parents said it reminded them of me cuz they'd call me pukie cuz when i was a baby i puked all the time. lol. well i really wanted it and they told me i couldn't get it. then on xmas i got it and i couldn't figure out how they did it cuz we didn't have cracker barrels near us. 
i just love that place sooo much. 
for years now we have had one about 20 minutes away from our house and go once a month. 
just curious to see if any one else like it there. 
and have you ever noticed that is smells like apples and Cinnamon when you walk in? that smell brings me good memories.

I'm from the UK and have been to Florida a couple of times and it's always been my fave place to eat whilst out there. The breakfast is gorgeous, the shop is full of interesting things, dinner is wholesome and yum and HUGE and I love all the rocking chairs out on the front porch - so quaint! You are so lucky to be able to eat there once a month!

I used to love it. The food quality has always been excellent. I grew up on homemade food. The first salad I had there was loaded with croutons and bacon. Believe me those were absolutely homemade. I still like to go when I feel like splurging. Unfortunately like everywhere else the prices have gone up and the portions have gotten much smaller over the past 10 years.

Have a look at meal deals in your area or the places you want to go. Making him dinner is also a good idea. You can get far with Â£30 if you do things yourself. You can get relatively cheap but nice wines from Tesco or Sainsbury's. Have you tried the Martini Champagne? It's very good and is priced around Â£5 to Â£8 depending on where you get it. You can get a nice desert for after the meal... hmm. You can always stay in and watch a movie after the meal, put some candles around the places and make it look romantic. You don't always need go out to have a good time! Have a night of all his favourite things! :) good luck!

As a kid, did you order things like Mac N Cheese or a Hot Dog at a Sit Down Restaurant?



I remember when I was a kid (back in the 80's) I loved the few times a month were my family would go out to eat. I could get foods that I rarely had at home. Fried Chicken, tasty burgers with several toppings, fried french fries (opposed to just baked), and even a half a duck when I was 10 or 11. There was no way I would even consider getting something that I could easily have at home...I'm wondering was I just different, or have the kids changed? I know I would have never been the kid running up and saying "Mommy, mommy can we buy this 6 pack of bottled water" Water comes out of the faucet and was free, if I was going to ask for something it was going to be chips or pop.

No when I was at a restaurant I too ordered things i could not get at home. What the point of a treat if I am going to get something I can get at home. I agree with you a hundred percent. lol. no asking for bottled water. However I think that alot of kids today are sheltered so if they dont know what the special stuff is on the menu they may be intimidated and not want to break out of the comfot zone. I have taken adults out to dinner and they have ordered chicken tenders nad buffalo wings. That annoys me. If you are going to order chicken fingers then you could have gone to the local McDonalds

We ate out fairly frequently when I was a kid. I usually got chicken fingers, fries, and a coke. I'm 23 now, I don't remember them even having hot dogs as a menu choice. It was usually smaller portions of things from the regular menu. I wasn't really restricted from much when I was a kid though, so it didn't matter much to me. I was a picky eater though (still am to an extent) so I almost ways at chicken, whether it was at home or out.

I think offering hot dogs and mac-n-cheese are for the really picky kids. Or a lot of kids like eating what they are used to eating. Probably easier to get a little kid to eat a hot dog than it is to order something new and try to persuade them to try it too.

I agree its not the most healthiest food selection to have.  When I go there I typically just order coffee.  Fast food places are dirty anyways because of the mishandling of the foods.

What is that curved metal pole attached to a bartop at a bar (where you drink)? what is it's purpose/history?



i've googled it but cannot find it anywhere -- and the darn waitress at the pub didn't know either! lolol i so want to know!
To best explain it, it is the one that starts on the inside of the bartop (where the bartenders are) and wraps itself around the bartop downward and ends underneath the bartop where the customers are. It's not really used for anything so it's goes so unnoticed but it's ALWAYS there. lol thx

Service Bar Rail--it blocks off the "service area" to keep customers from sitting there and blocking the wait staff.

I think it's there for people (barstaff+customers) to rest their feet on while standing at the bar. That's what i use it for anyway!. I thunk it's quite an old-fasioned thing.

Smart trousers & a nice top. You don't want to be too casual in Pizza Hut, but not too smart either, if you're bowling afterwards.

You can work at any which will hire you.  As you're just beginning in this area, I would look for an opening in a
place like Chili's, T.G.I.F. or I.H.O.P. where you can gain experience for a few years.  Don't forget that the main things they will be looking for are someone very neat in appearance with a friendly smile.  I wouldn't apply to a McDonald's or Kentucky Fry type of place as the better restaurants won't consider the experience you get to be of much value.
