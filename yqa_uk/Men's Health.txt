Set up a group on facebook inviting all single sex hungry women to provide you with some free steamy webcam sex, get there details and away you go. Otherwise you would pay, the sex industry is big business hence the expensive charges for viewing such material. 
The other option is get a girlfriend.

The risk of pregnancy with no contraceptive measures is 60%, ( not 100%), using the so called 'withdrawal method' is aproximately 30%. This means that withdrawal reduces the risk of pregnancy by no more than 50%. This of course makes it a pretty worthless method of contraception.

yeah it is normal. there is no negative effects from masturbating. enjoy it while you can before you get old and are not able to experience an erection anymore. thats what it is there for and if you dont use it then it is going to waste. good luck.

rarely do boys get erections when being checked around their penis, even very horny ones
you could try jacking off if you knew when the exam was
but then your penis make leak some semen
the doctor may not even touch your penis or scrotum anyway, most of the exams for sports are just a quick look

Nope, I see no reason why it's wrong. The water from the sink ends in the same place as the water from the toilet, so as long as you rinse it out, no problem.

Plus, it stops the women whining about putting down the seat.

It's not what its made for.. Its not wrong either.. If you need to go and for whatever reason you cant go in the toilet then pee in the sink.. Just make sure you completely wash the sink out afterwards with bleach to stop bacteria.. If you are just doing it regularly I suggest you do the normal thing and pee in the toilet :)

It is wrong but having said that i remember doing it at some football games i went to watch because the urinals were all being used, make sure you leave the tap running, do not do it at home.

I don't know how to tell you whether it's right or wrong.

It is not unsanitary or unhygenic, as people have said. It is gross, the way most people thing. Urine is not especially dirty or dangerous.

It depends on whose sink it is and what it's used for. If it's a laundry tub and you leave the water running, it shouldn't make much difference. If it's the kitchen sink and there are dirty dishes in it, I think most people would consider it wrong.

Shaving your legs would just be like shaving your face.  Not painful, unless you cut yourself.  Once you start shaving multiple times though, it will be something you need to keep up with, b/c it won't grow back in like it is right now.  It will be stubbly, just like your face.

You have what is called a bashful kidney.  The only way to overcome it is to go into a stall and urinate there.  Basically desentize yourself until you can do it in the urinals with other guys standing around.

It's what's medically know as stage fright. A common syndrome amongst blokes who feel insecure about the size of their penis or generally un-confident when getting their nob out. Try to concentrate on a particular point on the urinal and pi$$ at that and don't think about anything around you. Then you should be fine.

I have the same problem friend, i need to walk into a empty quite public toilet, if its crowded it puts me right off having a jimmy, you have a mental block and must be stressed up about not being able to wee.

What i do that often works at football games is listen or quickly glance at some other bloke going, your soon start going yourself, if the situation is such that you still cant start just stand their calmly wait for a quite minute when you can tell your willy to start peeing.

Have you tried going in a lockup? i prefer to sit down and go that way as i get quite embarressed in a lockup cubicle.

I once had a copper at brighton walk up to me in a toilet trying to wee and he said what you doing, you've standing there over ten minutes, i showed him my willy was relaxed and explained i cant start with other men around, he apologised and said i wish you luck mate.

It is called paruresis or shy bladder syndrome. I have had this problem too. What I usually try to do is just wait for a toilet stall to become available. However, if I must use a urinal then I found a diversion technique that helps me focus on my body and the task at hand and not the people around me. It relaxes me and kind of shuts out the other people nearby.

I simply take my finger tip and thumb and place the pad of the thumb on top of the glans at the ribbed section and the index finger pad a bit below the underside of the glans and with a very gentle touch/brushing/sweeping across (it should be just light enough so you can feel it, no heavy pressure at all. and no it is not masturbation, it only just enough sweeping across to feel the pad brushing across the glans) I pull my two fingers across across the glan to where they will touch each other at the tip and then keeping the fingers together I go past the tip a inche or more into the empty space to visualize the urine flowing out past the penis and into the urinal (of course I don't sweep my hand where it touches the urinal but you get the point, sweep it out far enough to be able to get the visual and kinetic feel that it is flowing in that direction). While doing this I have the mental intention that this action is helping me gently draw the urine through my uretha almost like a magnetic force pulling it through. Sometimes I have to use the finger motion along with the mental intention for several passes before the urine starts to flow, it doesn't take long to do this procedure and I have found it very effective for me. Let me tell you there was times that I drank so much water and had to go so bad I thought I would bust before having developed this technique. Now, I can drink a lot of water and will usually lock up as usual until I use the technique then it flows freely.

Give it a try, hope it works out for you.

A variation of this technique that I use sometimes also is to just use your index finger and brush it along the outside sides of the glan up to the tip several times with the intentions metioned previously. It is a little simpler modification of the above procedure but I think the first procedure is more effective.

EDIT: oh, and btw, what in the world were the restroom designers thinking when they don't add the privacy wall between urinals, those are the worst! well almost the worst, now that I think of it I remember a few places where I went that didn't even had urinals but had troughs (and to top it off one of them was not linear but rather circular in shape talk about awkward having another guy on the far side of the trough across from you!), ugh!!!

How can I ejaculate more times in one day?



I've just started becoming sexually active with this girl I really like and we have a great time together.  I'm 22, and she's probably the wildest girl than I have ever experienced.  I am able to establish and maintain an erection for hours of passion, but I seem to only be able to ejaculate once in the course of 24 hours.  I feel satisfied but it's a little embarrassing to have to say "no really that was good! I'm just out."  Are there any methods to increasing the amount I have to unload over the course of a few hours?



I just wish I could "show" her how much I appreciate what she does for me.

Women have been faking orgasms for years, men can too. If she's that wild she's probably going to have a lot of fluid in there. When you're done, go through the act, flex it a few times and collapse. She might be slightly confused that she didn't feel your stuff, but stick to the story, she'll buy it. I had a girlfriend that thought she could get me off three or four times in a two hour period.

If you really want to show her how much you appreciate her you should tell her how much you do. It's nice when guys "show" it but its nice to hear it. But as to your original question, take vitamins and eat healthy and exercise a lot. It will increase your sex drive and possibly make you c*m more than once.

you removed the protective covering, the tip is not meant to be exposed to the environment, the tip has to build up tissue to protect it, this scar tissue does reduce sensitivity though

First of all, why did you wait so long to get him circumcised? I'm sure it's not a pleasant experience, although luckily, my parents had it done when I was young enough so that I wouldn't have to remember it forever.

Secondly, your surgeon probably knows what he's talking about. I suggest you talk to him if you have any questions about this subject, not yahoo answers.

Sorry we still do this in modern age....

It happened because somebody took a knife to a part of the body that didn't need to be cut off.  Scar tissue is what happens when tissue is cut, it tries to heal.



The result will be conformity to a false norm, so his will look like his daddies, or so a cultural tradition will be maintained.



Sensitivity will also be reduced.  Hopefully the infection that it was originally intended to stop some thousands of years ago, will not take over this time.

If anyone is thinking of circumsizing their children, and reading this, please consider letting this be an adult decision, HIS.

You need to give this poor little penis time to adjust to its new environment. That scar tissue must have been there a long time. Over a period of months, the whitish hue will disappear as the cells are shed. AS the healing progresses the colour will become pinker and this will be gradual. At first your son will go thr' a stage where his glans may peel and look a but stranger than it does right now,(rather similar to sunburn).
If your son is comfortable, that is the most important thing. Try to make sure that he has some sort of non-stick dressing directly over the operative site. A lot of surgoens use large amounts of Vaseline topped with a liberal thickness of gauze. Anything that takes the rubbing of underwear away from his glans will help significantly. Also tight underwear works better than loose because it compresses the swollen tissue.
I hope that your surgeon gave you lots of instruction in caring for it. The circumcision normally heals very rapidly and this was a preferable scenario than waiting until his teens when he may be more embarrassed.
You were very wise not to discuss the appearance with the doctor in your boy's presence. He is going to appreciate your sensitivity later.
Be sure to ask your GP about any of your concerns.Despite a lot of propaganda that you may have been exposed to about this very simple procedure, he needed this surgery and he will function normally

The risk of pregnancy  with no contraceptive measures is 60%, ( not 100%), using the so called 'withdrawal method' is aproximately 30%. This means that withdrawal reduces the risk of pregnancy by no more than 50%. This of course makes it a pretty worthless method of contraception.

first off, SEMEN. not SEA men. if it comes out your penis, you should at least know how to spell it. Second, OF COUSE YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY PREGNANT THAT WAY. That wet substance leaking out just a little is the same substance as the substance that comes out a LOT a little later on. And if you don't even know that, you probably shouldn't even be having sex.

It's always best to wear a condom. What you're thinking of is the "pull-out" method, and it probably won't work. I was thinking the same thing, but then I looked into it a little more, and it won't work. Precum has small amounts of sperm in it (the stuff that leaks out that you were talking about), so it's possible to get her pregnant even if you do pull out.

Case and point - wear a condom.

When a man is about to ejaculate he usualy thinks he can take it out, and se wont get pregnant, if he just ejaculates on the bed or somthing

two problems exisit with this, the most important is, precum, this is where a tiny drop of semen and urine travels out the penis, as the bodys way of testing if it will make it out, and clearing the tubes of the penis, and this precum can get a girl pregnant

also, when you pull out, if even a DROP gets anywhere near her you know what, she can get pregnant, its a slight chance, but it happens.



so either, do oral, or use the condom or birth control

the substance you had before you ejaculate sperm, i think it's semen

and i had check a review on it

From about.com



"Besides sperm, semen is made up of 65 per cent of fluid from the seminal vesicles, 30 to 35 per cent from the prostate and 5 per cent from the vasa. Semen contains citric acid, free amino acids, fructose, enzymes, phosphorylcholine, prostaglandin, potassium, and zinc. The amount of semen produced varies from a few drops to about 6 ml."

So.. the liquid you had it leak on your penis is just normal.. i had it when i masturbate too

You might want to shave in the areas you trimmed being very careful to do so. I've trimmed and shaved since High School and once you get used to it, it's much more comfortable. Definitely use shave gel with aloe and a new razor and do it in the shower so everything is easier.

Ordinary "run of the mill porn" isn't illegal - you probably won't be popular with your parents if you look at porn sites.  Looking for/at child pornography is most definately illegal.

I would recommend that you stay clear of porn sites.  The porn you would see is not real and will most probably give you a complex.  Just get on with life, meet a girl, get married eventually and lead a normal happy sex life with your wife.

You can delete your list of viewed websites and web history.
On windows go to control panel, internet options, and click on delete history.
As for the police, im not sure they mind if you look at porn unless its illegal stuff, in which case you will probably get found out.

I need to know an anti fungal cream to treat the inflammation of foreskin. In particular the skin that attaches to the end of penis is bit red and slightly larger than normal. I believe i have balanitis, and i need to know of a cream to purchase from the chemist to treat the balanitis which is caused by growth of fungi..

If I get inflammation  I bathe  the knob & foreskin daily with
Surgical spirits.  (NOT YOUR TESTICLES)

Best set and rep range to increase muscle mass?

8 reps is around ideal for muscle building, but if you've hit a plateau, maybe drop reps and up weight for a little.  That would target strength, when strength goes up, you could ease the reps back up and try to break the plateau that way.

Seeing as though you're going for hypertrophy, maybe try successive sets.. e.g

First Excersise - 3 sets 5-6 Reps
Second Excersise - 3 sets 8-10 Reps
Third Excersise - 5 Sets 8-10 Reps

Should bust the plateau in two weeks.

Two Ways to Deal With This, Informed or Un-Informed:

Uninformed: You can continue to hid and be ashamed of your issue, to the point where it begins to affect your life and the way you interact socially and intimately.

or

Informed: Go to the doctor and find out what type of in balance you MAY have, or if it can be fix or adjusted rather quickly.

Don't be ashamed to go to the doctor. Chances are, you are one of 3 Million people with the same issue and the doctor is just tired of seeing those with your condition. :-)

The Doctor is professional (mostly), there is not laughing and pointing at your nipples. That's cause for a lawsuit. Imagine that.

i have the same thing. i just try to be more active. i think if you be active more in the day and keep yourself busy you'll end up tiring yourself out and sleeping at a normal time. its probably the sleeping pattern. the latest you should sleep is probably 11 or 12.

Are you getting any sleep at night?  I just had blood test for the same problem.  I literally fell asleep while eating.  This has been happening a lot, but, I don't get much sleep at night either.  My test showed nothing.  I started drinking that 5 hr drink in the red bottle.  It's all B vitamins and it really works.  If you stay awake during the day, you will be able to get a good night sleep.  That's the best advice I can give you from a personal experience.  Hope it works for you.

you're becoming a ...vampire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



lol jk. dude get some rest, drink water, and when you get on your bed only use it to sleep instead of read a book or homework that way everytime u get into bed you will be more prone to fall asleep

also have you been traveling or going on airplanes maybe jetlag so what you want to do if u traveled or not is to wake up at 7am, bring your face into the sunlight for like more than 5 minutes and you should reset your circadian rhythm. that way you will go to sleep and won't get much tired heheh

and maybe you should drink lots and LOTS of water as even a small amount of fluctuation in your hydration level will make you feel fatigue, or headaches, or etc. I  prefer you drink filter water from the sink rather than bottle water as it kills the environment and plus its more cheaper to buy a filter. I reccommend aquasana filter. just search it.

and did the blood test checked your liver also?

This is a difficult question to answer.  There are men who choose to never get married.  Some men don't find the right woman until much later in life.  I feel that it is better to wait for the right one than to jump into marriage just because it is what is expected of him.  It is normal for a man to masturbate, especially if he is not getting sex on a regular basis.  The "issues" can't receive an answer until they are known.  If he is not comfortable talking about them with family or friends, he could try a therapist, a doctor, a pastor, or anyone else he could get good answers from.  Yahoo answers is not always the best place to get the right answers.  We don't know him or have the ability to ask him additional questions.

Well, having been hogtied for over 30 years i dont see not wanting to get married as any way abnormal. To stay married you spend your whole life compromising, if you want to go your own way without compromise, stay single. Seriously, in many ways marriage is an un-natural state. I hate shopping, yet what am i doing every weekend, being dragged around the shops by the wife - who half the time does not buy anything. What a waste of time when i could be out fishing or at the footy.

You did ejaculate "real" c*m. The frist few times you ejaculate will be clear. That's normal. And it may not even trun white. Some guys always have clear c*m. 
So you did have an orgasm and you did ejaculate. That wasn't pre-*** it was the real thing.

Height Does not matter and it defend an your genetic if your parents are tall or short. I'm 15 and im 5'4 and i weight 135 pounds because i do gym a lot. Like 3 times a week. Lift weighting does not stop your growth. 
What should you do is just eat healthy foods and exercise or do weight. 
Also don't be scared just wait till you grow up. The growth in human height mostly in about 18 to 19 years old that will you stop growing up.

You cant really get taller... thats genetic.  Stay away from sugar and bread, that also stunts growth to a small degree.  Its never a good idea to lift weights that young, but do some body-weight workouts (pushups, pullups, situps etc)  and youll be cut and athletic within 6 months at the most, probably like 3.  then just keep it up and youll get bigger.

Right now you can get into outdoor sports like - soccer, tennis, swimming (best) etc which will make you both strong and open up your joints for more growth. You can work with small weights but don't try to overdo it till you have had your full vertical growth.

And also eat well - greens, vegetables, milk, vitamins, etc.

With both good competitive workout and nutrition you would pave way for a stronger and taller you!

Sorry buddy you can't control your growth. You will most likely end up as tall as your father unless your mother was way taller or shorter than him. But what you CAN do is drink 2 glasses of milk everyday to support proper growth. Also, don't skip meals. Eat well. If you don't eat well, your body won't have nutrients to grow. Also, make sure you sleep well. Don't stay up late all the time because your body does all of its growing in your sleep. So no sleep = no growth. Also remember that you have a LONG time to grow. Men don't stop growing until about 21

To get stronger, you can always take up weightlifting. Join your high school JV wrestling team. They take people of all sizes and dont worry you wont wrestle rambo, just people your size lol. But ALL wrestling teams have a weightlifting regiment. I guarantee you that you'll be ALOT stronger by the end of the season. Don't worry if you don't know how to wrestle, you're not supposed to, and they'll teach you.

Best of luck to you my friend

Or.... maybe you should go to the store and buy wart remover and see what happens?

It could be a blood clot?

if you are doing a full body workout, 2 days should be sufficient.  But are you lackign the time?  It's best, in my experience, to divide up muscle groups to workout, but full body workouts are for ppl lackign the time to do so.  So you are on the right track.  Besides, kick boxing is a good toning and muscle developing exercise also.  good luck

Kickboxing is very cardio based. While it may help build muscle, you really should do strength training, using weights if possible. This will ensure you build muscle mass. As far as if you work out 4 days a week or only 2 days, it does not matter. Just add some weights into your workout and you will build more muscle.

3 out of 7 Is noraml. But 5 days out of 7 is really good. And if you are trying to build certain muscles you are going to have to change your work out daily. If you want arm muscles dont work on them every other day. Work on your lower body, working on just that one area could leave you aching.One of the days should also be a kind of slow day, like just stretching, I dont know why its good for you though.

Can't Stop masturbation and having erection problems..?



Somebody  please help me!!
 Masturbation has become an obsession it interferes with my daily routine and sex life. I masturbate instead of spending time on more important things on a daily basis. I can't stop masturbating, even though I promise myself not to, i just cant stop.



I forced my self and didn't masturbate 4 days but at end I masturbated 4 times a day. Because of this I cant get erection when I am trying to have an intercourse with woman although when I am watching porn I have hard rock erection.



one of my friends suggested me to use Viagra, now i cant have sex without it and I am only 20!!! I am feeling very depressed and blaming my self. Im afraid I will have psychological problems.

Please HELP ME OUT..

Well tossing of isn't causing your problems. Seems to me that you might have some anxiety when it comes to intercourse... viagra certainly helps that situation... it allows you to get an erection despite the anxiety. I'm sure once you are more comfortable with your partner, you will not need the viagra. Your current despair is the likely cause of the problem my friend. Now that you know this, rationalise it and take it easy... just do it... lol.

Don't you worry, buddy. A little masturbation never hurt anyone and likely has little to do with your performance in bed with woman. If you feel you're truly obsessed you may want to see a sex therapist. 4 times a day is alright as long as it isn't in Mom's bedroom.



I will star this question for you so people like dear Icy above me can convince you that anxiety is the cause of your problems and because the expression "hard rock erection" had me on the floor for ten minutes. Go Flinstones!

C*um/ejaculation question?



ok im 14. i never ejaculated before. today i masturbated and had a clear liquid come out like 5 secs after the orgasms so i asked questions on here. i tried it again and this time it came out clear but it took like 10-15 secs. for some reason i think im just urinating abit. is there any way to tell. if it is c*m it is watery not chunky. i noticed  that it felt cold and i no urine is kinda warm if that helps u figure it out. just tell me if it was urine or c*m and why is it coming out a few secs after the orgasm. ya so its cold clear and chunky free like a liquid. kinda like water came out of my penis

yeah this is definitely ***. the reason it's cold (colder than pee anyway) because it came from your balls which are outside your body in order to keep the sperm cooler i.e. away from your core heat inside your body. And as for the reason it comes after sex, is just that that's how it goes. It's different for all guys but i think 15 seconds is still ok

c*m is not always chunky.  It starts out liquidy, and then the more you do it the chunckyr it gets. Plus if your penis is wet while you are doing it it tends to be more liquidyish

You'll probably get a load of exagerrated claims here but mine's about 6-6 1/2 inches long erect.. anything up to that when flaccid. It can look scarily tiny sometimes.

I think you should be truthful to your parents about this issue and I really suggest you should try to stop.



First of all, smoking is illegal at your age and second of all, it will harm you. Your lungs will get bad later and there will be so many other problems for you.
I suggest you quit smoking and do something you enjoy such as doing homework and studying! Remember that learning is fun!

PLease help, I need to know what to do with this relationship that was so good up until now! And I think he ate my toenail cuz I didn't find it.....

lol, you had a right to kick that lil bugger. he deserved it. just tell her it was out of complete pain reflex because of the sharp pain, like you bend over when you get the air knocked out of you. If he tore your nail off, show her that and she should believe why. don't postpone you marriage if you really love her. its the big things you love, and the small things you get used to.

Question about Viagra...?



I have never had a problem "standing at attention" but a friend of mine gave me a Viagra to try, so I said, "What the hell?" and took it. My girlfriend arrived home shortly and we quickly engaged into sexual activity. I reached climax, but my member remained at attention. This was thrilling for my girlfriend as we had sexual intercourse immediately following the first time. Here is where it gets fishy: After doing this two more times I still have a major rager that is showing no signs of going down. What should I do?

I don't know... most of these people's answers are sooooooooooo wrong!!!!! In the morning, it's morning wood. It just happens to guys (not all). Their hormones rage so sometimes you catch them with a *****, other times it just happens. And yes older men experience it. And no it does not mean that they are necessarily sexually active.
