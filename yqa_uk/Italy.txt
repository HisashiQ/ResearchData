90% of Italians are married to their own race. 10% are married to foreigners. The majority of this 10% are married to Romanians and Polishes, according to data of 2007.  It leaves a fraction of percentage in this 10%  the room for other races such as people from other european countries, black, asians, Arabians.

Therefore, the conclusion is, they love spouses of their own race, followed by white europeans, then, others.

However, dating is different from a permanent relationship. They could have dated people of any particular races for 100s of times, but for marriage, mostly likely, once in their life times.

Al Covo
Close to the Arsenal, this small restaurant, decorated with 1960s paintings and Murano lamps, specialises in historical fresh fish dishes of the lagoon. The goby fish (used for the soup or served with gnocchi) is excellent, as are the scallops with pasta, and the mouth-watering chocolate cake. Alternatively, diners can follow owner Cesare Benelli's recommendations on the catch of the day. The tranquil location, professional expertise and personal touch add to the appeal of the two dining rooms. Cash only.

Fortuny Restaurant
Enjoying an intimate dinner with a loved one at the Cipriani's signature restaurant is the quintessential Venice experience and should not be missed by anyone who can afford to splash out. Feast on homemade black noodles served with scallops, clams and broccoli sauce, followed by a rack of lamb in a porcini mushroom and black truffle sauce, as the water from the lagoon laps against the quay and the lights of San Giorgio Maggiore and the Lido shimmer in the distance. A speciality is the Fortuny's first rate carpaccio, while the General Manager's favourite is the sea bass cooked in a salt crust. Lunchtime sees the Fortuny menu served by the swimming pool and an excellent value antipasti buffet from Friday to Sunday, which includes crab and lobster. Complimentary transportation on the hotel's private launch from Piazza San Marco simply adds to the glamour of it all.

Ristorante Cantina Canaletto
Tucked away in an inauspicious street not far from St Mark's Square, Ristorante Cantina Canaletto is a real treat and refreshingly free from the tourist hordes. Split into two distinctive areas, a serene dining room and a buzzing wine bar, the classically styled restaurant has beamed ceilings and an impressive array of wine bottles adorn the walls. Highlights of the menu include white polenta with lagoon shrimps, the best mortadella of Bologna made by Pasquai, grilled sea bass and grilled lobster. An excellent choice for seafood lovers is the starter platter, with eight seafood tasters. Perhaps surprisingly, the Cantina Canaletto also offers a small range of exquisite pizzas, with the Allegra (topped with cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, brie and rocket) being one of the tastiest pizzas served in Northern Italy.

Il Sole sulla Vecia Cavana
This restaurant, owned by Stefano Monti who has Il Sole restaurants in Miami, Paris, Rio de Janeiro and Monaco, is located just a few minutes walk from the Rialto. Il Sole sulla Vecia Cavana serves Venetian and Italian cuisines with a modern twist, using fresh ingredients and delicious Adriatic fish. Try appetising starters like smoked swordfish, carpaccio with strawberry sauce or fresh pasta filled with sea bass, peanuts and pistachio. For mains, sample salmon fillet wrapped in potato crust, served with spinach and mustard sauce, or old Venetian favourites like grilled cuttlefish and polenta.

Al Paradiso Perduto
This noisy and chic osteria, near the Ca'd'Oro, is a popular evening haunt for Venice's students and young professionals and is often open as late as 0200. Paradiso is legendary for its raucous nights and eclectic music and owners Paolo Ellero and Elisabetta Zane have given it a bit of a boost of late. Diners can watch live bands while tucking into the large dishes of tasty pasta and surveying Venice's young and beautiful late into the evening. The rest of the menu is best described as ‘fusion' with the likes of beef fillet with walnuts and plums or lamb chops with avocado and blueberry.

Naranzaria
For buzz and location, Naranzaria is hard to beat. This fun and funky eatery is just a stone's throw from the Rialto, but is a step up both in atmosphere and quality from the area's touristy restaurants. With bright and buzzy staff and simply prepared ingredients, Naranzaria is as much a favourite with trendy Venetians as it is with savvy visitors. Options range from salted cod cooked in tomatoes, black olives and olive oil with clams, through to sushi and sashimi dishes. The wine list is equally creative and impressive. Be sure to book a table on the outside terrace with its sweeping views of the Grand Canal. Closed on Mondays.

Aromi
Instantly amongst the hottest tables in town on opening at the start of summer 2007, the Aromi has far greater ambitions than most bland hotel restaurants. Take a ringside seat outside with views across to the Zattere and the cruise ship berths, and settle in for an upmarket Venetian treat. In the more than capable hands of young chef Franco Luise and bon vivant restaurant manager Lello Zerbini, the Aromi provides a palate satisfying and smooth service treat. Highlights on the menu include dishes laced with local spider crab, mantis shrimp and fresh vegetables from the Rialto Market. Creative touches include mussels and clams wrapped in sea bream with a saffron broth. The chocolate soufflé dessert is sublime.

Orange
If you don't like the colour orange then stay well away from this unmistakable bar/restaurant. Orange abounds everywhere and if you can stomach it the food is good with the likes of a hefty club sandwich, a variety of grilled meat dishes, and a good choice of seafood. Enjoying a prime position on trendy Campo Santa Margherita, Orange also boasts a small garden area and a posing terrace that peers out over the action. This somewhat schizophrenic place works for many tastes, whether you are looking for some oysters and a glass of champagne or something to nibble on while you take in a big football match.

Osteria alla Botte
This small and traditional hideaway rewards those who manage to find it with a variety of affordable wines sold by the glass, carafe or bottle. The mixed tapas cichete mista offered in the bar includes tasty Venetian staples, such as sarde in soar (marinated sardines) whilst the simple cuisine served in the small back dining room is both hearty and delicious. The lasagne al forno and pasta and fagioli bean soup are highly recommended. Trying a little Italian, no matter how bad, will speed up ordering, which is done on a 'loudest shout first' system when the bar area is busy. Always buzzing at nights and a fun place to see and be seen.

Al Giardinetto da Severino
Conveniently located for Piazza San Marco and the Rialto, this friendly and intimate restaurant is popular with local gondoliers and has been run by the same family for half a century. Housed in the 15th-century chapel of the Zorzi family, Al Giardinetto boasts vaulted ceilings and a frescoed fireplace. The restaurant offers dining in the vineyard courtyard during summer and is excellent value for money. Venetian staples dominate the menu, such as calves' liver with fried onions. Simple and tasty fish dishes, such as Venetian-style cuttlefish with polenta, are also a good bet.

Aqua Pazza
Located on an attractive square, this Mediterranean restaurant plays host to a buzzing mix of locals and tourists. The fish specialities such as a starter of peppered mussels or the fish risotto for two are delicious, as are the main dishes. For the more budget conscious, the restaurant's pizzas are good value, and the delicious thick crust frutti di mare comes topped with clams, squid, mussels and prawns. Diners are treated to a complimentary glass of meloncello or limoncello (both sweet fruit flavoured digestifs) to help them wash down a truly enjoyable meal. In summer there are chic white moulded plastic chairs outside on the square.

Brek
This self-service canteen-style chain restaurant located near the train station offers a variety of simple pizza and pasta dishes along with mixed salads, fresh fruit and sweet desserts. The pasta dishes are usually cooked to order in front of you. This healthier and more satisfying alternative to greasy burgers and stale sandwiches also sells alcoholic beverages at reasonable prices.

Da Renato
This is povera cucina (poor man's food) at its best. Renato, the chef and owner, offers a bargain alternative to the gourmet Da Fiore around the corner. His pasta and bean soup is part of an old Venetian tradition, kept on the stove all day to provide an all-in-one meal (piatto unico) for weary gondoliers. The restaurant is highly regarded for its food rather than its interior, which is basic, although inoffensive.

Trattoria alla Madonna
Near the Rialto Bridge, this large bustling trattoria is good value and a favourite with locals and visitors alike. In the daytime, the long tables laid out across the terracotta floor are a great informal place to tuck into a bowl of pasta with fagioli beans. In the evening, the more serious dining gets under way, with seafood specialities such as black squid with polenta and lobster on the menu. The restaurant also offers good meat choices.

Personal Recommendations
Al Ristorante Cip's Club
Cip's Club has an ingredient that is the envy of many Venetian restaurateurs - a stunning view back across the lagoon to St Mark's Square. A more informal alternative to the Cipriani Hotel's signature restaurant, Cip's Club is styled as a pizzeria, grill and dolci bar, serving regional Italian fare, such as pizzas and pasta, as well as afternoon tea, pastries and ice cream. The fish pasta starters such as clams with spaghetti and cherry tomatoes are excellent. Along with the more relaxed atmosphere come slightly more affordable prices. To make the most of the dining experience offered by Cip's Club, visitors should choose a mild day, sink into a chair on the floating pontoon and enjoy the unrivalled views. A highlight of a meal here is the free launch over the lagoon from San Marco.

Caffe Quadri
Like a Merchant Ivory film set, Caffe Quadri serves up a big helping of Venetian history, combining as it does a view over St Mark's Square with palatial furnishings. The refined cuisine draws the crowds, making reservations imperative and pushing up the prices. The saddle of rabbit with ham and shallots glazed in balsamic vinegar is fantastic and the ravioli with veal and white truffle sauce is a must for those who want to splash out - a unique experience worth every penny. Closed on Mondays from November to March.

Il Canova
One of Venice's grandest dining rooms seats 75, but it often feels like you are the only people there with deeply personal service in this candlelit retreat. The menu, under the guidance of young chef Roberto Conighi, concentrates on fresh Venetian specialities with an emphasis on seafood, though the Aberdeen Angus beef Chateaubriand hits the spot for carnivores. The stand-out starter is a light lobster salad with cannelloni beans, which leaves plenty of room for mains like scallops and king prawn kebabs or anglerfish medallions with capers, Ligurian olives and fresh tomatoes. The tiramisu at Il Canova is no mere slice, instead beautifully presented in three sections and accompanied by baicoli biscuits. A glass of prosecco to start, a bottle of excellent Veneto wine and a grappa to wash it all down completes one of the Divine Republic's most sensational dining experiences.

Harry's Dolci
There is no better place to watch the famous sunset over Venice's skyline than from the open-air terrace of Harry's Dolci, located on the island of Giudecca. The highlight of this luxurious and elegant restaurant is the romantic terrace that overlooks the Giudecca Canal. It is also the place to indulge on calorific sweetmeats in the city that first imported sugar to Europe. Famous for its zabaglione (a Marsala-flavoured mousse) and rich pastries, this Cipriani outlet offers both snacks and full meals. Also great on a summer's day, is sitting outside under the festooned awnings.

Osteria Enoteca San Marco
This classy osteria, located a stone's throw from Piazza San Marco, is a step up in both quality and décor from many of the tourist-orientated eateries in the area. It was a revelation on opening a few years back and is still going strong. Noodles with lobster and tender venison are amongst the appetising dishes on offer in the relaxed and rustic setting. The extensive wine list is also excellent. For some, the fact that you cannot get bar service during restaurant hours may grate slightly since it breaks with the tradition of the osteria. Closed Sundays.
