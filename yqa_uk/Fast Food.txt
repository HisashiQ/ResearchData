The stuff I had in Florence was pretty good. In the USA, which I know better, my vote goes to Vinni's Pizzarama in Wayne, New Jersey.

yes

When McDonald's restaurants first opened for trading in Glasgow they did not serve Irn-Bru. This was seen as an insult by some Scots, and a campaign to correct this oversight was launched. After many of their restaurants were picketed, McDonalds relented and began to stock Irn-Bru alongside their other soft drinks.

My sister can't eat the dressings they put on burgers and things at places like Burger King or Macdonalds.  She always has her food plain when we order at the counter.  How many people 'special' order, i.e ask for things to be different to the menu.



If you don't special order, feel free to also chime in and give an answer.

There would be no point. What ever you want left off will more than likely still be included. Ask for no sauce, and you will get sauce in abundance. Ask for a whopper, they ask if you want cheese, when clearly the whopper with cheese has its own place one the menu.

I usually get them to take out the tomatoes in burgers.  It's usually a pretty good idea because then you know the food has been 'freshly' prepared for you and hasn't been sitting on some hot plate for hours and hours going soggy and horrible.

I usually special order. I'm a veg, so at Burger King I get the BK Veggie, but I add cheese. They do say you can "have it your way" after all. Sometimes I get a "burger" but ask them to hold the meat (like the "grilled cheese" at the In-N-Out). We used to order burgers w/o the onions for my dog (cause onions are bad for dogs).



My mother actually used to ALWAYS get some sort of special order, b/c she thought it ensured that they made the meal fresh, as opposed to giving her one that was sitting under the heat lamps.

International McDonalds question...?



I live in the U.S.. Last time I was in London, I found curry flavored McNugget dip. I've also heard of other McD's around the world that serve everything from spam (in Hawaii), to alcohol. So, my worldly friends, what's on the menu at your McDonalds that you can't find in other countries?

Which of these fast food restaurants do you prefer?



Wimpy

Subway

Mcdonalds

KFC

Pizza Hut (it's not exactly a FAST food restaurant, but I'll just count it in anyway)

Now for my preference:

Wimpy - Is a bit 'wimpish', pardon the pun. LOL

Subway - I LOVE SUBWAY! Fresh, Clean, Extremely tasty! Made right in front of you! You choose ALL your fillings!

Mcdonalds - Pffaw!!! Squished burgers, more salt in your salad then in your chips! Looks absolutely NOTHING like the advert!!! Cheap toys that just end up being thrown away, which is a total waste of plastic and time! the tables are greasy (at least I think they are!) overcrowded, and juts plain eeek!!!

KFC - Another restaurant I despise! Maybe it tastes nice and looks like the advert, but the poor chickens! Not that people shouldn't eat meat but the way they treat those chickens and the rot they feed them!!!

Pizza Hut - Can't say much about this one, I've only been about once. Tasty, nice atmosphere, kind of exspensive though.

thanks for answering!

Wimpy - The first time I had Wimpy I was sick about an hour later. The second time (and the last time) I had some chips and a bit of my boyfriends burger and it was ok.

Subway - I liked Subway untill I realised the stuff isn't "fresh". It lies there for hours, from like 10am to 7pm. The meat, isn't meat, its like processed crap, 10% meat 90% water. Then, I found a big hair in my first bite of a sub and never ate there again.

Mcdonalds - As much as McDonalds is vile, I love it. I got a job there and they dropped the nuggets on the floor and put them back in the fryer. So now, eventhough I can't resist a McD's, I avoid the chicken nuggets.

KFC - Not my favourite. Not bad though. I don't like the batter they use on their chicken.

Pizza Hut - the pizzas are great, and the nachos are 100 times better! the cheese is sooooo good. I'm always sick with pizza hut because im intolerant to dairy products, but its worth it :D!!!

Never tried Dominos but Pizza huts food isnt anything special.

I wouldnt reccommend anyone dines in their restaurants either.The service is extremely slow,its too cold in the building and the foods too cold.The orders are virtually always messed up by amateurish kids and they never offer to compensate for poor service or food.

Whats more,it is ridiculously expensive for whats  little more than a fast food bar.

I want to quit McDonald's really bad, but i have only work for 1 month (need help)?



basically I work once every week and this McDonald's I work for is 30 min. away from home (waste a lot of gas). I have had a terrible experience at McDonald's with angry customers and also the managers are getting mad and annoyed at me for the mistakes I have done and when I need help. I just feel i don't belong there. I know is to early to quit, but I feel that if I don't quit now, then i am going to get fired for the mistakes i have made. what should I do?

Dont quit until you have found yourself another job. Just suck it up act happy and handle everything hte best you can. I did that. I quit after a month becase i hated it so much. I was jobless for about a month and a half. 
its really hard to find yourself another job, but believe me you dont have to tell them why, you can family related issues and i just cant do it anymore.

If you quit a job, you won't get unemployment.  Working 1 day a week may not get you much unemployment, but it'll be something.  I'd talk to your manager and ask for some mentoring.  Make it seem like you want to try to work it out there and just start looking for another job with the other 4 days you aren't working there.  And if they do end up firing you, you'll have a record of talking to your manager about improving your job (normally you have to  be given 30 days to improve) and you'll have unemployment subsidizing you.  But, why not bust your hiney and find another job with the other 4 days you aren't working at MickyD's?  It's what I'd do.

There is no excuse for making mistakes.  The purpose of entry level jobs like McDonald's are to teach you the proper values you need to be successful in the work force.  If you cannot even handle this simple job you are not going to do very well in any other.  Get your mind right, adjust your attitude, concentrate on doing everything correctly and take the initiative to help make the business function more smoothly. Then you will not find it so tedious and you will actually gain valuable experience and habits that will translate well into any other job you get.

You need to learn the valuable lesson all successful and satisfied workers learn.  No matter what the job, do it well, look for opportunities to do it better and make it your own.  Soon enough you will be treated as a valuable asset instead of just another grunt.

Youre lucky they give you ten..if you owned a restaurant and someone wanted 10 packs of ketchup you would probably charge them..... McDonalds doesnt charge...but they could...
And what gives you the impression they are being racist??
They are running a business and they are trying to make money.
They do have to pay for the ketchup....and who needs 10 anyway?

Try their salad! Skip the cheese, add extra turkey or ham, and use non-fat dressing. Very filling and ultra-low on calories and fat.

I happen to like McDonalds.  I know the food is fatty but nowhere can you go out to eat and be able to afford it.  You don't have to overeat and you don't have to go often.  It is nice to eat out once in a while even if its fast food.

McDonalds is just plain out terrible for you, even their Salads! First of all, their portion of salad is HUGE and the dressing has 1/3 of that fat your allowed in a day! Your right that people are responsible about what they eat, but some people just don't have any discipline or self-control. I feel bad for those people, and I wish that McDonalds would go out of business!

Fast food can pretend to be healthy all it wants but if you do a little research you will find out why they aren't. They have so much sodium and preservatives in what they serve, and not just McDonalds it's all of them, that even the salad is not as healthy as if you were to make your own at home with fresh ingredients and a light dressing. Everything is pre-made and pre-packaged and that means preservatives  which means crap. And yes the serving sizes are ridiculous I could feed myself all day off what they call a serving size.

Lol - I love when ppl ask this question, cos in my head the answer is pretty simple.



McDonalds is crap, crap food.  You go there to eat junky food.



Anyone who thinks they are going to McDonalds to eat a healthy meal should save themselves the trouble and go somewhere thats actually healthy.



If you dont have the discipline not to gorge on McDonalds, then stop going.  Plenty of other people in the world can contain themselves.

The salads are as bad as the burgers. A Premium Asian Salad with Crispy Chicken is 410 calories. That's before dressing. With it, it's 500 calories.

Chipotle is still considered a fast good restaurant, each burrito has upwards of 1000+ calories. People think they are eating healthy because of their advertising campaign (No additives, no lard, ect.) but the truth is, everything is jam-packed with calories-even the burrito bowl and salad! Most people don't understand the concept of moderation and choose to eat there regularly because they choose not to examine the facts!

Do you have a problem with "fat people"?  Maybe fat people have a problem with "stick people"?  Your karma will get to you, and as a "fat person" I would like to think that I am above your discriminatory comments.  Who says skinny people rule the world?  No one has an inside track on what is perfect.  Least of all those of you that are too busy they fail to look at themselves.  Clean your own doorstep and make sure that you are perfect before you criticize the rest of us.  If you are perfect perhaps you'd like to go back to your perfect little world where you belong.  The real world is here and you can either deal with fat people at Chipotle like fat people have to deal with skinny people at a dyslexia seminar. No offense to anyone?  IF you didn't mean to hurt or offend why did you ask?

I USUALLY SKIP BREAKFAST...I KNOW IT'S BAD, BUT I FORGET TO EAT BEFORE I GO TO WORK.

SO WHEN I GET THERE, I EAT ABOUT 6-8 OUNCES OF MIXED NUTS THAT I GET IN BULK AT THE STORE AND MIX THEM MYSELF WITH DARK CHOCOLATE COVERED RAISINS AND COFFE BEANS! SOOO GOOD.

IF I DO REMEMBER BREAKING MY FAST, IT USUALLY IS A BOWL OF HONEY BUNCHES OF OATS WITH ALMONDS AND 2%.

WAIT...IF I HAD A CHOICE OF ANY BREAKFAST, IT WOULD BE AT MY DAD'S TABLE AND HE WOULD MAKE ME BACON (NOT TOO CRISP), 2 EGGS OVER-EASY, HASH BROWNS, AND A SIDE OF FRENCH TOAST WITH REAL BUTTER AND REAL MAPLE SYRUP, DARK COFFEE, AND A GOOD MORNING KISS FROM THE COOK!

Which way up should a sausage and egg Mcmuffin be?



Should it be so that the egg is above the sausage or below it? Are there any official guidelines as to how it should be served and how do you eat yours?

I doubt there are any official guidelines but i would think that the egg would be at the top. Well, thats the way I eat mine anyway!  Isnt that how Its served in McDonalds?

With the Sausage and Egg the Egg should be at the Top.

With the Bacon and Egg the Bacon should be at the top.

well, I would ask a employee at McDonald's as far as which is above and which is below. I worked at a restaurant about 8 years ago and I was told to serve with the egg above. As far as eating it.  I would just eat the sandwich and not worry about it. lol

Awwww man don't get me started on subways!! Theres one across from my work and I go there constantly.

O.k I have tried EVERY sandwich and my two favourites are....

1) Meatball and cheese mnn.. Best on italian herbs and cheese bread, ask for extra cheese and toasted, also the south west sauce goes really nicely, with whatever salad you choose. Beware though the sauce is a little nippy.

2) The Italian BMT is great as well.

This has turkey, ham, bacon and cheese on it, although I ALWAYS get them to put extra cheese and pepperami and salami on it too. Combined with bbq sauce and a salad of your choice it's a proper meat feast!

YUM. Wish I was going to work right now...

After a having a Subway sandwich now and again and I began to discover that all of their sandwiches have that same generic 'Subway' taste.

That's why I recommend going to a local baker for a baguette- you can normally still choose what goes in it, it's truly fresh (unlike Subway), is normally about the same price as a Subway and you're supporting a local business and the local economy.

To me, that's delicious!

Barely ever at school. Trying to get back into shape and that's a killer.

When I'm home, I'd say 1-2 times a week on average. When I was a kid and my parents worked nights, it was more like 3 nights every week plus the general equivalent of fast food out of the microwave at home a fair amount of the time as well.

Why on earth would you want to stuff crap like this down your throat - and probably add to your cholesterol, weight, diabetes and God knows what - when, for less than a fiver, you can cook yourself a wholesome meal with all the right kind of vitamins, minerals, fibre and all the good things? Or perhaps you're one of the ever increasing band of sad people these days who can't even boil an egg??

Get real - stop stuffing yourself with rubbish - I object to paying taxes that have to go into the NHS to save greedy and obese people from killing themselves when the solution to their problems is so simple and CHEAP - LEARN TO COOK!!!!

The one where I live there are Mexicans working there. It just depends on where it is and stuff. Down in Southern, CA and Arizona should have Mexicans working there. In N Out doesn't say no to any race to work there as long as you speak and understand English.

They do have Hispanic employees.  In-N-Out pays their employees well and have good benefits.  Some of their employees have been there for 20 years so there is little turnover.  They get plenty of applicants and can select the best.  One thing I have noticed is that they do not have many/any locations near hispanic neighborhoods.

I kinda see what you're saying. It does seem like they have a lot of white people working there, but I have definitely noticed diversity, just perhaps not on the level at other fast food places.

Because the outside was cooked before the middle bit, you needed to raise the middle bit in the oven.

Next time you cook one put a little saucer in the middle of the pizza for even cooking.

Why do some people prefer the Whopper over the world famous Big Mac?



I don't get it. Big Mac is popular everywhere in the world. it is historic and unique in taste. The Whopper is just a typical burger with mayo. Whopper fans, explain...thanks

whopper is cheeper and it tastes better than the bigmac. plus it tastes better and looks healthier.  Big mac sounds like something fatty and gross.  Plus it's like double decked.  The whopper is a classic burger with everything I need.  Could use extra ketchup though B)

The Big Mac is a pile of soggy bread with pathetic, greasy burger patties peeking out. Who on earth would prefer that? The Whopper is a typical burger, yes... but McDonalds doesn't earn them any points for "uniqueness" just because they happen to make something *worse* then a typical burger.

Probably. Anything heavy enough to set off the little sensor things they have so they know when you are ready to order.
They don't even see your vehicle once you place your order. They arn't going to refuse to give it to you once you pull up to the window on a motor bike :P

Yes, as long as it is a motorized vehicle, they can serve you.  If you are on a regular bike, or on foot, they will claim for "safety" reasons they cannot serve you.  Honestly, I used to work at a fast food place, and the reason that we didn't serve people on foot wasn't because of safety reasons, but to:
a. Attempt to prevent people from cutting in line/stealing prepaid food
b. The time from order to completion of order cannot be calculated by someone on foot, because the sensor is activated by something in a motorized vehicle (and time is money in corporate terms, and is in direct relation to salaries/bonuses of managers)

Make sure that you open the door before you drive through a Burger King, McDonalds or a KFC Drive Thru' & make sure that you close the door when you leave the Burger King, McDonalds or a KFC Drive Thru' otherwise there will be a lot of smashed glass about & the Drive Thru' will end up very draughty for the other customers & staff ! If not then you will end up receiving a very expensive repair bill for all the damage caused !
