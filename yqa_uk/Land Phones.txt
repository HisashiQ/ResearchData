I wouldn't use BT to call internationally. Use Skype instead. So easy to do even if you have to call ordinary phones. I call an Indonesian mobile phone at the cost of 8.8 pence per minute. The line quality is reasonable.

Edit: Skype is not just for mobile calls, you can call landlines with skype too. If they have access to the internet then Skype is ideal. If they don't have it download it free from http://www.skype.com

Skype prices including VAT

France £ 0.014 
France - Mobile £ 0.132 
France-Paris £ 0.014 
France Premium Rate - 0891 £ 0.194 
France Premium Rate - 0892 £ 0.250 
France Premium Rate - 0893  £ 0.250 
France - Shared Cost £ 0.130 
France-Toll Free  £ 0.000



Most of the prices to landlines in France are less than 2 pence per minute inclusive of VAT (15% as Skype is Europe based not UK based and when you top up your Skype account VAT is charged so you get more value e.g a £10 credit costs £11.50)

BT Prices EXCLUDING VAT (VAT in UK is set at 17.5%)

France Charge band 1a From 6:00am - 6:00pm 21.000 6:00pm - 6:00am 11.500 All day Sat and Sun 11.500
Prices in pence per minute and exclude VAT
