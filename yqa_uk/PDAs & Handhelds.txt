Yes, it uses a SIM card, if you make sure you get the "unlocked GSM" version of the Centro.

Blackberry 8120 Pearl - sooooooooo slow.?



I've got the above on a contract with Orange - I got it because I love using my phone to Facebook and email whilst I'm out and about.  I only got it Saturday, and I'm already hating it!  It is soooooooo slow!!  I cannot actually believe how slow it is!  Is it Orange who the problem may be, i.e. I need a full signal for it to be speedier??  As the signal isn't great in my house.

I'm really disappointed, it wasn't cheap and I'm quite frustrated that my cheap old Sony W800i was super quick on the net and a brand new Blackberry is dead slow.

When you say slow are you talking about accessing functions of the phone, or the speed of the Internet browsing? If it is the first issue, you may want to perform a hard reset: remove the battery from the BlackBerry (while it is still powered on) for 30 seconds, then reinsert. This can clear up slow down issues.

Bluetooth Questions..?



1. When was bluetooth invented?
2. Who Invented / discovered bluetooth?
3. What was the first device to use bluetooth technology?
4. What is the latest personnal stuff using bluetooth technilogy?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



1. Bluetooth was developed in 1994 in Sweden by Jaap Haartsen and Sven Mattisson whilst they worked for Ericcson Mobile Platforms.

2. Jaap Haartsen and Sven Mattisson

3. mobile phones (sometimes called "cell phones" in certain countries)

4. Future of Bluetooth



* Broadcast Channel: enables Bluetooth information points. This will drive the adoption of Bluetooth into mobile phones, and enable advertising models based around users pulling information from the information points, and not based around the object push model that is used in a limited way today.



* Topology Management: enables the automatic configuration of the piconet topologies especially in scatternet situations that are becoming more common today. This should all be invisible to the users of the technology, while also making the technology just work.



* Alternate MAC PHY: enables the use of alternative MAC and PHY's for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth Radio will still be used for device discovery, initial connection and profile configuration, however when lots of data needs to be sent, the high speed alternate MAC PHY's will be used to transport the data. This means that the proven low power connection models of Bluetooth are used when the system is idle, and the low power per bit radios are used when lots of data needs to be sent.



* QoS improvements: enable audio and video data to be transmitted at a higher quality, especially when best effort traffic is being transmitted in the same piconet.

There's no reason to assume your Blackberry will run slower... but I'd say it's good practice not to have too many programs rumning at once, so exit your games by pressing the Blackberry/Menu key and taking the "Close" option.



I like to use the sites that have been around for a long time and have a good reputation.  One such site is PocketGear

personal digital assistant (PDA) is a handheld computer also known as small or palmtop computers. Newer PDAs also have both color screens and audio capabilities, enabling them to be used as mobile phones, (smartphones), web browsers, or portable media players. Many PDAs can access the Internet, intranets or extranets via Wi-Fi, or Wireless Wide-Area Networks (WWANs). Many PDAs employ touch screen technology.

First file for a patent to secure the idea
Then write a business plan that explains the idea and why you believe will make money
Then go to investors (venture capitalists) to propose the idea and ask for money - or ask friends and family to lend you money to get you started.
Good luck

Blackberry curve or palm centro?



Which is better?
I want a new phone, and yeah.. either one of those.
I have AT&T and I broke my sony w580i so i'm using my crappy razr but my parents said they'd buy me something new.

i like both the blackberry curve and palm centro, the palm being black if i get one, and i'd get a silver blackberry.

i basically just use a phone to text, call people, and maybe use the internet briefly to get ringtones. nothing else, so i don't need to know about features and all.

what i want is a good keyboard, somewhat long battery life, and, well, that's all..
something dependable.

which would you reccomend?

Brand wise... Blackberry is downrightfully a better brand, used by business people around the world.

As for Palm, not a very popular brand maybe it doesn't really develop its interface for user-friendliness and not very innovative in recent years so it kind of sunk in the market.

Blackberyy offcourse if you have the ability to buy an unlocked phone think of Nokia E71 it will work with att. it will be a far better and easy to use phone compared to blackberry.



but if the choice is between blackberry curve and centro by palm; it is a no brainer pick up the blackberry curve.

IPhone warranty done and screen cracked today....advice?



I had my 1st gen iPhone in my pocket and bumped into the edge of a table that cracked the screen thru the protective cover. My warranty just expired last month and I heard nightmare rumors about Apple charging $199 for repairs?!! Someone tell me it ain't so and someone please tell me that there aren't fools out there that actually pay for that when you can just get a new one for that price!! The folks on the phone at Apple are hush hush and they won't tell me the deal until I come into the store and talk to someone which I refuse to do.

Yes, Apple will charge 199 USD for repairs. Sadly, other companies would charge you 199 USD +++ for repairs as well (www.rapidrepair.com). You might as well buy the new phone or get it repaired.

There is this metro pcs store near my home, and they seem to be collaborating with t mobile and sprint. I think my tilt is already unlocked since it is the first of its kind and i heard rumors that the 1st tilts were mad unlocked but the 2nd version was locked to At&t.



So back to my question if i have a t mobile Sim card or a prepaid t mobile Sim card will i be able to activate the htc8925 with t mobile?

As long as you unlock the tilt beforehand, yes, there is no reason why you cannot use the phone on the T-Mobile network. You will want to find somewhere to double check on the lock status of your phone, but there is no reason why it will not work if it is already unlocked.

Thank you, i will go do that as soon as possible, but now the tilt is acting crazy.
Whenever i turn it on it freezes at the main screen(windows screen) and i cant even turn it off i have to remove the battery, so what should i do?
Should i go to at&t and ask them to rest the whole thing?

You could just buy a T-mobile sim card and test it,paying for someone to test it costs just as much as a prepaid card, and at least you get it right away, second if your moving from AT&T to T-mobile which are on the GSM network what does the Metro PCS store have to do with it since its a CDMA networks, for another matter that store is likely an authorized dealer for T-mobile, Sprint, and Metro PCS and has nothing to do with a collaboration with the companies you mention. A GSM network has no place in a CDMA world or vice versa, get a prepaid test it yourself its not that hard to do.

From your home screen, find the Profiles icon. Click it and then click Advanced. Then click again to enter edit mode. Find the alert and click it to configure the type of sound and volume. SMS Text is for text messaging, Phone is for calls. I am not sure about voice mail sound.

When your internet is being repaired, sometimes they ask you to go online type in some numbers and then they can control your computer. How much do they really see? Could they go onto my desktop and see my documents. I had someone go on my desktop once to fix itunes and I was wondering how much they saw. Could they have seen my desktop picture?

You let someone have remote access to your computer because your internet was being repaired? I've never heard of such a thing. Sounds like a scam.



In any case, when they control your computer in the way that you describe, they can access all of it. Everything.

Thanks! Just so you know its not a scam. They have got my internet working again many times after using this method. And anyways I have the power to cancel it if I want, so it doesn't worry me that much.
