Yes, as long as it won't put the king in check by another piece he can take any piece, including the queen.

Yes, the king can. Basically, the only limitation of the king is that it can only move one space at a time. You can still take any piece on the board. Usually though, the king only takes pawns in a good match. The only time taking out a queen would happen would be if you are facing a very bad/ new player.

Yes, not only is it possible for a King to capture the opposing Queen, it's not even particularly unusual.  The Queen must first move next to the King, giving check.  If the Queen isn't protected by another piece, the King can then capture the Queen to escape the check.  An example is 
1. e4, e5 
2. Nf3, Nc6
3. Bb5, a6
4. B:c6, dc
5. N:e5, Qd4
6. Nf3, Q:e4+
7. Qe2, Q:e2+
8. K:e2

The resulting position after the White King captures the Black Queen on move eight is equal in material (and rather drawish).

Additional info:  The following is a link to an extremely famous combination featuring a King capturing a Queen.  White literally forces Black's King to capture the White Queen by playing 13. Qd8+.  This sets up a discovered check and leads to an exquisitely beautiful checkmate.  But the whole combination starts with the Black King capturing the unprotected Queen that White has sacrificed.

Yes. The King can take any other pieces on the board as long as it is a legal move.

So, if your opponent's Queen move to a square where it can be taken by your King and it's your move then you can take the Queen as long as the Queen is unprotected.

That's one of the ways that the king can get out of check.  If she is in a square that the king threatens, and she is not protected by another piece, then the king is free to take out the Queen.



The only way the king can't move and take out any piece is if the move would place the king in check.  The only piece that the king can't take out is the other king, due to the fact that niether piece can get close enough to the other to do so.

If he never took her out on a date how could he marry her?:)

Seriously, yes, but she must initiate contact and have no defender.  A King can not get close enough on his own to a queen, but she can move next to him.

In short, she must ask him to take her out on a date.:)
