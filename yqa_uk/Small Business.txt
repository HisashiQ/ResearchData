Free UK Business Directory - Need opinion and advice.?



Hi,

I just launched a branded new UK business directory at http://www.searchukbusiness.com

Can anyone let me know what do you think about the overall website?

Also, I need opinion from online users point of view, what do you want to get from a business directory?

For me, I think the most important feature is the search function tool. What do you think?



Thanks

Not many free directories available - the big ones, like Applegate are expensive

The opening page is nice but once you click on a link, there's noway back to the front page (or did I miss it?)

Looked at a couple of the businesses advertising there. A simple description of what they do is provided and a link to their site - ideal for quickly finding what I'm looking for. Can they add logos to help identify the company quickly?

Overall, I like the site. Success will depend on how well the companies registered are picked up on searches via Google and Yahoo

I would not use the directory to find anything when I know I will get the same under Google and so I really doubt the success of directory.

Why would I need another business directory?  There are so many around already and, as someone else has said, I usually search on Google, Yahoo or yell.com for what I'm looking for.  When I search, I want to get straight to the company's website, not have to go through yet another portal.

As a business owner, I wouldn't list our companies in any more directories.  We check where people find us and monitor the results on other directories.  Very few enquiries come from searches on Touch Local or the like.

Sorry, I haven't checked out your site.  Other than increasing your hit rate, it's not something that would give value to me as a potential customer.  What's more important to businesses is being able to target their niches closely, which directory listings don't do.

LISTEN to the ppl around you.. you'll learn a lot just from listening to what ppl are talking about.  Also.. when you're sitting in class compliment someone sitting near you, like say "Oh I really love your shoes, where'd you get them?" or something like that.. if you compliment someone they're less defensive and it gives you an opening to strike up a conversation with them- sales people in clothing stores actually do this when working on commission to build up clientle.. anyways, as for the bf thing just be careful how you act around other girl's bf's-- its high school so ppl can be very immature about stuff or overly senstive so dont be too touchy feely with another girls man or anything like that.

In a trading account what expenses do you include?



I am doing a trading account (uni work), I was told that you include direct costs in the trading account..I know that wages and administration is a direct cost...but I'm not sure what the term direct costs mean? Also what are examples...eg insurance etc?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Okay a direct expense is an expense that can easily be attributable or traced to a product or service.
Admin is an indirect expense cos it does not add direct value to the product and is not easily traced to the product.
Wages, is generally not a direct expense , but it depends on the context in which it is used, ask yourself if it is directly traced to the product or service being offered, if yes, then it is direct if not then it is indirect.
Expenses that you could add to trading could be transportation costs of delivery raw materials or stock, this can be added to the trading account because it is traceable to the product delivered, if the stock was not transported to the site ( office premises) then the stock can not be sold in the first place, hence it is direct. Try and apply this principle to the wages you are referring too. 
Sales returns and purchases returns are also included in the trading account.
Use the direct and indirect principle above to question whether an expense should be put in trading account or not, but generally, expenses are found in the income statement or profit and loss account.

What will i do with my Land??? Buisness ideas?



I have just bought a rather sizable plot of land approx 3.6 acres I am going to be building my own house on this, wich will take up including the garden around 300 - 500m2.



My question is does anyone have any really good suggestions for something to do with the rest of this land which will make me some good money? I do not want to sell of as re-development and cannot put anything noisey in - because of neighbours/planning

Ive been thinking along the lines of a stocked fishing pond... Any other suggestions or idea's, anything considered!!!

Are you near to any local football grounds/hospital or places where people can park their cars to walk to somewhere where they have to pay for parking?If your near a football ground or even a 10-15 walk away from a football ground or hospital why not make a car parking area for paople to leave their cars while they walk to the hospital/football ground. If you did this and offered cheap parking people would pay to park and walk rather than park on a grounds pitch. Up in the N.W England the local football team has its own parking but soon gets full. The retail complex has patrols on so that home/away teams cannot park due to it being a shopping presinct. I live a 20 min walk away and have seen supporteres walk to as far as where I am to avoid all the slow traffic when leaving the ground. There are always double yellow lines or pay and display signs around. If you can build a car park and it have room for 10 spaces depending where you are you can charge a minimum of £1 per car per match day. At every home game near you this would bring in an extra £10. (not much you may be thinking but Im giving low prices to make the calculation easier) You could even say that a profit of 1% would go to a local charity if you are at all generous like that. You could offer people a residence and mark all your bays with numbers for an anual fee. Ie:- bay 1 to Mr Jones regular commuter £100 per year. (he may use your land as you could be next to a trainstation with a car park that doesnt have an overspill). He would then think if I pay £100 per years I dont have to rush to get a parking space in a morning.

I hope this helps. Im not very clever where business ideas are conserned but everone wants to park and there is not always a place to.

its very very difficult to make a decent income while doing data entry from home, and you're unlikely to get the names of genuine employers in a public place like this.

If you are really into starting your own business, and wish to pursue this career, you should first get a loan. This is to first buy out a piece of property, and hire some employees to help you with your designs. You also have to research into material, and factory production, to utilize the most of your product. Business requires about 3-4 years of college, in order to be sucessful. Good Luck!

You can ask for cheques or postal orders to avoid PayPal.  However, your stuff will sell for much less on average than people who set up a PayPal account.

The difficulty arises with eBay fees.  I do not  believe that eBay has any facility to cope with you paying sellers fees by any method other than through a bank account.

You might be able to use a building society account.  Worth a try!

Depends on what you are selling. Quite often if its a large item then people state that the purchaser picks the item up from you, thus asking for cash when the goods are picked up shouldn't be a problem. I have seen this on a number of items eg cars.

Asking for cash or postal order through the post is theoretically possible but I am sure a lot of purchasers would shy away from this.

You'll need to contact the executive offices of Starbucks

Starbucks Corp.
2401 Utah Avenue South
Seattle, WA 98134
Phone: 206-447-1575
Fax: 206-682-7570

You need to ask for the person in charge of the Starbucks menu or the person who deals with outside vendors.

This is just a start, you will probably be redirected to half a dozen people, leave 40 messages until someone might call you back.  You'll have to sell your product over the phone and hope that the person you're talking to is interested.  Then you might need to make a face to face presentation of yourself, your company and your product.  Your product will then probably be tested and rated to see if it fits within the Starbucks model.



Here is an interesting question.. Starbucks has about 8500 stores, if they say YES, will you be able to deliver hmmm..



204,000 units or 2 dozen per store?  Be careful what you wish for.

Of course before Starbucks makes a corporate wide commitment to your product they might want to have it in a few test markets first.



Best of luck.

Hi, Go to your homesite (eg, www.ebay.co.uk) and make sure that you log in there.



If you don't do this, you might open your shop on the wrong site.  This wouldn't be a huge problem but different eBay sites have different criteria for opening a shop, for example, the US site requires you to have twice as much feedback as the UK one does.

Go to your 'My eBay' summary page, find 'subscriptions' and click on that, then on the next page you'll see a link to subscribe to an eBay shop.

As you're asking about a 'shop' rather than a 'store', I'm assuming that you're from the UK so also have a look here
http://pages.ebay.co.uk/storefronts/open...
for a lot of useful info, including a link to open your shop from there.

First of all you have to set your mind whether to sell your items locally or to worldwide. Mention this in your listing. If you intend to sell worldwide you have to do some research. You can surf your local post office's website or email them and request type of service they offer, zone listing and list of rates. You may also do the same if you choose courier service. The other options is you may peep or refer to other eBay seller's postage and packaging fees who live in the same country with you.

My wife is a Power Seller on Ebay and has this problem all the time, so much that in the sellers profiles you can check your preferences and block bidders from parts of the world you do not wish to sell to. The problems we have encountered with overseas items is not worth the time and effort and for that matter the negative feedback that comes with it! As far as your response to the email, we simply say thank you for looking but we do not ship to your country due to the fact that we cannot get delivery conformation, sorry.

If you want to allow them to bid on your auction, you need to weigh the item (including all packaging that you'll use) and check to see how much it will cost to post.

Go here
http://sg.royalmail.com/portal/rm/PriceF...
to the Royal Mail 'price finder' and it will calculate the postage cost for you.

You can then revise your listing to show the P&P costs to Bulgaria (assuming that you don't already have bids on it).

If you'd rather not sell overseas, go to your 'My eBay' summary page and in the preferences section have a look for 'selling preferences'.  Once you get there, you'll see that you can block overseas bidders, so tick the box and save the changes.

If the enquirer has already placed a bid, you can cancel the bid - info on 'unwelcome bidding' here
http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/policies/un...
and then add their id to your blocked bidder list (you'll find a link to do that on the 'unwelcome bidding' page).

Is is legal to use brand name as my store name?



I am planning to open a store in downtown and i wanted to buy brand clothes and retail it. I am planning to buy them from wholesalers. And i was wondering if it is legal to use the brand name as my store name. For example i buy jack jones jeans from wholesalers and i only sell jack jones and i name my store jack jones. if all the products are legal would that be okay? and what if i use their logos as well?



Also i was wondering how i become distributor or franchisor of any brand company such as DKNY or jack jones etc. I am really interested in DKNY. but i can't find any information on their franchiser requirements or start-up costs or franchiser fee. I wrote them e-mail but no reply. So i am stuck. So it would be really wonderful if you help me with this.

No, you would have to contact the company for information on franchising. They may not franchise. Also, what would you do if you wanted to carry other brands of clothes?  You need to contact a local chapter of the SBA http://sba.gov for information on requirements in your state.

No, it is not legal unless you are part of the franchise and my guess is that very few stores are being admitted to the DKNY franchise as most of the stores are part of the direct company. Sorry but I don't know about how to become a distributor. Why not sell both under your own name?

officially no, before adopting a make you should contact first the original or the proprietor of the brand, normally they have office for that,that's why they are big makes. they won't allow you to make competition with them. it is to do with their own image and prestige, but if you buy their goods directly your records would be registered to theirs so in case of issue you have the proof that they accorded you to use their make. in any case if you use their make you are making a publicity for  their success, but if it is  a counterfeit you will have the counterfeit representatives on your back and the damage they ask you it's not worthy it will cost you your capital.

sorry to say, but it's a scam, they know you need money, so they make the offer sound too good, all they want is your details.

if you have signed upto any online job sites, that is were they got your information from. as soon as i signed up i started getting loads of them.

Firstly you should decide what business you would like to start. So it would be something that interests you and you know all about. 
Then think of a place where you would like to start (internet, shop, centre etc) see how much it would cost and what needs to be done.
Try and think how you would get interest from the public (posters, flyers, internet, etc) Then start designing the site or shop.
A way to get money to support your business could be a paper round, or dog walking etc.

Making a business is hard work so you might want to work with some friends too.

This may not be the answer you want to hear but I highly recommend that when you find what you are searching for you stay off sites like this and concentrate on your future. If you do not put forth a 100% effort and change what you are doing you will never get ahead! I was able to retire at a early age due to the success of a small business I started from home. My time is now devoted to my family and helping as many serious people I can achieve the same control over their finances, their life and their future. I am always available to answer your questions and help in anyway I can.

As far as making some kind of cash today, you can see if anyone needs a babysitter, house cleaning, give at a blood bank, ask a relative for help, go to a pawn shop with some items of value, get a friend and wash cars for $5 or more each.

I recommend taking a look at this site:
http://www.ecashoffers.com/paidto/home.p...

It is a 100% free and is meant for stay at home moms and kids who can't work yet.  You don't pay any sign up fees and there are lots of tutorials on how to complete the offers well.  You basically get paid to complete short surveys and free offers.  Best thing about this site is, once you've reached the minimum payout of $10, you can request a payment by check, paypal or money order and it will be processed that day.

If you need proof of payment, take a look at this site:

Visit the links below for tutorials on how this website works:
http://www.ecashoffers.com/newtoecash (offer example)

There are a lot of scams out there but I've been doing this for a while now and it works for me.

Try and understand that online jobs will not bring you what you make now in the corporation that your involved in. Home based jobs are just that, a "job". Employers from legitimate companies only want to pay the lowest amount possible. So some places have created positions available for people to work from home and be able to do that. They can justify paying minimum wage because the person is working out of the comfort in their own home. It's completely different where a salary is needed because of transportation and everything else that it takes to get to work. So, if you want to work from home in a job setting, then expect that you will only make minimum wage.

No bank or conventional lender will lend you money to buy a bar.



You will have to find partners and investors.  Once you find people willing find yourself a good accountant and attorney to walk you through the transaction.  The account can tell you if the numbers being presented to you are realistic.  You state the business is making 310K, is that gross or net?  Doesn't help if your revenue is 310K but your expenses are 320K.  Then get a property inspection and appraisal.  Do a search for any tax liens or code violations.  Find out what it takes to get a liquor license in your state.  The business can be transfered to you but I doubt if the license can be transfered.

If the current owner is hesitant to turn over the books of the business or make any necessary corrections to the property walk away.

At minimum, you will need a business plan, in which you will show (with adequate documentation) reasonably expectable revenues and expenses.  Lenders will typically want to see 25% equity; you have half that.  Inquire of the present owner if he is willing to take back paper for some or all of the rest of the purchase price.  Be sure to ask the seller for copies of tax returns; if he reports income to the IRS, it is fairly believable.

It's not an exciting job.  Webhosts make money once all of their equipment is paid for... which is usually very expensive.  If you're a reseller then you don't have to deal with the equipment, but you will still have to provide customer service which can be a horrible experience if you do not like dealing with people

An administrator is appointed to manage a company’s affairs, business and property for the benefit of the creditors. The person appointed must be an insolvency practitioner and has the status of an officer of the court (whether or not he or she is appointed by the court).



The objective of administration is to:

*rescue a company as a going concern;



*achieve a better price for the company’s assets or otherwise realise their value more favourably for the creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration); or



*in certain circumstances, realise the value of property in order to make a distribution to one or more preferential creditors.

Hi nettie,

There are many legitimate work from home opportunities available to you. There are also many scams out there. You will need to do your home work to keep from getting burned.

I have a BS degree in engineering and for several years I worked as a structural engineer on nuclear power plants. So you may find that I am giving you a few more details than you desire. But that is how engineers are! Eventually I went off to Bible College and began pastoring full time. As a pastor I was not making enough money to support my family of four. Forsaking my calling was not an option. Neither did I desire to go back to work in corporate America. Traffic, bosses, and other considerations pushed me to work from home.

The first thing you need to decide is, are you looking for a JOB or a business opportunity. Each one is very different. A job may offer you more security and a steady paycheck but you are building the owners dreams not yours. A job should not have any or very little start cost because the owner is taking care of the overhead.

A business is not a job. You are the owner and you are the one taking the risk. But you are also the one that will reap the rewards for your success. You are working toward your dreams not someone else’s. Yes, with a business of your own there will be a start up cost. But as you know even a child’s lemonade stand has a start up cost. The parents may buy the lemons, sugar, and paper cups for them but there is a start up cost.

So first decide do you desire a job where you may have security but you are helping someone else achieve their dreams. Or do you desire a business of your own. You take the risk but you also reap the rewards of your success. For me I am willing to take the risk of building my own business.

If you decide to start your own business there are some things to consider. First, you need to decide how much money you are willing to invest to get started. Yes there is a cost to start a business, even when starting a lemonade stand.

Second, you need to decide if you desire to market a product or a service. Which ever you do make sure that it is a commodity that is in demand. Learn more about this at http://www.TinyURL.com/32T9JL .

Third, I suggest you make sure the company has been around for some years. Over 90% of businesses fail in their first year. Then the majority of the other 10% fail in the next 4 years. So chose a business that has some time on its’ side.

Fourth, make sure the compensation is worth your time and effort.

Fifth, make sure the person you are working with has the ability to mentor and coach you. Most home base businesses fail because the person does not get any one on one mentoring. No successful business person makes it on their own. They always have a source for coaching and mentoring. The source is often the combination of books and individuals.

I know this has been long but I hope it has been of value for you. Much success as you go through this journey of life. You will have success.

If it is faulty, then you do not want to sell it - too much hassle from customers!

Returns may be binned or resold, depends on company policy.

Clearance stock and or product over runs may be available BUT do check on terms and conditions of purchase - they may prohibit you from mentioning the source. I.e you would not be able to call it Littlewoods without them cutting up about it

Dreading starting my dream job?



I got a new job last month, just waiting for all the checks to come through before I can get my start date and hadn in my notice. I've been in my current job 18 months and although I hate many things about it, I feel it is part of my life and my colleagues (only 7 of us) have become like my family. My new job is tonnes better in terms of the work is more interesting with better hours, better pay. But i just not sure I will be able to cope with it. For some reason I don't feel happy I just feel panicky and depressed. Somedays I just feel like i want to just give up all together, like if i carry on I will end up cracking up and messing up and losing everything. That's how i feel, my job is my life. Either way i'm scared i'm gonna do somethin stupid, get sacked or something, and then i'll lose my flat as well. I just feel anxious and bad. I should be happy and feeling blessed, not feeling like this.

You'll do fine in your new job.
It's hard moving on from colleagues you've become close to, but that's life. No reason why you and the other 6 can't meet up from time to time? It's perfectly natural to be nervous too :)
It's important you actually enjoy your job, and by the sounds if it currently you don't.

A dream job has almost nothing bad about it.  YOU feel great
in the morning, afternoon, evening and you like a majority
of those around you.

YOU WILL find it.  This is not it.

1. First ask for the financial statement of the business. This will enable you to know its profitability or otherwise and be able to work out how much your contribution should be.

2. Ask about the customer/client list.

3. Ask to know about other partners, if any?

This is not exhaustive by any means.

KT and Late Night Larry make very good points.  Think first about why you want to buy into the partnership of someone else's business and why they're willing to have you do so.

Partnerships in business can work very well but you all need to have the same aims.  If one of you is in it to make a quick profit and get out after 3 or 5 years, they'll have different ideas from those who want to build a sustainable business that grows over the next 10 to 20 years.

Find a good accountant to go through the finances of the business you're thinking of buying into.  It's a case of looking at trends as well as whether the numbers add up to a profit.

If you do decide to buy in, you do need a watertight legal agreement signed by all parties that sets out all the responsibilities and liabilities of the partners and, as LNL mentions, includes your exit plan and what happens in the event of disputes.

Is there any way you could work with the partnership as a freelance for a time to see how it all works without committing your money to the business?  If you have particular skills that are useful to the partnership you could offer them for a time.  It gives both sides the opportunity to find out how they can grow together.

We brought in an extra director on one of our businesses.  With hindsight, we'd have been better to have employed him as a freelance using his particular skills as required.

Good luck!

First question is why they want a partner? Do you bring new skills, new business to them, or is this a cash flow issue.  If the later what is to say it is safe?

Ensure you see previous accounts and written partnership agreements, if you are unsure pay a professional to check them.

A written partnership agreement is essential as it allocates roles and responsibilities so as to avoid unpleasantness later.

Make sure that there is a written partnership agreement with an exit strategy in case someone decides he/she wants out next month.



If you're putting any money into this partnership, or may be held responsible for any of the debts of the business, have your accountant review the financial records for the last several years, and make sure your liability for previous debts is spelled out in the new agreement.



This suggestions are not extensive, there are more things your lawyer should consider... and you will need your own lawyer to protect your interests when drafting the new partnership agreement.

Are you based in the UK?  If so, contact your local Business Link for free help and advice on setting up your company.  They have information on any other licences you might need.

You will need insurance.  As a limited company you need Employer's Liability insurance, even for yourself.  Directors are employees of the company, as well as owners.  Public Liability insurance will be a key one, too, and you may want to think about professional indemnity insurance.

Speak to someone like AXA.  We've used them for some time.  Their rates are not bad and they go through everything to make sure you have appropriate cover.

Good luck!

Here's eBay's Food Policy:

Food also comes under their Prohibited and Restricted Items Policy
http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/policies/it...
in the 'Questionable' section.

From reading that, it would seem that they'd really rather that you didn't sell any foodstuffs at all, but if you are satisfied that you can comply with all of the regulations and eBay's own rules, there's no reason why you shouldn't do it.

You would need food hygiene certificates and who's to say the food hasn't past its sell by date when it arrives it would cost more to make than you could sell it for due to supermarkets own brand being so cheap.

Funny thing, it was pretty simple, I just didn't start the right business or have the right information or support. Making money is fun when you know what to do. It is very frustrating when you do not. If you are serious about making this kind of money I suggest to really go over this resource site.  http://rubyurl.com/hPHO

First of all Good luck in your new venture. Yes you would have to legally register yourself as a business / sole trader with the HMRC (tax office) as you will need to pay tax on any money / profit you make.

That other answer is looking like a "fake" answer to me, just letting you know. (the one that starts "after 4 years")

I dont know about hosting, but what i will be doing (when my site is complete) is charging people to advertise their banners. That would be alot easier. But obviously wont make as much money.

----edit------
Its good that your thinking about hosting at an early age, but to pay your college fees you should just get a real job. Work in a restaurant or a shop.

The guy above me is spam...

But anyway look on amazon or go to Barnes and Nobles they have easy books on how to write contracts.( Not books but guides with pictures and stuff.) But to be honest with you, contracts don't need to be fancy with big words and stuff. A contract could be made on a napkin as long as it has the agreements written on it and signed by both parties. You should be able to type your own with ease.

Good luck!

If you contact your local council, they can put you in touch with their public protection department, who deal with things like shops and fast food vans etc.

I think you'd need a basic food hygiene certificate at least, but the council will be able to help for sure.

You need to show evidence that you understand basic hygiene and cleaning methods, but the usual course for operatives is one day.

As the other response says the local Environmental Health/Food Standards team should be able to point you in the right direction.

You will need to register the business with them anyway (free)

I would check with your County Clerk and see if they have a list of repo properties that were confiscated by the county for non payment of taxes. You go thru the auction process by bidding on it. This is a lot cheaper than going thru a realtor.
www.legalzoom.com
Go here to register your business with the state and your business name with a DBA(Doing Business As).
They can also help you make a will so if anything happens to you,YOU will decide who gets what and not the state.
www.irs.org
Go here for a free federal ID tax number.
You will have to get the City Health inspector to come check your shop for cleanliness,and the County Fire Marshal will also have to inspect the shop for fire safety violations.

Figure out what you like to do that you can do from home.

Are you good with websites?  Can you widdle wood?  Would you be willing to sink a few grand into getting t-shits silk screened for the coming election since you know you'll sell them out quickly.

I do not recommend network markting, which I am involved with, because building a network is truly an out of home venture, even when you're just a salesman.

The short answer to your question is Not ones you will hear about here.

When you ask a question like this there are only two basic kinds of answers you are going to get:

1.  Responses (like this one) telling you that you are going to get a bunch of spam about scams.

2.  Spam.  (Some of the spammers may give me a thumbs down but that's OK with me.  They are still spam. I have influence in the community; they don't.)

There are many different business's out there. All require your time and effort. It's up to you to decide how much of either, you want to invest into your business.

Take for instance, the business I'm currently operating can be done passively,(email,blogging,classifieds), directing traffic to your website.
It can also be accomplished non-passivelly by calling people, meeting with people,etc.

I actually promote my business both ways, enjoying a much greater success.

I completely understand your caution and skepticism, because I recently went through the same thing.  I was originally searching for an opportunity to make some extra money because my husband is a full time doctoral student.  However, when I found the number one National Health Benefits Company in the U.S, I realized that this opportunity is going to change my life.  I thoroughly researched the company and found out that legitimacy is not even a question.  This 15-year-old company is a member of the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Dental Plans.  This is a nationally known and reputable home business, which has been featured on “60 Minutes” and the New York Times, to just name a few.  This is the number one national health benefits company in the United States and is accepted at over 100,000 retailers throughout the nation (Wal-mart, K-mart, CVS, Target, Sears Optical, Walgreen's, etc.).

A legitimate business will never promise that you will be making loads of money overnight and without putting in the necessary work.  However, if you are willing to work at least part time hours on this business, it will reward you for the rest of your life!  This company pays me daily for the work that I do and we are paid residually as well.  Your income will increase every month because of the residual pay, which means you are paid every month for work that you did once.



In addition, there are no products, cold calling, or hard selling.  We simply provide a needed service for a very affordable price by using our internet connection and telephone. I love this business because I know that I am going to really make a difference and as a psychology graduate this is very important to me.  However, I also realize that this business is going to change my own life as well!

I am just excited to share my experience working from home and I wish you the best of luck!



You can research the company at www.iboplus.com/newman

There are some really good companies out there who hire people to work from home.  I am a Dad of 4 and have been working from home for a while. Its possible to find companies without fees or upfront charges.

I looked for a very long time before I found the company I'm with today I will tell you that it is a lot of work and it takes committment.

This website contains a list of some companies that may be hiring, also also some general information on working at home and data entry etc.

http://my-data-entry.blogspot.com/

Take the time to find something you enjoy doing from home and something you believe in because you do not want your home to become a prison that you just do not want to work in.

I can not tell exactly what you are saying.
Is some one asking for your Paypal address.?? but calling it a Paypal adders.?
If so, then I would be very suspicious of this, as there has been a recent up rising in the number of Paypal scams, and one of the ways to spot them, is to look out for spelling mistakes such as this.
Be careful.

If you want an internet presents then look into a paid or free website service.  Free usually means lots of advertisement to go along with it.  If you go with a service it can cost you less than 10 a month and you get a free domain name.

If you want to do it in a cheaper way than do it like this.  Go to your local University and talk to the Graduate school department for MIS or department for Graphic design. Ask them where to post up jobs for students, students are always looking to make extra money especially those in grad. school who know what their doing for 1/4 of the price.

good luck

I highly recommend SBI! You build the website yourself so you save thousands of dollars and even if you know nothing about web design, they go through everything step by step. See an example of what I did for my website using the SBI! system. The first source is the SBI! site, the second is the example. Good luck my friend.

can i refuse to sell to someone on ebay because of low/bad feedback or think its a scam or unsafe country.

The auction was open internationally and I am getting lots of queries from abroad, but I am unsure wether I want to send to someone with low/bad feedback, or countries that are known for scams.

I'm in the UK. Would you post to Spain?
Italy?
Chile - I don't want to

The auction hasn't finished yet, I have put a note saying don't bid if abroad, but couldn't change setting so its probably still showing on other ebays

can I cancel bids

thanks

You can accept or reject bids from whoever you want.  You can cancel a bid without giving a reason.

I always insist that overseas buyers pay by PayPal.  That way, I know I've got the money before I send off the goods.  I also ask for proof of delivery.

Although some countries are worse than others, there are always people trying to steal your money - even in the UK.  Just take reasonable precautions.

As stated you can dictate your terms.
You can state in your auction that you deny anyone with a feedback rating lower than you like. They can still bid, but you can cancel their bids and report them as "unwelcome bidder".

And I recommend you do just that.

If you are just selling some random stuff and you're not a business, find another sales outlet.  Ebay is abusive to sellers.

you kind of need to put those caveats in your auction before you list it - you can absolutely dsay you won;t ship to another country and you can also insist on a minimum ebay feedback score - 10  is a common minimum and if it's a low number like that, it should be a 100% feedback rating - you can probably cancel bids - but you'd be better off - canceling the whole auction and relisting it with all that information clearly stated in the auction up front

I have run a leaflet company for over 14 years. You can make a living if you work hard and NEVER repeat NEVER let a client down.
A single leaflet (solus drop) is not worthwhile as you would have to charge too much. You should drop 4 (but not more than 4) (share-plan)
They all have to be different or they conflict, you cant put two estate agents together for example.
Dropping 4 leaflets into 1000 letterboxes takes about 8 hours and you should earn about £120.
If you send your email address to me I will be able to go in to more detail

Delete one, as long as the item has no bids you can delete it. Or simply add somethin in the description making it big and bold that the item has been wrongly listed twice and direct them back to the first listing.

You probably made a mistake when listing and ticked the box for listing under a second group to 'increase the chance of sale'. Open up one of the listings, on the top LH corner you will see a line saying edit my listing, click on that. Put at the end of the listing description section "DO NOT BID - LISTING DUPLICATED"  if you wish to bid on the item, bid on my original listing number .............. (giving the long listing number of the other listing. This way you will keep the watchers. If you just cancel one of the listings you will lose the watchers on that one.

Incidentally, do not put too much faith in the watchers, they may have a similar item that they are thinking of selling and are keeping an eye on your listing to see what sort of money it makes.  my son sold a ride on lawn mower today on ebay, it had 37 watchers, but there was only one bid made on it.

Well I went through all this last week. The difficulty with the comparisons websites was they kept asking how much it would cost to rebuild my house, how would I know. Tescos site was awful so I phoned a couple in the yellow pages. My best deal was with Legal & general,  being over 50 it cost less than the comparisons sites. So a bit difficult to give you a good answer.

As with anyone's life, what are your desires, goals, dreams!
Decide what it is you want from life!  Then find the right business (instruments) tools to move you in that direction. Don't let anyone tell that it can be accomplished without effort,time and planning. But it really isn't that difficult.
I currently have an online business that has to be the easiest and most profitable home based business in the industry. We provide great support and unbelievable training. I would love to help you build your own business.

KidCurry:

I've found much peace and happiness by starting my own online marketing business, which focuses on helping others, such as yourself, realize just how easy it is to earn a nice, honest living online and break free from the rat-race of rising gas prices and large company layoffs.

* The process is NOT EASY...You will have to contribute at least 2-3 hours a day (Take the weekends off like I do!) to seeing the success you're looking for.

* Takes TIME to see results...On 'average', this time line is a minimum of 30 days, and can take up to 90, but again, it's all about YOUR ATTITUDE and how much work you do to securing your own financial freedom! I've seen some people see success in as little as 7-10 days, and I've also seen some take almost the ful 90 days to start seeing their efforts pay off.

* Requires NO MONEY to get started, however, if you're willing to invest in an actual domain name, web hosting and a few other 'essential business tools', you'd spend less then $150 +/- and should be able to recoup that initial investment within a few short weeks.

I"m currently working with a few close associates at the moment and don't have a lot of free time now,  however, if you're serious about wanting to earn some extra cash in order to help pay off some bills, or just have more money at the end of the month then what's going out, please do not hesitate to contact me personally through Yahoo and I'll see if I can free up some time to work with you.



I hope my response answers your question?



Sincerely,

RME, Jr.

I use the internet to make money every day, however, I use it as a tool not the "total package" I am an Equipment Leasing Broker. Basically, I bring people together who want to buy equipment and those that have money to lend. I use the Internet - phone and fax to accomplish this. Now, it did take an investment on my part, but I am earning more than ever and enjoying myself so much - I sometimes forget that I can stop -whenever I want to. Make sure it is something that you enjoy ! Good Luck

The best way is to join a gpt site. Although, I wouldn't recommend using a site that just offers ptc ads...it takes a long time to make a lot of money. I would say your best bet is to join a site that offers 'cash offers' and ptc ads. Some cash offers are like surveys, and there are also a lot of 'free-trial' offers that pay out a lot. I would recommend checking out http://www.cheshirecash.net , treasuretrooper.com/surveys, or squishycash.

Good luck :)

Also, we cannot buy from a wholesale buyer as we do not have a business card which permits us to - due to tax.

Where are you based?  If you are in London then try New Road/Commercial Road, but look out for the fakes.

I am not sure what you mean about a card.  Tax should not affect it, you won't need VAT registration until your turnover is huge and a standard business card can be produced in those machines in the supermarkets

A company that doesn't exist yet cannot sponsor an employee for a work visa. In fact, to sponsor an employee, you need to prove that th business exists and one of the requirements is the tax paid by the business.

Also to get an investors visa, your uncle needs to have at least $500,000 if investing in a "targeted employment area" or $1 million if not

http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/m...

Get your uncle to come to the US for several months and then come back. The Netherlands is part of the US Visa Waiver Program where residents of these countries can go to the US for 90 days without a visa.

http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/withou...

He can come for 90 days - leave the country for a couple of weeks - and then come back again. Do this until the business is started, and until the business can sponsor him

I'm 16 and planning on starting my own business. Advice needed?



Hey everyone. I'm currently 16 and when i am older i want to run my own business. So recently i decided i might as well start now! Only a small thing though. Just to try and make some more money to put towards university or something i may need. I have Taken Media, ICT, Maths and Business studies. And i have the attitude needed to keep a business open. Although, because i am only young and still in school 4 days a week i was planning on starting small working on Ebay and Amazon. (All done with help of family members)

Heres my idea.
Due to the increase in size of people. Generally i mean. People need bigger clothes. And some people find it difficult to afford large clothes (XL+) As they are usually expensive. Which is where i see a gap in the market and would like to buy clothes (Males shirts XL up. Trousers 34" up) and then resale using online techniques. Like Ebay...
So i need you, to give me links, names and just any company (Based in england) So that i can buy large clothes and sell. So someplace like a warehouse or holesaler. The whole idea of merchenting comes into to play here.
This is simply to make a small business on Ebay (selling items) and my own website (As i can make the website myself and also advertise.) Which who knows. In the future my idea may become very successfull.

You may find it hard to beleive i am 16 :)
I currently have 1300pounds to work with. I been saving up.



To summerise....
I need warehouses or holesalers who will sell clothes cheap, so i can resale them on the internet. So if you know of any then please. Do tell me. Any of the popular supliers who make clothe, if you just so happen to have the website for where i can buy large items of clothing for resale.. (E.g Denim jeans, Easy clothing. Ect Ect.)

If anymore information is needed feel free to ask and i shall give you it in as much detail as i can.
I'm mainly looking for advice. Where i can buy clothes. Where to start ect ect.

Thanks for reading and no silly comments please. I am quite serious about my idea and i hope it will be a big success.



Many thanks to people who reply.

Well done for thinking ahead.  I do not want to put a spanner in the works but I own my own dancewear shop and perhaps a little advice may be useful.  Most manufacturers before they sell to you or take you on as a client they insist that you buy at least £500 of stock first.
They also need references from the bank and others so this maybe a little tricky for you.
I think you have a good idea but I feel getting into the rag trade as they call it can be difficult.
Do you know anyone who could make these items for you, then I am sure that you would have a winner.
The most popular suppliers will only sell to the bigger shops, so if you can make your own and undercut them you may find this easier.  The only trouble being people want the right name tag.
It might be worth visiting Manchester where lots of stockists have their own shops or warehouses, but again gaining access can be difficult.  No harm in trying though.
I am sure that if an older person went with you this might help.  Some local authorities have funding and advice for starting your own Business so they maybe a good place to start.
You should also join via the net the Manufacturers index and sign up for a small fee this will get you onto their websites, some of them may agree to sell to you, but you will not be able to return the goods so choosing carefully would be important.

If you cannot buy them cheap enough and I mean at half price then your mark up is so small by the time they add their VAT on and Postage and packaging.  Of course you will have to pay the VAT and you will not be able to claim it back, so take this into consideration when you do your mark up and if you price it too high then your customers will go somewhere else.

If you can find a machinist then this comes into a different category because you are creating garments which is a service and funding then becomes available.

I hope I have not put you off, just trying to be honest.  I wish you well in your endeavours and would love to hear about your progress.

Thanks. I have only really searched the internet for warehouses and stock places. But i never really thought about going to a city like Leeds or Manchester and finding them myself. Me and my father will go there sometime soon and see what we can find. Thanks for the advice.

My sister once got a box of clothes from a liquidator site. there was a price for the entire box [not sure how much] but it was like $2-3 for each piece of clothes. They had categories like designer pants and juicy track suits. And then shoes and stuff. I'm pretty sure they would have large sizes. you didn't get to pick out what you wanted it just all came in a big box. All it is is just stuff that wont sell in stores by the time they get new stuff in.

Well your idea is really smart and i hope it works out.
Just so you know im 15 but still consider my advise plz.
I live in america and i don't know about the business's
if they are in England or not. But
Good Will, Savers, Ross and T J Max all sell stuff cheap.
Good Will is a store that takes donations as well as Savers
Ross and T J Max are stores that take donations 
but not from the public like they take donations from Malls
like JCPennys (and other department stores) 
dontates to Ross and T J Max I would advise
for now just look around on the internet
and GOOD LUCK!

In UK the first £35000 in each bank is protected BUT you could have more invested in what you think are unrelated banks that they treat as one bank.

It is very very difficult to find separate banks to invest in and even if you do at a stroke they can merge into one and you can't stop it.

Not really sure what amount you are looking to make, on average I make about £250 every 2 weeks from my scheme, however the money isnt guarenteed Im afraid.



Am only 16 so do it part time between school, and more recently between GCSE revision. Find it much better than a part time job as 1. the pay is better usually and I can work whenever I want, so if I have a spare hour I use it on this rather than waste it.

Anyway, what I do is use those giveaway sites, where you sign up to a deal, (lovefilm, coral bet etc) and then refer friends.



Some offers and entirely free, (lovefilm) others you have to pay a fiver or so for, but it is worthwhile. Obviously start with the free offers. You then refer people to do exactly the same as you and then you receive a free item, normally I get a PS3.

Anyway, I then sell the PS3 on ebay, keep the money, and start again on a new item.

I have created a website with all the info



www.freewebs.com/mark304



Is only basic but has all info on what to do, how to, and even proof. Also has all the most reputable links towards the 'proper' sites.



Would advise you create one as it does help when referring friends.



Anyway, visit my site, is definatly worthwhile, you have nothing to lose and you will not regret it, I know I dont.



www.freewebs.com/mark304

Furthermore, these things have been shown by the bbc, the video is on my site, so it does show this does work for real. Unlike many scams and cons on the web. Have a read.

there are a number of  ways to make money on-line and working from home. now, a lot of them are espcially capital free. you just need a laptop with a little know-how around using your pc. it also takes a little time (week or so), to personally do some research so that you are properly equipped.

i have been working with a delivery company who pay me a mere pound per parcel for dispatch in my area. about £20-£30 for an hour or so. the other is paid surveys. which unless you spend a lot of time on them, they can prove strainious. although i have information on them, i would not recommend for someone who already has a day job. i don't want to count my eggs/chicken early, but i think i could help in the near future.



stay in touch, i will live this one to your descretion.

Hi,

Sorry if this is really confusing? I have been to Barclays and they want a long winded business plan .. i have my own ...with is suffice for me will i need one that is suffice for them as well if i want to open an account with them?

Thank you!

You need to register as self employed within 3 months of starting your business. I dont think you mean that you are setting up a company as this will be rather complicated at this stage.
You will need to set up a business bank account as soon as you can. I dont know why Barclays want a business plan unless you are borrowing money from them. Just set up a number 2 account with your normal bank.
Your business will not affect your tax at your PAYE job.

Okay....

You have three months to register from when you commence trading. Trading being, performing any work or services......

Once you have registered you will get a tax return each year. On this form you will complete sections relating to your employed income and your self employed income.

Your self employment does not affect your tax allowances you get on your employment. But please be aware, any income you now earn from your self employment is taxable and so you may wish to set aside some of this money to meet your future tax bill.

You are not setting up a new Company. You are setting up a new business as a soletrader so dont use that term with Customers or at the bank.

The bank should not be asking you for a business plan to set up a business current account unless you are asking them for some form of borrowings, be it an overdraft or business loan. If this is the case then you need to look into getting a proper business plan drafted up as most high street lenders wont lend to businesses who arent perpared to give them some form of business plan or security.

If you have any further questions hun feel free to drop me an email.....

And good luck !!!

Realistically, now is not a sensible time to start a business. You would most likely lose your money in around 5 months of starting out, as no one is spending much with prices going up & a recession just around the corner.

I wouldn't, most business go bust within the first year and that wouldn't be helped with bank collapses and people spending less money. I'd wait until things were more stable and i had a decent chance of survival, then probably a decent cafe/coffee bar. Where i live you either have commercial big names like star bucks who charge prices beyond belief, supermarket cafes like Morrison's or tesco. or cafes fit only for street rats. there's noin betweenn ground.

As far as naming your company I suggest you go to http://nameboy.com and try playing around with some catering terms and see what you get.  Try catering first and some other words for the secondary word like quality, fast, good.

Good luck.  I hope your business does well!

How to start a small business when I'm still in permanent employment?



I would like to start a small business but I am still in permanent employment.I need advice on how operate with a company name to make it look more professional as well as how to open a business bank account.Will operating as a sole trader be a problem if I want a business name and what will i have to submit to the inland revenue for tax

I trade foreign currency as a home based business.  It doesn't require a business name.

If you don't have a business idea you can look into network marketing.

Or you can find a business mentor that can lead you through the process of operating a business part time.  I can recommend a good one if you're interested.  Just message me if you would like some information.

But operating as a sole trader shouldn't be a problem if you have an idea and want a business name....  You will want to setup a DBA and operate under a business name while being a sole proprietor.  My mother has operated as a sole proprietor with a business name for many years.  She has never been required to incorporate in order to operate her business.

And you can change your business entity later if you want to become an LLC, LLP, Corporation., etc.  There are certain tax and income benefits of which can be taken advantage depending on the size of your organization.  Further, depending on the nature of your business you may want to consider becoming incorporated to reduce liability.

You need to be clear about how you are going to operate because first you say you want to be a company and then you say tou want to be a sole trader.
To open a business bank account, you first of all need to be clear about how you are going to trade. If you are trading through a company, this needs to be set up before you apply for a business bank account. If you are going to be a sole trader, you just set up a bank account in your trading name.
The company will register for Corporation Tax and you will pay tax under PAYE on all your drawings. If you are a sole trader, you will self assess annually and pay your tax in Jan and July.

How do I chase an invoice which is over 30 days overdue to us?



We are a small company and I have just taken over the accounts, I have noticed a few outstanding invoices and wondered if anyone had any ideas on how to word the letter?  Obviously this is the first letter despite numerous phone calls and still no payment has been received then I want a second letter that is just a gentle reminder that their payment is due on such and such a date.

Humour works well.  I ran off a few slips with a photo of two mafiosi, one with a violin case and the other with a fish. (It was originally on the cover of the Observer Magazine)  It said: With the Compliments of Our Credit Control Department.  I attached one of those to each statement with overdue payments and got cheques by return.

Write a letter, saying something like (similar to what someone else answered):

"RE: Invoice #_____ OVERDUE

Dear (person invoice went to),

This letter is in regard to the invoice mentioned above. We are currently awaiting payment for the services we provided. If you have misplaced your copy of the invoice, we have attached a copy for your convenience.



We have made numerous phone calls, and sent many letters regarding this overdue payment. If you wish to discuss this matter, please contact us at your earliest convenience.
If you do not wish to take action, or do not take any action by INSERT DATE we will be forced to use a bill collector.



We appreciate your business and hope to hear from you soon."

If another letter doesn’t work, hire a bill collector! Times are tough, but people need to pay their bills. Send them another copy of the invoice along with the new letter, be polite in the letter, but tell them you will be forced to use a bill collector. They may not be paying because no one else did anything. Call the person the invoice went to, and reiterate what the letter said. I work a larger company, and a co-worker misplaced an invoice, so it went 30 days overdue. The company we owed the money to called her a few times before she ever sent out the check. Just be persistent.
Good luck!

collections requires continued calling, asking when you can expect payment - even asking for partial payments - if they are a repeat customer and have unpaid bills more than 60 days old- tell then you have to put them on hold and stop future orders until they get their acct under 45 days or something - only being 30-59 days past due is nothing in the current economy - just keep calling them at least once a week, send an occasional statement that clearly shows all their outstanding invoices and highlights the overdue ones

No, I don’t think so. I just don’t know anyone, even if their first startup company was successful, that didn’t bang their head plenty of times. Many went through failures in order to find success. Even the Microsofts and the Apples all had intermittent failures along the way.

You can have success day in and out, but I’ve found that to sustain the energy and enthusiasm that’s going to get you farther, you have to deal with more no’s then yes’s. You need both, there’s no question. But plenty of people [experiencing] startup failures understand that failure is a part of the process — they just hope they can skip it. It’s not like you go out and say, “I’ll have two failures and then have success.”

It can be depending on how the lessons of failure are translated into learning's.

Someone who continually fails and does not take the lessons or the learnings of how why and when they failed will always continue to do so

You will usually find that many successful people did not always get it right first time ..but when they got it wrong it was a lesson they never forgot..or repeated!

The Small Business Administration http://www.sba.gov and SCORE (non-government) at http://www.score.org are helpful.



If you mean financial assistance, then you're looking at a loan rather than a grant, which aren't available from the federal government for business start-ups. Your state or provincial government might have a program for that, but again, you'll probably be raising your own capital through your own means.

If you're in the UK, the government provides help and advice for new businesses through Business Link.  They provide seminars on many aspects of starting in business and also help on an individual basis.  They can give you advice on funding for your business but don't give loans as such.

Inland revenue also provide free help and advice for new businesses.  Like Business Link, they run free seminars and advice sessions.
