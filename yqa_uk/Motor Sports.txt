<additional details>



If I do have too much time on my hands, then I'm glad I spend it giving some pleasure to the half-dozen people who enjoy doing my quizzes. You had time to bother not answering properly too, you know...



You need to have a look at 6, 8 & 9 again, Julian...well done too, I missed Alonso for 10, you have the others right.

Number 9 was done at the 5th-ever Hungarian GP, to help a bit.



I don't know who gave booboo the TD, but he's got 2 right of the 3 Julian didn't get.

Right, I'll do my best:

1) I think it's Renault.
2) Schumacher?
3) Is it Damon Hill? I know he had a very good record at Hungary.

5) I dunno...Ferrari.

8) 1993, Prost in a Williams?

10) I think it's Button, Hill and Alonso that scored their first wins, but I've no idea about the last.
Edit: Oh yeh, and Heikki or course...and would Button and Heikki count as a last win as well? :)

Best:
Pedro Rodriguez
Jacky Ickx
Gilles Villeneuve
Ayrton Senna
Michael Schumacher
(honourable mention to Keke Rosberg)

Worst (all bad drivers in any conditions anyway):
Alex Soler-Roig
Pedro Lamy
Hector Rebaque
Piercarlo Ghinzani
Pascal Fabre.

People who put Prost in the list are thinking of Monaco 1984, where he did just enough to win and looked bad in comparison with the young and reckless Senna & Bellof; or they are remembering the old Prost from the early 1990s - almost all drivers lose their rain ability with age, except maybe the ones I named above. He was one of the best rain drivers of his time in his youth, not quite at the Villeneuve/Rosberg level, but then they were both a little insane on the track at times...

In the wet, well the ones I remember ( post 1993)
1. Senna, purely for Donnington 1993
2. M. Schumacer, in the wet at Spain 1996, incredible
3. Jean Alesi, the amount of times he carried on with slick tyres
4. Rubens Barrichello, his first win was in the wet but Nurburgring 1999, the amount of time he took out of 2nd placed Jarno Trulli was great.
5. ( How many TDs for this un?) Jos Verstappen, just about all of his 17points came in the wet.

Worst,
Coulthard made some big errors in the wet but also had some great drives. Alain Prost, after a big wet weather crash, often drove slower. Ricardo Rosset manged to make even more mistakes in the wet.
I think Pedro Lamy was the worst i remember, he crashed out of the 2 1996 wet GPs on the opening laps.

Ayrton Senna, no doubt number one.  Schumacher runs a close second.  I think he is somewhat overrated.  Don't get me wrong, he's a GREAT driver, but he drove for such a dominating team that it's hard not to do well with Team Ferrari.  Ayrton was just brilliant, and unfortunately, he lost his life racing.  At least both left legacies on road cars (Acura NSX, Senna) and (several Ferraris, Schumacher).  After that, it's hard to determine because these two are so far above them.

Good question!  I think it wouldn't make any difference.  Ferrari always seem to come up smelling of roses and every other team gets it in the neck and as long as a certain MS is lurking in the background, it ain't going to change!!  Do you, incidentally, think he will end up running the team, eventually?

PS Lewis doesn't stand a cat's chance of ever driving for Ferrari imvho. but stranger things have happened.

To be honest it doesn't matter who drives for Ferrari they will also
get slagged off because all non-ferrari fans think that the fia is

and another set for the another teams.

First.
2.22secs for me mate. De Crasheris could find ways of crashing never before seen....

Tracing round his c*ck for that bemused boy at 17secs was upsetting. Where were the FIA in those days?

Second.

Gotta be Brasil '82 Piquet vs Rosberg. Excellent.
I enjoyed the Prost vs Jones as well, but more for the end interview: "Well, you know, when I had no wing and no side pod and no wheels etc etc I knew I had to dig deep...."  Different times.

Sense you are asking this question... you don't need to worry about winning no matter what kind of car you have. It takes money and experience ( and you don't have the experience) to even come close to winning. My friends has several years experience, a very good driver, and still doesn't win all the time. And let me tell you he can kick your butt on the track anytime, any car.

Doesn't matter for that class. You need to get one and learn. Any make, follow the rulebook for your local track for that class. Many times the guys at the end of the season try to sell their cars because they are moving up a class or getting out of racing. It's a cheap way to find out if you will like it.

I Hate the guy. Why does he have to talk bout hamilton all the time! Sure Lewis is british, he's doing ok and ITV is british but Come on!! there are other drivers out there! Even when Lewis is just doing average he'll make a big deal out of it and build it up and make out like he's the next Senna or something, I dont think so. Seriously i saw a clip of the last few laps of the Belgian grand prix with the commentary from speed and they were cheering on Raikkonen and it was so refreshing! i could actually enjoy it without having this feeling building up in my chest that made me want to pick up the Tv and throw it across the room just to get Allen to shut up! thank god for brundle is all I can say.

James Allen is a true F1 fan but his first opinion of just about anything is wrong or biased, if he thought for a few seconds before he spoke, his commentary would improve beyond recognition.
Murray Walker will be 86 next year and sadly, I doubt he would want to go back into the commentary booth.

He is a bit of an idiot. A complete Tory boy, and does not have great in depth knowledge. I remember when he used to do his section before he commentated, on strategies. I used to shout at the TV saying, who the f*ck cares what formulae you need to calculate when the cars are coming in. Pit strategies arn't the most exciting thing in F1.

But I do admire that he has watched the sport for a long time and he is passionate. He also is a good commentator in terms of speaking clearly and stating what is going on. Personally I would love to see an ex-driver in the role. But it seems unlikely as I think BBC will want to go with ITV's idea of making the sport more appealing to general viewers and not hardcore petrol heads.

We all miss Murray but the mans going senile. I remember his last days as a commentator God Bless, his Murryisms became a little too common! But no one will ever match his passion.

As for the Hamilton loving, come on, we have a great driver and hes British! Unless your watching from Australia or somewhere not in the UK put a sock in it!

I can't get enough of Brundle. I wish they did like a second commentating option on digital and it was purely for F1 geeks with Brundle allowed to talk without being held back.

I'm with Jenk on this. If James Allen could come to your house and watch a race with you, it would be fascinating as he obviously knows his stuff and has a great nerdyness about him that all F1 fans can appreciate. 
Yes he is full on about Hamilton but ITV always have and eye on the ratings; if a casual viewer can hear a British driver doing well then they are inclined to watch the rest of the race- job done.
Having said that, I doubt he will go to BBC- his sycophancy to Ferrari  (his son is called Enzo for god's sake) is just a bit too un-British for them!

It looks like Sato might well get the drive. They want an experienced driver in the team next year, and there aren't that many available. Of drivers still around F1, with over 30 GPs (about 2 seasons' experience), but without a race drive, only Christian Klien is anywhere near Sato's level as a driver. 
The problem is that nobody knows what Honda are doing next season. I don't think Toro Rosso will confirm their driver line-up until they know what Honda have planned for Barrichello and Sato next year. I doubt Barrichello will stay at Honda, and he would be a good signing for Toro Rosso. However, Sato would bring more money to the team. 
In conclusion, I think that if Sato goes to TR, then Bourdais will get another season. However if Barrichello goes there, then they may take a chance on young Senna, or Buemi.
