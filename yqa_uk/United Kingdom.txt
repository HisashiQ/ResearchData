Red brick (or "redbrick") is a term used to refer to the six civic British universities founded in the major industrial cities of England in the Victorian era which achieved university status before World War II. Modern usage of the term also sometimes refers to the members of the Russell Group of universities founded between 1850 and 1960, although the terms are by no means mutually inclusive.

The fired colour of clay bricks is significantly influenced by the chemical and mineral content of raw materials, the firing temperature and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example pink coloured bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues, if the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple and then to brown or grey at around 1300 °C. Calcium silicate bricks have a wider range of shades and colours, depending on the colorants used.

Get a train from the Luton airport to the London. Get out and hail a taxi. Get in the taxi and say "Astor Hotel, Queensborough Terrace my good fellow - and don't spare the horses". Get out on arrival. You have reached your destination.



Look - whoever gave me the thumsdown - I was born in London, I have known London for half a century and I can assure you that the above would be the most stress free and safe way for a foreign visitor to find a particular hotel.

She is the farthest thing from being posh or high-class.
I'm curious as to how she got the name.
I'm guessing she was rich before or something.



But then again, when did having money make you high-class?

One week is not enough!! You could base yourslef in Aviemore, its beautiful with lovely lochs to see and walk round (like Morlich) and the stunnign Cairngorm mountains (google them they have a web cam). fromt here you can drive round the area, to Loch Ness which is beautiful, Redven (sp?) barracks, shopping in Inverness. The Culludon (sp?) battlefield.. A long days drive is Fort William. Then head to Edinburgh for the last few days maybe with their castle and spooky ghost tours, excellent food, drink and stunning buildings. Have fun!

Avoid Edinburgh at all costs, nothing Scottish about the place and it’s just a rip-off.



The best castile in Scotland to visit it, by far, Stirling Castle.



Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland, offers fabulous shopping, crowded pubs and clubs and terrific restaurants. Art lovers will also find plenty to capture their imagination, as the city is home to more than 30 galleries and museums, including the world famous Burrell Collection and Saint Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art. Naturally it is also possible to visit the coast from Glasgow or discover the rich history of the region by exploring neighbouring cities and villages.



Architecture: Many of the city’s buildings date back to the 19th century, when Glasgow was the trading centre of Scotland. Nowadays, the city palaces of yesteryear serve as offices and department stores. Enjoying both architecture and the contents of the buildings is the theme of The Lighthouse in the heart of Glasgow, with a variety of dynamic exhibitions on art and architecture.



Shopping: Glasgow is the largest shopping city of Great Britain after London and offers excellent shopping. Visit the pedestrianised shopping precincts Sauchiehall Street, Buchanan Street and Argyle Street or one of the indoor shopping malls, such as the Buchanan Galleries or St Enoch Centre.



Food and drink: Whisky, preferably single malt, is the drink of choice in Scotland. A visit to a distillery is certainly worthwhile. Like in England, the Scots enjoy a hearty breakfast with bacon and eggs, whereas dinner usually consists of a wide selection of meats. Salmon is also widely available. Mutton lovers must certainly try the traditional Haggis.



Getting Around: Glasgow has one of the most advanced, fully integrated public transport systems in Europe. Glaswegians are very reliant on buses, the underground, and the local railway network that cross the city and link it to the suburbs. The Travel Centre at St Enoch Square (+44 (0) 141 226 4826) is a good starting-point for general Glasgow-wide travel information.



Underground: The Glasgow Underground has twin tunnels providing a circular service linking 15 stations. Trains are frequent (approximately one every five minutes), and tickets are cheap, but must be bought in advance of the journey either from a machine or from the ticket office at the station.



Rail: An extensive network of regular and frequent local rail services operates in Glasgow, its suburbs and the West of Scotland. Most suburbs and towns within this area are accessible by train. If you are staying outside Glasgow and do not want to drive into the city, you can use the 'Park-and-Ride' system, which allows free parking at suburban rail stations, where you then continue your journey by train. CCTV protects most of the parking facilities - the Park-and-Ride also operates at four Glasgow Underground stations.

Glasgow is the only UK entry in the list of top 10 cities in the world in the 2009 Lonely Planet Guide.



It is known for its spacious, relaxing parks – there are over 90 parks & green areas within the City boundaries, more than any other city its size. Many contain some of the city’s main galleries & attractions, and facilities for recreational activities.
FREE Ranger-led guided walks are available at Botanic Gardens,Glasgow Green & Kelvingrove.
http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/P...



Art & culture are important in Glasgow life where galleries & museums are in abundance. http://www.glasgowmuseums.com/ All have Free entry – great for someone on a budget.



There's year-round calendar of festivals and events, many of them FREE. -see links



Good transport links mean you can get to most of the major attractions quickly & easily. The Underground train system is a fast way to travel from the City Centre to West End venues & several sites on the south of the River Clyde. A Discovery Ticket (£1.90) gives one day's unlimited travel after 9:30, all day Sunday.



Here's what I believe are Glasgow’s “must-see” attractions:



Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
[nearest Underground Station: Kelvinhall]



The Museum of Transport
[nearest Underground Station: Kelvinhall]



The Burrell Collection, Pollock Park & Pollock House
Pollock House has the finest privately owned collection of Spanish paintings in the UK, including works by Goya, Murillo, & El Greco.
[Getting there: Train from Glasgow Central Station to East Kilbride. Get off at Pollokshaws West (2nd stop). Turn left at station exit. Walk down the slight slope onto the north side of Pollokshaws Road. Continue (east), about 100 metres in all, over the river to the first down kerb, (entrance to Pollok Park), turn left here. Or number 45 bus from North Hanover Street].



In the old centre of the city, Provand's Lordship (Glasgow’s Oldest House, 1462), & Surrounds (including Glasgow Cathedral, Necropolis & St. Mungo Museum.
http://www.glasgowcathedral.org.uk/
http://www.igougo.com/attractions-review...
[Getting there: First Bus services 11, 36, 37, 38, 42, 89, and 138 all stop near the museum]



In the Merchant City area, the Trades Hall is one of the most important historic buildings. Designed & built from 1791-1794 by Robert Adam and his brothers, as a meeting place for the city’s Trades House & 14 Incorporated Crafts. Today, the Trades House still meets in the building, which apart from the mediaeval cathedral is the only building in Glasgow still used for its original purpose. It has many unique features including the original Adam white marble fireplace, a seven metre dome bearing the coat of arms of each of the 14 Incorporated Trades, Spanish mahogany panels and spectacular windows. You can tour the building without a guide Mon-Fri & Sat. mornings or with a guide on Tuesdays. FREE Admission.
http://www.tradeshallglasgow.co.uk



Take a FREE 45 min. guided tour of the magnificent City Chambers building. Glasgow’s municipal headquarters in George Square stands as a proud statement to the city’s position during the 19th century as "Second City of the Empire."

The London Underground from Heathrow (The Picadilly Line) is undergoing some major renovation, so it is probably not the best way to go.  Take the Express train to Paddington (depart Heathrow every 15mins) and from there you can catch the underground.



Visit the website below for the underground information.  Specifically look at the Picadilly line services.  You will see that they have worked out an agreement with the Express.



Since you really don't have time to visit the insides of much, you could do a lot by going to Buckingham palace and then wondering toward Parliament from there.  You can see the barracks, St. James Park, Whitehall, Parliament, Big Ben and Westminster.



You could go into Westminster (the front part is open free of charge, but if you want to visit the section with tombs of poets etc., then you have to pay an extra bit (worth it if you haven't seen it).



You could then easily get to Trafalgar or Picadilly/Soho and find a pub to visit.



That makes for a nice, quick, central visit.  There are other options too.



I am happy to make specific recommendations. I provide personal tours and group tours of Rome and Europe. Feel free to contact me through my website listed below.

if it says 8, then that means 8, no earlier, and no more than a few minutes late
shoes? some prefer you to take them off, some dont, take your lead from whoever answers the door, look at their feet, seldom will people expect a guest to take their shoes off, but fresh socks just incase!



as for a gift, it is polite but not essential, i would go for a small box of chocolates, i dont know where you are in scotland, but look for something like a thorntons, and get a small box of chocolates, or, if you can, something from your home country that represents you, it may not be exactly like you have at home, but there are many greek delis here
or, a bottle of wine from greece would also be greatly acceptable



please dont worry too much, the one thing we scots are known for, is our warm hospitality! we just require good company, not gifts



enjoy

If the invitation is for 8, and it's just a small event rather than a big party, be there for 8.  Maybe 5 minutes late, but certainly not 30.  If you're a student they won't expect a smart expensive present, but a small box of chocolates or a small bunch of flowers will be nice.



No harm in offering to remove your shoes, but don't start taking them off until you get your answer.

If your invitation is for 8 o'clock, then be there at 8 o'clock. It is considered rude to be late. Just take a small gift such as a bunch of flowers, box of chocolates or a scented candle/ornament. When you go into the house, ask if they want you to remove your shoes. Some houses may want you to and others may not. Hope you have a great time!

If you are looking for a fun day visit the science museum, thye always hav kl exibits. Go horse riding in richmond park and take a pedalo out in bushy park. Go to Thorpe Park and go to the Tower of London. Visit Hampton Court and go to the Ritz for tea. Go to Harrods to eat and look around Hamleys toy store. Go to the National Gallery and see Van Goughs Sunflowers. Go to the transport museum in Convent Garden and also try to see a ballet there (the ballets are AMAZING). Eat out in the Rainforest Cafe, go to the Electric Cinema, go iceskating at Queen's. Go shopping on Oxford Street. Go to the playfround in Hyde Park (I thinkl it's Hyde Park, I get confused), see a play or a pantomime. Go to the V&A. Evry1 suggests places like Buckingham Palace but its not actually that great.

For most visitors, Madame Tussauds and The London Eye are top of their To Do lists. Tower of London, Piccadilly Circus, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Bond Street, Knitsbridge, boat cruise on the Thames. It depends on what you like doing. There are lots of museums and galleries, theatres and shopping places. Go to the visitlondon website and I'm sure there'll be lots of suggestions there too. Have a nice time when you do come... London is usually nice around Christmas time with the lights in Oxford St and Regent St.

Go the the London Duck Tour or London Frog Tour - you can search for both names.  They are the amphibious craft that go around the roads then splash into the Thames - it is really fun.  I think you have to get it from near the London Eye.

What is Nottingham like? its ok.  Just keep in the nice parts of the city
What is the main Central Shopping Centre like? there are 2 shopping centres, broadmarsh and victoria.  They are ok.  the better shops are outside the centres
What are the main attractions in Nottingham? Obviously you have Nottingham Castle, but dont expect to see a very old medieval castle cause that was destroyed.  You have the tales of robin hood which is the history of the outlaw.  There is also the galleries of justice which is good, but best time to go to that is with a paranormal group to spend the night there.  If you do out of Nottingham you can visit sherwood forest.



Oh before I go, I just want to say Nottingham has a good nightlife, but please be careful

I live in Nottingham, it's not as bad as people make out. The main shopping centre well, it's just the city centre and with 2 shopping centres and lots of shops around the city centre. The best thing about it is the city centre, there's lots of shops. I'm not old enough to experiance the night clubs and bars, but anyone from nottingham will tell you there's nothing else like it.There is also the gallerys of justice, which is basicly a old prison/museum which is quite good fun. There is also 'The tales of robin hood' which I can't quite remember but it's like a museum I think. There's also the nottingham caves which is under the city centre and you can go to the broad marsh shopping centre and go on a tour in them which is kinda cool. But other than that I can't think of anything else. There's wollaton park, newstead abbey and a few other places like that. I can't think of a lot of attractions but I'm sure there is more. If your thinking of coming here for a break then well it's ok for 1 night at the most but there's nothing much other than shopping. If you thinking of living here then I think it's a great place to live when you get to know it. There is also lots of countryside like 5 min drive from the city centre, there's also holme pire pont, the national water sports centre next to the river trent. Holme pire pont I suppose you can spend a whole day there if the weathers nice, it's a nice relaxing place. There's also a centre parks in sherwood forrest which I think is about 20 min from city centre.  Yes there is some very rough parts but I know people who live in the roughest parts and have never had any problems. It was rated the 3rd most happiest place to live in england so it can't be that bad. I wouldn't want to move anywhere else

Ignore people who say there is loads of crime in Nottingham and you'll get shot! It's a bit of an urban legend now!



London is WAY more dangerous. I mean i can walk the Nottingham streets in the day and feel safe but when i walk around London i feel like i'm going to get robbed or stabbed at any min!



In the end if you walk around any city in the UK on your own at night (particulary around a council estate or city centre) without reason looking for trouble then you will find it. It's all about common sense and knowing the area.  Yes there is gun crime in Notts but most of it is between gang members and people who are involved with them.



Nottingham is an exciting and beautiful city full of greenery which has being unfairly given a bad rep. It is one of the most greenest cities in Britain! Of course there are the rough areas (such as St Anns and the Meadows) but it has it's nice areas. It's like any city in Britain! Also check the whole county of Nottinghamshire (avoid Mansfield though it's horrible!). In Nottingham and outside the area you have what Londoners don't: BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE. Beautiful places such as Sherwood Forest, Peak District, Woolaton Park, etc.



In the end if you avoid Nottingham simply because of what stupid people say about the place then you are missing out on a city full of friendly people, great attractions, great shops, etc.

Glasgow used  both red and gray sandstone in the tenement building period of the 19th century Although red sand stone was found relatively close by ( Giffnock for example ) the more prestigious buildings were built of Locharriggs sand stone from Dumfries . Edinburgh too used sandstone whilst Abedrdeen was famed for its granite ( Ruberslaw ) . The lack of suitable stone  in England saw the traditional brick made from clay used for centuries . Portland stone in the south of England is their most important stone Many buildings in London used stone from Caen in France .

Motorways include M1 - North, A1(M) - North east, M11 - Cambridge, M2 - Canterbury, M20 - Dover, M3 - Southampton, M4 - South Wales, M40 - Birmingham.  The M25 is the orbital ring road.



Rail Terminals are Paddington (West), Waterloo, Victoria (South), London Bridge (South East), Liverpool St (East Anglia), Kings Cross, St Pancras, Marylebone & Euston (Midlands, North & Scotland).  St Pancras is also an International Station with rail links to France.



Airports are Heathrow (Middlesex), Gatwick (Sussex), Stanstead (Essex), Luton (Bedfordshire) and the little City Airport serving Western Europe.



The Underground Railway Network is a very important way to get around London, as are the buses.  Black cabs go everywhere and you see them everywhere.



London is hardly used any more as a port - the docklands were redeveloped 20 years ago for offices and luxury apartment blocks.  Most sea traffic goes through Felixstowe in Suffolk, and the Channel ports of Dover and Folkestone in Kent, Harwich in Suffolk, and Southampton and Portsmouth in Hampshire.

Salisbury plain is a military training area, so if you want to pitch your tent make sure that you don't get run over by a tank in the middle of the night!



Also there is a busy main road right by Stonehenge so your idea of a peaceful night sleep is not going to be quite what you would imagine!

You raise a good point there, DS.
I've travelled a lot, and hope some day to meet people who take me as an individual, not a nationality, but, if people are going to stereotype me anyway, why not find something to be proud of? I didn't say where I was from, either! Anyway, much respect for keeping it real.

It's appropriate to be proud of things you have done, not of attributes you have through accident of birth.



Besides which, what's good about our involvement in the Iraq war and our subservience to America? What's good about our rubbish queen and rubbish prime minister? Our empire? Our binge drinking and yob culture?

Nothing.  The problems start when politically-correct pseudo-socialist rodents who think they have the right to apologise on our behalf for everything Britain has done for the last 500 years start calling the shots and trying to make us feel ashamed of our nation and culture.

It wasnt just Wednesdays... think it was a localised thing, used to be Tuesdays where I lived... gives them an early afternoon off when frankly there was no trade anyway. Wednesday is traditionally a half day for many schools... with sports games or activities taking place in the afternoon, so maybe a link up with that?

I've always heard of it happening on Thursdays, but it's probably the same OLD tradition that dates back to when there were actually weekly open farmers markets and such.  Stores closed so employees could leave early to essentially go groceries shopping.



Most farmers markets that I know of are on Saturdays now, but I suppose some people just like leaving early in the middle of the week.

You used to not be able to see a doctor or dentist on Wednesday...that was their golf day. SERIOUSLY!



Now when I was a kid there was no shopping on a Sunday.  NOTHING was open..not even gas stations.  It was called the Blue Law.



Now there are a some places  that are not open on Mondays...because they are really dead days.  People are partied out and back to work and that is the worst business day in the week....especially for Restaurants.

The word "nice" and "Chelmsford Essex" should not be used in the same sentance.



The word "chav", "knife crime" and "slum" are more suited.

my family live in glossop.  there are your normal high street shops.  there is a nice outdoor and indoor market.  There isnt really much for the young ones there.  There are a nice few cafes to eat in and there is a museum in the town market square.  Oh also there is a lovely big park, that has train rides for the kids and a playground.



if snakes pass is open then you can go up to castleton and take them down the caves.



best time to go to glossop is when they have the victorian weekends and christmas fairs.

Its a very small and quiet village on the Greater Manchester/Derbyshire boarder and has one of the main (infamous) routes into Sheffield passing through - the Snake Pass.  It's infamous due to the amount of fatalities on the road and because of the fact it's always closed.  It's very beautiful and picturesque though!



There isn't much to do round there to tell the truth, but there are some nice walks, little shops and there is a nice park to walk around as well, but it is very cold at the moment and i can imagine it will be worse on the Peaks.



Also you are close to the Peak Distict National Park and it's only a short drive away to the fairholmes visitor centre near the Derwent reservoir.  Here you can take a walk around the beautiful countryside, see and feed all the ducks (there are seriously LOADS.  The ducks will run up to you when they see you have food lol) and you can also hire a bike.



All this is just a drive up the Snakes Pass, but be careful driving up this!

No such thing as a cheap hotel near Heathrow!



Use a the hotel comparison sites and try for the Thistle hotel.



Stay there when we have an early start.



It is just outside the perimeter fence and the Hoppa bus service from all terminals drops you there (was about £3 one way).

London doesnt get as cold as the rest of the UK but in winter it can still go down to below freezing. About 7c is common for this time of year. In summer you could expect temeratures of about 25c - 27c but this could be higher. We seem to be getting record temperatures every year.

For the benefit of oscar, Tiger Tiger is a club in the Haymarket London.



The hotels within the closest proximity are as follows:



The Hampshire, (raddison edwardian) Leicester square.
The Haymarket, Suffolk place, bottom end of the Haymarket on the left.
The Trafalgar, spring gardens/Whitcomb street.
Thistle, Coventry street.
Hilton Trafalgar square.
Shaftesbury, Shaftesbury avenue.
Or if you are feeling quite flush, try the Ritz Piccadilly, the Stafford, and the Duke in  st james place mayfair.



Their are obviously loads more, but these are the closest.

Is Peckham as bad as everyone says it is?



i live in london but dont go round peckham much. recently though i went down to new zealand with some mates for our overseas experience. we chose one of the cheapest places in auckland - otara. the place was a dump. there seemed to be youth gangs on every street and everyone seemed to be either drugged or drunk and carry either machetes or crow bars. the 1st night we were there some arguement started up between the "tongans" and "samoans". This some how ended up in nearly every car on the street smashed and quite a lot in hospital. 2nd night i was there some youth gangs had a fight. must have been at least 50 people and a couple of dogs. yet again more people in hospital.
ever since i went there iv just been wondering if peckham really is as bad as everyone says it is.



btw. the rest of my trip was great. i recommend it. dont go to otara or the rest of south auckland though.

hmm, i'm sorry, it seems your haggis has entered puberty, give it a couple of days to simmer down and it should return. it a confusing time in it's life, it's just been taken out of a sheep's stomach and stuffed for crying out loud, give it the space it needs. *rolls eyes* haggis these days, not like the haggis of the 1980s, no respect for those about to eat them.

Mmmm. Tricky one this. Haggis are extremely difficult creatures to catch. You could set up a trap, but this would hurt him. Or you could try putting some sedatives in his food to tranquilize him them bring him back home. The reason he has left in the first place is because it is the haggis mating season so you could try to tempt him back by getting a female haggis and the scent of her will have him (and other haggis') running back home for a leg over! Good luck.

I think there is a very good chance you will see your haggis again.  All you need to do is set a small trap by putting sparklers and a twinkie in an anti-gravity boot.  It may also attract weasels but your haggis will be waiting there in no time, good as new.

Depends on age of your family - if school age kids then have a look at areas like Bearsden, Milngavie and Jordanhill (all north west, nest Loch Lomond) or NEwton MEarns, Giffnock and Williamwood (on south-side).



Alternatively, further out are Ayrshire (Ayr, Prestwick, Troon, Kilmarnock) which is near the coast yet commutable or Renfrewshire (Paisley, Houston, Kilmacolm, Bridge of Weir, Lochwinnoch).



Have a look at the local council www for school info.



Glasgow is a great place to live with easy access to the countryside and coast. Good luck with the move!

its a shame your not here for boxing day coz everything is like soooo cheap because everything is on sale. im not sure actually around that time... but because everythings so bad at the moment theres probably going to be some sales because they want you to buy stuff. i think there probably will be quite a lot on oxford st, especially as it gets nearer to xmas.

Hi Amy- I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. Where did you visit?



Hi Crazeddoglady



I'm sorry that you had that experience in York. It's my home town though I don't live in the city anymore. I live about ten miles away but still work in York.
As our city depends so much on the tourist trade it's not a good sign that visitors have this oppinion of us.
Thankfully most of us are greatful and pleased that so many different nationalities want to visit our beautiful city and the wonderful surrounding countryside. Hopefully you will visit again sometime and find that most people are friendly and want people to come here.

What is the amount owed?  If it is over (I think) £750 you can apply to have them put into bankruptcy.



IUse the small claims procedure, get a court order and then :-



Find a bank account of theirs with some money in it and garnishee it.



If the amount is large enough get bailiffs to seize a vehicle or office computers.

I'm moving tomorrow and I'm staying in a hotel for a night...the day after tomorrow I will probably turn around searching for a house to rent...

It should be the given UK price unless they are using a courier service.  Some courier services have to charge extra due to extra costs for ferry crossings etc.

Ok! im gonna make this easy for you since it sounds like you have no cooking experience what so ever.

Things you will need: caned sliced tomatoes,skinny loaf of bread, cloves of garlic,1/4 stick of butter,teaspoon of basil,cup of cream,1/2 cup of cheese, and spaghetti.



#1. Buy pre-cut/ sliced tomatoes. In a small pot mix 1 teaspoon of basil in a pot with the sliced tomatoes. Cook at a mid temperature and stir occasionally.  No longer then 6 minutes.

#2. Buy a loaf of bread, long and skinny. Cut pieces of bread on a diagonal direction. Toast the pieces to a light crisp.



#3. Take 2 cloves of garlic and chop finely.  Melt down butter and mix with garlic. Spread over the toast.

#4. Take the basil tomato and put on toast.



#5.  Take 1 cup of cream and put in a pot. Add 1/2 a cup of graded cheese. This is your allfrado sauce.



#6. Make spaghetti. Boil the water. Then add the spaghetti until soft about 10 minutes.

Spaghetti is an easy, cheap and simple thing to make. You can even buy frozen meatballs to add to the sauce (I make my own sauce with canned tomatoes, just add spices, but for the first time you might want to use a jar). you can either heat the meatballs up in the oven or add them to the sauce and heat them together (if using a stove, make sure you stir often so they don't burn). When boiling the noodles, taste test them before you take them out of the water (some people like them softer than others).

I even buy shredded cheese (either mozzarella or an Italian blend) to sprinkle on top. And if you really want to impress her, you can add a salad and/or buy garlic bread that you just warm up in the oven.

Why does the UK shut down for the night ?



Hi,
In semi-retirement, I am called upon at odd hours to sort out technical probs for the "military" in the UK.

Job done, I wander out in search of a decent breakfast.

Everything is shut, barred up, closed, knackered at 3-4 am

Not so in the USA. 24hr food & drink.

I know it is a case of lack of demand for stuff, but is a Kentucky Fried Chicken thing at midnight too much to ask for ?

We don't all work 9~5

UK culture is changing.  There is more available in the night and on Sundays.

I remember when supermarkets were closed on Sundays - and when supermarkets started opening 24 hrs.  I'm not an old fuddy duddy either - just 28yo!

We now have 24hr drinking in many areas (few Conservative-controlled councils, though).

If you're in Central London, there are lots of places to eat and drink throughout the night.  In fact, Central London is clearly a 24 hour city.

I used to drive buses at night (9pm-5am) and I used to find some takeaways to get food during the night - open mainly for people leaving pubs.

However, in some areas including countryside, suburban areas and smaller towns, there are often more limited options.  You are right that this is supply and demand.  Businesses are businesses, not charities.  They do not have to stay open if there are no customers.

However, there is usually something.  Look for a 24 hour supermarket - they are in many areas of the UK and offer hot food to take away (chickens, curries, pizzas, etc.).  Try a service station which will often have pasties, etc. and a microwave to warn them up in.

In larger towns and cities there are 24 hour McDonalds, Burger King, KFC and independent fast food outlets.

Or take a flask of soup or stew from home.

Good luck finding your food!

Nick

Thanks Nick, and to all for your answers.

As most of the places I am called upon to visit during the night are in remote areas, the flask of stew sounds great.

A lot of it will depend on where you live. A big city or tourist resort will probably have such facilities available around the clock, but I suspect there would be much call for it in a small village in rural England.

The real answer to your question is one of basic economics. Where there is a demand, there will be a supply. If there were thousands of semi-retired people wandering the streets in the early hours of the morning looking for a decent breakfast after sorting out someone's problems, I suspect someone would tap into the potential.

Most people, I suspect, would just go home and cook their own breakfast.

Hi Bob - UK is still very much a "Puritan" country, inspite of the female navals on display.  Thus shops tend to close up at about 5.30 to 7pm.  This includes cafes, many of which are only open during the hours 7am - 5.30pm.  The last orders in most restaurants is about 10.30pm.

I say UK is "Puritan" because most folk still hold to the belief that anyone wondering about at 2 and 3am in the morning must be up to no good.

Until quite recently, it was almost impossible to do any serious shopping here in UK on a Sunday and this was due to a powerful group of Christians called "The Lords Day Observance Society".  Very Puritan, which had many supporters in the House of Commons.

It was really only during the "Elective Dictatorship" of Margaret Thatcher, that Sunday trading began happening.

I'll explain England like this.  In the 17thC The Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell MP banned Christmas.

The English as a result, did not really celebrate Christmas until the mid-19thC when Charles Dicken's book "Christmas Carol" was first published.

The Christmas we have here in England today is based almost entirely upon the "Christmas Carol" ["God Bless Everyone etc"].  Add to this a guy called Santa Clause, who was called Father Christmas until the Coca Cola company first introduced us to Coke back in c1916 or whenever it was the Americans joined us in WW-One.

The Santa Clause we have today is entirely thanks to the Coca Cola Company.

I think it is probably depending where you are in the UK.
My town centre 'Subway' is open till 4am and McDonald's is open till 3am. Another of the fast food restaurants is 24 hour but I can't remember which one. We also have a 24hour supermarket within walking distance and another 3 within a half hour car journey.

We must be lucky, we can get anything we need, when we need it. Even our local 'Boots' which is in sight of the bottom of my street, is open till 1am.

I used to work at Tescos. Usually you are not allowed to work more than eight hours straight, however I don't know how much you will get for 11 hours, but in an 8 hour shift you get 15mins, half an hour for lunch, and then another 15 mins. So I reckon for 11 hours you will get another 15 mins on top of that. Ask your line manager or manager they will tell you exactly what you will get as they will have it on there rota for the day.

Ask your boss. If you aren't happy with the answer, ask your union rep. Someone close to me works for Tesco and they seem very happy to conveniently be blissfully unaware of many contraventions of working time regulations and Health & Safety measures. Unfortunately, most of the staff seem to be unaware they are being exploited too.

Hi
In addition to your normal breaks for a standard 8 hour shift you are entitled to an additional 10/15 minute break, which depending on how your shift is scheduled, you can conbine with your usual 2nd 10 minute break, that is at the discretion of your line manager though.
take care

EDIT
Captain chaos is also TOTALLY right, nobody in Tesco management even knows what the regs are.

When eating in a restaurant in the UK...



...I have heard that if the meal is not to your total satisfaction then you are not legally bound to pay for it at the end, even if you ate it all. Or you may pay whatever you think that it was worth.

Is this true and is it that easy?

When I worked at a particularly crappy restaurant a few years ago a man did exactly this. The owners told him he was taking the piss and called the police. When the police arrived, they backed him up and said that he was within his rights to leave without paying if he felt that the meal was THAT bad. The owners were furious but the police said that the most the owners were allowed to do was bar him from coming back.

Obviously though, the average copper is no legal expert, so I'm not sure if I should believe it because it just seems too whacky to be true!

Can anyone clarify? And ideally provide citation?



</question>



<additional details>



The police did specify though that the customer must have enough money on him to be able to pay for the meal to prove that he did intend to pay.

If you don't like the meal, you should send it back and tell them it is not up to your standards, order something else,

if the meal, service and atmosphere was generally bad you shouldn't feel obliged to tip them,

it's pretty rude if you eat the whole thing and then say you are not paying for it!

If the meal was that bad he should have complained to the management, and certainly wouldnt have eaten it! It cant have been that bad then!!

Ive only been in one situation where i was unhappy, and that was pizza hut. The pizza was cold and we had waited a long time, so when they came round to ask if everything was ok we told them no and what was wrong, so we got the pizza re done, and it was free of charge and then they gave us free deserts, so i was really impressed!!
I can only assume if you report the problem at the time then you are giving the restaurant the oppurtunity to rectify the problem, i certainly wouldn't eat something and then complain! That's just cheaky!!

It's not true. Can be just a little more complicated though since if the diner never intended to pay then that is a criminal offence (theft) and the police will prosecute. If the meal was just so poor that it couldn't be eaten and the diner refused to pay then he/she would leave contact details as a mark of good faith and the restaurant could pursue the claim through the civil courts. Unless other diners could support the claim of poor food then the diner would almost certainly lose and finish up having to pay for the food and court costs.
Don't try it. Either way you will finish up in court.

Hi im not sure, but when we were in a restaurant a couple next to us were moaning about the food and then when they complained to the mananger they got another meal each, despite eating the first meal they had, However they did payI think so maybe the company can offer you another meal, and if you dont accept it then you dont pay or get your money back as in this restaurant you pay first.

I have been to loads of restuarants where the food was horrible but I think is really embarrasing when someone complains, not everyone has the same taste, so what taste bad to me might not to someone else.lol

Sawbridgeworth is a small, mainly residential, town in Hertfordshire on the Essex border, situated between Bishop's Stortford and Harlow.



Location
Sawbridgeworth is four miles south of Bishop's Stortford, twelve miles east of Hertford and nine miles north of Epping. It lies on the A1184 and has a railway station that links to Liverpool Street station. The river Stort flows through the east of the town, past the Maltings (now a small business and residential area).

Nearby towns and cities: Bishop's Stortford, Harlow

Nearby villages: High Wych, Spellbrook, Much Hadham



History
Prior to the Norman Conquest, most of the area was owned by the Saxon Angmar the Staller.

The Manor of "Sabrixteworde" (one of the many spellings previously associated with the town) was recorded in the Domesday Book. After the Battle of Hastings it was granted to Geoffrey de Mandeville by William the Conqueror. Local notables have included Sir John Leventhorpe, who was an executor of King Henry V's will, and Anne Boleyn, who was given the Pishiobury/Pishobury estate, located to the south of the town.

Much of the picturesque town centre is a conservation area; many of the buildings date from the Tudor, Stuart, and Georgian periods. Great St. Mary's church was originally built in the 13th century (although a church on the site existed in Saxon times) and includes a Tudor tower containing a clock bell (1664) and eight ringing bells, the oldest of which dates from 1749.[1] Ralph Jocelyn of Hyde Hall, who was twice Lord Mayor of London in the 15th century, is buried here; images of many of his family and other locals have been engraved on brass, and hence the church is popular for enthusiasts of brass rubbing.

The town's prosperity came from the local maltings, owned by George Fawbert and John Barnard; in 1839 they set up the Fawbert and Barnard charity to fund local children and their education, funding a local infant school that still exists today.

Apart from the historic nature of the town, attractions include local river cruises in the summer and two annual fairs held on Fair Green on St George's Day and the Feast of Saint Dionysius.

By the time of the Norman conquest, or soon after, Sawbridgeworth's rich farming land was fully developed for cultivation as was possible with the means available at the time: it was the richest village community in the country. It is, then, hardly surprising that many important medieval families had estates here. The land was divided amongst them, into a number of manors or distinct estates; the Lord of each manor had rights not only over this land but also over the people who farmed it. The number of manors increased during the Middle Ages, by a process of subinfeudation, that is the granting out of a part of an existing manor to a new owner so that the new manor was created. Many manors sprang from the original Domesday Book holding of the de Mandeville family. The came to be called Sayesbury manor, from the de Say family who inherited it from the de Mandeville's in 1189. The many important people who held these manors built themselves houses with hunting parks around them; when they died their tombs enriched the parish church, so that today St. Mary's has one of the finest collections of monumental sculptures in the country.

The Lordship of Sawbridgeworth includes the following estates: Sayesbury, Pishobury, Gilston, Eastwick Hall, Overhall, Giffards, Shingle Hall and Tedmanbury.



Pronunciation

The name of the town is now almost universally pronounced in the obvious way, but this was not always the case. In the Middle Ages it is believed to have been pronounced "sapserth", and since then the pronunciation has varied to include "sapsa", "sapster" and "sapsworth", and even until the Second World War was pronounced "sapsed".

Current residents often use the casual name "Sawbo".



Politics and local government
Sawbridgeworth is administered by East Herts district council.

The local Town Council currently has 12 councillors, covering both Sawbridgeworth and Spellbrook.

Sawbridgeworth is twinned with:



Bry-sur-Marne in France (1973) 
In Parliament, it is in the Hertford and Stortford constituency. Since the election of May 2005 Sawbridgeworth is represented by Mark Prisk, a Conservative.

The village of Lower Sheering in Essex adjoins Sawbridgeworth, east of the railway station, along the Hertfordshire - Essex border. It shares the same postal code as Sawbridgeworth, although for local government purposes it comes under the Epping Forest district of Essex, with the Member of Parliament being Bill Rammell (Labour).



Education
Sawbridgeworth has a secondary school, the Leventhorpe School, which also offers a public swimming pool and gym. There are also three primary schools and one infants school in Sawbridgeworth.



Sport
Sawbridgeworth Cricket Club is one of the leading cricket clubs in the south of England, fielding seven senior sides and seven colts sides, from ages nine to fifteen. The 1st XI plays in the Home Counties Premier Cricket League, and the other league sides play in the Hertfordshire Cricket League. The main ground is Town Fields, situated behind Bell Street. The second ground is at Leventhorpe School.

Sawbridgeworth also has a football, tennis and bowls club.



Trivia
Notable inhabitants include Victoria and David Beckham at "Beckingham Palace" since 1999. 
The Leventhorpe school has a fully functioning and operational wind turbine, the first in the local area.

A lot. Food, board, etc. More than half your wage will go to pay for the Nanny.
And the cost is not always monetary....my friends husband developed an affair with their Nanny.

I was a live in nanny and was paid £150 a week.  I didn't have to pay for food, a room, bills etc.  I was also told to inform the parents if I bought any food for the kids/used public transport so they could pay for that, but I never did even though I should've.  It was a 12hr day, looking after a 1-yr-old and a 3-yr-old.

However, I knew the parents very well, and that's how I got the job (I'm not qualified).  As I said I'd do it for cheaper than them getting a real nanny.  So...maybe £200-250 a week?  I know non live-in Nanny's can be up to £10 an hour!

I want to send a letter I want to send but it is about 2mm two thick to be classified as a letter in the UK and instead would be classified as a large letter which is much more expensive.Would the Royal Mail care if I sent it as a letter anyway?

They wouldn't care as such, but the recipient would have to pay the excess postage before it was delivered. And if they don't pay, your letter/item doesn't get delivered.

You bet they would.  If you go ahead and post it without the correct postage then it will most likely be returned to you for additional postage.



If you do not put a return address on it they might be nice enough to deliver it to the receiver 'postage due' and make them pay the additional costs....



but most likely it will end up in the undeliverable bin and never make it to its destination, (without a return address, it wouldn't get back to you either).

Most of the mail is processed through automation machines and letters that are too bulky can't get through the belts and rollers and are likely to get chewed up instead of being delivered.

So you are better off to shell out that little bit extra if you'd like your letter to get there.  In a nutshell, YES the RM would care and you would be foolish not to pay the extra postage to send it as a large letter.  It can't be that much more money....

If you send it as just a letter the recipient will have to collect it from the sorting office and pay the extra postage which is only 6p but also the administation charge which is £1.  Would they be happy to do this? if so, send it.

Hi there are lots of places try looking on 
http://www.toptable.co.uk/
and
http://www.london-eating.co.uk/

London eating is good as it wil give you "best for" lists - to find somewhere good for different occasions. 
Both websites have info about scepial offers too.

If you are feeling touristy but classy try Rules - oldest restaurant in London and VERY traditional. Other personal recommendations - Pasha, Gilgamesh, Mango tree, Hakkasan, Yauatcha (like Hakkasan but easier to get a table), Asia de Cuba mentioned above, Blue Elephant are all very good. A few of the above have decent bars too. Check them out on the websites mentioned

What about the Hard Rock Cafe?

If you like Lebanese food, or would like to try it, then Levant would be great. It's lit by candles and has bellydancing, but is quite expensive.

http://www.london-eating.co.uk/1910.htm

If you'd rather stick to American-style food, then try Eagle Bar Diner near Soho. Great milkshakes!

http://www.eaglebardiner.co.uk/

Actually, All Star Lanes might be perfect. It's a 50s themed bar and diner, with its own bowling alley and live music on some nights.

I'd recommend Levant, but it is expensive - even though the food and cocktails are great and you can sit outside in the secluded area to enjoy shisha. Great for a special occasion.

http://www.london-eating.co.uk/1910.htm

Otherwise, try Edgware Road - there are hundreds of shisha places there. Try Fatoush, they have loads of flavours:

It's not a question of the best school, most of them are franchises.

You want a good instructor. Try the Institute of Advanced Motorists and see if any of their instructors will teach you. They aren't motivated by money like the driving school instructors who will try to sign you up to a load of lessons you probably don't need.

It depends if you're looking for something 'fancy', or a local gem.

You will struggle to get truly authentic Thai food in London as it is usually adapted for the Western palate and isn't as spicy etc. However, you can still get very good Thai food. Some to try are:

Patara (Soho) - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/5931.htm
Addie's Thai Cafe (known to be authentic) - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/525.htm
Esarn Kheaw - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/437.htm
Crazy Bear (expensive) - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/4147.htm

As for Indian, check out this list from Squaremeal:

http://www.squaremeal.co.uk/restaurants/...

You have to search hard to find local gems, but London's high end Indian restaurants are among the best in the world. I would recommend:

The Painted Heron - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/2613.htm
Moti Mahal - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/6243.htm
Benares - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/3646.htm
Zaika - http://www.london-eating.co.uk/90.htm

If you're in or near North London, then Meghna Hampstead is well worth a try. Their dishes have great flavour and they do Indian tapas at lunch. It's reasonable too.

What is Coton like for quality of life?



How pleasant is Coton to live in? It seems very close to Cambridge yet cheaper than Cambridge.

Seem nice enough.

Coton is a small village three miles (about 5 km) west-by-north of Cambridge in Cambridgeshire, England. It belongs to the administrative district of South Cambridgeshire. The parish covers an area of 4 km². In 2000 it had a population of 720.

Coton has a primary school, a church (parts of which date from the 12th century) , a restaurant and pub (the Plough), a garden centre containing a Post Office, farm shop and cafe, football, cricket and bowls clubs, and a British Women's Institute group as well as other local clubs.

The Coton Footpath is a popular recreational cycle or walk from Cambridge to Coton. It begins in the city centre, crossing the River Cam, passing alongside the University's West Cambridge site south of Madingley Road, then crossing the M11 motorway, bypassing Coton Orchard and terminating at the village recreation ground. On the roads and gardens around Coton it is often possible to see Muntjac deer, descendants of escapees from Woburn Park in Bedfordshire.

As of 2005, the District Councillor is Robin Page.

Of course not! Placing a bid on an item on eBay constitutes a legally-binding - and law-enforceable - contract to buy that item. Why on Earth would I want with an amp - I don't have an electric guitar! I don't want to be the only bidder - because, then, I'd be forced to purchase it!



Just be patient! Maybe you have the price set too high.

You must not do that or ask anyone to do it for you.

It's called 'shill bidding' and can get you into deep trouble if you do.

If any of your watchers are genuinely interested in your amp, they will bid when they're ready (most bids come in the closing stages on an auction).

It could well be that your watchers are just that - watchers who have no intention of bidding, possibly because they have a similar item and want to get a guide on the selling price, they might just be nosey or they could already suspect you of shill bidding and are keeping an eye on your auctions.

If you’re a foodie, then you can’t go wrong with Chez Bruce. The French insprired cuisine is amazing and service is top notch. This is a Michelin star restaurant but without the hefty price tag you’d expect and none of the pretension that you would get at other top quality restaurants of the same calibre. The only downside is that it's located in Wandsworth so not of easy reach to everyone.

Reviews: http://trustedplaces.com/review/uk/londo...



Arbutus in Soho would be my second choice. Another Michelin star restaurant that's great value for money and the location is great.

Bristol is a lovely city with loads of open space. The Downs, Ashton Court, Snuff Mills, Blaise Castle Woods are all excellent dog walking areas and there are loads of other places too.

The local paper is the Bristol Evening Post http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/
And probably the first place to look for somewhwere to live.

You may find your budget is on the low side as rental prices are high.Try Bristol Evening Post online and look for the property rental section. Good areas are Clifton,Redland,Harbourside with waterfront properties, Westbury-On-Trym, Stoke Bishop, Henleaze,Southville. or look at nearby Portishead, Weston-Super-Mare or Cleavdon if you want a sea view.plus lots more. Buy a city map or look on line I think Bristol has a good website Good luck

Wear a short black skirt, white knickers & bra & unbutton a few blouse buttons. Keep leaning over & crossing & uncrossing your legs. Always smile & wink at the interviewer. If you get the chance, brush yourself against him `accidently'. Works for me all the time. Good luck.

Seriously

What to do:
dress smartly, look bright and attentive, and speak clearly and confidently. Don't forget that only 7% of the interviewer's opinion of you is formed by what you say - the rest is judged on how you look, act and sound 
find out where the venue is beforehand, how to get there and how long it takes 
get your outfit ready the night before 
find out what kind of interview it will be so you can prepare 
examine the person specification and your CV/application form, and think about what type of questions they will ask you 
prepare answers for the main questions - for example, why do you want the job, what are your strengths and weaknesses, what are the main tasks in this job 
make about three or four points in each answer 
quote real examples of when you've used certain skills - just saying you've got a skill isn't enough 
take your time when answering the questions. Make sure you understand the question and take your time if you need to think 
sell yourself. No-one else is going to! Be positive about yourself and your experiences 
prepare some questions to ask at the end - use it as an opportunity to find out more about the role and the company. But don't ask about money or perks just yet! 
when discussing salary, know your market worth and start by quoting a little higher than this 
get feedback on your performance, whether you were successful or not 
turn off your mobile! Treat the interviewers with respect and give them your undivided attention 
keep your answers focused on what you can do for the employer, not what they can do for you
What not to do:
don't be late! 
don't swear or use slang words 
don't slouch in your seat or do anything else that makes you look disinterested 
don't smoke 
don't lie! The interviewer may see through you. Even if you get the job, your employer can dismiss you if they find out 
don't let your nerves show too much. A few nerves are normal but extreme nerves will affect your performance. Use breathing techniques and try to remember that it's not a life and death situation - there are plenty of jobs out there! 
don't be arrogant and assume you've got the job. Nothing turns off employers more than someone who is disrespectful and over-confident 
don't discuss controversial topics such as religion, politics and gender relations 
don't read from notes or your CV. You should be familiar enough with your own history to be able to talk about it unprompted 
don't criticise former employers or colleagues. Interviewers may mark you down as a troublemaker and a gossip 
don't argue with the interviewer, no matter what. Remember to keep things positive!
These rules apply for most jobs. However, employers in some industries can use more relaxed and informal interviewing techniques. In some creative fields (design and media for example) it may be expected that you turn up for the interview in casual clothes, as that is the dress code in the office. If you're in any doubt, do some research on typical interview technique in your line of work.

Above all, preparation is the key to performing well in interviews. Research the role and organisation, and prepare evidence and examples of your skills and competencies.

Where can I get further advice and information?
You can get advice on how to prepare for interviews from learndirect careers coaches. They can help you to figure out what employers are looking for and help you to sell your experience. You can speak to a careers coach on 08080 100 333. Lines are open 8am to 10pm, seven days a week.

Not able to get to the phone right now? You can also email an adviser or request a call back at a time to suit you.

When the stringy stuff at the top of the corn kernal turns brown, gently undo the leaves protecting the kernal and poke one corn kernal with a knife, if clears fluid comes out then its ready to be picked. If not then put the leaves back in place and check a few days to a week later.

Where is a good place for a family of four to stay for a few days?



My wife and kids and I are going to the UK in two weeks.  We'll be spending most of our time in and around London (staying in Watford), but we want to visit Cambridge from the 15th through the 18th (or 19th) and need a place to stay.  Should we look for a hotel, a B&B, a flat, a hostel, what?

Cambridge is very popular with tourists. I suggest that you look up B&Bs and guest houses on these websites. Hotels tend to be very expensive for what they are, although the Gonville and the Regency are as reasonable as it gets. There is a Travel Lodge outside the City centre (beyond the railway bridge) and there are frequent busses in/out. If you’re in a car DO NOT take it into the city centre – the one way system is a nightmare and parking is ridiculously expensive.

depends whether you've got your own transport or not ... if you have a car I'd say look at the chains of motels/hotels such as Travelodge, Holiday Inn, etc because you can get family rooms for 2 adults and 2 children which can work out reasonable

if you are relying on public transport then you need a place that's convenient for rail stations and buses ... in that case maybe a B+B might be better ... for a flat or similar self-catering place during August (which is peak season) they're probably only going to rent by the week, not just for a few nights, although it's always worth checking it out

I think the internet is the cheapest place to buy videogames,
you can find a DS game for less than $10 on www.ebay.com

but a DS game would cost anywhere between $20 to $40 these days.
Yes,  you can get a jacket for $20 but it won't be the same as a $100 one.



$5 shoes are hard to come across unless you buy it online ofcourse,



and even when you do find $5 shoes they won't be what you expected xD

it will generally be cheaper in the US
for example, a DS game will be $25, whereas here it will be £25
for things like games you can save at least half the price 
you can also get cheap clothes, (designer) as again, whereas a jacket may be £20, it may be $25 in the US
im going to the US soon as well, so i wait till i go out to the US untill i buy things like clothes and games
hope i was helpful

All depends on what you want to buy all my sports gear and urban wear comes from the States when i visit family. The difference in prices is incredible and way cheaper than in London. The thing is when companies who import from the USA into the UK they have to pay certain duties and so up the prices to meet this.

it is generally cheaper. like games in usa cost $60 e.g. ps3 games or xbox 360 games. while in uk it cost £40. so in the UK it should cost £30 due to the equation however uk needs to pay taxes and stuff like that.

but if you do goto america. you should spend as much as you can so you can save yourself money.



and the pound is going strong aswell.

Many things are cheaper in the US, because that's a bigger market and also because they don't have to pay VAT. Bear in mind that if you're buying something in America and taking it to the UK, or having it sent to you in the UK, you might have to pay tax on it when it arrives- and that could make a big difference to the cost.

Yes, most clothes are much cheaper in the USA, especially if you go to a discount store or outlet mall.  Last time we were there, my wife bought some tops for $0.85 (50p) and I bought good designer label trousers for $4.99 (£2.50).  Forget the high end stores, you will pay over the odds.  But you will find plenty of bargains.

I work for a small drilling company in the uk



i leave for work in the morning and come home in the afternoon/evening. after some time i asked for a pay rise and as usual my boss said no. he thinks that paying a bonus for not taking sick leave is enough. so i decided to take a second job in the evening. i told my employer the next day and he was fine with it. now he's asking me to phone in sick on my second job so i can work away from home for a few days or can i use my holidays instead.im not going to phone in sick and i dont want to use my holidays just to please my employer and work away so what rights do i have

The Big mistake you done is to tell the first Employer that you got a second JOB....soon he will ask you to choose his Job or the new Job...and your chances are  if he really needs you if you choose the  first job possible he will give  you  a lot more money that you earning now...or after you make the choice just to make an example out of you  he will fire you....Check with the Labor Dept. to find out  what rights you have

My mum - who I haven't seen in ages! - is visiting me in London, and we're going out for dinner near Covent Garden.  I wanted to take her for pre-dinner drinks at the Savoy, but it's closed for refurbishment until 2009!!!  Can anyone suggest somewhere else we can go... I want it to be something special... preferably something infamous, or well-known...

Most of the bars in Covent Garden are aimed at the drink-til-you-drop crowd, so I think you're best off sticking to hotel bars.

You could try The Lobby Bar at the 1 Aldwych Hotel.

http://www.onealdwych.com/aldwych/home/o...

Or the Long Bar at the Sanderson:

http://www.sandersonlondon.com/sanderson...

Homage at the Waldorf Hilton would also be a good choice:

And the Light Bar at St Martins Lane Hotel is always a winner.

To be honest, the selection of restaurants in Newport is rubbish at best so I would stick to Cardiff if I were you. 
Personally I would reccomend Nandos to you which is in the Brewery Quarter as the food is filling (great for lining the stomach) reasonably priced (most things are under £10), the service is quick and there's a little something for everyone with salads, steak rolls, burgers, pittas etc. Plus! It's very central so you wont miss a bit of the atmosphere!
If you have to go to Newport and like Italian then Victorios is lovely by St Woolos cathedral.

Does anyone live in town where Greggs the bakers is open until the early hours?



My sister went for a night out in a Yorkshire town recently and said that Greggs the bakers was open until 3am to serve pasties to pub goers! Is this just a northern thing or does it happen everywhere but where I live? Not that I would indulge in baked goods after a night on the vodka but I like the idea!
Also, if you were to visit Gregg after a night out what would you buy?

I've never heard of this but I'd much rather have a pasty than a kebab. I know several late night shops that sell bakery products late at night but none of them is a dedicated bakery.

The UK has so many places of interest.  I could suggest loads but you honestly wouldn't have time to visit them all.  Best to take a look around the websites and see what takes your fancy.  It all depends on what you like, touristy places?  Quiet scenery?  Bustling cities?  We have it all.  Enjoy your visit.

EVERYWHERE!... I just got back from my 2nd trip there and it's amazing!... It honestly depends on what you want to be doing and seeing... if you want to shop... London no doubt or even Birmingham if you cant get to London. It also depends on how much time you have and money (my suggestion bring loads it goes fast). If you can visit Wales it's beautiful there but bring your umbrella. If you want to go all over the place then try Scotland as well I haven't been there quite yet but i heard it's gorgeous. Also, if you like theme parks at all try Alton Towers it's amazing! Other than that everywhere is pretty much a good spot to pick, you really can't go wrong in the UK if you don't get to everything on one trip it's always a thrill to go back again!... Almost forgot I heard the Isle of White is a good place to go and relax.

It depends what sort of tourism you are interested in. 
If you like history then all over the UK there are castles, churches old houses!  London of course has an immense amount of history and has great tour buses.  It also has the British Museum which is free and incredible!

Edinburgh is also really interesting for history.



If you like out doors things you want to go to the Lake District and walk the hills, or to Scotland and walk the munros, climb some amazing mountains and see beautiful views.



If you want a mixture of both, Scotland is still good.  You can easily get around and do outdoors things, but also be close enough to do city based things too.



For getting around cheaply .. www.megabus.com 
Very cheap, if you book in advance.

Hope this is a help

Well as you can see from my monica I'm a scouse!  I've never met any Americans so I wouldn't know if they like me or not. However I do know Liverpool is famous for a lot more than The Beatles! We have a fantastic history dating back to at least 1207 when King John founded the port of Liverpool. Maybe instead of asking inane and disrespectful questions on here you should do a little research. I would hardly class you as a "thinking" person.

Because Americans are not blinded by the near racist stereotyping which is so beloved by a certain section of British society which glorifies stupidity, watches Big Brother and thinks the sun news paper reflects all that is good in British society.

Its not only Americans who love Liverpool, the city is teaming with tourists from all over the world at the moment.



This idiocy only manifests itself in the UK.

It depends on the store and the time/date you choose to go. Once I went to an Argos in South London in Saturday afternoon and I was waiting -not exaggerating- for 75 minutes. But if you go on a week day and in less busy Argos stores you just show your paper, pay and go to the queue to pick it up. All in all about 10 minutes.

You can either go to the cashier and pay or you can go and pay at one of the pay-machines. In that case you won't have to get in the line for the cashiers.

Just pay at the machine (if you pay by card) and it will give you your receipt and then you just go to the pick-up point and wait for your number to be called. Waiting time could be anything from a minute to...apparently...75 minutes (yikes!)

The only thing that making a reservation does for you is to ensure that they actually have the item that you want in the store of your choice.

The rest of the process is exactly the same - you either go to a cashier - give them your reservation number - then pay and queue for collection OR you use the automatic machine - put in your reservation number and pay and then queue for collection.

basically reserving changes nothing in store you still do exactly the same as no reservation - except that your reservation guarantees the store has what you want - so depending on the day and the time you could queue for a few minutes or an hour.

This is not for a stag or hen do but 2 adults and 6 kids who want to spend a week in Blackpool but self catering near the centre if possible? Have looked through the most obvious websites but can't find anything

Hiya! Well this place I know of is situated near south pier, which is within walking distance of the promenade, beach and pleasure beach. Not to mention the piers! Is not directly in the centre but this is probably a good thing, will be less rowdy for the little ones while they try to sleep. You can jump on a tram or bus for a quid and it will take you to the centre in about 5 min. I highly reccomend it! (and its well priced )Hope you have a great time. I miss my home town so much!!

We want to be able to have a good time and have a laugh, we want to be able to make a bit of noise (not to much obviously) and not be pestered by the staff telling us to keep the noise down. We also want to be able to have some privacy, like a booth or something.



Please help me out A.S.A.P because I'm leaving for London tomorrow!! Remember! It's in the centre of London!

Go to www.toptable.com or www.lastminute.com and you can choose a restaurant in the area you want



I recommend Sugar Reef (Leicester Square) for the kind of night you would like.

Since you asked this question in the UK section, I have heard of the approx 120 mile corridor that crosses Great Britain from Hull in the East, to Liverpool in the West referred to as the "City of the North". Boosters believe that this heartland has the potential to became one of the great economic centers of Europe. In a similar manner, Dublin went  in a single generation from one of the poorest cities in Western Europe, to one of the richest cities in the world. 
----------------------------
Population figures:
Greater Manchester Urban Area - 2.24 million
West Yorkshire Urban Area - 1.50 million
----------------------------
Currently it is a 135 minute train trip from Manchester to London. A planned high speed rail would cut this trip to 85 minutes and make the city of Manchester more accessible to Paris and Brussels via good connections to high speed rail in London.

Why are garages in the UK so small?



Why is it that almost all of garages in the UK are too small to fit a family car? Its ok if you drive a Ford Ka or something of a similar size, but anything bigger than that (focus, vectra, etc) you are stuffed!
An extra half metre would make a big difference and would also provide a safe place to keep your car overnight as opposed to leaving in the street/driveway where its vunerable to vandalism/theft.

Whats the minimum size allowed for a garage (if there is such a spec)?
the building laws on garages need to be updated to reflect the cars we have today.



ERIC S:
Maybe if our garages were built to accomodate our expensive cars we would change our ways?
We would not keep so much crap, recycle more and keep our cars where they were supposed to be kept, in the garage. it does not take much effort to build something that is fit for purpose, then everyone is a winner!

You are supposed to push your car into the garage or get help to pull it out.It is called penny pinching,no room for anyone to get down the side of the vehicle or open a door once you are in the garage.You make a very valid point that only the English are stupid enough not to do anything about it.I would never dream of buying a house with one of those outhouses known as a garage in the UK.

I agree with Jed: It's "penny pinching".

The house my parents bought a few years ago (built in the late 80's so not that old) was fitted with doors, windows and plumbing - pipes and fittings - that were all of an odd non-standard size that were impossible to find replacements for even when they were fitted. The company that built the housing estate probably saved a couple of hundred pounds per house by using cast-off crap that would later cost the buyers thousands to put right.

Building a garage that's too narrow means extra pocket-money for the builders.

I looked at all your answers with interest, because at a guess 90% of our garages are filled with rubbish, what we will not have in the house.  Our valuable and expensive cars are usually kept outside.  I don't really know the logic of this, but being so, why have big garages if your not going to use them for the correct purpose?  Mines full of rubbish and the car

at the minute i would say no, it's not easy to find a job in britain at all due to the credit slump. but i'm sure our government would allow you to come over as you seem to work hard (unlike some of the others) However it all depends on the type of job you are looking to become employed in because i know a lot of British people are getting very resentful of the amount of people coming to this country and then just claiming benefits. However if you got your degree first i would assume you would have no problem because it shows you are willing to work hard. However London is very expensive to live so make sure you save up for a while first or have a job lined up before you come over. Good Luck

I sent postal orders from Ireland to pay for ebay goods in England and people have said they cannot cash them.  I thought the post offices would just convert to the exchange rate of the day and give the sterling over.  Anybody know if it can be cashed any other way?

They usually advertise their vacancies on their website, usually in early spring in advance of the opening for the summer season.
Or you could just look for a "contact us" link on the website, and ask!

EDIT - like I said, look for their contact details and just send an email, or a letter, or phone them ,and ask how they recruit!! It shows some initiative and if you send a CV too, they may keep your details on file and remember you when they are looking for staff.

What the heck has happened to the south of england?!?



I moved back to just south of London (near Croydon) a few months ago from abroad and keep hearing horror stories of stabbings and shootings and people beating each other up and getting bottled and mugged and hit in the faces with crow bars... is it really that bad? has it always been this bad and I just forgot? and why is it this bad? I'm scared and really feel like moving away again.

If you are worried about this then ask yourself the following questions.  If you answer yes to any of them then you are at risk:

Are you in a gang?
Do you live on a large council estate?
Do you take or deal drugs?
Do you carry a weapon yourself?
Do you wear a hood and baseball cap?
Do you hang around on the street with no purpose?

You will find that 99% of all these crimes are inflicted on people who would answer yes to most of the questions above.  For a normal adult going about their business and making sure they take taxis home at night you are absolutely fine.  I live in SE London (West Norwood) and have never had so much as an encounter because I'm sensible.  The majority of people round here are lovely and friendly and I like the leafy area and small village feel of the suburbs.

It's largely gang members shooting and stabbing other gun members, it's not terribly likely that you are in danger unless you live in a particularly rough area.
If you want to live somewhere that is totally safe you need to go and live on the moon or something. People have always been violent beings.

My understanding is that property crimes, and muggings and rape are soaring in London and Cardiff. I read one report that said those two cities are now the most violent in europe. Another statistic says that the crime rate in London is now 7 times the crime rate in NY.



Crime rates are plunging in the United States in many cities (particularly NYC). It's still very high in Detroit and St. Louis. However, murder rate, will always be higher in the US becasue of our entrenched culture of weapons.

Joe Bloggs is in "The Idiots" gang and he did something which "The Muppets" gang didn't like so The Muppets went and killed Joe Bloggs yet The Idiots didn't like it so they killed one of The Muppets and then The Stupids went and killed one of The Idiots and the cycle continues on and on.

Sadly it's something like 26 or 28 young people killed in London now and that's this year alone -- but that still adds up to 2 a month or at least 1 about every 15 days.

On one hand it's obviously not a good thing but then again on the other hand it is a good thing because if this continues then there won't be any more gangs around and so crimes (muggings, assaults, stabbings, etc, etc) might significantly reduce which could be a good thing.

Liverpool.

It's almost as large as Manchester the city (not to be confused with Greater Manchester which equals the size of Merseyside, not Liverpool)

It has a compact city centre which is easy to explore on foot, the new Liverpool One shopping area, Albert Dock and Cavern boutique shops.

It has a beautiful dock and waterfront area in the city centre, in fact the waterfront is a world heritage site.

It has quaint village suburbs such as Woolton, West Derby, Crosby and perhaps Southport which isn't too far away.

It has the only Tate modern art gallery outside of London, the most Georgian architecture and more green parkland than any other city outside the capital (the latter two a legacy of it's status as the British Empire's second city in the 19th Century)

And most importantly of all, it has it's simple-living jovial and quick-witted people who live for the moment and are fiercely proud of their city despite its oft-publicised shortcomings.

Finally, Manchester also has many good points (it is probably Britain's second city nowadays) and I've had happy years living in both cities so feel free to make your own decision. The previous poster criticised Liverpool unnecessarily based on opinion rather than fact so I write this to balance that opinion a little.

It's far larger

It's got a lot more shops

It has a wider range of shops

It has a nicer city centre

It has nicer suburbs

It is better connected to the rest of the country

It's more important



Put it like this; I'm Manc and I had the option of going to uni in either Liverpool or Birmingham. I chose Birmingham. I think that sums up my views on Liverpool

Why would we want to? Regional accents are a reflection of the origins and diversity of the different parts of the British Isles. The perception that Received English represents intelligence and authority on the part of the speaker died out about 50 years ago. Nowadays, speaking like Roger Moore is more likely to get you derided as a 'toff'. Perhaps the pendulum has swung a little too far the other way in this respect, but Britain would be a far duller and more boring place if everyone spoke with the same accent.

Hello,

The truth is that ebay is probably one of the easiest ways for anyone and everyone to start making good money online.

I have been exactly in your shoes.  I was struggling to find a legitimate way to make money online.

If you have been interested in or have been trying to make money online, then you probably know how frustrating it is.

You hear all these stories about people making six Figures and more a year online.  But every product you buy fails to really deliver.

I have shelled out lot's of money to lot's of different  get rich quick schemes.  And I can tell you this, NONE of them worked like they promised.  I was left feeling empty and hopeless inside.

Then I finally figured it out.  There is no magic button, you have to put at least a little amount of work into it.

I read an article about a woman who was making over $400 a day on ebay.  When the interviewer asked "What got you started on ebay."

She said that she visited a website that changed her life.  She said the name of the website was http://tinyurl.com/663tun .



It showed her a way to quitely make $100 to $400 a day from her kitchen table and her laptop.  And she said the best part is that she was able to start with No Money Down.

I have purchased the product due to reading this article.  And I have to say that I am impressed.

I have been working at it for a couple of months now, and I am not quite making $400 a day, but on my good days I do make upwards of $150 and more.  Not bad for only working a couple of hours a day :)

Hope you find what your searching after,
-John :)

This one works in the UK (not in the USA unfortunately) and can make you a lot of money quickly.

http://www.mayer-roulette-strategy.co.uk...

It relies on turning the small house edge in the online casinos to your favour.  I was very sceptical at first (as I am a natural cynic) but it does indeed seem to work.  I joined last week and have made £2890 so far!  It all seems to be above board and fully legal.

I am giving you a site that I have been using myself and works quite well. Requires no membership payment and pays out well.

I can't find a reference to the Inn of Courts in Birmingham UK, there are Grays Inn of Court in London and a few in Birmingham, Alabama.
I think that you may have more success with this question in the Politics & Government &gt; Law & Ethics category.
Try re-posting there, and mention which Birmingham you are asking about (UK, USA). You will get a better response.

Officially Cabot Circus opens on the 25th September.  It sounds like Harvey Nicks will open on the afternoon of the 24th September (2.30pm?) so people can look round.

Unfortunately as you are under 16 you cannot get a proper job, it's against the law. so do a paper round, clean cars, do pocket money jobs for friends, neighbours and relatives such as gardening, cleaning windows, shopping, dog walking etc.
Good luck and enjoy helping others.

What good nightclubs are in London?



I'm going to be 21 in October and was just wondering what good nightclubs I can go to. I will be with people who are under 21 so the club has to be 18+ instead of 21+ lol

I'm just looking to go somewhere special, a night to remember! In London it can be anywhere like Picadilly.. anywhere in or near central London.

Thanks :)

<answer>



There is too many clubs in that area abit more specific like what music you prefer? do you want a themed bar? Are you concerned about drink prices? are you concerned on dress code? Are you concerned on the clients in the club? etc etc

Most clubs are over 18 only.

I personally like sound and another good one I like is rain-forest cafe. However, its typically r'n'b music.



Fabric is pretty good too and it has three different music rooms

Please Recommend A Place In London To Have A Staff Christmas Party?



Here is the deal:  I have been put in charge of organising a christmas dinner for my team at work.  Altogether there are 18 people in my team and I am looking for a place to have a dinner/dinner party.  Because there are only 18 of us, I am not looking to book out an entire hotel but at the same time I want to organise something a bit more interesting than simply a table at a restaurant.  I was thinking to maybe book out a section in a bar or a club.

I am looking for a place in central london/city.

Please advise...websites more than welcome.

Looking for at home work to fit around my children (UK)?



Does anyone know any jobs that i can do (data entry, anything where i can sit at a computer for a couple of hours a day, sales etc) from home that will allow me to work around my children?  I have a 4yr old who is at school and little girl due in december and i really dont want to have to go back to work and leave her in nursery and him in before and after school care.  I am enjoying being a stay at home mum and want to be there for my children!  The problem is that we cant afford for me to stay at home so i need a way to make money from home.  I already do Avon but it doesnt make all that much money.  If anyone knows of anything i can do or can point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated!  Thanks in advance!

Why dont you think about going into childminding, it lets you stay home and gives ur children some playmates, you can pick and choose hours and the pay is good, contact your local council who will advise you on which steps to take towards getting registered, some councils even offer free training courses although i believe these are not compulsory, just satisfactory police checks and disclosure and a safe child friendly enviroment , goodluck .

good luck.. I've been looking for the past 2 years. Most everything you look into is a scam.. all I can tell you. is 
NEVER pay for anything that says you will make more than you contribute.
Do not sign up for anything that says you will get pain through a paypal account for many many many reasons.
Do not fall for online Educational courses that claim you will receive a job after finishing the course such as data entry or medical transcription.
And remember that most of the web sites people will give you that claim they have weeded out the scam sites and put together the best free surveys.. are all owned by the same marketing co. which it is in their best interest to focus your attention on all of the co. names they own.. not just the enthical, good ones.
Good Luck, I hope this helps you

Is there Insurance for where you are holding it ie: school or church hall.
This might sound daft but you need someone to man the toilets at all times. I've organised a lot of these and the kids get up to lots of things they shouldn't. Also you need someone on the door to watch they don't get out. You will need to give the parents some idea how much the food and drink will cost so the kids will have enough money with them. Make sure all parents know what time it will be finishing. 
Good Luck - its hard work.

Dear Lauren,



It's not a question so much about the heart of London as it is really small towns put together in one city. The neighbourhood best for you is one that is suited to your personality and budget. The centre of London is what is known as Zone 1 on the Transport for London Tube Map but many nice areas are in outer zones and easily assesible by train.Go to wikipedia and look up London and search different London Neighborhoods, particularly those in Zones 1 and 2 on the TFL map. I would go to www.gumtree.com to get a sense of prices for flats, afterward. We don't commonly do loft style flats here but there are many different sorts and prices.



Best

London is in the southeast corner of the United Kingdom, which is that wierd looking country to the east of USA across the Atlantic and up from France. We used to rule the world but haven't for about 100 years and have never really psychologically got over it (but you don't need to know about all that).

You don't say where you live, so I cant help with visas. If you are US then you can get a study or tourist visa but working will be tougher. It is possible to come here and work illegally, but you'll be ripped off and made to work like a slave by nastey folk who'll get illegal asians to do it cheaper anyway.



London is a good place to visit so come and make it work for you. Totaljobs.com or monster.co.uk are good websites for jobs if you are legal. your local mosque is a good place if you are not!! (harsh but true).

This can't be answered. I depends on the vehicle you're driving, the weight of the boat, and how you drive. Weather will also be a factor.

my car does about 330 miles to the tank and it costs £60 to fill the tank, so for me it would cost about £100 there and back.

Edinburgh, Scotland. Beautiful city and lots of history. Tickets to the city no more than £40 depending where you buy it from.

Don't go to Liverpool, yes they have history with the Beatles but the area is not good.

And also try out Devon, England, with the beautiful agriculture.

Overall London is the place to be.

Love the city.

Edinburgh, Scotland is the best weekend trip. Preferably two nights at a minimum. It takes about 4.5 hours to get there by train. Possibly the most beautiful city in the U.K.
-----------
Best day trip outside of London is Oxford City. Incredible place.
-----------
Day trips near Greater London are 
(1) the boat rides to Kew Gardens from Westminster Bridge. Don't take the boats to Hampton Court palace. You have to go through two locks and depending on the tide, the trips could take forever. This is actually inside Greater London, so if you don't have the time for the boat, you can get there by tube. World Heritage Site.
(2) Windsor Palace is just outside of Greater London. Nice town
(3) Stonehenge is a few hours. Probably best to take a bus.
(4) Greenwich and the Thames barriers. You can get there by docklands light rail.
---------------------------------
Flights from Stansted to Dublin airport are usually about 100 pounds round trip. The train is about 45 minutes from central London and the flight is 85 minutes. Book you train with your flight on ryan-air to save money. Sometime significant discounts are available.
---------------------------------
There are some excellent discount prices on day trips to Paris (about 2.5 hours each way on the Eurostar. You could end up with 12 hours to walk around the city. I would consider this a priority.
First train London to Paris is 5:25 to 8:50 am (time change)
Last train Paris to London is 9:13 to 10:34pm (time change)
A nonexchangeable- non flexible day trip is 72 euros. You must return that day. The same fare as r/t child of 4 to 11.

Make sure you come up north!  I'm originally from Cumbria and would recommend the Lake District.  Don't go to Windermere though if you can help it!  It's too touristy.  If you can get to Borrowdale go there.  Otherwise, as others have said, Edinburgh.  York is also quite nice.  Manchester, in my opinion, is a great city though.  Great Music Scene.  (I do live there so perhaps I'm talking out of my ****).  If you make it up to Manchester, go for a walk around the Northern Quarter where there are some interesting bars and pubs.  And get yourself down to Temple bar, Peveril of the Peak and Briton's Protection (all on one st. just off oxford road).  Pubs with great character all three.  Trust the Northerner to recommend the best places to get slashed!

Wage wise, I'd check out the minimum wage for your age.

Interview wise, expect stuff about customer service, sales experience, working under pressure, dealing with difficult customers, working accurately...

And what you'll be doing... prbably either operating a till, or getting stock from the stockroom, or passing the stock to the customer.

Hey buddies, I find something fishy here, isn't it high time the people responsible tell openly the exact reason for this takeover. Doesn't it seem funny to believe that in this period of sub-prime crisis a simple excuse of ambition to be the biggest mortgage company, is a reason sufficient for a takeover



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Quite so. However, with the holistic capital funds now taking an unexpected increase, we can see that the inital strategy infrastructure is flawed, given that potential growth assessment was, and indeed, still is based on secondary level gain analysis. 
With that said, overall downturn in the face of growth ambition is something of a paradox, not simply due to the seemingly unwise steps being taken, but also the limited options when entering deficit management programs.

I think "escort" is a euphemism.  Ford had a car by that name, but I think it was mainly an obscenity masquerading as a form of transport.  It is a dangerous world out there so for chrissake get yourself a big economy size box of condoms.

If you take the Westbound Central line from Stratford Station, change to the District line  at Mile End. (One stop).
The Westbound District Line takes you through to West Kensington.
The whole journey takes about 40 minutes and will cost £2.50 peak time on Oyster, or £2 off peak (after 9.30am and at weekends).

Pretty far. About 45 mins to an hour on the tube or more. Don't even bother with the bus for that distance - you'd have to go through the centre of everything and it would take ages.

About 30-40 mins on the Tube depending on which route you take. Central Line to Mile End, change to the District is the quickest.

Depends which bit of Kensington, there are a number of tube stops (High Street Kensington, South Kensington, Kensington Olympia) but would probably be about 35 minutes on the tube.

Transport for London has an excellent journey planner feature on their website, where you just type in your start and end points, and they tell you how long the journey should take, and what the quickest route is. journeyplanner.tfl.gov.uk

It's quite a long awkward journey.  I would suggest taking the Piccadilly line from Kensington to Kings Cross, the Victoria Line Northbound to Highbury and Islington then the overhead train to Stratford.  That will take more than 20 mins.  Your best bet is to call London Travel Information on 0207 222 1234

Any suggestions on where to go in manchester to cater for indie and chart music tastes?



I'm going for a night out and some of my friends are die hard indie fans and some are die hard pop fans.  Is there anywhere i can take them that will cater to both tastes?  Don't really wanna split the group if i can help it and don't want anyone to feel left out.

You couls start off at a few bars in the northern quater play indie music and really cool myusic then go to either 42's, 5th ave or the venue, all very similar and same price - 42's is probably th best out of them.  They play indie music old and new and the odd pop song - not too cheesy though- you can request songs!



There isnt anywhere really that plays a mix of the two for obvious reasons - both not like each other, unless u wanted to go printworks where they play chart and maybe one indie song but its full of pretencious clones id avoid that place from a mile off!



There are so many aamzing places in man literally just to a lot of bars then club!

For my 21st still deciding where to go but as birmingham is looking like a good option Im looking for any suggestions of clubs and bars. Nothing too expensive but nice that doesn't just play like r n b and dance etc but indi and party tunes as well. Don't really want to end up in a new city and not have a clue where to go. Its just the girlies having a night out as im going away with my family and boyfriend, so just want to make it a fun, happy and memorable night. Thanks

Broad street can be good if you are careful as there is a wide range of bars and clubs. TGI fridays is also good on the hagley road it is expensive but really fun and good atmosphere.

Yes, I think it will effect the election drastically, even though it shouldn't. I'm 100% Democrat, but I think it is unfair if people criticize Sarah Palin for her daughter's bad choice. Even Barrack Obama admitted that. I know it's an argument to say that Palin is for family values and her daughter lacks them, but just because her daughter has different beliefs, it doesn't change Sarah Palin's. Don't get me wrong, I hope to God Sarah Palin gets her butt whooped in the upcoming election, but I'm sure if Barrack Obama's daughter got pregnant and the Repubs did the same thing, we'd all be really ticked.

The jokes are made about Essex girls but I wouldn't bring two foreign men to Essex to have sex with English sluts if I were you.

The big Essex night club areas are also the places with the highest murder and assault rates. There's nothing the Essex racists would like more than to kick a foreigner to death for trying it on with one of their women.

Unless you want to try to defend your two friends from 30 drunk Essex boys who want to kill them I'd stay away and take them to Soho, that's where the prostitutes are.

This question made me laugh. I live outside of London (I come from  Canada) and I can tell you that girls in London are streetwise and "curious" is not something I would call them. You may have heard jokes about Essex girls or South London girls but in every city and town in England there will be the "slutty" types. Women are just different here, they dress more provocatively than their North American counterparts, but that doesn't make them slutty. People make that assumption all the time.
Just a fact for you: Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in all of Europe, but that can be blamed on the social welfare system more than the girls themselves (my opinion).

Hi Lizzy,
 The girl's here are no different to girls any where else, what I would say is that they sure know how to enjoy them selves and let there hair down. If your guys want some real fun I suggest you book them into digs in Southend On Sea not too far from London and a great place for them to find lush girls.
Have a enjoyable trip lizzy.

Does anyone know about buying flats? near manchester, england?



I am looking at buying a property and have come across some lovely flats, the problem is my fiance has been told that flats are notoriously hard to sell if you buy - we do not want to rent but only want to live in this flat for a year or two until I finish uni and get a nice house!  Does anyone know if my fiance's friend is right? Because he has really been put off the flat idea by this. x

The way the property market is heading, it is probably better if you do not buy just yet. If you're only going to live in it a year or two, you are spending a lot on mortgage fees and solicitors fees in order to buy it, only to do it all again in 12-24 months.



And what if by the time you want to sell property prices have gone down 10-20% like some people are predicting? If the value of the flat goes so low as to exceed what you owe on the mortgage, you will be trapped in 'negative equity'. This means you will be throwing mortgage payments into a black hole of pointless debt and you might find it impossible to move or refinance.

There are two risks associated with buying a flat. First, there's the fact there is a glut of them in Manchester - surplus always makes for poor demand. There would have to be something exceptional about your property so that it stands out from the hundreds of pokey, cheaply-built flats out there which don't have a balcony and suffer from nuisance noise, traffic fumes and lack of parking.



Next, it is difficult to add value to a flat in order to make a return on your investment or offset falls in property prices. Unlike a house, you can't build an extension, refurbish the loft, add a conservatory or tart up the garden. All you can do is decorate or install new fittings which is pointless to do since most flats in Manchester are only a few years old anyway.

In a falling market, you're better off renting. Or buying a solid house with fixer-up potential in a good neighbourhood. My 2p!



Source(s):



I bought half of my flat in Manchester 3 years ago through a shared ownership scheme, paying rent on the other half. That means I want prices to go down, so it would be cheaper for me to extend the mortgage and buy the other half.

Thanks for your help :D , you gave us a lot to consider there and  I think from this and the view of other people we will stay away from flats.  Thanks again! x

You can get the tube from Stratford (Central Line) to Tottenham Court Road and then the Northern line to East Finchley. Will take about 45 mins.

What is the currency of England?



Ok, so I'm thinking about visiting England in December. I was checking the price of a hotel in London and for some reason, it didn't give me the amount in dollars. It says 90 dollars (per night) with some weird squiggly sign. What does it mean? How much is 90 squiggly dollars in American dollars? Will they accept American money in Central London?

The correct term for British currency is "Pounds Sterling" - More recently bastardised to to GBP (Great Britain Pound).

The symbol is £ not a squiggly $. The symbols are very different from each other!

You should be able to exchange your Dollars at any "Bureau De Change" but logically, I'd bring either traveller's cheques, or get the Dollars exchanged before departure. It's a lot handier that way - especially if you need a taxi at 2.00 am on a Sunday!

If you want a great time mate, don't go to London, it's just an expensive sh1thole. If you go oop north a bit to the Midlands (Nottingham where Robin Hood used to live), you can at least double your spending power during your stay, we are much friendlier than bluddy boring sutherners, and we'll give you more bang for your buck! But, alas, you can only spend pounds sterling here. Our banks (if they still exist then) will give you a great exchange rate for your dollar though.

If you really are American, you may have independance but most towns and cities are named after British towns and cities, and so therefore in the present day and age you are travelling to the UK which use Sterling which is as someone already said Great British Pound which again is stronger than the Dollar. But no....no american monies generally accepted.

Squiggly dollars?! Are you serious?!?

Please, please. Don't make me go on a diatribe about why I wish my fellow Yanks would stay home and be quiet before displaying their stunning ignorance before all the world.

But I digress ... that so called squiggly dollar is the pound sterling (£). For the last few years £1=$2. So £90 would equal $45. And no, they will not accept US dollars in central London so you will need to get it changed into pounds. You can do this at a bank, bureau de change (which are at pretty much international airport), etc.

Seriously, the £ is the fourth most commonly used currency in the foreign market so it's good to know. You may also see this symbol € which is the price in euros.

I strongly suggest picking up a really good gudebook like Frommers or Dorling Kindersley (which you can find at the library if you don't want to spend the money) and reading up a bit so you don't look like an utter prat on the other side of the pond.

"some weird squiggly sign" ? Sigh. Yet another American ignoramus. You do your nation no favours.

Anyhow:



1. Of course it didn't give the price in US Dollars. Its a hotel that isn't in the US !!! Only the US uses US Dollars!! The currency in the UK is Sterling, and usually referred to as Pounds

2. The "squiggly sign" is this: £. It is called the pound sign. It works the same way that the $ sign does for Dollars.



3.The current exchange rate is approximately $2 to £1, but it changes daily by fractions of a cent. Any bank can give you the latest rate.

4. $90 is approximately £45.

5. No, they don't accept US dollars anywhere in the UK, with the exception of one or two extremely expensive hotels in London who are sometimes prepared to take payment in a major currency such as Japanese Yen from very rich clients.

That would be 'Pounds Sterling' with the symbol £. The best way to calculate the up-do-date exchange rate is to go to www.xe.com. Also, US$ is accepted in London and you will be able to exchange it on the spot at any Money Changer.

i suspect your 'weird squiggly sign' is the British pound sign. We use pounds sterling. There are 2 of your weird squiggly dollars to our weird squiggly pounds. Don't they teach you anything in American schools? 
You are highly unlikely to be able to use american dollars here - but we do have banks and bureaux de change where you can change your money! And electricity.

Rent some British films. "Snatch" or "Long Good Friday" are good for getting the accent. But remember that "British" is about 30 accents in a very small space. What accent do you want? Scottish? Welsh? Brummie? Scouse? Geordie? Cornish? Somerset? etc...

I reckon you are probably after a "London" accent. In which case watch the bbc news at www.bbc.co.uk/news and just mimic the newsreaders till it works.

Having read the answers ahead of this one, I think you are asking for an English  Public school accent. which is terribly contrived correct Oxford English.(some of the time),but one does need to start young and listen very carefully to ones pronunciation,you need to be terrible terribly ,not tewwibly tewwibly. And of course absolutely no americanisms the odd French word thrown in is OK and Italian but definitely no Spanish.

Kendra, there is no such thing as a British accent. There are many dialects and if you were to go to Scotland or Wales or Northern Ireland, for example, you would soon find out.

One dialect that seems to be in the ascendancy is called 'Estuary English'  Found around London and the South East (the Thames Estuary)

But why not just speak as you normally do?  I'm sure it is delightful !

Why do you want to mimic a 'British' accent (no such thing, by the way)?
If you are visiting the UK or spending time with any Britons it would be really rude if you tried to mimic an accent. It would not be seen as a compliment.

May I ask why you want to do that ? Unless you are an actress rehearsing a role, there is nothing more ridiculous than hearing someone trying to maintain speaking in an accent which is not their natural one.

<answer>



I have lived in both & would advise Manchester every time, at least they don't bleat on about the Beatles all the time & the scally girls don't think they are WAGS (as they all seem to in Liverpool) plus, if rumours are to be believed, there are no jobs in Liverpool anyway... sorry but it's Manc all the way, great city, metrolink, trains, football & great nightlife.... you'd love it.  For work try the agencies & best of luck guys...

Im moving to England form Houston, Texas, United States. Any suggestions?



I'm really scared. i don't want to leave all my firends and I don't think the British kids will like me. They will make fun of me for being different. Also I don't know anything about the place except for that's where "Hogwarts" is. I'm afraid I'll never get to do the things I do here ever again. Do they go swimming in England in the summer for example? Do they get off school in the summer? And I HATE tea, and I here thats what they drink. I am so nervous please give me advice. We are moving in November.

Y'all only get 6-8 weeks of summer!!! We get 11!!

And does anyone have private swimming pools like in their backyard?



i dont like mcdonalds actually. its gross.



Oh my gosh! You can get from one end to the other in one day! I had no idea it was that small. We have to stay overnight in a hotel just to get out of Texas! And then you have the rest of the country to go through! We've taken road trips with 10-14 hours a day drives for 3-5 days and have never even left the country!



****************************************...
We are moving to a house on Kingsmill (street, i think) in Bristol. Know anything about the area? Also, do you know if its one of those neighborhoods where all the houses look alike?



I just found out we are moving to a place called Stoke Bishop which i think is a small town in Bristol

You are so unlucky
I live in the UK the ''ghetto'' side as you may call it.
I am 16 years of age and now going to college.

There is no summer there is no sun we do not believe in summer.
It is a real stereotype saying we all drink tea i don't drink tea screw that crap.

Best thing is loose the accent don't act to cocky, do not show off at all worse thing to do.
Do not trust NO ONE in school keep them all at 80% Trust because they will back stab you before you know it.

There first impressions will be look at this foreigner coming into our country little punk lets all rush.

Best thing to do is don't be a smarty pants don't be cocky and be very friendly and you will fit in.

Trust me these are words of sweet advice and do not get corrupted do not let English people change who you are rember where you come from and do not change yourself to please boys/girls.
Only people you should give 100% trust is your family.

Are you insane?  England is just another country, you can do whatever you want and drink whatever you want, as far as people liking you, well there was this american kid in my high school, he did get bullied quite a bit and that's saying something as it was a goody goody school with high grades.  Do yourself a favour, avoid London as it it costs too much to start living there nowadays and avoid Manchester (where I live) as it's boring.

Hi. Your question made me laugh, you are so cute!!



Ok.. lots to discuss...

Swimming in the summer: Unfortunately, England is no where near as hot as Texas. So if you think you'll get to spend all summer soaking up the rays on the beach, you won't. During the summer, we have a few good days, and these days every one makes the most of. 
But yo can swim all year round if you want! It isn't arctic cold or anything like that, and theres always swimming pools!

School: Yes, usually schools end at the end of June, and start at the beginning of September. So you'll get 2 full months off for the summer. Most people here go on holidays in the summer, most commonly to Spain, France,somewhere like that, becasue it isn't too far away. For school children like you, most would possibly get a summer job until school starts again.



Tea: Tea is a very traditional drink in the UK. Many people drink it, but many do not. Me for example, I HATE it. Can't remember the last time I had a cup. So don't worry, no one will force you to drink tea or anything else you don't like. We many of the drinks you have in America.

British kids not liking you: Don't worry about this either. The majority of British kids will be super excited to hear that an American girl is coming to live near them! I think the American accent is amazing like most of us here. They'll alll love you!!



I hope you have a fantastic time here =]

It's sad you don't know the exact name of the place your moving to.  My family and I live in England and I remember that the first time we went to Texas all we kept saying was: Isn't that big, isn't this big, everything is so big.  When you get here you'll be saying:  Isn't that small, isn't this small, everything is so small.



But the good thing is you can get from one end of the UK to the other in under a day.

Email me if you like and let me know where your moving to and I will gladly let you know all about it.

I lived in England for 1 year when I was 16.  It was different, but not in the ways you are worried about.  Their school schedule is different than ours.  They get time off every few months, but don't have as long of a summer break.  Just like we get spring break, they do.  But, in October, they get time off too.  It was actually pretty cool.  And summer isn't shortened that much.  I lived just south of London in Redhill.  It snowed a couple of inches in the winter and was in the 80s in the summer.  All the kids in my school loved my accent and wanted to hear me talk all the time.  It was actually really neat.  I made some great friends.  They have some different slang words than we do and it can be confusing sometimes, but you just have to ask.  They will ask you what you mean when they don't understand your slang too, so don't worry about it.  And don't let all these people fool you.  They have just as many stereotypes about us as we do them.  And they will ask you about them all the time.
Somethings that are different than here is that people walk so much more there.  Although I suppose that depends on if you live in a city or in the country side.  They have a great transportation system and it will take you from one end of the country to the other.  So, you will get used to riding the train.  They drive on the other side of the road and the cars look really funny until you get used to it.
Another thing that is different is that where I lived the houses were much smaller than I was used to.  I don't live in huge house, but you will understand what I mean.  The average home size is much smaller than ours.  The same goes for the back yard.  I don't remember anyone having a pool in their back yard or even having a yard big enough for a pool.  They call the back yard the garden by the way.  Where I lived there were lots of town houses where the houses are connected.  Again, I'm not familiar with your area, so I don't know what it will be like there.
I loved living there and wouldn't trade that experience for anything.  It is hard to be away from your friends, but you will have so much fun.

Hey, I'm from Houston too and I move to England withing the next month!
What a coincidence.  You should just be who you are.  Sure you will have a different accent and use different words but most people will like that because you are a bit different.  I'm moving to Harrogate farther North and I'm really excited to go.

By the way, I hate tea also and everyone serves me Iced Tea in Texas.



British culture is not that much different than our own in comparison to other countries around the world.

Kids in England don't drink tea.  They drink coke and fanta and stuff.  Things you may lose are: Oreo's, sunshine, space.  Don't see many Oreo's over here I'm afraid (but try chocolate hobnobs...they're amazing dipped in...well you don't like tea, sorry).  That's the thing though.  Start getting used to dipping confectionary in hot drinks.  It's something we do a lot of.  Sunshine is something we don't get a lot of.  But there's more in Bristol than up north.  It's cold and wet I'm afraid.  But we'll probably moan about it more than you do.  Also, house prices in England are ridiculously high.  So you will probably be living in a much smaller house than your used to and it might be terraced (connected to other houses on either side).  We don't tend to have pools outside.  It's too cold and just too expensive!
The good things you'll find is that wherever you are, you're always near the sea.  In Bristol you are near Cornwall where you can go surfing!  You'll probably need to start understanding the fundamentals of football (soccer...never call it this!  It's football now ok?!) as this is all anyone ever talks about.  And you'll have to get ready for some harshness.  People probably won't pick on you but compared to the Americans, we're not very polite.



Coming from Texas (bible belt I believe?) you will notice that religion takes much less of a stand in England.  We are a secular country and ideas of God do not come up in politics unless we're talking about religious clashes between different cultures.  Generally we are Christian - Church of England or Catholic, but most of us are atheist or agnostic.



I understand (but only through watching Rikki Lake...) that Americans dress a little differently too.  English girls are known slags!  We were too little clothing whatever the weather.  The age of consent (when you can legally have sex) here is 16 and the drinking, smoking and voting age is 18.  So you can do things earlier.  Apart from driving.  The age for that is 17.  But most people do ALL of these things earlier!



A few tips concerning slang.
Fanny = Vagina, not ***
Jelly = jello
Jam = jelly
Pavement = sidewalk
slag = ****
scallie or chav = "white trash" I suppose.  Often violent people who wear loads of sportswear and spit on the ground!  haha!

Have fun in England!

You should DEFINITELY visit London. I honestly love it there. It is very multi-cultural, which is my favourite thing. There are so so many things to do. So hopefully you know people there. If not, just ask. Everyone is pretty friendly. 
Must Sees:
-Big Ben
-London Eye
-Piccadilly Circus
-Buckingham Palace 
-Tower of London
-Thames River

Things to eat:
-bread and butter
-bread and butter

I hope you go and have fun.
Hope i've helped.

london is like new york in the sense that everyone is always rushing everywhere
everyone beeps each other in the car
and everyone is stressed lol 
but now the good part
go on the london eye ! you won't regret it you can see the whole of london through it !
museums are a must, most are free
tube is the essential to get around - so cheap and a lot more people use it in the uk than they do in nyc.
bring an umbrella lol - just in case !
good places to stay are radisson - ive stayed there and it was gorgeous oh and the strand

visit london by all means but for a day or two, see the sights then make your way to Liverpool capital of culture. Hotels are much more inexpensive than London, eating and drinking out also. Then travel further up north and see beautiful Scotland. I know i will get a lot of thumbs down for this answer. but London? only been there twice. got my car sat nav robbed and this was in under ground hotel car park on Oxford street and nearly had a pickpocket, only my husband spotted her.

Why do so many people dislike Manchester?



The last days I've been thinking about studying in Manchester,
but today I've been reading around on the internet quite a lot
and everything I read is negative. People getting beaten because they have a southern accent, people saying unfriendly things for no reason and so on... I'd really like to study English there but I'm not so sure anymore after reading all negative things. It's hard for me to believe that it really is as bad as it sounds though... But who knows, I might get beaten up for being a foreigner.



</question>



<additional details>



"But who knows, I might get beaten up for being a foreigner."
It's hard for me to imagine that happening actually but I'm.. just.. slightly frustrated cause I really wanted, and want, to live there for 6 months.



I'm NOT studying at the University of Manchester, but close by.

Manchester is a great city as long as you don't stray into the wrong areas.



The areas around the Uni are fine and Manchester Uni is one of the uni's with most overseas students, so it has quite a big mix of different people.

as long as you stick to the city centre and don't end up in places like Moss side you will be fine. Just stay away from all the residential areas populated by angry mancs

Lots of people dislike it because it's a big city, and all big cities have crime and problems. It's a fact of life.

People in Brum seem to be under the impression that Birmingham is more important than Manchester, so they have a negative attitude to it anyway.

In my eyes, Manchester is a fantastic city; definitely far better than Birmingham. And I've lived in Birmingham for the last years, having spent the 20 years before that in Manchester... in fact I'm in Manchester now.

There's a huge student population, and there's always something happening. The transport system is effective and thorough (don't get me started on the congestion charge though...) and fairly cheap.

Housing is far cheaper than in London, yet many companies have their second office located in Manc. BBC Manchester, for example and the Guardian (founded in Manchester).

Lots of students are imports- they don't get 'beaten up for being a foreigner' unless they do that incredibly irritating thing where they try to pretend they've reverted to a Manc accent within the first week of living in the city... basically they say t' instead of the and think that qualifies as Northern...

Sunday Trading Laws : Why don't Tesco's 'stagger' their Sunday Opening hours?



We have 3 Tesco's within three miles here. 
Why can't they stagger their Sunday Trading hours so as to get 'round the idiotic Sunday Trading Law restrictions?

One could open at 9 a.m., one at 1p.m, and one at 4 p.m (say).Then we could shop when WE wanted instead of when Big Brother says....

because Sunday trading laws state that large shops can only open for 6 hours between 10am and 6pm (i.e a continuous 6 hour period from either 10am, 11am or 12noon) unless they are exempt.

Thank you. I favour all 3 Tesco's near us opening at staggered times, to serve is (the customer) better.
Then we could shop 10 till 4, 11 till 5., or 12 till 6 pm at our choice.



Better still, why not have another Tesco just UNDER the size restriction limit, open 24 hours like the main one weekdays

Restrictions on opening times on Sundays are now, under the Sunday Trading Act 1994, confined to large shops (defined under the Act as those having an internal sales area of over 280 square metres), which may open for six hours between 10 am and 6 pm.

It depends on what sort of work you are want to do . More specifically what work you are experienced in.
Here's a link to a number of agencies in Birmingham
http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&um=1...
Have a look at the websites and pick an agency that recruits for whatever you want to do and give them a call or go and see them.

Contact the head office of any employer in whom you have an interest and inquire if they have vacancies in that location. If you can produce the name of a company, then any directory inquiries line (eg, BT 118500) will assist you in contacting their head office or regional one. You could also try putting company names into your search bar. For hotel work - and Brighton has numerous hotels all along the seafront - just make a trip to Brighton and inquire at their reception desks: this shows that your level of interest extends to getting off your **** and getting out there. Good Luck! x

HR9 as a postcode refers to Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, not Bristol.

The only Clayton Row in the UK is in Langho, Blackburn.

Have you any more details about the address.

Please Recommend A Place In London To Have A Staff Christmas Party?



Here is the deal: I have been put in charge of organising a christmas dinner for my team at work. Altogether there are 18 people in my team and I am looking for a place to have a dinner/dinner party. Because there are only 18 of us, I am not looking to book out an entire hotel but at the same time I want to organise something a bit more interesting than simply a table at a restaurant. I was thinking to maybe book out a section in a bar or a club.

I am looking for a place in central london/city.

Please advise...websites more than welcome.

Thanks

I lived in London for 7 years (I'm from the USA).  I think the answer to your question depends on what you want out of life.

London is big and exciting; there are great museums, theater, concerts and restaurants.  There is always something new to do and discover.

On the other hand, London is also very expensive, especially housing costs and going out.  The weather is not great, though the summers can be nice.

Another thing to consider is the people - I found Londoners very cultured, intelligent and they generally had a decent sense of humor.  On the other hand, they tend to be reserved (by American standards) so it can be hard to make friends - I think people tend to socialize mostly with their work colleagues or people they met in school (huge generalization there).

Hope that helps.

How resilient do people think the London property market will be?



Prices have definitely come down but I wonder how low they can go, given the supply & demand, the fact that so many uber-rich people, non-doms etc are all in this market inflating prices... do people think London will keep declining or is the impact expected to be limited?

Just wondering what people's opinions are really.

Trying to figure out when a good time to buy would be- the minute the market starts to recover I would be priced out again.

Do you think the police do a good job?



is there any justice i think not, can you just tell me if its me but it seems they are there enough police when im doing no wrong to check up for silly things, but when a real criminal hurts my family they don't appear for days and then they do nothing, the reason why ive put this question in manchester is because this is my home town and i know the authority's are different in other regions or maybe they are not i am interested if your views are the same as mine, i have been brought up to respect the police and have always taught my kids to find the police if they are in danger or lost but recently i find most of the police in my region are bully's on a power trip

I would say both yes and no, I do think that they waste a lot of time on small things though.
I was recently threatened by my ex this was not an emergency, I wanted to report it so then it was on record in case of a follow through or future threats, they would not take a statement at the station, but a police man was round mine within an hour.
Yet when my ex assaulted his daughter it took them 2 days to come for a statement!!!!
They spend too much time speed checking, and pulling for 1 brake light not working, rather than catching those doing the more serious crimes.
I live in greater manchester so not efficient here either.

I live in Manchester too , and I agree with you in some parts but when I really need them on sunday when my son went missing they were fantastic with me and my family and I couldn't fault them in the way they dealt with the search for him. He has autism and is only 10 and they were at my house within minutes of me phoning 999 , in fact I was still on the phone to the operator when the first officer turned up. Most of GMP were searching for him on sunday.
 You will get the odd bad one but the majority are good officers . I honestly couldn't deal with what they have to do every day.

They do what the Home Office tells them to do. Which is why you'll always find them criminalising ordinary people rather than catching criminals. Anyway, that's easier.

In general, the type of ppl who go into the police force are one step up from club bouncers. Yes they are on a power trip. They ain't that intelligent - they're just following orders. Ultimately they deserve no respect.

I totally agree.

I'm in the Greater Manchester area and find that our police service is absolute crap! I have been a victim of crime over a number of years in the past when the police failed to turn up or turned up and said "make it quick, i've got to go somewhere else" one said "it might be easier to get back with him" after I'd had death threats and all kinds of going on and was so stressed I was barely surviving. Some were just like thugs in uniforms. They're absolutely disgusting.

If you have a complaint please put it in writing and someone will visit you and give you a choice of how to pursue it, whether you go for a telling off, disciplinary or dismissal.

If issues to do with the crime are still affecting you as you say you could seek help from Victim Support and talk to someone there or a Sexual Assault Victim Support (SAVS) place. Even if you weren't sexually assaulted it may help to understand your own feelings about what happened to your daughter and also the physical attack on you. Victim Support can help in contacting the police on your behalf or accompanying you and making sure you get to talk to somebody who is properly trained to deal with sexual assault. Silly or uncaring remarks from police officers can add to your ill feeling and sense of loss. Most of them are not really trained to work with victims of crime.

Some women's refuges run courses in confidence building and stuff too or can offer emotional support and counselling. You don't have to be staying in one or suffering abuse now to get to talk to someone.

its strange how everyone has a go at the police, does everyone have a go at you and the jobs you do! do people actually think that the bobby on the beat hears the call on the radio that someone is in trouble and they decide to say 'em can't go to that as i really need to do someone for having no lights on their bike??' didn't think so!



Many people in their lives don;t have much involvement with the polcie in their lives and if they do its usually because or speeding, no seatbelt etc. BUt if you were that officer that had to attend the scene of fatal RTC bacause the driver didn't have their seatbelt on the believe me there are going to be initiatives with the polcie to target people with no seatbelts.  Just like there are things going on while you are tucked up in bed with the police targetting criminials for more serious offence.  Unfortunately the police do not have crystal balls and can not predict where the next offence is going to happen as criminals these days do not normally go out of their way to carry out crime in front of the police, yet motorists do on a daily basis.  If people just wore their seat belts or didn't use their mobiles when driving then the polcie wouldn't have to deal with it!

They do a good job and yes some are bullys but thats life and will happen in every job.

If everyone finds it so easy to comment on how to solve crime then join the polcie yourself and you would realise its not as easy as you think!

The police in Manchester are superb. I was on duty, in a hospital, on the day the IRA blew up the centre of Manchester and I was on full emergency alert ready to receive child casualties. The only reason there were no fatalities on that day was because of the absolutely heroic police evacuation of the area. I feel particularly strongly about this because my wife and three young children were in Manchester on that day and it was three hours before I knew they were safe. After that, I can forgive the police almost anything, except the behaviour of some of them during the Miner's strike.
Regarding people being fined for riding their bikes without lights and not wearing seatbelts AND speeding, I have spent my whole working life helping to patch up kids involved in road accidents. I only got to see the survivors, not the ones who had to be scraped off the road by the police and paramedics. Please just think before you ask critical questions about an organisation where the vast majority of officers are trying their best to do a very difficult job.

IS ESOURCES.CO.UK RELIABLE/?



Hi, I've had some dodgy dealings with Chinese Drop shippers on Alibaba. So I've come to realise there is a lot of opportunity for scam artists with drop shipping and I'm never using Chinese drop shippers again as I've come to realise most the stuff is fake.

I'd like to know if anyone has had any experience good or bad with esources.co.uk?

I've tried to find some dirty on the company but not really found anything bad.

This leads me to believe they are in fact reliable.

Another thing: is the profit margins any good on the articles purchased?

Thanks in advance

I am afraid you are being scammed, there is no job offer with Shell and I bet that they want you to send them some money to cover your work permit/visa/flight ticket...I also bet that the telephone number they gave you starts +44 70

In Yahoo Answers people regularly ask about these type of jobs that are offered through received emails, and all of them are being scammed, it's known as an advance fee scam.

Oh; its a laugh a minute dodging the bullets, avoiding the muggers, dashing into shabby overpriced shops to avoid the rain. Be careful not to trip on the rubbish strewn streets because you'll end up in one of the even dirtier hospitals. The cleanest thing is the MRSA virus.

Manchester is a dump and getting worse. I used to live in Didsbury 15 years ago and it had a charming village feel to it. I go back regularly and I am always amazed at how dirty it is. Choked with traffic, more bars than shops. Overpriced hovels that you cannot sell.

The city centre is no better. It is rundown and grubby. If Manchester city centre is so good for shopping, why did they build the Trafford Centre?

I've got to go back in November and I dread it. The last 5 miles of my journey into Manchester take as long as the 120 miles it takes to drive there and now I have to pay a congestion charge. Con being the operative word.

a "gift character"?  Doesn't make sense.  If it is a "character gift" I guess it would be based off of your character.  In other words if you are the rich heiress you could bring a nice bottle of wine or some fake bling.  If you are the school girl you could bring a dictionary or book bag???

As the UK people are not willing to tell you where to go in London, I a S'porean will tell you to go to the places of interest by tourists. I have been there 3 times from 1981, 88 & 99 and maximum stay was 1.5mth.  Where are you from?  To london for tour, study or visit.



As a 1st timer, take the City tour on an open-top double-deck London Bus to see all the important places to visit on your own time.  The travel up the river Thames by ferry to GMT village to see the Zero time point.  Cover the Oxford Street for window shopping, the Hyde Park on Sunday morning, the Sunday Market and visit the Kensington Palace within the Park.  Also must cover the museums, there are many to be covered, the Stadiums and the palace.



If there is time visit the castles: Warwick & Leeds, the Shakespeare's Village and the Lake District in Scotland.



Quick a pick for you.

<answer>



Working on Sunday in Lakenheath, Suffolk - but just over the border the weather was pretty awful - rain from first thing in the morning until about two in the afternoon.



It really depends on what you were planning on going to Duxford for.  I wasn't aware of any airshow.  Nice pubs and restaurants around there - and you wouldn't have been affected by any rain!



Looking for planes?  Try the Rod and Gun Club at Lakenheath - lots of F15's of the base - but usually you would need to be there during the week and not the weekend.

At which King's Cross do you live?



Assuming it is the one in London, go to Euston Station,  jump on a train to Liverpool Lime Street where you can change to the Wirral Line of Merseyrail and travel direct to any of the many stations in Birkenhead.  Birkenhead used to have direct trains to and from London but the track was torn up and Woodside Station demolished years ago.



It is true that it would be cheaper to walk, hitchhike, take the coach, etc., but it is so (unusually) easy and quick by train by today's standards you'd have to be a real miser to consider these other options as they are so slow and inconvenient.

National Express. I do not think they now take the route through Birkenhead but from the National Express Terminal, Lime Street station and the Merseyrail  Underground route is about five minutes walk away.



I would advise that you contact Merseytravel on the internet and find out about bus and train day passes and longer ones depending on how long you are staying

The schools you are applying to will have accommodation offices. Give them a call and ask what areas are popular with students looking for cheap rents. London is huge and what may be a handy area for one university will be poorly placed for another. Finding affordable accommodation in London can be a real headache, which is why these offices exist. Once you have a place at the uni the accommodation office will be able to connect you to like-minded students who are looking for similar places.

There is no single post code for London. Postcodes in the UK are very specific - a postie can usually identify a street or place of interest on the basis of a postcode.



For example Buckingham Palace has its own postcode - SW1A 1AA



"SW" stands for South West London. the rest of the numbers and letters identify. area, street etc.



So you need to know the address that you are looking for the postcode for. Once you had the address, you can use the Royal Mail Postcode finder to get the postcode:

<answer>



The UK post code is a string of characters added to the address of every building in the country which are unique to that building or that block of buildings/ part of a street.



If it is written correctly on each letter it allows the mail companies to use a computer to read the code and then sort the mail to speed it on it's way to the correct destination.



Therefore it follows that in the UK there are thousands and thousands of different postcode and if you want a specific one you need to tell us a specific address - London will have 10's of thousands of post codes.



It is also used by many other companies in the UK to determine specific areas - for instance car insurance companies use the post code to determine the risk in the area you live and amend the payment accordingly.



Also delivery companies use it with a computer to work out the best route for the delivery truck to avoid covering the same roads twice.

Pet friendly short weekend breaks in Devon or Cornwall?



Hi, i am desperately looking to book a short weekend break (friday night, saturday night, leave sunday) over the next 3 to 4 weeks for me, my fiancee, 6mth old baby boy and a dog or 2!!



Can anyone recommend any good self catering places that are dog friendly, preferably near dog friendly beaches etc, as my fiancee is totally knackered looking after our little gem of a boy and i would like to treat her to a short break (on a budget).



Thanks

There are lots of cottages that are self catering in Devon and Cornwall that are pet friendly.  We recently went to Jackna Park in Polperro and took three children and two dogs!  It had a lovely garden and the animals are more welcome than people - a really friendly place where you pets can also go into pubs and restaurant's with you!  There isn't much of a beach there,but there are some lovely walks over the hills overlooking the sea and it is a really cosy place for a family with pets to go - a refreshing break for your wife and great for the children and dogs alike.



Just put in your search engine www.holidaycottagespolperro.co.uk and type in Jackna Park.



I also think they do other dog friendy accommodation and probably have other offices in Devon if you were interested.



Have a wonderful time - you will never want to leave!

I've booked with Holiday Lettings before - went to a really cute cottage in Wales, which was pet friendly to a tee.



Not sure which beaches are dog friendly in Cornwall/Devon - but if you ask the owner of the property you enquire about they should be happy to help you out with that one.



Hope you find somewhere and have a relaxing break!

Depends what kind of party you want. Food or no food and what type of music you like etc. Almost every pub in Glasgow offers free party bookings. Just have a look next time you are in town, and enquire in any you like the look of. Hope you find somewhere suitable and have a great party!

Caterham isn't bad.  It is on the end of one train line, so you always get a seat in the mornings.
Still not what you'd call cheap, though.  But you have to go a long way, like Bicester, before you get a noticeable reduction in costs.

#1 East Grinstead in West Sussex (East Sussex - when I was born !) ! Beautiful Place to live & it is so clean ! East Court Mansion - East Grinstead Town Council Offices - & the grounds surrounded it were bequeathed to the people of the town in 1936 ! 20 minutes drive by car to Ashdown Forest & 'Winnie the Pooh' Country & Ashdown Forest ! 10 miles (North) to Junction 6 of the M25 & 7 miles (West) to the M23 ! 20 miles to Croydon by car / train ! 30 miles to Brighton or Eastbourne on the East Sussex Coast by car ! 10 miles (East) to Crawley & 15 miles (West) to Royal Tunbridge Wells by car ! 30 Miles to Central London by car / train ! It takes 1 hour to get to London Bridge or Victoria Railway Stations on the Southern Railway Network from East Grinstead Railway Station ! East Grinstead is my hometown & I lived there for the first 38 years of my life !

Depends what you mean by outside London. Surrey is very nice in places (e.g. Esher, Weybridge, Guildford) but also very expensive. You tend to pay more for places in towns with fast rail links to London.
For example Brighton is an hour by train but pricey nowadays. Hasings is a similar distance but cheaper as the train is almost 2 hrs.
Whatever you do, avoid Milton Keynes.

In the 60's and early 70's they built large ghetto type housing estates known as housing "schemes".

Pet friendly hotels in liverpool?



Hi there,



Me and the other half are going to the oasis concert in Liverpool 08/10/08 at the Echo Arena. I don't want to leave the dog on her own all night (we prob won't get home til gone 02:00 and that's just not fair) so we thought the best thing to do would be to take the dog and stay over night... every time i type in 'pet friendly hotels in liverpool' in google every time (which is so annoying) it comes up with the adelphi - which is NOT pet friendly !!!! does any one know of any pet friendly B&B's or hotels ? thanks in advance x

Try Hotels.com and go to More Amentities, then choose Pets Allowed and search.  Always helps for me.  Or, if there is a Motel 6 or a LaQuinta, those are always pet friendly.  Also, be sure to ask if there is a pet deposit, sometimes it is $25!

Is Scotland STILL a separate country from England?



I know Scotland and England had separate monarchs until 1603.



And that Scotland, England and Wales were united in 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain.



Then the Irish voted to join the Union in 1801 -  then the Kingdom of Great Britain became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.



But then most of S.Ireland chose independence in 1922 and became what is now the republic of ireland, leaving the uk as the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland.



so my question is;



is scotland still a seperate country even though it is part of great britain and the united knigdom?



or are england and scotland the same country (great britain) ?



please do not answer if you are not 100% sure. people think they know a lot about this but usually they are wrong. also if you have the facts to back it up please post a link to the page - people directing me to wikipedia is useless to me (wikipedia can be edited by people not necessarily fully educated on specific subject).



if you are a historian or have studied this subject i would greatly appreciate your answer.

What do you mean do not answer the question unless you are sure I do not need wikipedia to tell me that I am an English man living in ENGLAND which is part of the United Kingdom.



I doubt very much that someone from Scotland, Wales or Ireland need it to tell them either.



So yes I am a 100% sure we are seperate countries who all belong to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

I can't think of anywhere romantic in England.



But some suggestions:



The isle of Mull in Scotland is really beautiful. Stay in Tobamory, and explore the mountains and Lochs around the town. It's beautiful.



You could always opt for London. It's a far more romantic city than people give it credit. Stay in a nice hotel, and go to some romantic restaurants.



Gower in Wales is really romantic. The Gower peninsular is just south of Swansea. Find a quiet B&B, and spend a week-end there. Visit the world-class beaches, and just walk along them for hours. It's always quiet there this time of year.



Centre parks seems a bit tacky to me, but some people find them romantic. I just think they're a bit too crowded to be romantic.

For a special anniversary we went to "The Lobster Pot" in Mousehole, near Penzance.  A very, very old Inn jutting right over the tiny harbour.
Told them about our event and they put us in a room over the harbour and our table for meals in the dining room was similarly situated.
They did a fabulous Lobster Thermidor, one of my favourites.
Your friends could do a trip over to the Isles Of Scilly, visit St. Ives which has 3 lovely beaches.
If they are going at this time of the year, then Cornwall probably has higher temperatures than the rest of the Country, and the Isles of Scilly are usually very mild.

there's a problem with Americans, and how they think British people have bad teeth. It came that way because the calming afternoon tea, in the Elizabethan times, or whenever, caused horrible teeth. Just cuz they had no tooth brushes to cure the horrible teeth, it became common that the British had bad teeth. America has misunderstood. England has blossomed for more then a millennium. America is the country who just 300 years ago became their own country. Face it, America had food, shelter and all that, when England ruled it. But when America broke free, France and a little bit of Spain, had to help them out. Americans are pretty much anti-British. Besides the UK is WAY more healthy. They don't have McDonald's and as much junk food there.

As someone who has lived in both countries, I think in general British people do have worse teeth, but they're not really that bad.  I think it is because British people have the NHS to provide necessary treatment and don't get any actual cosmetic work done, and won't pay for it themselves.  They could pay for it - as the Americans do - but choose not to as they have other priorities.  I think this is because Americans are more worried about their appearance in general - more Americans than Brits have plastic sugery, liposuction, etc.



But in terms of who is the healthier nation, I think Britain is actually.  Whilst there are people in both countries that eat awful diets, Americans to tend to eat far more fast food and to eat larger portions.



Also, I think British people do more exercise.  Of course in both countries there are kids that get home from school and then just sit in front of the TV, but British kids are probably more likely to go and kick a football around.  And, Americans drive everywhere - no-one ever walks.  Here, at least kids might walk to school or whatever.  I live in central London and only know one person that has a car - so obviously we use public transport, but we might have to walk 15 minutes to the station or something.



No, I don't think Americans are anti-British.  In fact, I think more British people dislike and disrespect Americans than the other way around.  In fact, many Americans tend to be fascinated by foreign countries and the people that come from them.  In general, they don't tend to travel as much as we do and perhaps do not have so much exposure to other cultures and this may make them a little ignorant, but you have to understand that being a little ignorant is not the same as being "anti" something.

I read about the bad teeth to,



and i reckon they have just watched Austin Powers ,
an American Actor playing a fictional English character from the sixties, And gone, Oh they must all be like that.'
Or think that everything in England is about 200 years behind them,and that we haven't developed dental hygiene,  which we have, as much as the usa.
You'll find your old people have bad teeth to,



But your more inclined to rip them all out and put false ones in. #
And i don't know anyone who was told that they could have braces ,that didn't. Because it's free when your still in education.
And the UK has a bad, but better then America, Obesity rate.



The amount of silly questions about Britain asked on here,
like where is Britain?  Do People in Britain have computers?
Whats the difference between Britain, Uk, and England.
And questions that are actually statements going on about how england thinks they own Ireland, which noone does.



I don't mind Americans, i just don't like it when they come along with



their ignorant opinions about something they have no knowledge about, except silly stereotypes.



(Or generalizing people based on the newspaper they read, and getting it wrong, A Guardian reader is probably more likely to have traveled, actually,if we are gonna do stereotypes.)

I like this Q. I would say that UK & America are so different that it is impossible to say one is better than the other. The bad teeth thing is probably like all American's are fat, it just isn't true.



I would say that both nations are as unhealthy as the other with the UK constant daily drinking, the chip shops, fried food. While the American's & their large portions, cups of coffee, pancakes etc.



Cannot say I know the American's are anti - British but one thing I can say for those Guardian readers types out there they comment daily on America's ills, America's global destruction, America's lack of knowledge etc,etc. Is all wrong as I've been well travelled (unlike I must add Guardian reader types) & would say ever America I have meet has been a delight. They have been more than friendly, honest, no way sarcastic, inquestitive to who I am as a person & just brilliant.

I'm American and in the process of moving to your wonderful country next Spring. I'm a college-educated nurse and my husband has his Masters in Materials Science. We are definitely not anti-British. Those people are uneducated fools who probably are miserable in their own lives and are too ignorant to realize that their beliefs keep them right where they are. For the record, I don't see anyone with really bad teeth in England. At least not any more than here. We can't even afford to see a dentist in the US. I have dental insurance and I still pay hundreds of dollars for a vist.

Health care in the U.K. is by far better but, both countries are very unhealthly because of our western lifestyle. I am a welsh american and non of it is true. But both British and Americans are pretty fat preperd to the rest of Europe and the World. Where ever you go in both America and the UK there is a Starbucks, Bugerking, Subway, Mc DonALDS, KFC, Duncan Dounouts ect where ever you go. The U.K. and the U.S. are both overweight but both countries have a very long life expendentcy.

I'm an American and I love the British. My ex-boyfriend was British and had excellent teeth. It is my favorite country to visit and I have made the trip over there 5 times. I once heard though, that less people go to the orthodontist in Britain because they believe that is par to excessive plastic surgery, and not covered by the NHS.  In America, we have priivate insurance and many have orthodontics covered so it is almost considered child-neglect to not get your child braces if they have bad teeth. Lol. It has nothing to do with being imbred. That's just mean! Many Americans probably had bad teeth when they were young. They just got braces to fix it. For some reason our culture is obsessed with having perfectly straight, blinding white teeth. Btw, I've seen some pretty bad teeth here in America.



People like to compare the two countries because we have so much in common. We share the same language, many share the same heritage, and we even share the same legal system. I think when Americans make fun of Brits and vice versa, it is mostly in jest because we know each of us can handle it. I've heard a funny analogy once that referred to us like competative cousins.

Neither.



The first one is completely wrong for the UK, it's an American format.



The second one is valid for smaller cities in the UK. London however has numbers in this format:
020 8888 8888
020 7777 7777



(You might sometimes see this quoted as 0208 888 8888, but this is wrong as once you're in London you don't need to dial the 020, but you *do* need to dial the next digit, which is always either 8 or 7).



Other large cities have numbers in the format:

It sounds like you are young and working class and therefore burdened with more than your fair share of insecurity.  In the first place, relax; don't worry about it and you will grow out of it anyway.



Reaching out to broaden your horizons and enjoy life and new experiences will build self-confidence and speed up the process of growing out of it.  (Middle class types have this served to them on a plate by their parents which is why they tend to achieve more at a younger age).



Your feelings are entirely normal, stop worrying about them and you'll start to feel degrees of relief almost straight away.



Don't knock getting pissed, particularly when you are happy!  It's fun and you should never grow out of having fun.  Drink does nothing for you when when you are miserable however, so avoid it.

you would be best going to your local newsagents or more specifically the shop you intend to start your paper round with.



different prices vary with different shops and papers, my friend deliver the local St Helens newspaper around her village and she gets £7 a week to deliver something like 200 newspapers. however i'm not sure how much you would get for delivering the Echo

There's loads there; it's one of my favourite places in London.



First thing that's great about it is how eay it is to get to. Waterloo Station is nearby and that's easy enough to get to.



You got the London Eye which is great for tourists, plus great views of the opposite side of the Thames which make for some great photos.



There are loads of restaurants (including Giraffe and Wagamama's), plenty of street performers, and a giant green area which is great for picnics (where the London Culture Festival is held).



The Imax cinema is there as is the British Film Institute so if you love films and cinema, the South Bank has loads for you to do. And the Globe Theatre is about a 15 minute walk away from the BFI so you can appreciate some Shakespeare while you're there.

Actually I should add that aussies are getting a bad rep in London as there are a lot of wanker travelers there that go overseas and never leave to australian pubs acting like d*ckheads. Sometimes referred as the 'new yanks' (inferring that we are arrogant and self centered) or Jafas (Just another ******* australian) Sometimes I witnessed things that would make me agree that we are the new yanks.

English don't like most people. There is the colour bar concept and do not like the East Asian and so will include the South, Australia too.



But they should consider the Commonwealth Group of countries who speak English and should be brothers to them.  The asian are at one time their workers in colonies and the aust are children of british prisoners of the olden time.  British really look down on others and currently they are being look-down too by others in the world as poor.

There are buses from the city centre to East Midlands Airport. They go from Friar Lane, just off Market Square ( or if you are local, Slab Square).



It is not too clear if the service you want is F1 or that is the number of the bus stop that it runs from. Easy enough to check.
There is one at 07.05 that arrives at the airport at 07.39. If this is too late, there is an earlier one at 06.30 and arrives at the airport at 07.09. There are even earlier ones.
Be at the stop a good 5 minutes before its due so as not to miss it.

I've done this before (travelled via bus to the aiport) and it was honestly ok.
I was considering getting a taxi but I'm glad I didn't waste my money - it was cheap and the bus was fine (on time, had plenty of room for luggage etc).
The bus actually drops you off in the aiport car park too so its not too much of a trek with you're baggage!
The buses are regular and run 24 hours a day 7 days a week (every 30 minutes during the day and 60 minutes during the night).. You can find out on this website (times and pick up location etc).

I just read Yvonne's 21 s answer,"she knows loads of people in Formby , who have never been flooded" wake up, Yvonne it flooded years ago, before the sea and river defence, now coupled with increased rainfall, Formby is a flood plain area, no matter how many people you know its what is going to happen with or with out sea defence, coupled with global warming and increased rainfall, I asked not what anyone thinks , rather what they know from the past.

During the night of 11th and 12th November 1977 severe storms coinciding with high tides overtopped coastal defences throughout Lancashire and Cumbria. At Southport the midnight tide rose by more than one and a half metres (5ft) above its predicted level and flooded 110 houses at Harrogate Way in Crossens. No one was physically injured but floodwater up to a metre deep caused considerable damage to property. It was found that water had overtopped a length of sea bank dating from the 1890's which was lower than the other sea walls at Southport. Elsewhere in Sefton the sand dunes eroded by up to 20 metres (60ft), promenades, coastal parks and sea walls were damaged and there was much wind damage to inland property. The bank at Crossens was raised and strengthened during the following year and has not been damaged since.



As recently as January this year fields,Altcar,Hightown and Little Crosby were waterlogged with up to a foot of water as the pumping stations could not cope, Currently only two storm pumps are in a useable condition. It is hoped a third can be salvaged in time for the winter, while the fourth has been consigned to an engineering graveyard. Altmoouth pumping station is havin a multi million pound refurbishment to replace the pumps which control the level of the River Alt in adverse weather., also an extention of the weed screening scheme is being done.



A proposal has been put forward to have another flood plain at Lunt meadows.



Sand extraction from the dunes through storm surges and asparugus growing weakened the defences before Coastal protection orders came into place these were the natural protection from the water  and that is why it was declared a flood plain

Thank you, Hayley that answer says it all for me, Formby is in danger in the future, I don't think for one second a line of beautiful sand dunes will protect it from flooding, and the river Alt is a constant danger, from the rear ,I will look away from Formby, some place safe from flooding.

No it is not built on a flood plain. Anyway there is hardly any risk of flooding because the sea is quite a distance from any settlements due to the sand dunes and the pine woods. (Look on Google maps).
However they say that Formby point is one of the lowest areas in Britain and is about to disapear under the waves very soon due to global warming.

Yes it was drained in the 1700's and part of it is below sea level.



It is protected by the nearby sandhills but be specific. The whole of that part of old Lancashire now Merseyside has the same problem.



Not all of it floods  but it is as well to be aware. It is no Tewkesbury

Go down the docks and check out the developments - loads of new buildings have gone up.  Go on the Ferry across the Mersey!! Take lots of photos of Lambbananas (that'll make sense when you see them!).  I love the Cavern pub and club, and Matthew Street generally but loads of places to go in the evenings.

Unfortunately most of the big events for capital of culture took place during the summer, but there are still a few things going on. The Liverpool Biennial is taking place, 'Turning the place over' is still astonishing.
It depends what you are into, St Georges hall a stunning building which you can tour, or you could go and see a visual art exhibition at the FACT on Wood St.
The Maritime Museum is good and has a great Titanic exhibition, as well as the International Slavery Museum.
If shopping is your thing Liverpool One, The largest retail development in europe has has just fully opened.
The magical mystery tour is a good way of seeing the whole city, takes a few hours and leaves from the Albert Dock.



Unfortunately the Superlambanans where taken of the streets at the end of August and have been raffled for charity. There are four in the world museum in William Brown St, there is one at the cruise liner terminal, and it was a delight to see The Liverpool and Everton Superlambananas in the Home Bargain's shop at the firms head quarters off the East Lancs Road on Saturday.

North East Bamburgh and Seahouses are very pretty if you like seaside resorts, however, they will be bitingly cold and many of the attractions will not be open in January.  However, there are lots of nearby attractions you could visit, quiet places such as Holy Island, Craster (home of the lovely smoked kippers, a sweet little island), Alnwick Gardens or Dunstonburgh Castle. Embleton is just north of this castle which has a lovely beach, if you are prepared to wrap up and brave the winds!



Or you could go North West, to beautiful Cumbria, Cockermouth is a gorgeous little place and the hotels reduce their prices in January and February.  Or Keswick which may cost more, but, be just as pretty, they also have cheaper hotels.  If you seek a busier place than these quiet tourist idols, Carlisle or Penrith are larger and have more to offer - shops, bars etc.



I would suggest Scotland too, as despite the cold, they have a lot of all year round tourist attractions, you don't have to go far over the border.  Berwick is gorgeous, so is North Berwick.  Dunbar is also very lovely.  Eyemouth is a lovely little fishing village that has a fabulous pub called Churches, it's a hotel too, serves gorgeous fish dishes (as it would considering it's location).



I hope you find somewhere fantastic.

THE PEAK DISTRICT! We normally have gr8 weather in January as we have lots of snow, not so much rain.



It has lots of great villages and smalltowns to visit these include:
Castleton - lots of caverns, air sports e.g windsurfing and parachuting, and old fashioned sweet shops and pubs.



Buxton - a few funky but stylish bars, lots of decent buildings, the devonshire campus, the royal pavillions.
Chatsworth - magic place!
Matlock and ashbourne - other example of brilliant trowns to visit.



However I live here and I work  for the council in the tourism sector so I dont know as much for other places. I would also recommend the Lake district, skegness, blackpool and Alton towers.



Alton towers has an incredible hotel and a brilliant theme park.



I hope you enjoy your holiday wherever you go.

Depends on how far North you're prepared to go.
You can't go wrong with the Lake District in Cumbria.
It is one of the loveliest places in the whole of the British Isles as far as I am concerned.
There are plenty of really good Hotels, Guest Houses, Cottages etc to choose from. Windermere is probably the most popular and busiest of places within the area.
If you want a relaxed holiday with lots to do and enjoy lovely scenery, look no further.

All the suggestions here are very good if you like scenic beauty, lakes and mountains and things, but as you're quite young, you might enjoy Blackpool. It has a wonderful funfair and lots of other attractions and lovely beaches and beautiful scenery isn't far from it. It's a pity your holiday isn't now, when the lights are on, for that really is a sight to see.

Are caravan sites really allowed to charge extra £700 rent per year because the van wasnt brought through them?



Hi if you dont buy a van through the site your ground rent is higher than buying direct from the site.
Is this really allowed?

Pet friendly short weekend breaks in Devon or Cornwall?



Hi, i am desperately looking to book a short weekend break (friday night, saturday night, leave sunday) over the next 3 to 4 weeks for me, my fiancee, 6mth old baby boy and a dog or 2!!



Can anyone recommend any good self catering places that are dog friendly, preferably near dog friendly beaches etc, as my fiancee is totally knackered looking after our little gem of a boy and i would like to treat her to a short break (on a budget).

Is Elephant and Castle a safe place to live?



I recently moved here to study at LSBU.
Ive read mixed opinions about this place
although the answers all seem rather dated
whats Elephant and Castle like today?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It rather depends on your age and the kind of things you like to do. I think it would be safe enough for a middle aged lady who liked bingo, but some youngsters are going to be a bit vulnerable because it is an inner city area in the Borough of Southwark.



There are some racial tensions there. So, I would say go out in groups, avoid eye contact with the yobs, and ignore them.



Don't intervene in a fight, go a distance away and call 999 on your mobile.



I don't want to make it sound awful, but it is a fact that there are some very nasty types around in places like that.



If possible, why not move a bit further out, to say Blackheath or Greenwich, they are nice areas and quite easy to commute back to Elephant and Castle.

The answerer, Morpheu. uses faulty logic; Having crossed it often, he BELIEVES  it to be safe.  But that's not the same as it BEING safe.
If he is on the bridge on the day that it collapses, he may find himself changing his opinion as he splashes around in the cold, dirty River Thames.

The current London bridge is classified as a super structure, it is constructed of pre-stressed concrete box girders, and reputed to be the safest and strongest form of structural engineering in the world.



All the bridges in central London are rigorously maintained and checked on a daily basis for any stress symptoms. (see the bridge trust).



Trivia: Apart from the United stated buying the old London bridge, thinking it was Tower bridge, the actual lights on the bridge are made out of Napoleon's cannons.



The albert bridge, (see lynx post) is the only bridge where as the soldiers from the local barracks, must break step, when marching over it.



The actual sign is on the old toll kiosk at the foot of the bridge (north side).

When many people go over a bridge they all should change step... If your military you'll know what I mean easily... If everyone walked at the same pace & there foot steps hit the ground at the same time - as in marching then the bridge would bounce... because everyone is walking at an uneven pace the weight & step remains apsolutely & the bridge is safe...

Here in England we have the English (Bank of England) Pound.



If costs Americans about $2 to buy £1 (One Pound) approx.



So, if the hotel price quoted is £90 - that about $180.00

€ = euros
£ = UK pounds sterling

Normally, items are priced in UK pounds Sterling. So, I'm guessing that it probably means approximately $90, depending on what the exchange rate is when you pay for it. $90 is a bit cheap for a London hotel though (unless it is a per person (min. 2 persons) rate as opposed to a room rate)

The currency of the United Kingdom (England is not a country, it's a nation, and does not have it's own currency) is the British Pound (sterling).



£1 = $1.76 dollars so £90 would be $158



I would suggest, however, that before visiting our country you learn a little about it. You might then enjoy your trip to the United Kingdom more.

there are lots of little B & B' right next to St Pancras station. Sorry not to give you a link but would imagine they are not too expensive.



google b and b in Kings Cross, look for Argyle Square, its nearest to st pancras. That is the quickest way, there are other main hotels near Russell square which are much more expensive,

There are several large hospitals in Glasgow - and several more in the surrounding area.



http://www.nhsggc.org.uk/content/ gives you the basic information - contacting them will help your mom find work.  There are also nursing agencies in Glasgow, but I know nothing about them, I'm afraid.



http://www.nhsggc.org.uk/content/default... gives a database of any possible suitable vacancies.



You also have to figure out what working permits etc your mom might need.

Its at the junction of Gt. Western Road , Byres Rd & Queen Margaret drive.



You can get subway to Hillhead, or any bus going west along Gt Western Rd, No. 66, or one from Buchanan St bus station, just ask there as there is more than one bus leaves from there. It should take about 15 or 20 minutes. It is a beautiful park, & you will enjoy it.  I live not so far from there, & enjoy the shops in Byres Rd , a good day out.  Have fun.

0141 334 2422



Set in the West End of Glasgow, Scotland, the Glasgow Botanic Gardens is a large public park with several glasshouses, the most notable of which is the Kibble Palace. The gardens were created in 1817, and run by the Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow (founded by Thomas Hopkirk of Dalbeth), and were intended to supply the University of Glasgow. William Hooker was regius professor of botany at Glasgow University, and contributed to the development of the Botanic Gardens before his appointment to the directorship of Kew Gardens in London. The gardens were originally used for concerts and other events, and in 1891 the gardens were incorporated in to the Parks and Gardens of the City of Glasgow.



The site was once served by a railway line, and Botanic Gardens Railway Station remains today in a derelict state as a remarkable example of a disused station.

My boyfriend is a big LFC fan and from what I've experienced, everyone is generally very friendly and welcoming, the number of times you talk to random people in the street cause they happen to be wearing a Liverpool top, amazing. I don't usually go to matches but from what I know, most people do go into town afterwards rather than staying around the grounds, there is a specific bus that runs the route, the soccer bus, which is usually rather cramped but does the job. I would expect generally people would be very pleased to meet someone who has bothered to come all the way to see Liverpool rather than giving them crap.
If you haven't yet I would recommend you join the official site:
http://www.liverpoolfc.tv /
There are forums on there (I think on that site anyway) where you could meet some fellow LFC fans and ask some more questions. My boyfriend has met friends on there which have been really helpful in the past when it came to traveling, so I would really suggest you checking out. Have fun, Liverpool is great, hope you'll enjoy your stay!

First off you will be very lucky to get a ticket for Anfield, there is a waiting list for season tickets, and those that go on sale are snapped up very quickly.



Liverpool is renowned for its friendliness, you will be treated very well, unless you are related to Gillette and Hick's because there is a lot of bad feeling over what they have done to the club.



The pubs around the grounds are OK friendly but a bit run down, most people travel into the city centre for probably one of Britain's best nights out.

I love castles and have visited many, I prefer the ruined ones that have seen some action!



Wales probably has the best castles:



http://www.castlewales.com/



I used to live near Pembroke Castle which is awesome, huge and well preserved.  Carreg Cennan is in an awesome location.  Manobier Castle is quite small but overlooks a lovely beach, great for day trips.



North Wales has Beaumaris Castle and Caenarfon Castles, both very impressive.



Cornwall has some good ones, Launceston Castle and Restormel Castles.



Scotland also has good castles, Culzean Castle is interesting as it is triangular.  Stirling Castle is very large and well preserved, worth a visit.



I'd probably go for Urquhart Castle as my favourite overall as the location is stunning with Loch Ness on one side and the mountains on the other.

My favourite is Richmond Castle in York. went there for a school trip and been several times since. Back home in the North-East there are so many places to see of historical value.



Castle Eden Walkway and Robin Hood's Bay both feature ruins, which is another favourite of mine. I guess I love visiting ruins as your imagination builds what these fabulous place must have been like.



Most impressive of all was an enormous Fort on the island of Malta. I was hungover on the tour so I would have to look up it's names and details, but it was breathtaking in its expanse and views.

Goodness, I have lost count of the castles that I have been to.  I was lucky enough to live in Cyprus as a child and I think that that is where my love of castles stems from.  I would have to say that my most favourite castle is St, Hilarion which is in the Kyrenia Mountains of Northern Cyprus

Chatsworth is definitely my fave. I like the idea of it being built by a woman :-) I dunno it just feels like Narnia and it's got that painted violin that looks real.



I also adore Stokesay castle. It's an English heritage site and they don't tart things up and put dummies in and I like that. Everytime I've been it's been full of Swallows ..just adding to the magic.



When I researched Mr Haz's family tree I knew he was bit posh but I was well peed off when I found out he was a direct descendant of Bess of Hardwick the lady responsible for Chatsworth. Reliably Mummy Haz made me feel a lot better by saying' that's all very well but where's the bleedin' money?' lololol.

Because women have been opressed to the point where men and club owners feel somewhat sorry for them, and also grateful at the same time. The girl to guy ratio is probably because of so much harrasment and rape that happens when there are more guys and girls. Women are naturally more mature than men, thus a club owner would prefer to let 5 of them in for $20, over 20 rowdy men for $80. Plus more people will come to a club that has a rep for letting "gorgeous women" in...fellow women included.

Because its a guy/girl bar, and because most of the people who WANT to go in there are male, the bar will soon be full of single men, and when teh women come in, everyone will be all over them. The women will stop coming, and if women stop coming, the men will stop coming. Thus they go out of business.

it would depend on te time of day, but it would roughly be between £6 and £8. i often get a cab from old street to blackfriars station which is roughly the same length of journey and the price varies between £6 and £8.50, but of course the cabbies usually expect a tip of about a pound

Read about Scotland's involvement here.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Engli...



the Third Civil War became a war of England against Scotland. Here at least the English Independents carried the whole of England with them. Few Englishman cared to accept a settlement at the hands of a victorious foreign army, and on June 28, 1650, five days after Charles II had sworn to the Covenant, the newly appointed Lord-General Oliver Cromwell was on his way to the Border to take command of the English army. About the same time a new militia act was passed that was destined to give full and decisive effect to the national spirit of England in the great final campaign of the war.



Meanwhile the motto frappez fort, frappez vite was carried out at once by the regular forces. On July 19, Cromwell made the final arrangements at Berwick-on-Tweed. Major-General Thomas Harrison, a gallant soldier and an extreme English Independent, a Fifth Monarchist, was to command the regular and auxiliary forces left in England, and to secure the Commonwealth against Royalists and Presbyterians. Cromwell took with him Lieutenant-General Charles Fleetwood and Major-General John Lambert, and his forces numbered about 10,000 foot and 5,000 horse. His opponent David Leslie (his comrade of Marston Moor) had a much larger force, but its degree of training was inferior, it was more than tainted by the political dissensions of the people at large, and it was, in great part at any rate, raised by forced enlistment. On July 22, Cromwell crossed the river Tweed. He marched on Edinburgh by the sea coast, through Dunbar, Haddington and Musselburgh, living almost entirely on supplies landed by the fleet which accompanied him, for the country itself was incapable of supporting even a small army, and on the July 29, he found Leslie's army drawn up and entrenched in a position extending from Leith to Edinburgh.



Operations around Edinburgh
The same day a sharp but indecisive fight took place on the lower slopes of Arthur's Seat, after which Cromwell, having felt the strength of Leslie's line, drew back to Musselburgh. Leslie's horse followed him up sharply, and another action was fought, after which the Scots assaulted Musselburgh without success. Militarily Leslie had the best of it in these affairs, but it was precisely this moment that the Kirk party chose to institute a searching three days' examination of the political and religious sentiments of his army. The result was that the army was "purged" of 80 officers and 3000 soldiers as it lay within musket shot of the enemy. Cromwell was more concerned, however, with the supply question than with the distracted army of the Scots. On August 6, he had to fall back as far as Dunbar to enable the fleet to land supplies in safety, the port of Musselburgh being unsafe in the violent and stormy weather which prevailed. He soon returned to Musselburgh and prepared to force Leslie to battle. In preparation for an extended manoeuvre three days' rations were served out. Tents were also issued, perhaps for the first time in the civil wars, for it was a regular professional army, which had to be cared for, made comfortable and economized, that was now carrying on the work of the volunteers of the first war. Even after Cromwell started on his manoeuvre, the Scottish army was still in the midst of its political troubles, and, certain though he was that nothing but victory in the field would give an assured peace, he was obliged to intervene in the confused negotiations of the various Scottish parties. At last, however, Charles II. made a show of agreeing to the demands of his strange supporters, and Leslie was free to move. Cromwell had now entered the hill country, with a view to occupying South Queensferry and thus blocking up Edinburgh. Leslie had the shorter road and barred the way at Corstorphine Hill (August 21). Cromwell, though now far from his base, manoeuvred again to his right, Leslie meeting him once more at Gogar (August 27). The Scottish lines at that point were strong enough to dismay even Cromwell, and the manoeuvre on Queensferry was at last given up. It had cost the English army severe losses in sick, and much suffering in the autumn nights on the bleak hillsides.



Dunbar
On the August 28, Cromwell fell back on Musselburgh, and on August 31, after embarking his non-effective men, to Dunbar. Leslie followed him up, and wished to fight a battle at Dunbar on Sunday, the 1st of September. But again the kirk intervened, this time to forbid Leslie to break the Sabbath, and the unfortunate Scottish commander could only establish himself on Doon Hill, near Dunbar, and send a force to Cockburnspath to bar the Berwick road. He had now 23,000 men to Cromwell's 11,000, and proposed, faute de mieux, to starve Cromwell into surrender. But the English army was composed of "ragged soldiers with bright muskets," and had a great captain of undisputed authority at their head. Leslie's, on the other hand, had lost such discipline as it had ever possessed, and was now, under outside influences, thoroughly disintegrated. Cromwell wrote home, indeed, that he was "upon an engagement very difficult," but, desperate as his position seemed, he felt the pulse of his opponent and steadily refused to take his army away by sea. He had not to wait long. It was now the turn of Leslie's men on the hillside to endure patiently privation and exposure, and after one night's bivouac, Leslie, too readily inferring that the enemy was about to escape by sea, came down to fight. The Battle of Dunbar opened in the early morning of September 3. It was the most brilliant of all Oliver's victories. Before the sun was high in the heavens the Scottish army had ceased to exist.



Royalism in Scotland
After Dunbar it was easy for the victorious army to overrun southern Scotland, more especially as the dissensions of the enemy were embittered by the defeat of which they had been the prime cause. The Kirk indeed put Dunbar to the account of its own remissness in not purging their army more thoroughly, but, as Cromwell wrote on September 4, the Kirk had "done its do." "I believe their king will set up on his own score," he continued, and indeed, now that the army of the Kirk was destroyed and they themselves were secure behind the Forth and based on the friendly Highlands, Charles and the Cavaliers were in a position not only to defy Cromwell, but also to force the Scottish national spirit of resistance to the invader into a purely Royalist channel. Cromwell had only received a few drafts and reinforcements from England, and for the present he could but block up Edinburgh Castle (which surrendered on Christmas eve), and try to bring up adequate forces and material for the siege of Stirling an attempt which was frustrated by the badness of the roads and the violence of the weather. The rest of the early winter of 1650 was thus occupied in semi-military, semi-political operations between detachments of the English army and certain armed forces of the Kirk party which still maintained a precarious existence in the western Lowlands, and in police work against the moss-troopers of the Border counties. Early in February 1651, still in the midst of terrible weather, Cromwell made another resolute but futile attempt to reach Stirling. This time he himself fell sick, and his losses had to be made good by drafts of recruits from England, many of whom came most unwillingly to serve in the cold wet bivouacs that the newspapers had graphically reported.



English Militia
About this time there occurred in England two events which had a most important bearing on the campaign. The first was the detection of a widespread Royalist-Presbyterian conspiracy how widespread no one knew, for those of its promoters who were captured and executed certainly formed but a small fraction of the whole number. Major-General Harrison was ordered to Lancashire in April to watch the north Welsh, earl of Derby on the Isle of Man and Border Royalists, and military precautions were taken in various parts of England. The second was the revival of the militia. Since 1644 there had been no general employment of local forces, the quarrel having fallen into the hands of the regular armies by force of circumstances. The New Model, though a national army, resembled Wellington's British Peninsular army more than the soldiers of the levée en masse of the French Revolution and the American Civil War. It was now engaged in prosecuting a war of aggression against the hereditary foe over the border strictly the task of a professional army with a national basis. The militia was indeed raw and untrained. Some of the Essex men "fell flat on their faces on the sound of a cannon." In the north of England Harrison complained to Cromwell of the "badness" of his men, and the lord general sympathized, having "had much such stuff" sent him to make good the losses in trained men. Even he for a moment lost touch with the spirit of the people. His recruits were unwilling drafts for foreign service, but in England the new levies were trusted to defend their homes, and the militia was soon triumphantly to justify its existence on the day of Worcester.

While David Leslie organized and drilled the king's new army beyond the Forth, Cromwell was, slowly and with frequent relapses, recovering from his illness. The English army marched to Glasgow in April, then returned to Edinburgh. The motives of the march and that of the return are alike obscure, but it may be conjectured that, the forces in England under Harrison having now assembled in Lancashire, the Edinburgh-Newcastle-York road had to be covered by the main army. Be this as it may, Cromwell's health again broke down and his life was despaired of. Only late in June were operati

Don't tip at a bar when buying drinks. If you have been there all night and have had particularly good service then you may consider a tip at the end of the night but generally it is not required to leave a tip each time you order. Another common way of "tipping" a bar person is to ask them if you can buy them a drink.

Scotland is a country in northwest Europe that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It is part of the United Kingdom and shares a land border to the south with England. It is bounded by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest. In addition to the mainland, Scotland consists of over 790 islands including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.

The AA site has it at 216 miles which will take 3hrs 41 mins.
The closest I've done is Liverpool to Carlisle which takes a similar route and was an easy but shorter drive.You're pretty much straight up the motorway.



If you go to www.theaa.com you can use their route planner.

You get your entrance tickets at the gate when you get there.
As for the Fast Tracks, from what i remember there are fast track machines outside certain rides and you get a ticket from there and it gives you a time to come back and use the fast track ticket

16+ Oyster card for London Underground(HELP IM CONFUSED)?



Zones 1-4 cost £1.20 on Wednesday afternoon. But my friends told me it is £2 to go from Walthamstow Central to Oxford Circus and back.



If I were to swipe my 16+ Oyster card in Walthamstow Central which is in Zone 3, what happens? Does £1.20 get taken away? In which case it will take £2.40 to go to Oxford Circus and come back?



What is this "New deal cash single fair" which says it cost £2 for Zones 1-4. Maybe my friends were talking about that? Is this different from my Oyster card?

You can use it for Gatwick to Victoria but I'd doubt it would be valid on the Gatwick Express (30 mins every 15 mins).



Just buy a tube ticket at Victoria to get you to Heathrow (about £6).  Take the Victoria Line and change onto the Picadilly at Green Park or take the Circle/District and change on to the Picadilly at Earl's Court.

The trains and the underground go to terminal 4 - the station is called terminal 4 .



Your train from Sheffield will NOT go direct to Heathrow - you need to get off your train from Sheffield in central London and get the London Underground to Heathrow Terminal 4 .



Heathrow airport has three (yes 3) stations - they are T1,2,3 (sometimes called 'Central) - - T4 - - and T5.  there is no need to get a taxi or a coach to the airport.

Either get the Piccadilly Line from King's Cross St Pancras which takes you to either Heathrow Terminals 4 and 1,2,3 or Terminals 1,2,3 and 5, or Circle, Hammersmith and City or Metropolitan lines to Paddington then travel on either the Heathrow Express or Heathrow Connect trains to Heathrow Airport.



Using the tube would be cheaper though.

I think the trains from Sheffield go into St Pancras. Get the underground from there to Paddington and get the Heathrow Express (it takes 15 mins) to Terminal 4. If you think that's a bit expensive take the Piccadilly Line all the way from Kings Cross St Pancras to Heathrow Terminal 4 (it takes a long time as there are a lot of stops).

Walk to Kilburn High Road underground, head on the Bakerloo Line to Oxford Circus, then change onto the Victoria Line to Victoria. Either £4 for a single journey on the tube without a Oyster card, though about half that price if you do have an Oyster.
At Victoria get on the train to Windsor and Eton Riverside. (estimate at about between £10-£20 for a return)
When arriving at the terminus you will either have to walk towards the castle and pick up the Shuttle bus(which costs about £4 for a return) or hail a taxi(no idea on price)

if you've got the time and the patience to do your own searches you may well be able to get a better deal booking things yourself ... but there can be some reasonable deals ... why not do a bit of searching to get an idea of prices of hotels and compare that to the packages



the area around the O2 Arena is not where most of the tourist hotels are ... the O2 Arena is near North Greenwich station on the Jubilee underground line ... see square D8 on the tube map
http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/s...
most of the hotels etc tend either to be in the west (Kensington, Gloucester Road etc) or to the north of the West End (Bloomsbury, Russell Square etc) ... the most important thing is that you get a hotel that is within reasonable distance of a tube station and you'll be OK



if you want to search for hotels yourself, I'd suggest you use one of the maps, e.g. www.multimap.com, www.streetmap.com, or google, where you can enter the postcode of the hotel and it will pull up on a map where it's located

first of all for hotels near the O2 arena take a look here:
http://www.milesfaster.co.uk/places/mill...



However take note that London is split between north and south of the River Thames so you really want a hotel on the south side. The Express Greenwich fits the bill, its close, on the south side and its part of a budget chain.



As for packages the thing to note is how flexible do you need to be? Packages normally require upfront payment and hefty cancellation penalties while a hotel like the express wont charge you till you check-out. (unless taking a cheaper rate for advance payment). The only way to compare rates between booking separately is to choose and see the prices. DIY is so easy these days that making your own package has a lot of benefits.

You would save a lot on a package deal as everything is all in included.  If you go it on your own the uk is expensive for transportation hotels food and entry to some of historic places.



No matter how you go if your lunch is not included - then use the local pubs where you get a good meal at a reasonable price no matter your age but if underage to drink do not insult the owner by trying it on.
Be streetwise and do not haul all your cash out in front of people or as in all parts of the world, someone will part you from it.

It depends on what you want to see once you are over here.
There are lots of sightseeing tours here that you can go on once you arrive if you just book a flight and hotel package.

It's safer in Kabul than in London.



The Home Office and Metropolitan Police confirm via new figures published that we are experiencing more crime involving knives and more stabbings throughout the nation.



129,840 stabbings recorded last year



75 per cent up from previous year in the number of stab wounds



In the capital yesterday a 17 year old was found guilty of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm by Inner London crown court for plunging a knife into the head of his victim during a street robbery.



The Times reported that the teenager and two other young men were injured when they tried to stop a friend being robbed at a bus stop in Walworth, southeast London, in November last year.



The attacker was later caught using DNA evidence found inside a hat that he dropped fleeing the incident.



The blade used according to Detective Constable Scott Albert was a kitchen knife and the damage done to the victim will be long lasting.



This conviction comes at a time when 27 Londoners have been killed either via knife or gun crime on the streets of the capital making life for teenagers more dangerous in London than in Kabul Afghanistan if they were in the armed forces.

The trendy pubs are on George Street



All Bar One
29 George Street, EH2 (226 9971 )
An archetypal example of a former bank becoming a trendy Edinburgh pub/wine bar. Operated by a large nation wide bars chain.



Bar 38
126-128 George Street, EH2 (220 6180)
Wall sculptures and attractive coloured lighting provide interest for the eye at this popular after-work Edinburgh pub, which is in an area at the West End of George Street among other fashionable Edinburgh bars.



Candy Bar
113-115 George Street, EH2 (225 9179)
Great atmosphere and a good place to visit on a night out at the west end of George Street Edinburgh.



The Dome
14 George Street, EH2 (624 8624)
Underneath the vaulted cupola of this grandiose former bank building is a large central Edinburgh bar surrounded by carefully placed seating and plants. Frazer's Bar, at the front of the same building, is decorated in luxurious art deco style, with wood-panelled walls. Famous for their good food in their Edinburgh restaurant area. Must be one of the most stylish bars in Edinburgh.



Le Monde



16 George Street, EH2



This Edinburgh style concept pub, is situated in a stylish building on Edinburgh's George Street between the Dome and The Edinburgh Hard Rock Cafe. It's an 18 bedroom boutique hotel which has 3 bars and an night club called Tokyo in it's basement.



Standing Order
62-66 George Street, EH2 (225 4460)



It's still possible to see the safe from the time when this large Edinburgh building was a bank. These days it's a spacious Wetherspoon's Edinburgh pub with no-smoking rooms, no music and no children.



Tigerlily



125 George Street, EH2 (225 5005)



Edinburgh’s winner of The Scottish Hotel Bar Award 2007 . Hang out in the ground-floor bar area where the glass windows look out to George Street.



Or you could try Frankenstein's on George IV Bridge, 3 floors, 3 bars and lots of music.



Then move on to Espionage, just along the road, its a popular venue for visitors, its free to get in and has 5 floors all with different music types. It's in Victoria Street next to India Buildings.



Whatever you decide to do, I'm sure you'll have a great time.

The Standing Order (It's still possible to see the safe from the time when this large Edinburgh building was a bank. These days it's a spacious Wetherspoon's Edinburgh pub with no-smoking rooms, no music and no children) is probably the cheapest place to go for food and a drink in  Edinburgh City Centre. In Edinburgh classy doesn't go with cheap, it does get pretty crowded and noisy, but it a good place to start before moving on , there are lots of classy places in George Street and even in Queen Street. I am sure you will end up somewhere that suits you.

Revellers are being warned that the gathering in Edinburgh, centred on Princes Street, is strictly an all-ticket affair and that no bottles or glasses will be permitted through the barriers. Glasses and bottles will not be allowed through the barriers and will have to be deposited in bottle banks.



Arrangements have been made with off licences to supply beer in cans and spirits in plastic containers.

I'll bet it was an American who told you that - they seem to have a fetish about totally unnecessary circumcision. In the UK if there's no religious reason to have it done, hardly any boys are circumcised - most of us would consider it child abuse.
