Urgent enquiry re. working in France...



Any directions very much appreciated.

I had a job to commence in SW France, leaving this Saturday. I've just learned the job has fallen through (grrrreat!) and I had tied up all loose ends in UK ready to leave. Come Saturday I've no residence and no job. there are quite a few opportunities on Gumtree I can start calling tomorrow but I need to maximise my opportunites and get as much to go at as possible.

Any websites you can recommend, similar to Gumtree, that give the employer details direct without having to go through an employment agency?

Extreeemly grateful if you can help. Thanks.

Does modern day France still contain any land originally acquired by Napoleon Bonaparte's conquests?



if so, what parts? and what country did they belong to previously?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



No.



Napoleon's conquests were stopped in 1814 and that year French borders went back to being what they had been in 1789 (+ some territories annexed in 1792, 1797 and 1798 - in any case, before Napoleon came to power in 1799).

What is the best way to visit France and Italy?



My husband and I want to travel to France what is the most economical way to do this?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I went to Italy & France two years ago, before our USD took such a beating.  Are you sure you want to go and get so much less for your dollar?



Are you a very young married couple?  I ask because you may want to really cut costs by 'roughing' it in Hostels?



If you are moderately well set, own a home...It's possible you would want to trade houses with a family there?  If the schedule works out where they come here at the same time you go there?  Traveling back and forth between the countries is a snap.



Planning ahead can save you in regards to air fare.  I hear there are some good deals before the holidays, or after?  For me, there were vehicles at my disposal, but really there is no reason to rent a car, the public transportation is good.  Unless you want to go 150 mph on Italy's Autostrada?



I was fortunate, I had a friend who owned a summer home in Nice, but nice hotels are not cheap in France, better in Italy.



Finally - since u have not given me much to go on -



For a middle-class couple, two weeks in Euro, should run you a minimum of $7,500...that is figuring in your flight, a 'decent' place to stay, food, and a few souvenirs.  If I am underestimating your financial output (you give me no clues), then you can easily spend 10K and have a good time as long as you do not walk up the steps of the Casino in youknowwhere.  I hope this has been 'some' help, feel free to ask what you want.

Avoriaz is a ski village. All about it is skiing. Ski school, ski equipment shops, ski outfits shop, the village's economic is everything to do with skiing. Still, there are shops, restaurants, nightclubs and all facilities and entertainments. To know more, you can visit their site, it's got English version there :

All three would actually be translated the same way =]  And number three technically isn't correct grammar in English (some variation of a split infinitive, although the name escapes me at the moment.)



Your two translations mean:



Maybe you weren't watching "the news" last night.
For the news on TV, we say either 'les infos' or 'le journal télévisé.'



Your second sentence means-
Il was necessary that you don't watch "the news."



So back to our first question.



You don't really translate the 'must not have' literally into French like you do in English.  It comes out with a whole twisted new meaning =]



Tu ne devais pas regarder les infos is what I would say.



So basically, you must not [have] watch[ed] the news is what is comes back as word for word.



Hope this helps!



Ah, and 'si ce n'est pas l'amour' is correct =)

Are there any cheap pet-friendly hostels in France?



If so, what are the names and cities?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Most hotels in France allow guests to take pets into their rooms and most restaurants also allow dogs under the table but they do have restrictions as to size. There usually is an additional charge if a dog is taken into a bedroom and stays there overnight. Guide dogs are accepted everywhere, but there would still be a charge.
Youth Hostels (auberges de jeunesse) have different rules due to the fact that facilities and accommodation are often shared and some guests may be allergic to other people's animals.
The advice given to tourists is ask from the place where you want to stay beforehand. Most guide books or those issued buy hotel chains that offer the cheapest accomodation tell you which hostelleries accept animals. In Michelin, the sign is a box with a dog head. If it is crossed-off , it means "no pets".
http://www.parisinfo.com/paris-guide/vie...



Here is a list of chains that accept animals:
http://www.spa-france.asso.fr/hotel.html
There are some all over France and you can look at their individual websites to find in which cities they are. Formule 1 and Campanile are amongst the cheapest.

Well known celebrities in France?



I'm not a French native but I have to make up some work for a school class which revolves around them guessing celebrities by descriptions of when they were born, famous films/songs whatever and some basic physical descriptions?
Anyway, because i'm not french i'm really struggling to come up with many that they'll definitely know, especially 14 year old kids! So if there are any french people on here (especially ones with young kids) it would be great if you could give a few ideas.



Also, the ones i've come up with so far are: Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Claude Monet, Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Zinedine Zidane and William Shakespeare. Do you think they will know all of these?

The French love hollywood and movie stars. Brad and Angelina for instance, the Olsen Twins, Hillary Duff.



Then there are the usual Gerard Depardieu (french actor), Serge Gainsborough (famous old singer), Juliet Binoche (actress), Daniel Auteuil (funny actor). Daft Punk are also a popular group in France at the moment.

If you want some celebrities that the FRENCH might know:



Jerry Lewis
Le Charlot (also known as Charlie Chaplin)
Picasso (lived most of his life there)
Van Gogh (ditto)
Johnny Depp.  Okay, the French might not actually know who he is, but he lived in France, and your 14 year old American kids will know who he is.



Hmmm?  yeah, I'm coming up with a bunch of people no 14 year old kid would know...like Jaques Brel (actually Belgian) and Edith Piaf, Brigitte Bardot, and Catherine DeNeuve.



Ah! Gérard Dépardieu!  Some might know who he is!  Also, Dumas, or the Three Musketeers, or D'Artagnan.  They might be able to come up with that...How about King Louis XIV? Surely they could come up with that...



That should help.



Marcel Marceau?  Or is he too obscure?



Can you use fictional characters?  Sophie Marceau (from Da Vinci Code...anyone who's seen the movie...)
