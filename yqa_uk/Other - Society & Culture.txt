<question>



Now That America Has Their First Black President, Will We Ever See The First Women President?



I voted for Obama and am happy he won. But I don't think a Women should ever be President Of The United States.



Why You Ask, I Think Bill Maher put it perfectly.



Here is what he said:



Bill Maher: I’m not trying to be sexist here, but I’m just saying that women try a lot of different tacks when they’re in arguments.



[Plays a clip of Hillary, misty-eyed at a campaign event]



Maher: But look at Hillary Clinton. Because the first thing a woman does, of course, is cry. [Affecting a dramatic, teary voice] “I just want to be happy. Why can’t you just love me?”



Maher: And then they go to sweet talking.



[Plays a clip of Hillary complimenting Obama at a recent debate]



Maher: “You’re the best thing that ever happened to me! And you look so handsome in that tie!”



[Plays a clip of Hillary saying “shame on you” about Obama’s “Harry and Louise” brochure]



Maher: And then they throw an anger fit totally unrelated to anything. “Stay home and watch the game. See if I care.”



[Plays a clip of Hillary mocking Obama’s soaring rhetoric]



Maher: And when it doesn’t work, they bring out the sarcasm. “Oh, I’m just a woman, I couldn’t possibly understand the issues like you could.” Don’t write me, please ladies, don’t write me.



Christopher Hitchens: And then if you say “whine, whine, whine,” they say that’s sexist.



Not to mention when that time of the month comes, she might just accidentaly nuke a country.



Women just can’t handle the tough job of being a leader much less the leader of the United States, the toughest job in the world.

I would have voted for Obama if I were American.



But I'm not, hehe



Indira Gandhi did very well



Golda Meyer did great



Philippines is doing nicely



and many other countries, such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, etc. are and have been ruled by women.



And just in case you do not know, the monthly curse does no longer apply by the time they reach the post of Presidency ;)

Are you genuinely laughing your a** off, I don't think so!



It is generally inserted after something the individual has written themselves and almost 100% of the time is not even remotely funny. It has never been cool to laugh at your own jokes anyway!



Undoubtedly I will receive answers containing lol's and lmao's and for the those people why don't you GFY!

I love being in the USA.  I love it's beauty.  I love it's freedom.  i often do not like some of the government regulations and policies.



I think other countries have better health care, better civil rights for gays and lesbians, less restrictive regulations about personal matters, better employment policies such as a long vacation.



Also, I would prefer a more peaceful nation.  We seem to always be fighting with someplace.

well, i guess it depends on the person. if that perticular person did great things when they were alive, and helped many people, when theyre gone, people will notice the change in their world and start to realize how valuable and loved that person is.

1)They are conceited.
2)They believe that only their values and beliefs matter and anyone else's is crap and cheap. To each their own people! You will find it that the less you try to impose your values into someone else, the less conflicts you will have.
3)They believe that other people's values are offending them and that they should be corrected (this goes with #2, just adding more detail).
4)They are jealous or something
5)They are on acid. No one should  be imposing anything on anyone. It just doesn't work.

What do you think of interracial relationships?



I am curious what people think of this subject. I was raised with the beliefs that you stick to your own race & I have. I am white & my husband is white & our daughter is white & I will pass on the same beliefs to her. I would be very very upset if she ever dated or married out side of her own race. To be honest, and this is NOT to offend anyone, just my personal opinion, I don't like seeing interracial couples, especially black & white. I also hate it when they have kids as I feel they come out very homely (Most of the time). I think that black couples look good together & they normally have great looking kids but when they mix to me it just doesn't look good, they don't match, it looks odd. Again this is not to sound racist, sorry if it offends you. How do you feel when you see an interracial couple? PS: I would never ever be rude or disrespectful to anyone just because of their race, this is strictly based on looks that I am speaking about, although there are many cultural differences in many races.

Sorry but not all kids are beautiful. I have seen plenty of ugly ones and most were mixed.

I think interracial relationships are ok.I am not in one my self but my oppinion is that it does not matter what colour your skin is or where you are from as long as you love each other and it certainly does not matter if you look good as a couple or not as its whats inside that counts not the outside.

I personally don't see the problem.  I'm a black woman and with the exception of my ex, I've only dated white men.  It's not that I don't like black men, I've just always been attracted to white men.  I've met plenty of white men who treat me with respect and act like they have sense.  So what if their skin color is different than mine.



As far as looks go,  I think that's a shallow reason to dislike interracial couples. Sorry, to sound like I'm bashing you, but I think it's true.  If two "ugly" people were together, would that be wrong?  I also disagree with the "homely" children comment.  I believe that most interracial children, especially those who have one black and one white parent, are beautiful.  ALL children are beautiful.



I would never impose such rules on my children.  It would be next to impossible to raise my children that way while explaining to them that it's not a racist view.  Just because you say it isn't, doesn't mean it isn't.  If you single someone out or exclude them in any way because of skin color, that's racist.  Plain and simple.  It doesn't mean you're going to go throw on your robe and burn crosses on peoples' lawns, but it's racist all the same.

I have seen many interracial couples and seen their children. In my opinion their children are so beautiful and have beautiful skin color.



But i will add to what you said and say that it seems 85% of the time i see black men with really trashy , foul mouthed white women. I also am not racist. I have dated interracially before, but of course i am in the 15% that arent trashy & nasty. Just an observation.
But as to passing it on to my children...i will tell them to look for all beauty, in & out. Our Children should be able to choose who they want to be with, after all....didnt we date & marry who we chose?

My family has spent many years in the military, all the male members but one served and some family members even retired from the military. I can tell you that while in service, we never knew the whys or what-fors of war. The conclusion that I have arrived at is this: Nobody really knows. It could have started by accident, it could have started by disagreement, it could have started because one country invaded and accused  another country of having something they did not have. I personally believe it is all about power and money. No one is really happy with the amount of power they have so they want more... and are willing to do anything they have to do just to get a little more.



So in a nut shell.... I do not think that we the common people will ever know the truth behind war.

Whom do you live for?



my brother told me i only live for myself.
i want to study abroad, i went (here i am)
i only went home for a week after a year, and the first next vacation i have, i'd rather do an internship than go home again.



i think he's right.
and i don't think that's wrong what i do.
i've always lived to fulfill other's expectation on me back at "home"
that's why i find my destiny abroad.



where i could actually be myself.
without having to fit in just to satisfy what "my society" expect of me.



whom do you live for?

There is a fine balance when dealing with self achievement and family obligations. Especially when you are so young. When I was 23 (I am 40 now) I had no problem blowing off family "things" to follow my dreams and my desires. On one hand i love that I did what I wanted to do but on the other I feel some regret that I missed out on some family "things" as well.



There is nothing wrong for living for yourself, BUT... if your family is important too, then you want to find a balance so you do not have regrets in the end.



Trust me, the last thing you want is to say the sentence " I love that I traveled abroad and love that I followed my dream, but i regret...



In the end, you have to do what you feel you need to do, just think about the entire picture... not just the short term.



Me, at this point in my life I live for my mother who has Alzheimer's Disease, I live for my three rescue dogs who were severely beaten and abused and I live for me. I did college, and grad school and military and I now have a small business I try to run from home and care for my family. Would I do things differently? I am not sure...

One of the reasons that men should put the toilet down is to keep women in the home from falling into the toilet. Women go to the restroom more times a day then men. Men might ask why a woman would fall into the toilet. First, we usually leave the bathroom light off so that it does not wake you in the middle of the night. Aren't we nice? So, we stumble into the bathroom and go through the whole undressing bit. We just sit on the toilet without looking because we are half asleep and not really wanting to wake up more. Then there you have it! Men leave the seat up and we fall in.

well i don't think it's just about needing it to go to the bathroom..a toilet seat has the capability to go down and when it is up..it just doesn't feel right..you wouldn't leave the cabinet doors open, would you?



well maybe you would..but you shouldn't..it just isn't right..they're meant to be closed when not used

because we don't sprey the whole thing. we just sit down and do our business. It looks cleaner if the toilet seat is down. Because even with the toliet lid lifted, men always somehow manage to still sprey the whole thing. Who wants to look at a urine stained back of the lid anyway. Plus it helps to keep us from falling in if the seat is down.

You can't give such generalising traits to any nationality even if the traits were possitive. The percentage of classy vs unclassy in a community is probably the same worldwide.

If Obama has his way, as a teacher you will receive more pay, and more resources to better do your job. Teachers have the most important job there is, as they are shaping the great minds of tomorrow. Good luck.

What race do you identify with? If it's both, then say you are mixed. If not, then say, "black" or "white". It's who you believe you are inside, not the other way around. It doesn't matter that much anyway, because this is America!

Why should anyone have to claim any race ?  People are what they are. In a few more generation of intermarriage there won't be distinct races - just "tan" so why continue this dichotomy.  So if the form asks, "Race?" you just say, "None of your damn3d business".

You are neither because nobody considered you would suffer for their choices! I am not being mean, it is true. You should not have to wonder that, it was not fair of your parents. You get to say you are the minority and receive all of the benefits the rest of us do not but have to live with not knowing what you are.  I am not a racist, I just think it is important to know your heritage and when they are mixed you lose yours and your history because you are Truly not either.

Do you think that Tiger Woods is ashamed of his African American heritage?



I know that Tiger Woods is multiracial. But he also has African American heritage. He told a reporter that he was not black but he is "one-quarter Black, one-quarter Thai, one-quarter Chinese, one-eighth American Indian and one-eighth White"



Wouldn't it have been better if Tiger Woods said he was not only black but Asian, white etc as well. Or wouldn't it be better if he said I am white, black, Asian etc. If people called Tiger Woods Asian do you think he would  have stated he was not Asian? I personally don't think that Tiger Woods would have ever married an African American woman. What do you think? Do you believe he is ashamed of his African American heritage?

Does anyone else feel the grief today?



I woke to find my worst nightmare had come true. Our country died last night.  I Truly feel like someone died.  Of course that may just be because our country died and all of our lives are in danger. It will be very soon when the war is HERE in our country.  Do people not understand that someone with no emergency management skills or experience can not protect us?! The threats were already made and I have no doubt our enemies will be attacking as soon as he is put into office!  Not to mention that white people are the minority because we do not start having kids as soon as our bodies allow at 10-12 years of age! We are responsible so we are out numbered.  I do not want to be a part of this anymore, my country is gone! God help our children!



</question>



<additional details>



I never thought I would say it but I would like to see the civil war again, maybe the south could fix this, we certainly would not be in danger of our lives and our futures if they did!



What are you people not getting? Our country was attacked, what should we have done, let them just keep striking? The president protected us all by putting the war in their country not this one! Where do you get the rich boss thing? Excuse me but unless you are black or from a different country you do not get help here or jobs? The laws making them hire minorities are keeping white people from getting jobs or having money! The discrimination is to the white person not the black!

I am so sick of people saying that Bush ruined this country. It was ruined LONG before he came into office, by his father and that nasty boy Clinton.



As far as the civil war, if it would of happened, it would of already happened. Black people make up only 12 % of the population and if you seen Obama at his rallies there are more white people than black people. Also, Obama is only 16 % black.



What gets me is, that my husband and I work our butt off so one day we will be able to get a dream home and a wonderful house in a good neighborhood for our children and us, and you have these low-life welfare hounds that live in brand new town homes that they did nothing to earn....NOTHING!!!!! That is what pisses me off. We shall see what happens in the next year. Who knows it could all work out in the end.

You need to get to the audition and give it your all.  Don't worry about everyone laughing at you - you are  really good at impressions and therefore deserve to be on the stage.  Entertaining us.  Please don't give up.



Where would Michelle McManus be today if she hadn't gone to the Pop Idol audition.  And Steve Brookstein - what would he be doing now if he hadn't turned up for the X Factor audition.  Take a leaf out of their books - audition, audition and audition your heart out.



ghm: it's no big deal getting an audition, anyone with a dancing dog can get one. It's talent we're talking about here - and this impressionist obviously has it.

If you feel that you're really good, it will be nice to get the support of family and friends before you go on the show. If you truly have faith in your talent, then go on the show and do your best. If you don't get through, then you can hold your head up high and say that you gave it a try. Try not to have any regrets in life. Good luck.

I personally would let them all get on with it, and i wouldn't tell them anything else regarding your audition don't let them put you off some of them could be a bit jealous others are just ignorant, if you think you have a talent then go for it good luck to you.

Being an impressionist is hardly serious and I don't understand why you are upset.  Of course you should go to the audition - you are just being overly sensitive.  This is a great opportunity for you - don't blow it because you can't handle a few laughs and jokes.  You have to toughen up a bit and stop being such a wimp.  Don't feel down - feel excited. Ignore everyone - stay focussed on your goal and good luck.

You shouldn't have told them at work until afterwards -- when you could announce your success. Many performing artists are sensitive and vulnerable and you just have to develop a thicker skin. When they laugh and joke, just shrug and ignore it. They are probably envious.



If it continues, perhaps you could drop hints that you are studying them closely for material for your performance. Maybe that will shut them up!

Ignore all the doubts and negativity.



It is your life and you dream so don't let others determine the outcome



Be thick skinned and go after you talent, so many people have wasted opportunities and regretted it.



Good luck with your audition and smile x

Maybe that is because you notice b--------s more than the nice ones. Teenage girls can be inwardly nervous and that can be perceived as being stuck up. As  teenagers, girls tend to be conscious of what others think. If you are good, but don't put up with s----t than all should be well and you will attract the right kind of women:)

You can EXTEND you question, for a longer period of days.



But sometimes no one answers the question.



There are lots of questions asked...... sometimes you've just got to get lucky that someone will answer it.

Am I wasting precious time? ?



I'm 22 already - trying to find a new job because I work at a restaurant and feel I could be doing something a little better. Just changed majors in school, so I probably have another two years left. My two best friends live in San Diego, so I don't go out much. I haven't had a serious boyfriend in 2 years. I haven't been dating because I went through depression and low- self-esteem. I'm working on making myself look better......but am I wasting time? Should I be going out and meeting people and putting back together a social life?

Your generation isn't dumb. It's just sick of the Republicans' turn for the worse, so the majority voted for the Democrats... for change... That doesn't sound so dumb to me.

What is the dance I always see black people doing?



I've seen it in a lot of movies, I saw it after the obama election stuff last night, I've seen them do it on tyler perry's house of payne, I've seen it on night at the apollo at the end, a bunch of places.



Young people and old people do it.  It sorta looks like square dancing.  They do quarter turns and jump from time to time.  What is that dance, where did it come from, and what is the significance of it?  How is it that almost all black people know it?

If I'm not home for a UPS package, will they leave it on the door step? ?



I can't be home tomorrow to receive a package that's supposed to come, it's fairly small and I know from previous experience that they'll sometimes leave it on the doorstep, otherwise they leave a note for you to come pick it up. How do I know which they will do?

depends on the item.  Usually expensive items such as computers need a sig.  If you are just getting shoes or something they will leave it at the door.

You can talk to your neighbor/s and ask them to hold the package for you so you know it's safe (if you trust them, that is).
Otherwise it might end up sitting there in the open for any curious passerby to tamper with.



Call UPS and tell them you want it left with your neighbor, or write a note on your door so they know.

With the advancements in transportation, there is no race on earth that is not represented in Asia...



BTW... Asia is HUGE!!!! You would be better off asking for the racial diversity in a specific area...



Asking about "Asia" is like asking about "South America" or "Europe".

I'm from the UK, you guys are amazing! I was watching the president election on tv last night till 6am in the morning! (I got my result) and I was speechless. At the end of the election a couple UK reporters were saying how this will be a good change for the UK too, as Gordan Brown (UK Prime minister) will be invited to come speak with Obama. All I can say is that our Prime minister (your president) he's not even in the same league as Obama. I wish I lived in America!

Chicago is my advice...



But I'm from here so I'm biased! LOL!



I have lived in many places across the US and of them all... I like Chicago the most.



Tucson Arizona is a good 2nd though... Decent economy, a VERY interesting mix of characters...



But Chicago beats the rest of the country hands down.



We have the Big City life style but with a laid-back Midwest Attitude that keeps everything from getting so stressful that you end up with New York.

Well..."America" is quite large, as it encompasses the entire Continent from ALASKA in  north western NORTH AMERICA to PATAGONIA on the tip of south eastern  SOUTH AMERICA. If however, you are referring to the United States of America, then I would suggest the pacific northwest. Southeastern Alaska,western Washington State, and western Oregon being the best geographical choices !  I'm not sure where you are in the UK, but these regions pretty much have everything and more that the UK has to offer....with the exception of your royal family of course! The summers are far more agreeable as well.

What is it with almost/half naked girls in ads?



All the time I'm seeing these girls dressed in barely there clothing posing for bands and ads....stuff like that.  I simply dont get it, yes i realize that sex sells; but does it really have to go as far as having one girl starting to get sexual with another?  Does this mean I have to take pictures in barely there clothing for guys to take interest in me?  Cause I'm not that type of girl. It doesnt help when someone you have romantic feelings for is promoting/working on the shoot.  Should I worry about him and the models?



Sorry for ranting, its been on my mind for awhile and I just need answers.

If half naked girls in advertising bother you - contact the company that is using them in their ads and tell them how you feel.  I don't know what to tell you about your love interest.



In general, guys hanging around half naked girls can be tempted by them.

you just need to decide how far you want to go and what kind of model you want to be.  My wife models, but she won't ever go topless, her choice...which is awesome to me.  you said it, sex sells.  I wouldn't worry about your boyfriend though.  If you have to worry about the security of a relationship, then it's already not too secure.  hope this helps

Tell him you're uncomfortable with it. Thoes girls just want attention, and what better way to do it then in advertising? Boys drool over that stuff.. A mature man won't want you to take pictures in barley there clothing.. unless it was just for him, but if you don't want to he should respect that.

Biracial celebrities?



I think that biracial persons including biracial celebrities sometimes identify themselves as being of one race instead of identifying with both of their racial heritage because of the backlash and pressure that they would get from persons in the general public. What do you think? Do you agree or disagree? I think that whether a person is biracial, multiracial etc that they should accept all parts of their heritage and they should not prefer one heritage or race over the other. They should embrace fully their two heritages equally. After all no matter what heritage someone has every person is equal. No one is above another. No race or heritage is superior. All races and all heritages are equal. All people are equal.

I think it's easier for people to say they are just one race, especially if they look like that race more. I don't believe it is fear of backlash. It could also be that the person identifies with one race easier than other because of friends, etc.
Or even a person who was only raised with one parent may identify with what that parent is.

Change has come to the African-American stereotype? among blacks?



On tv a man told a reporter that for less fortunate blacks this election takes away the excuse that they 'don't stand a chance'. &lt;I think it was in reference to having a good education, being safe and prosperous&gt;
I know, Obama is not an inner city success story  &lt;raised in Hawaii?&gt; but I wonder what others think of this statement, especially the African-American community.

From today on I will be carrying a picture of Obama with me at all times...



The next time I have to face down a scum-bag begger, I will flash the picture and tell him to get off his butt and get a job.



A few days ago, my father was driving back to our yard when he saw the 'guy in a wheelchair' that begs in the area of Damen Avenue and Madison WALKING DOWN THE STREET pushing his wheelchair because he put his stuff on the seat of the chair...



There are TWO guys in wheelchairs that tend to beg on that corner and neither of them are actually disabled. They are scam artists.



They beg out by the liquor store where the drug dealers stand...



Right up the block from Damen and Warren where the crack-whore works...



(I have given you the Cross Streets... I have given you details... Come on down to United Center and check it out for yourself... It can't be racist when I can stand there beside you and POINT THE PEOPLE OUT!)



Here in Chicago... We are inundated with people like this...



And to this day there are still protests that it isn't their own fault, it is the white man that 'did this' to them.



Now they have no more excuses.



Unless they want to start to scream that Obama isn't "Really Black" and kick him out of the fold that is.



Affirmative Action should be abolished...
Public Housing and Welfare should have their standards tightened...



And the next time I see a preacher standing in front of City Hall screaming about the White Man... I will be sure to bring a bigass picture of Obama to drive home the point that you CAN do anything if you get off you butt and TRY!



It is time to grow up black people...



No more excuses...

NOT TRUE.White men loves Asian women.Because we don't have the attitude white women have.Not because we're easy to be pushed around.We just have more moral values and modesty.We preserve our honor and dignity more.It's not true about marrying white for their money.Mostly because we think white men are alot good-loooking but very poor in moral values.And secondly,it's backwards to say that because most Asians that are exposed to white race are of higher-income families.And most Asian countries are thriving too..especially Singapore Japan Korea Malaysia China Taiwan Brunei

That's a tough one. Women have done so much and contributed every bit as much as men have. I'm stuck for an answer.
I know that it is a cultural thing, and that over the centuries, "traditionally" accepted places for each gender varied. Yup, I'm stuck. Good luck with this one.

Hmm difficult, you could think about the general break down in moral fabric of Society, the family unit being stronger when women stayed at home providing a strong and constant influence on the children. How marriages worked better when roles were traditionally defined....Not that I necessarily agree with the above but it is a common argument!

<answer>



I don't think too many men hold these views in this day and age. But it is increasingly common for men to feel that they are the victims of inequality. Here in Britain many aspects of law favour women at the expense of men :



- women can get a court injunction against a man without any evidence; her word is enough.



- men in England only win 1% of child custody cases.



- where a man reports being assaulted by his partner, he is likely to be the one who gets arrested in 40% of cases, despite being the victim.



- the UK government spends £60m per year on women's refuges, and not a penny on men's.



- a man is two and a half times as likely to be jailed than a woman, for exactly the same crime.
- a woman is twice as likely to be given a discharge (conviction without punishment) than a man for exactly the same crime.



- widows get a pension from the state. Widowers do not.
- men get fleeced in divorce cases, and often lose their home.
- men get fleeced by the Child Support Agency. Over 90% of those who it targets are men. It unfairly apportions blame for a failed relationship, and puts that blame squarely on the man in almost every instance, and indirectly punishes any new family he may have, and fails to address the problem of how the money is spent. Courts used to make far more realistic and fair Child Support orders.



Men are finding now that institutionalised feminism is in practice institutionalised misandry. Harriet Harman, the Minister for Women and "Equality" (?) even wants to give women accused of murder a legal defence that her male victim had the potential to be violent at some point in the future, which would make it okay for her to kill a man as he sleeps! You couldn't make it up!



Edit - just a thought to add. If there is a feeling that people hold those views (ie men) then it is women's fault. Women understandably generally spend more time with the children on average. Therefore women get to have more influence on their children. So if children are being raised with sexist views based on gender stereotypes, then it must be mostly the fault of women themselves. Why did they not do more to educate their sons and daughters, and show them that men and women are equal, and that women can have careers?

NOTE- I am a woman, I don't believe these statements, just answering the question.



If you look on this in a historic view the reasons were dumb, but here are some for you.



1)Women tend to over react. Their "female organs" can cause them to think irrationally. That was a big one at one time. I don't know why have a uterus should have anything to do with this, but it has in the past.



2)Women didn't get out of the house. They cooked, cleaned and watched kids. They didn't get out to socialize at the local watering hole, so how could they know what was going on past their front door?



So basically, if you have a uterus and don't leave the house, what other rights do you need? You should be happy with the men in your life telling you how the world works. You should not want anything more than your happy little family. Once women get involved it changes things and men don't like change.

The language of philosophy is male...the truth, the purpose, the intelligence of men, these ideas and meta narratives discussing all major topics important in life were at their height in the 18th century...the Age of Enlightenment. These were times when women were not considered people in their own right, and hardly able to think about such weighty subjects!
Just rely on age old sexist ideas about women not being able to rise to the challenge of being worthy of such rights as men.



And although it is fine for the status quo to remain, men are seen as dominant and do not want their privilege to be eroded, women are told they are agitating for too many rights and may have a negative impact on men.  It is not seen as a problem the other way round! Anyway, enjoy good luck!

What does someone need to do to be a mentor?



My boss and I don't have much of a relationship, but he wants to build a mentoring relationship with me. He wants to know what I need from him in order for him to be effecitve in this manner.



All I can think of is conversation and helping to find out my goals in my career. The thing is, my boss is very quiet and reserved. So when he tries to talk about those things, it just seems really forced.



Any ideas about how else he can strive to be my mentor that won't make it all feel so force with the 'conversation' piece?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Firstly your boss shouldn't really be your mentor. Part of a mentors role is to allow you to talk to you openly about your job and any difficulties you  are having then approach your boss for you and discuss ways forward that work for you and the company. However having said this it could still work. Being a mentor is about sharing experiences, having an 'open door' policy and helping you to identify realistic goals and empowering you to achieve them. A good mentoring relationship develops when you have common ground with your mentor and you respect their achievements and successes and they are motivated and able to help you succeed in your own right.

Women: Do you feel sympathy for this man?



In an incident that happened several decades ago, a man, who had a history since adolescence of molesting, raping, and torturing little girls, was the focus of revenge by two sisters, one of whom had a 5 year old daughter who was repeatedly raped and tortured by the man.
In addition to other acts, the women covered his erect penis with honey or cheese or something, and his penis was then inserted into a cage of hungry rats. The rats then proceeded to slowly eat the man's penis.



The man castrated himself sometime later, probably due to sexual frustration. He was then put into a mental institution where he spent the rest of his life.



Now, I don't for a second condone vigilante justice, nor do I think that such barbaric methods be incorporated into any justice system.



I simply want to know what other women think. Is this a fitting punishment for a man who raped and tortured several little girls?

I think what he did was wrong, but the punishment is a little severe. Maybe a couple of years in prison or maybe more, and then do some probation time. I honestly dont think that he should have to spend the rest of his life in a mental hospital. I have been to a mental hospital. They are not fun what so ever. The rules are very strict. And you have to talk to someone at least once a day. Then participate in group thearpy and talk about why you are there. I would def. say a good time in jail and a probation time and then rehab or a therapist some one he can talk to. Hope this helped you.

I suppose the question is if he was really a victim of mental illness (he must have been determined to be crazy to be put in an asylum) or whether he was purely evil. Maybe there is no such thing as pure evil--perhaps a person has to be crazy to do such horrible things.



I understand the anger and desire for revenge by the women. As a mother, I would have wanted revenge too, if someone had done that to my daughter. Karmically speaking, I would say yes, his punishment was fitting.

Because women want to control men and they are mad that they missed you as a control subject. Also if you had tons of money they wouldn't be making fun of you. They "do" that because they have an inferiority complex so they strike out at you,but comfort their own sex for doing the same thing.

To the new college: Believe or not, many schools are still segregated. This is not a complete fault of racism (though it is in part) : Blacks and whites are still separated into two separate group. The Magnet school in the city have mostly black students. In turn, town school have a mostly white student. We are trying all we can to prevent racism, but sometimes it happens when we can't control it. Though no, I would disagree if you opened an all-white college. Blacks should have a choice in they want to go.
To the light-skinned people "club": No, I disagree. Though I notice many, many groups are made up of mostly black or white people, I would work as hard as I could to give blacks the choice to join it.
Huge deal about the president: Why not? They're making a big deal about Barack Obama, so in turn we should be able to celebrate John McCain.
Whole month out of the calender for whites: This question is a draw because blacks have an entire month in the calender to celebrate (or something around there.)

What is unusual about what you have outlined? This has reflected society for such a long time...with several add ons....all male white education establishments, all male white parliament and as for historical achievements, art, science, all white male..or they would have us believe! This is not a clever observation, it detracts form the efforts of black people and women to actualise, to highlight their abilities.

What does this say about our society?



I have been having trouble with women. A buddy of mine brought to my attention has mentioned that it is all about being an Alpha male. I looked up what an alpha male was and found that it was the dominate male in a group of males who is usually has the best physical prowess and gets first pick when it comes to women. They said the men around this alpha male are called beta males and they only get whats left over because they are quiet, reserved and Intelligent and are not aggressive like the Alpha males.



I definitely am a beta male, Now before you say well your boring, I would like to ask since when is being reserved, quietly confident, charming, funny and respectful now is considered "boring". What kind of a society do we live in that being a respectful person makes you a wimp and being brash, disrespectful, crude and in your face a cool person to be around?



How *** backwards is this logic? also why do women like guys who treat them like this? do they really have no self respect and little self esteem that they would allow someone to completely disrespect them in hopes of "changing" him. What a load of crap. I guess i am old fashioned when it comes to dealing with people socially, because what i am seeing is appalling. it seems to be the norm to completely disrespect people for them To like you and when you are being respectful you are called a wimp. wow .

There are age and cultural issues in your questions.  Hard to give you a generalized answer without knowing more.  But, there are lots of women that don't prefer the so-called alpha male type.  Since your friend called you one, he probably was confused about the term, or else, others see you differently than you see your self in group situations.  You need to figure all of this out.

All relationships are different. My first husband was an "Alpha" male and the marriage didn't work out. My boyfriend whom I've been with for 7 years is a "Beta" male.  He has a quiet strength about him, and I feel a certain peacefulness with him I didn't have with my ex. No, the "passion" isn't there but life isn't all about that...that fades eventually, but being able to have someone whom you really connect is much better.



Don't worry...the right woman will come along. The one who will appreciate you for YOU!

These locker room type men that you describe generally don't go over well with women, none that I know of. Typically I find them inept & socially unacceptable. Women that are well within themselves, don't tend to bother with men seeking negative attention. Alpha or Beta, respect & sincerity seems to draw genuine people together be it in peer relationships or otherwise. Maybe it's conditioning or maturity (or lack thereof ) that we find these "types". You sound fed up, I don't blame you. You certainly don't seem wimpish or boring. Stay true to yourself & kindred spirits follow

Forget about that dumb advice he gave you.....He is caught up in the hype and trying to get you involved in it.  "Alpha Male" is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.  If they are so "Alpha Maleish"  they wouldnt make themselves available to just anyone, more than likely they are so full of themselves and entertain just about anyone.  It's best to be who you are and enjoy it for what it is worth.  You have to remember that.....females like "alpha men" who will step on them, Women don't entertain that.  There is a big difference,  when someone doesn't know who they are---how can they know what they want or what is good for them in addition to what is actually good to begin with!  Women know this because one of the things that make them a Woman consist of being in the know.  An "alpha male" would never have an interest in a Woman he cannot deceive or manipulate her so whats the point.  He needs to always "be in control"  of what you might ask.  Nine times out of ten he doesn't even know cause he can't even control himself.  I applaud you for your individuality and the fact that you have realized how backwards people's logic and mindset is.

What could this dream mean?



In the dream:



I went to my old house in California, where there are now tenents. I was on my bridge that was outside of my house and called her (with her own phone which was sitting on the bridge) saying that "Hey I'm outside on the bridge, is it ok? Would you feel uncomfortable?" When she said no, It started raining hard. I put the phone down and started to Dance remembering my old times in elementry and with my parents. The streets were empty. Suddenly I missed this guy that I am in love with. (He stopped talking to me and started to ignore me for some reason that he never told me. The end of our friendship was mysterious.) Well, so again I pick up her phone and call him (in Texas). Somehow my Dad picks up the phone and says "hello" kinda like it was transferred somehow or something. It was the guy's number though. Anyways So i talk a little and hang up.. I was really sad and crying. When the neighbour came out with her daughter she was kind of consoling me. I was like "there isnt anyone anymore that I can share my childhood with anymore." When I started to leave, this good looking guy (that i have always felt a "brotherly bond" to. He's on a tv show) grabbed my hand with a smileand said "LET'S GO!! YOU CAN SHOW ME!!" Well then I wa happy again and it felt like he was really close to me. We went through the playground and I told him my struggles and everything. He was actually listening to me. So when we got there there were students playing around on the fields, and teachers for some reason were out there with tables out and they were preparing something. Well I went up to a lady and asked her if it was ok if I took him to tour the school.. She said ok. I asked her if there were any teachers and she said no. I named a few and she said ya maybe. well I asked her about my pre-k teacher and she said "this is her" pointing at the lady on the wall. That teacher looked SOO different. She dyed her hair. I didnt think she'd recognise me but she hugged me saying "thanks for meeting me" and she gave me her email address.. What could this mean?

Basically, it makes kids feel cool or like they're not conforming to society when really all they're doing is following all the rules set down by the man... and their mommies.



it's a "personal choice" made popular.



I'm not bashing anyone who doesn't do drugs/have sex/drink alcohol... I'm just saying the whole "straightedge" idea is so stupid because most of the "hardcore" kids who claim to be straightedge also claim to be "different" and somewhat rebellious (because of their obvious choice in attention deprived music) when in actuality they're right where society wants them.



Source(s):



I used to work in an all ages music venue in New Orleans. I saw these kids just about every night. I've gotten to know some of them and they're all blinded to the fact that they're mindlessly marching in the "politically correct" direction when they "represent" originality.

Drink lots of water to flush out your system. Every drink that you've had, it takes 1 hour for your  body to remove. 1 1/2oz hard liquor, 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine is 1 drink. Postpone your test if you have to.

No. Alcohol can remain in your system for quite a while. It's in the bloodstream, too, remember?

Last night was just another night among many.  The President of the U.S. is a figure head position the same as the Queen of England.  The President himself (or herself) has no actual power to do anything he (or she) promises on the campaign trail.  CONGRESS runs the country and SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS run congress.



All you McCain-ites and Obama-ites are truly naive if you think it matters one whit who is President.  The only way a particular party's agenda goes forward is if they control congress.  Right now we have a democratic congress so expect to see change on the horizon because of a democratic congress - not because of a democratic President.



As for everyone who made this election an issue of color, would you have voted for McCain if he'd been black and Obama had been white?  I think it's terrific that a black man can be President the same as a white one, a Hispanic one or a "Whatever" one, but find it hard to believe that anyone would vote for the President of one of the most powerful countries in the world on the basis of race rather than confidence in the person's credentials and track record.

Why do people think that being a muslim makes you a terrorist?



On the news, there are lots of white people killing others for no reason but do we say "White people are killers" no we don't.



If few muslims are the same as few white people being violent, why make a name tag for all the muslims?



People say muslims are anti-Chris, WRONG because muslim people do believe in jesus but don't believe him as God's son. Muslims believe jesus as a prophet. God created all of the people and that's what muslim people do believe.

Before you judge me, please, let me say I don't hate Muslims. The reason why most people think a Muslim is a terrorist is because of 9/11, the media, and constant threats. Sure enough, I know many Muslims that aren't terrorists, but because of the war, the media is focusing on the Muslims in a negative light. That's why a lot of ignorant people feared Obama because they thought he was Arab. Because we're enemy of a nation that basically follows Islam, they believe Islam is trying to destroy our country.

In my opinion, I wouldn't take the blame for anyone else at all because if I EVER had to get in trouble, it would be because my own foolish mistakes. Also, if that person was a friend, they wouldn't let me take the blame in the first place. Actually, it's up to you to decide, but I personally wouldn't get in trouble for someone else. Sure enough, if the person isn't committing murder or rape or anything, I don't care about what he's doing, but if I get blamed, then I have to defend myself.

Why are so many people calling Barack Obama "black"...?



... when he is, in fact, mixed race.



Are the individuals who do it blind, or just plain stupid?



Have they forgotten that his mother was as white as his father was black, or is it something they need to ignore in their haste to espouse painfully racist propaganda?



I'm just grateful that Obama himself seems to stand beyond the petty racial issues that seem to mean so much to the idiot racist factions of both black and white America.



But how long will it be before the rest of the world catches on and gets over their racial hangups?

What's wrong with saying he's Black? He IS Black. He is also White. One not need to qualify the statement with a percentage for it to be true.



I agree that the senator is handling the race issue with much more grace than many Americans. It's a shame that we're still not quite over race, yet nobody said it was going to be an easy and quick process.



Problem is we still have a fragmented society, very few places are truly "integrated".



Here in the SF Bay Area (CA) racism is practically a non-issue because for the most part one can find representation of just about any race in any city (though there are of course certain districts within cities that have ethnic majorities).



Most of the US is far from this ideal. We still have entire cities that are either/or Black or White, and until we see a more even integration I'm afraid racism will still be present.

It is an important milestone in American history that he is "black".

Does it even matter whether they call him Black or mixed-race regardless? It doesn't change the fact that he's going to be our president in January 20th, 2009. In fact, people call him Black because he prefers it and because his other race is Black, he can say it if he pleases. Why not call him Black? I mean, if you haven't noticed, a majority of African-Americans in the US are mixed with some sort of Native America, but no one cares or call them mixed-race, do they? No. I mean, seriously, if you didn't know Obama, and you saw him on the street, what race would you assume him to be? Malcolm X was of mixed-race, but no one ever says he was mixed race.  Also, a person, whether Black or mixed, still made history on 11-4-08. Chances are, people in this country would have never accepted even a mixed-race person for president, but things changed. Barack Obama appears to be more Black, and that's who he represents himself, so therefore, he's a Black man.

Ya it is pretty sad, but I see it mostly in other blacks that make a big deal of it.  They are talking about how they want a black president, there needs to be a black president, blah blah.  So I believe its just the other blacks that are making this a bigger issue then needed.  Why can't it just be about the best man for the job?  Shouldn't just vote for someone because they are black.  If whites did that, McCain would have won in a landslide.  The race issue is kept alive by the blacks.  I could careless if Obama is black/white.  I voted for him because I think he is the best man for the job.

The history of American racial identity for people of any African descent has included the "one drop rule", where the law in colonial times designated anyone with "one drop of black blood" as black to maintain the "purity" of the white race.  We have moved far beyond this history of ignorance but in many corners, it still prevails.

Most people oppose gay marriage.
There have been homosexuals for over a thousand years, but such relationships have never been considered a marriage.



It used to be punished by execution, but George Washington advocated limiting the punishment to castration.

I think the laws in place are fairly decent at this time.
If it is rape of a minor there should be mandatory jail time and life long registration on the sex offenders registry.
If it is rape of an adult there should still be mandatory jail time, but perhaps not as long.
I love the sex offenders registry and the fact that it is available to the public.

The man should get the same punishment he should be turned naked n make him run around the city n broadcast him live so that he can feel the same feeling as he did to the victim. And to make money penalise him high. Stil insufficient then lock him up for entire life or hang him till death, coz rape is worse than murder the girl loses her living life n becomes a statue don't know whether she even think or not! She is then seen with cruel eyes n noone wants to marry her n her life is ruined.

Harsh laws, a rapist currently gets a lesser jail sentence then drug offenders. I'm sorry but selling weed is not even on the same level as raping someone, rape should carry a mandatory sentence to prison, among the general population, most jails have special places for rape prisoners because they are usually the first to be targeted by other prisoners, I say throw them to the wolves, let them be raped. I know a friend that has been raped and her mental torment of having to see her rapist out and about is appalling.

I'm biased of course (see below) but I think there should definitely be harsher punishments for rapists - i.e. much longer jail time, and higher conviction rates. The rate of conviction in the UK is under 6% which is pathetic!



@ Akhil C: I know you have good intentions but I just wanted to say that rape doesn't necessarily ruin a person's life and ability to think - I was raped 3 years ago and I'm definitely not a statue :D In fact from the last I've heard, my life is a million times better than his is. Mind you everyone reacts to it differently though.

As a rape survivor, I can't really be objective about this issue. In my mind I have invented many, many heinous & cruel punishments for these bastards, most of which would never be approved of by the general public.  I definitely believe a lonnnng prison sentence~at the very least 10 to 15 years, & more if it was a particularly violent rape or was warranted by other circumstances.  I also think they should have to "repay society" in some other way, something that might help them realize the reality of what they've done to another human being.  (Without having to expose them to other victims.)  I also think that they should have to pay for the victim's therapy, medical treatment including abortion costs, & any other costs incurred as a direct result.



Unless you've been through something like rape~especially a violent rape where the victim was in danger of losing their life, you can't imagine what you go through. It changes every aspect of your life, & becomes a part of it.  The world becomes a completely different place,



& you no longer enjoy the freedoms that you once took for granted. You become a prisoner in your own psychological hell.



Rape isn't "just" having sex with someone you really didn't want to have sex with.  It's about losing control over your own body. It's about fear. And living with the nightmare EVERY day for the rest of your life.  As far as I'm concerned, there IS no punishment strong enough. Nothing can give you back that part of your soul once someone has stolen it.
PS.  To the "You have to put it behind you etc." posters... don't. You don't know the situation, so don't assume you do.  Thanks.

stop referring to me as african american? No one in my family has seen africa since the 1600's!



I never see a white man with red hair and say" hey there's an irish american" or a women with blond hair and blue eyes as a swiss american and the odds are my ancestors were here centuries before theirs were. Black people are lucky if they can trace their roots back to a single country on the continent of africa but others in this country can still hold onto their origins from way back, practice back home traditions and even still speak in their native tongues, in MY country and be called straight americans but every time its someone who looks like me I automatically get a false suffix in front of my country of origin?

Keep up with the changes, we haven't been african americans since the 1970's and white people gave themselves the name white to signify that they were pure so don't give me that crap about whites being offended when referred to as "white". Its mighty funny no of other races say the word ni**er to a black persons face not only is it wrong but those labels are played out MLK is dead I'm BLACK and Proud.

it is so difficult for "white" people to know what to call people of your race. we are afraid of being deemed racist. in so many years it has changed so often that we are confused and scared.
some people of your race want to be called african american, others black, still others none of the above.
it is okay for us to be called "white" and we take no offense.

It's going to be a very long time, but what's so offensive about it? I mean, I don't know about you, but I like being called African-American because he shows that I have a real cultural background. It shows that our descendants are from Africa, but we're American because we were born here. It done the same way for other races such as Mexicans, and Asians. When other people call us African-American, they're not trying to offend, they're REFERRING to our race. I don't see a problem with it.

People (especially whites) sometimes try TOO hard to be PC.  "African American" sounds kinder than black when describing someone's appearance.  I for one have found out that if you are describing someone, "black" is acceptable and you really aren't berrated for using the wrong terminology.

In my experiences, it seems like only other blacks are emphasizing it so much.  "My president is black now" or "Screw you old white man, our president is a black man".  Like always its blacks keeping the race "conflict" alive.

Why do people care? I mean, it doesn't matter what his race is regardless, but he had has Black in his genes, and he has every right to refer to himself as Black. Most of his family are from Kenya, an African nation, and he identifies himself with his Black family more more often. Also, in my opinion, he looks more like a Black man than a White man, and therefore, I would never say he's White if I never knew him, and he was walking down my street.

I don't give a damn if he's white,black, or green. I voted for him because I felt he was the better man for the job. But they say once you have a drop of black blood in you, you're black.

I see a lot of white people asking this question, but it's really simple. White American racism has always defined who was white and who was black. If someone had black ancestry they were simply black in order to not just let anyone be classified as white. Whether fair or inaccurate it is something we all assume in terms of bi-racial people. Even if a bi-racial person identifies more with being white everyone else sees them as black.



I'm not saying Obama is black, but because of old traditions this is how it is now.  I don't care how much anyone is tired of hearing about it, whether anyone considers him half white, or fully black, this is a big deal, as it would be if a woman won.

I don't know but I suspect that those "white" people who make a point of calling him black are insecure and picking on a noticeable but irrelevant difference to belittle him.



I'm afraid I cannot remember who it was, but during the 1950's a famous conductor entered a "coloureds only" bar and when someone objected, he stated "I'm not white, I'm pink!" I think that is a great attitude.

I have been wondering the same. More so as ppl go to pains to state that they are not racist. If race doesnt matter why keep touting 'First Black/African American US president? Why not highlight his policies or ???
I think it may be simply because he is the first, and while he avoided his race as an issue during the entire campaign, he did mention the 106 yr old lady who has been there since slavery, so he definitely has the same sentiment.

Great question!  I don't think it's ever been done, but of course times are changing and I think that it could work, depending on whether or not the mother retains her maiden name.
If the mother takes the father's name, it won't work, since the child's last name would be his.  Traditionally, women have given their maiden names as middle names (my mother did that) but sometimes the last name may not fit.  The parents would have to work it out, because usually even when a mother keeps her own last name, the child takes the father's name.  It's confusing, there should be a way to do it, but there are a lot of factors to take into consideration.  I HAVE seen a couple of companies though, that were named "Jones and Daughters" (or whatever the name was) instead of "Sons" & that was nice to see!



EDIT:  You know, I don't think I really understood your question at first.  Your mom COULD put Susan Michelle Pharr II~ I suppose, but I think it would become part of her last name?  Not sure, but I think it goes like this:  Sam Jones has a son, so the son is "jr"  Then Sam Jones Jr. has a son, & HE would be Sam Jones II.  His son would be the III, etc.  I'm not positive about this, but I remember someone telling me that. So in that case, your mom could name her daughter "jr" (most forms have that option) but when Susan Jr. had a daughter, she wouldn't be able to name her the II, because she would have her husbands last name. (?)  LOL, very good question!

I need help on a hypothetical but very plausible life threatening situation that could happen to me?



Please don't laugh at me. I am not good at handling dangerous situations, and am lucky i have even survived this cruel world this long... LOL



But, here is the scenerio.



I live in an apartment and there are two locked doors i need to unlock to get into my apartment - an external one, and my own.  I also like to go for walks but live in a cold climate and winter is coming soon.



What if i go for a walk in winter and forget my keys? I would be locked outside, and when it gets dark, i could freeze to death.  The rental office closes at 6 pm and is not open at all on weekends.  Suppose i forget my cell phone too, which is likely because i almost never carry it. And since i forgot my keys, i couldn't go in my car and turn on the heater either.
Even if someone comes by and lets me into the first door, i would still be locked out and would have to sleep in the hallway.



How can i make sure this doesnt happen?  would i have to climb 40 feet up somehow and smash my way into my balcony door?

Can obama be a bigger black icon than michael jackson was?



i personally think that ,from all african americans of 20th and 21st century(from all fields)
nobody touched (in wordlwide status,i do not know for usa since i am not living there) the stardom of michael jackson (1983-1993)!
i believe in the history of 20th century few people period, (ainstain-elvis-beatles-maradona greatest soccer player ever-corbatsoev-kennedy) experienced the glory of Michael jackson!
so u believe wordlwide can obama be the most admired black(american,cause nelson mandela is top black person of 20th century period noone can doubt that) man ,accepted by all nations and races like Mj was??

Why is it that...........?



It never matters what the title is....women always seem to answer? This is just a hint to the ladies but sometimes other people truly don't care what you think, that is why they start their question with "All you guys out there" or "This one is for the Men" Bash me if you must but the truth is that it is Very Rare to see a Man answer a ladies only question but women ALWAYS answer the Men only questions.



IS this their fault or are they just programmed to know EVERYTHING?

<question>



I thought I had passed by a teacher at school. Was I offensive?  Please read below.?



I emailed a professor at my university and described to him, by email, what I thought he had looked like since I had to meet him in the lobby to go over a new program. I asked him if he was "older with somewhat of a belly". I didn't know how else to describe him, but was this way out of line?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I believe someone could get offended. I would recommend saying he's "like 40-50 with a little weight on him." That sounds better.

Does anybody oher than me truly think that people suck and that they REALLY should not ponder upon.....?

<answer>



If you mean why bother, that's a philosophical question.  I assume, since you are also "people," you believe you too suck.



The idea is to reduce your own suckiness enough to entertain the thoughts about the real nature of people. Then you can better understand them and so, better understand yourself.



Good luck.  It's more difficult than it sounds.  The greatest problem is to reduce your own suckiness enough to see anything.  Then wading through the world full of philosophical crap that's been vomited onto the earth from universities is real drudgery.



Try starting with social institutions.  I landed there after wading through most religious and political philosophies and not finding much.



Examining the institutions answered a lot.



I'll give you a hint.  If you take off all your clothes and look in a mirror you will see just one of the many species of animals here on this earth.  It acts just like the others but it plays somewhat sophisticated games to avoid admitting that.

Being annoyed is one thing, and yes you have every right to be, but taking action is something that needs to be done.



If it's a fancy dress party, a slutty nurse is hardly appropriate. Maybe you can help her pick out something sexy, yet classy to wear to the party.
She needs to realize she's a lady and if she wants to be treated with respect (and if YOU want to be treated with respect) she really needs to act like a lady with class.



Maybe she doesn't realize that you can be sexy without being slutty.



I suggest going shopping with her and telling her she can't go with you unless she wears something you both agree on. That way she can be sexy enough for her comfort, and classy enough for yours.



Plus, most girls don't know what guys REALLY find sexy and being slutty isn't something that guys find attractive, it's being feminine that counts.  Tell her to leave a little mystery.

1)  I owned a dog in 2007
2)  Actually two dogs adopted from animal shelters.



One dog is a pom-huahua (pomeranian and chihuahua) and the female is a long haired chihuahua.  We had dobermans before but after having to have one doberman put down for a bleeding disorder and our next doberman put down because she had liver cancer, we decided dog  ownership was too painful to continue ...



... and then we were touring a shelter one day and this tiny little red fur ball pushed his little paw through the bars of his cage and tried to touch me.  The rest is history and I am so thankful to have Kibbey and Tassi in my life.  I still miss Belle and Ruthie (our dobes), but I learned you still have room in your heart after loss.

Let's be honest. Is it time to stop saying african/americans?



I voted for Obama. So many people did. It's a monumental moment in history no doubt. Yet while watching analysis everyone is talking about african/american. I realize, Barak Obama is mixed-racial and "black", but let me ask. Are you tired of this "african" american business?? He is AMERICAN. I am AMERICAN. Let's push for this to be the main focus. Not his skin color. C'mon people, I'm curious. What do you think?? Aren't we placing too much emphasis on past cultures / where we came from, and less on future American culture and unity?

It shouldn't matter what you call a person. People call asians Asian-Americans, and dutch, Dutch-americans.



It doesn't matter what you call the person, it matters more how you treat the person, and as you have seen today the way america treats minorities is improving.

If we lived for a thousand years?



Imagine if our lifespan was a thousand years long. How different would society be? Products would have to last much much longer, homes would become places where multiple generations would grow up. How would power be managed in jobs? CEO's would be around for hundreds of years, would their be more dictatorships? What other areas of our life would be drastically different from what they are now?

Can obama be a bigger black icon than michael jackson was?



i personally think that ,from all african americans of 20th and 21st century(from all fields)
nobody touched (in wordlwide status,i do not know for usa since i am not living there) the stardom of michael jackson (1983-1993)!
i believe in the history of 20th century few people period, (ainstain-elvis-beatles-maradona greatest soccer player ever-corbatsoev-kennedy) experienced the glory of Michael jackson!
so u believe wordlwide can obama be the most admired black(american,cause nelson mandela is top black person of 20th century period noone can doubt that) man ,accepted by all nations and races like Mj was??



</question>



<additional details>



whoever is too young and did not live to experience the stardom of Mj in 1983-1993 era,better do not answer!



matilda i know that  but u know what picasso was a painter too and mozart but we all talk about them and know them even today,can u name me every president of england of 11th century??:)
obama will be lucky if he influence 5% of people that michael jackson did;)

Michael Jackson isn't a Black icon in my opinion because he changed his appearance to look White, kind of making other Black assume he doesn't want to be Black. Also, Michael Jackson isn't exactly known for being a Black icon to me, but rather a famous Black singer and dancer, while Obama is going to be the first Black president with intentions of helping everyone, no matter the race.

We are talking about two different arenas,



but to go along with your idea.
Sure he can.



There is always going to be someone bigger and better who comes along and takes over the throne so to speak.



Michael was great for a time,  but then he began to act in a questionable way and lost that honor in many people's eyes.



Only die hard fans are going to stick by MJ.



And in what way did MJ change the world?



Maybe the world of music and dance,  but in what other significant way?



Martin Luther King,  now he was a great man,  who did something significant,  positive to help make changes in the world,  and the legacy is still being carried on.



Where is MJ?



He is no longer respected and revered like he use to be.  he brought too much crap upon himself.



If Obama carries on in the way he has begun,  then yes I believe Obama is going to have a big impact upon this country and possibly the world,  and is going to be thought of and looked at in a positive light for a very long time.

Why is it that...........?



It never matters what the title is....women always seem to answer? This is just a hint to the ladies but sometimes other people truly don't care what you think, that is why they start their question with "All you guys out there" or "This one is for the Men" Bash me if you must but the truth is that it is Very Rare to see a Man answer a ladies only question but women ALWAYS answer the Men only questions.



IS this their fault or are they just programmed to know EVERYTHING?

Well, we answer because we have the freedom to. It doesn't say in the community guidelines that a specific gender had to be left out of a question, and chances are, no matter what the question is, it can be answered by a woman. That's why I answer by saying, "Well, I'm no guy, but . . . . blah, blah, blah."

Women are emotion before intellect, and emotions leads to curiosity, and that leads to discoveries, answers and intelligence.
Men don't really care about too much that's not directly affecting them until they start reaching out to their feminine side.
So how far are you now? That's the curiosity in me, not trying to be offensive.

I haven't been angry but I have been upset.  I got out of bed, went dizzy, and fell down, about 6am, which at 37 weeks pregnant is not fun!  It's because I have low blood pressure at the moment and it just makes me very dizzy.  I felt rather silly afterwards and brought back to me just how out of it i am at the moment and am likely to be until I have this baby!  Other than that, my husband stayed home from work to do the school run for our 4 year old daughter and to keep an eye on me so after the initial incident i was pretty much pampered!

I seem to get angry about everything at the moment.  I seem to just be a kettle waiting to boil over.



I had got myself all nice & calm whilst waiting to see the nurse at the doctor's today as one of the things she was going to do was my blood pressure - I went in, all smiles & friendly greetings - then she said she would do my repeat script review after my blood pressure.
That was it - I was off - I went in there 3 weeks ago for this miserable b1tch of a doctor that I had never seen before to do the bl00dy review (Let's see, diabetic - will I still be needing insulin, needles, testing strips in the coming year?!?!) and the stupid doctor had failed to update the records because SHE had a go at me about my balance.
SHE has never met me before and started making judgements and actually called me stupid - without bothering to read my notes.



Unfortunately - me telling the nurse about this (who DOES know my history and was amazed the doctor thought I wasn't doing well) sent my normally very low blood pressure through the roof!



Sigh.

I have been having a sort of unlucky day today. Nothing very serious but very irritating.
It started off with me using my sons old car to find out his gas guage didn't work.I stopped to get gas and pay with my bank card.I was told the card wouldn't work so had to pay with my emergency cash. Went to get the gas and  noticed his tire was almost flat. Put air in and drove away to my yoga class. Got to the gym and some women was blocking the flow of traffic with her huge SUV so I couldn't turn left without risking killing myself from three lanes of oncoming traffic.
The yoga class calmed me down and afterwards went to the bank to sort out the problem with my bank card.



Went grocery shopping and drove home.Started cleaning the house and made a huge mess with the vaccum bag since my husband was messing with it and put the bag in wrong.
I am now afraid to do anything for the rest of the day.

What do you think of people who destroyed our American Flag?



Yesterday evening when Obama was declared the winner of the 2008 Presidential election, Obama supporters in New York City's Union Square Park (at 14 Street Union Square in Manhattan) took down a gigantic American Flag that was hanging there at the park and  cut it in pieces so that everyone could have a piece of our flag to take home as a souvenir.  Please tell me how you feel about this being done to our flag.

the philosophy of the general body

actuality, they are condemning the

the motive was in part due to the

i'd object more if it were done as



a protest in the event, Obama wasn't

of mere spitefulness, instead of as



a  statement of joy, of course  had

The flag was not exactly destroyed.



It still exists just in smaller pieces.



In fact if you think of it,  the event you describe  can be interpreted as a symbolic one of unity,  for which the flag stands.



Each person has a piece of that flag now,



to commemorate an historical and most patriotic occasion,  all those people are now connected and united forever.



And the flag piece and the history behind it can be passed down to generation to generation.



You see how the whole picture can change if you hold it in a different light?
I think the picture I have is quite beautiful.

It's an historic day and I see why they would want a keepsake to remember the moment.  I don't have a problem with this because it wasn't done in hate or protest, unlike other so-called Americans that burn the flag as protest to one or two issues they have with our country.

It's just a flag... cutting it up didn't hurt anyone.



They were doing it to symbolise how everything is a part of the experience. They were doing it because they are free to do so.



I will never understand people who react badly when a flag is damaged. It's freedom of expression, and besides, no harm was done.

Wouldn't it be nice to see "average" models in the windows of the shops?



I was watching Gok on TV and I loved the shape of those "dummies" because they protray more of the "average" looking woman.  Actually, I thought they were quite sexy looking (in a strange way of course lol)  I don't want to see skinny any longer.  I have nothing against skinny at all... I respect people who are naturally slim... skinny sounds awful.



A lot of women I see in the streets are quite average looking.  Your thoughts?

i agree. the average woman is a 12-14. we should embrace that and i guarantee the anorexia and bulimia would go down drastically. there is nothing beautiful about a too thin woman. itts grotesqe. There is something gorgeous about a curvy confident woman though so i have to agree.

Did you ever see the Dove commercial?  These are just average women. not extra thin, not extra beautiful.  It's a refreshing change.  But it will be a long time before all store fronts. magazines, etc.  will start having the "average" woman on the front page. This is a shame, we look at these magazines, etc. and feel that there is something wrong with our bodies and then aren't as happy with ourselves as we should be.

There's a wide range of people, between the extremely closed-minded (who never change their beliefs, no matter what evidence) to the too-open-minded (who change their beliefs every time any even half-plausible evidence pops up). The difference between them is that the closed-minded people are completely confident in their beliefs and don't even examine new evidence, while the gullible trust others' as much as or more than themselves, and take too many arguments as facts.



Think back to childhood or think of a child you know. Children often happily go with anything they are told to, because they do not tend to analyze whether or not something is actual evidence or not, and because they believe that adults know best. Or, children can be insanely stubborn, refusing to even hear arguments to the contrary. It's not a matter of intelligence, but some people never learn to trust their own judgment or to filter fact from fiction.

It's scary, but I think it has to do with how people are raised. If you aren't raised with anything to compare what you see on television etc. to, if you aren't getting your information from different sources and exploring what's out there, you're not going to have any sense of what's true and what isn't. Kids who are raised by a television set, or who get all of their news from MySpace, and adults who get all of their ballot information from campaign commercials and so on, aren't grounded in any kind of reality. You need a good, well-rounded education and reliable sources, with differing opinions to be less easily influenced.

turn this on its head - people may be easily influenced by propaganda because they are open minded.



Education in all its forms can be narrowing if the mind is trained to think in a box.



I have opinions some are quite strong but if someone can show me a better way or side to things then I will not let my education hold me back from changing an opinion.

i know man. me too......you just have to remember that people like to talk about bs. and will always like to talk about bs. for a fewer of us i think we can rise above it but its just how human beings are. it may make you sick until you can't take it anymore but it'll be there tomorrow, just like it has been in the past. coming to accept this may be your greatest challenge because you can't fix it, or treat it, you just end up dealing with it one way or another. and as you know life is already full of these kinds of things. all this logic that we are blessed to have as highly evolved creatures just flies out the window because it can drive you mad. take comfort in the fact that you know your not the only one and this will help.

What do guys like in a girl?



What I really want to know is: If a girl has beautiful eyes, Jolie lips, tan skin, hot body and is tall but has a nose like Brenda song (Asian nose that is; it’s what they call a button nose or Nubian, I’m not really sure what it’s called), is she still considered gorgeous, beautiful and pretty?



This is my nose: I have small nostrils. It is a little narrow at the top, thick and broad at the middle and wide at the end. It’s a medium-sized nose. It fits my face really well. It compliments my face.



Does the nose matter???



All these describe how I look... so what do you think?

ya know cause guys do punching and all that stuff so i was wondering if another guy slaps another guy may not look manly.



there are some men who have small hands so the strenght of the fist is not as effective.

No it does not look bad. You just gotta do it the right way :)  I can only advise you to watch the movie "Rocknrolla" they have a whole chapter in there why a guy slapping another guy is not bad and how to do it properly. It's very funny and it's a good movie as well. Watch it! You'll love it, I saw it at the cinema last night.

IT WILL BE OKEY FOR BOTH, AS FAR AS OTHER GUY DOESN'T REVERT,-- I suggest: better be far from such situations. --- If some thing happens like that unexpectedly, immdtly. try to cool down, because the first guy who started slap is a mentally weak, confused, unorganized with no self confidence, respect & esteem  --- And the other side, 2nd guy who defends & cools the (movements) situation is a wise, mentally stronger than 1st guy with more control on the situation. so, think, this is not movie, nothing to do with small hands or big body, it is the mind which any body should keep it well. choose, which guy you want to be.

paul washer has excellent sermons from Heartcrymissionary; or you can find him on youtube also.

Please explain to me how two people showing the love and commitment they have for eachother affects children, they are not teaching kids about marriage in school, that was a bunch of B.S, you people are so worried about what kids are learning when half of them are shooting up schools killing their classmates, but you're too busy making sure that "JR" plays with toy cars instead of dolls, right? get a life people, we're all human here, and i believe if two people love each other and want to commit, LET THEM!!! who the hell are you to judge? most of you heterosexuals end your marriages in a month, but you want to call it sacred? .......give me a break...

im not sure why they are they way they are. but it scares me. she makes their clothes and everything. she home schools them. dont you think after having that many kids, you would send them off for school, or even a camp? those kids are going to be so lost if the mom dies. i do not think those kids are going to be head strong. none of them know how to make a decision by them selves.
she said god told her to have that many kids. i don't believe it. why doesn't god give the power to have kids to someone who has to pay for a sergeant mother,instead. obviously she has no problem having kids, so god should give the love to another trying family. they have to many already, i hope there's not more

I think being a real man is when you are yourself, and you are who you are, You take care of your business.



My husband is a real man, he takes care of his family, and he is the same man he was when i first met him, he is genuine.... He is not all about money, or how to get ahead in life, he is a simple man, and that is what makes him my man....



He will not tell someone what they want to hear just because they want to hear it, and he cant say the truth...



He is also just honest, and self less, always thinking of others, he thinks about me and my children before himself, he lives for us... I live for him to dont get me wrong, but he always treats me right, and tells me that he will do what ever he has to, as to survive in thisworld with his family, he doesnt care about going out to a party, or making new friends, he rules his life, and he will tell you his life is his family...



A true man takes care of his family.

In 2007 the basic requirements of a real man haven't changed that much from 1900s CE or 2000 BCE.  We have to be able to provide for our families, be able to defend them from dangers, and provide a stable environment in which to raise our children.  A real man maintains good relationships with others.  Good standing in the community is often part of this, but a real man has to know when and where to  make a stand for his principals even if this goes against the norms.  A real man is not pushed around, is not a wimp, and doesn't whine or complain about things that he cannot change.  I am a Christian so I would also say that a real man walks a good and holy Christian walk and strives to be all that Jesus wants him to be.  In short being a real man is a tough job that most of us mess up from time to time.

To be a real man, stand up for your woman and family, do the chores, you know washing up, taking the bins out etc, and work if you have to, bringing the dosh in.
Those are the basics.
Then there is being caring, loving, sharing, putting up with crap like in laws and friends of hers. Lastly respect yourself, or no woman will.

To me being a real man is as follows



a) to provide, love and care for my family and friends
b) to treat people with the respect they deserve and which I would expect from them
c) to be honest in my life and to demand honesty from others
d) to keep to my own morality and not allow the world around me to drag me down to its level



The old image of a 'real man' as a hard drinking, wife beating, fighting, foul mouthed individual is dead.  The reality is that it never was an image to follow, merely an excuse for those who were like that.



In the modern world it is important (and sadly neglected) to be empathetic towards others and to work together to make life better for all those around us if we can.  Life is too short and too difficult to have to deal with all that macho, posturing rubbish.

I think being a "real man" has changed.  Go back a mere century and men were throwing down their coats into puddles for women and running around after them.  Today, they're letting doors close in womens faces and running around but with everyone but who they're with!!  I reckon a real man is committed, honest and straight up!!  That's the real man us gals are looking for, just like Bruce!!!

i kid i kid. It has exaggerated effects. but there is an issue in porn that we as viewers must take up. Like hollywood porn is not real it is fantasy and as long as we remember that and maintain our real relationships there is no harm.
I can see how some people lose respect for women due to pornography but i would venture a guess that they began viewing porn and had no real encounters with women and based porn to be the norm. I would be frustrated if i were that dude cause none goes that long in that position i mean nobody!

I absolutely HATE how the rich people at the top f** everyone else over. It makes me SO mad.  And it's not just in america.  pretty much everything politicians do makes me mad.  and all the other people who have power in companies.  One day God will repay them what they deserve.

I am trying to look at your speech objectively so that I might give you some constructive criticism. In general I see this as a statement not a speech, or it might make a good answer to an essay question. I suggest you read a few books on public speaking to understand the structure of a speech.



Get rid of the second and the third sentence. Your speech is about Barack Obama so why talk about anyone else.  In the fifth sentence use either "Us" or "Americans" also there seems to be something missing perhaps the phrase "He wants the American people to be united as one..."
If I were grading this I would give it a "C". A good effort but it needs work.

They might be doing this because they don't know any better.  I used to stutter as well, and after explaining to people that just like for a person who doesn't stutter, it is rude to cut people off and to please just let me say what I'm trying to say, they eventually got the hint and stopped.  It turned out that they didn't want me to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable.

It may be because they're so used to you stuttering they feel like they know what you're going to say or that they don't have to listen but you should remind them that just because you stutter it doesn't mean you don't have stuff to say. I had a friend that stuttered and people were generally mean to him and impatient with his speech and I know I would be very upset if my "friends" did this to me.

Are the world powers moving closer to each other, politically ?



Over the last decade Russia and [ to a certain extent ], China have moved slightly from extreme left-wing communism with total state control, to a more socialist type government with some 'freedom' in the markets, media etc. Meanwhile the U.S. is slowly shifting from a conservative govt. with minimal state interference, to a more controlling govt. with less freedom in markets and media ! Will they all meet in the middle one day as semi-socialist states ? With enemies being more based on religion rather than politics ?

Yep. It's all part of the NWO agenda. If politics don't vary so much country to country, we will be quicker to abandon our ideologies attached to those politics. (Even though America is ideologically capitalist, it ceased being so when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.) once we abandon our ideologies, the governments can unite and the bankers will have done what Stewie and The Brain wanted to do, take over the world.

Clarkson joke sparks complaints?



Now is it just me....or has the UK population lost its sense of humour??!



Apparently 517 complaints have been made after he made a joke about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes, some people are even calling for him to be sacked and OFCOM is strating an investigation into it.
First, Jonathan Ross gets suspended, now they're trying to get rid of Clarkson....what's going on?!?



I personally think these are two of the funniest men on tv, why has everyone suddenly got so uptight?  It's driving me mad!!  The editor of a trucking magazine even said it only offended a small number of drivers and everyone else found the feature great as it demonstrated the difficulty of driving a lorry.....



What's going on with the British people??!  Chill out!

Just don't stress about it.  Yes, when you grow up, you'll be way "cooler" than you are now, in a different way.  College is way different.  Life is way different.  High schoolers are mean.  It's just how it is.  Let it pass.

Well, it depends on what you mean by cool. In my opinion, you can be whatever you like. All you have to do is ignore what haters say, and meet new people. It doesn't matter if they're "cool," or "nerds," simply make friends, ignore haters, and enjoy your school life. That's what's cool in my opinion. You don't have to be like the popular girls on TV. Trust me, if the "cool kids" don't want you around them now, there's no reason to get with them later.

You are an individual, the kids on the back of the bus are sheep.



The unpopular kids at school are the ones who become successful adults who come up with new ideas. They are used to be self sufficient and are not afraid of being laughed at. These kids become adults like Bill Gates, Trey Parker & Matt Stone etc. Trust me, I have been to my 20 year since school anniversary and the cool kids ain't cool anymore!!



So embrace being yourself, name calling is just the way insecure people can feel better about themselves. The real strength and coolness in this world is to know that you are OK as you are, it doesn't matter what anyone else things.

You sound cool to me already! Do not bother with the COOL KIDS, trust me! its not as great as it sounds. It's usually really shallow relationships, the type of people that will love you one minute but hate you the next just cause of something like a pimple. Please don't waste your time. You're never gonna see them again anyway after you get out of school. and i know that seems like an eternity from now but really it isn't. Don't drop your grades to fit in either cause that is just dumb. The smarter you are the better you are off and failing just to fit in will only make things harder for you later. when you are young its all about fitting in but when you get older its all about getting away from the crowd and being unique. if you want to change a little, which is basically just about appearance, which is shallow. Anyway you could get more stylish glasses (present time) i guess you can say, get a nice hair cut but thats it! don't go over board, and i know its long so sorry for that =) hope this helps at least a little, but i still think you sound awesome already!

You can't see yourself and think badly of yourself. Life is weird because at the beginning all you want to do is fit in, then later in life when you are truly finding yourself you won't care what people think of you and you'll want to stand out and be unique. Just focus on your good qualities and  the way you carry yourself and present yourself and that will let people know you are someone they want to get to know and hang out with. Usually "cool kids" at the back of the bus are not worth hanging out with anyway. just do your own thing.

if my kid stinks, im gonna put him in the shower. he sees me putting on deoderant, so, i will let him put some on too. my fiances daughter is 6 years old and she has a cell phone, ONLY b/c he doesnt have custody of her, and her mom wont let her talk to him on her phone. so, we bought her a cell phone for her 6th birthday, so she could talk to her daddy any time she wanted to. it got to the point when any time she talked to her daddy on her moms phone, her mom would start screaming for bill money. so, that was his only option if he wanted to talk to his daughter. now, they can talk as much as they want and it only costs $9.99 a month. pretty good investment if you ask me :)

First, there is nothing wrong with putting deodorant on a child.  If they stink, they stink.  There is nothing wrong with that.



As far as cell phones go....



I dont have a land line, most of my friends dont have land lines, pay phones are all but gone, and I do NOT want my child going up to a stranger to ask for help.  I am sorry you dont understand that, but times have changed.  I get that 50 years ago people didnt have cell phones, but 50 years ago almost everyone had a land line, there were pay phones on every corner, and it was more or less safe for your child to ask the nearest adult for help.  Those things are NOT true anymore.



And I am not sure why you are comparing cell phones to head phones, but the only danger with head phones is playing them too loud.  Played at a normal level, they are fine.  There is no medical or scientific proof that cell phones cause cancer, if thats what you are talking about.

Because you've just helped make discrimination legal, that's why people say that.
Now, you must be very proud.
Live and let live, is what I say.

Gays want you to bow down and worship them thats why. I really think its that they are so disgusted with themselves they force everyone to like them to make their feelings go away. It would also explain why they have such a huge problem with drug abuse, stds, multiple partners, etc. When I look on craigslist or go downtown I always see ads for gay meth users.



And I actually think any gay act should be illegal, you know how it is on the books. I would go as far as any act out of marriage, but one step at a time. I assume that gay marriage will pass eventually, I mean look we have prostitution being questioned on the same ballot!! That makes me laugh. What's wrong anymore? ARe we going to vote on whether stealing is wrong? Cheating is becoming acceptable in society too.

I say a person should live long as they want. If they want the choice to die, I say it should be allowed because as humans, we need personal freedom. For instance, if one is suffering, he should have freedom to make the choice to end his life, as living through torture isn't pleasant to a typical human-being. As a lifespan, I can't really give you an answer. It would be random if I did because I wouldn't really KNOW what I'm talking about.

Are you stupid? blacks in the UK are a tiny minority of the population? so the chance of them being successful politicians is also very slim. There is over 30 million blacks in the US and there is obviously far more of a chance they would get into positions like that. also blacks have only been in the UK for about 50 years where as they have been in the US since the country was established really.



but hey you're an idiot. why not get blacks for every prime minister and president position in the world! even countries like poland. that have no black people what so ever.

Clarkson joke sparks complaints?



Now is it just me....or has the UK population lost its sense of humour??!



Apparently 517 complaints have been made after he made a joke about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes, some people are even calling for him to be sacked and OFCOM is strating an investigation into it.
First, Jonathan Ross gets suspended, now they're trying to get rid of Clarkson....what's going on?!?



I personally think these are two of the funniest men on tv, why has everyone suddenly got so uptight?  It's driving me mad!!  The editor of a trucking magazine even said it only offended a small number of drivers and everyone else found the feature great as it demonstrated the difficulty of driving a lorry.....

Why is it a stand up comedian act on stage can get away with it and we all find it funny, but when it happens out of context it's the end of the world?  Grow up BBC it's only a laugh. 500 complaints out of millions of viewers so small a percentage it's hardly worth moaning about.

Its hard to know if you're cool or not.  You need to give us more information.  All you'ved asked is "do you think I'm cool".  I'm sure you're fine though.  If you'd like cheering up, email me and I'll email back.

I find it annoying when two people driving, stop their cars alongside each other, and talk, blocking the road. Now, that gives you a good reason to go into road-rage. I honk the horn and tell them to move, but then, they still continue taking. Have these people ever heard of cell phones?

I'm sure it would. If weed got into stores, a bunch of loser potheads would spend their money on it, and it would be perfect for companies to make a profit. That's my view, but I wouldn't recommend making weed legal.

Yes.



First of all. People who smoke marijuana aren't 'loser potheads' as put by that person above.



Anyway...if marijuana was legalized it would be really cheap. There goes profit for gangs (most of which make their money selling weed).



Also, if it could be sold legit without added chemicals like cigarettes then there would be another choice for people rather than alcohol. Alcohol is far worse for the body, and is addictive. Marijuana is not physically addictive.



Anyway. This is beyond yes or no. Haha.



In short - Yes.

Maybe but I doubt it. If pot were legal it could be taxed but we'd lose tax revenue from alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceuticals if legal pot usage made a dent in their sales -- and it almost certainly would. Another factor is that marijuana is easy & cheap to grow -- it's said that pot is the biggest cash crop in California -- and I'd expect home cultivation to expand dramatically if legalized. This is why pot is illegal. The powers-that-be don't want people producing their own drugs any more than OPEC wants you to produce your own energy. There are good reasons to legalize pot but I don't think benefiting the economy is one of them.

It already does, it is just unaccounted for. If it was legalized however, the government could tax it, and generate large tax revenues from it, as there is a huge market for Marijuana. It would also take away a source income for gangsters and criminals, although there are plenty of other illegal drugs for them to profit off of.

Should you argue with people who you know to be dead wrong?



Like when you hear someone say something you know is totally wrong but you also know that if you contradict their point of view they'll only end up defending their opinion (which they think is the absolute truth) and because their sense of self-importance is damaged they'll then try and put you down by attempting to prove that you're non compos mentis and do what you will, they'll never come around to your way of thinking because their pride is so precious to them. So what do you do when you get in a situation like that? What is the best thing to do when someone says that America is not a democracy, Obama is a moron or Putin is just a prime-minister who cares for his country and other bullshit like that? I mean how do you react? What if your teacher is wrong and he doesn't know one hoot about politics but makes some unreasonable statements, do you tell them they're wrong? ... 'Cause from my point of view it all seems kind of futile to try to prove people they're wrong. It knda makes me think... should you argue with anyone? I mean what's the point? And the same thing with everything else - politics, religion or what kind of clothes you should wear or how you should live... What's the point in even telling others what you think if you know that'll only ignite disagreement and lead to an argument, that most likely won't solve anything? So what should I do in cases like this? Should I tell people what I think when they're feeding me some of their BS?

The point is when you believe, think, or know you are right.  The right answer may just be dependent on it being the right answer for you.  No one can tell you who to vote for, or not, what to wear, or even who to date and be friends with.  It is only debatable if the person is questioning his or her choices.  Then and only then, is it a debate.  Usually, if someone is firm even if they are firmly incorrect in you opinion then you can only state your opinion whether that opinion comes from your own personal experiences or it comes from something is full of proof.  The fact is that no one likes a know-it-all in certain social circles but it really works out in other circumstances where knowledge is valued.  Keep on giving your opinion because for what it is worth, you can have a impact on the lives of people, now whether they take it negatively or positively is up to them.

We managed quite well before they came.  We could manage without them.  Society would be different, but it would survive.



Now who are these mythical powers that be?  Now we've let the technology genie out of the bottle, getting it back in is beyond the power of governments or corporations.

The Australians follow the USA in placing the day of the month after the month -- today, for example being 11/5/08 in those countries, whereas elsewhere in the world it's 5/11/08.



Otherwise, look for examples in music, in fashion, in social mores, where the American lead seems to be followed, largely through the influence of TV. The Australian soap operas bear much resemblance to those of the USA.

•On the question of chronology, two external references are helpful:



Aristotle tells us that the Laws is later than the Republic, (Pol. 2.6) and



Diogenes Laertius (3.37) reports that it was unfinished at Plato's death (and the text of the Laws itself shows some signs of incompleteness and lack of revision).[2]



Platonic scholars also frequently appeal to stylometry (that is, the quantitative study of the features of Plato's prose style) to help to date the dialogues. Although the usefulness of stylometry is sometimes questioned, it is widely accepted and the agreement of many such studies allows us to divide the dialogues, with some confidence, into three groups.[3]



Group 3: Critias, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, Statesman, and Timaeus



Group 2: Parmenides, Phaedrus, Republic, and Theaetetus



Group 1: the rest



Drawing upon other evidence, it is reasonable to see the dialogues in Group 3 as the latest. Given the length of the Laws (it is the longest of the dialogues and is, roughly 20% longer than the Republic), it seems likely that its composition overlapped with the composition of at least some of the other dialogues in Group 3.



2. The Laws’ Relation to the Republic
The Laws comprises a conversation in 12 books, set on Crete, among three interlocutors: an unnamed Athenian Visitor (Plato's spokesman in the Laws), Megillus, a Spartan, and, Kleinias, a Cretan. The first two books consider what the proper goal or end (telos) of legislation is. Plato claims that even the best of extant constitutions, such as those of Crete and Sparta, have gone wrong on this crucial point. In all his legislation, the lawgiver must aim at a single goal and that is virtue. In particular, the lawgiver must aim at fostering all the virtues -- courage, justice, moderation, and wisdom -- in the citizens as a whole (Laws 630C3-6, 705D3-706A4).[4] So if Plato is to meet his own criterion for a good city, the rest of the Laws should show how the constitution (politeia) of this city reliably produces citizens who genuinely possess all the virtues.



At the end of Book 3 (Laws 702BD), Kleinias announces that the cities of Crete have decided to found a new city, to be named Magnesia, in a long abandoned part of Crete and they have given the responsibility for doing so to his city, Knossos, and that Knossos has delegated this authority to himself and nine others. He asks the Athenian to help in the construction of the new city's constitution and laws. In Books 4-12, the Athenian sketches, often in considerable detail, the constitution, the political and social institutions, and the laws of this new city, along with the political and ethical principles that justify them.



Since both the Republic and the Laws involve the creation of a good city, discussion of topics in political theory as well as related ethical and psychological material, it is natural to ask what the relation between the two dialogues is. The predominant view, until fairly recently, holds that the Republic is Plato's statement of what the ideally best city is; the Laws, on the other hand, describes the city that would be best, given less optimistic assumptions about what human nature is capable of. This position has two variants, depending on one's view of whether Plato at the time of the Republic thought that its political program was compatible with human nature. If one thinks that even at the time of the Republic, Plato thought that its ideal city placed too great demands on its citizens to be psychologically realizable, then one can hold that the Laws is entirely consistent with the Republic: they could, at least as far as their philosophical positions are concerned, have been written at the same time.[5] If, on the other hand, one thinks that Plato held that the city of the Republic was psychologically possible, even if difficult to realize, it is natural to see the Laws as the outcome of a change in Plato's views about human nature.[6] The first view faces two challenges:



providing evidence from the Republic that Plato did not think its ideal city was realizable, and



either explaining why the Republic does not at least gesture in the direction of the arrangements of the Laws as the best humanly possible option or arguing that we can find such evidence.



The second view should explain why Plato becomes more pessimistic about human nature. The need for such an explanation is especially pressing, since the most common attempt to do so by appealing to Plato's experiences in Sicily is philosophically quite unsatisfactory.[7]



In recent years, it has been argued that there are deep and pervasive differences between the Republic and the Laws (and more generally between the dialogues of Group 3 and those of Group 2) on ethical and political questions.[8] The debate over these claims is just in its initial stages and no scholarly consensus has yet emerged. Given this state of flux, the rest of this entry sketches a few important topics of contempor

This book might help: Plato's Ethics by Terence Irwin



"This exceptional book examines and explains Plato's answer to the normative question, "How ought we to live?" It discusses Plato's conception of the virtues; his views about the connection between the virtues and happiness; and the account of reason, desire, and motivation that underlies his arguments about the virtues. Plato's answer to the epistemological question, "How can we know how we ought to live?" is also discussed. His views on knowledge, belief, and inquiry, and his theory of Forms, are examined, insofar as they are relevant to his ethical view. Terence Irwin traces the development of Plato's moral philosophy, from the Socratic dialogues to its fullest exposition in the Republic. Plato's Ethics discusses Plato's reasons for abandoning or modifying some aspects of Socratic ethics, and for believing that he preserves Socrates' essential insights. A brief and selective discussion of the Statesmen, Philebus, and Laws is included."

He wasnt the actual 'plotter' so to speak, he was given the duty to carry out the plot. They were going to blow up the parliament in protest to the aristocrats of England during the State Opening of Parliament. When asked what he intended to with so much gunpowder, he replied "to blow you scotch beggars back to your own native mountains!" Cool dude, symbol of anarchy, popular due to many movies, poems and other works of literature with themes that are related to him. Plus there are "Guy Fawkes" masks, which are a representation of a popular caricature of him, seen on the movie 'V for Vendetta'

Music on public transport?



by music.. I mean the noise which passes for music from teenagers phones, why do they get away with this when it is so plainly annoying to other users of public transport.?



You can't fall asleep to it, you can't sing along with it,you can't dance to it. why do the bus drivers not make them turn it off.?

Sometimes you can listen to classical music on the local trains in Madrid. It has great influence on the passengers.

This is so annoying.  Really jarring.  Some of these little b@stards are so self-absorbed that they think the rest of the world ought to listen to their music - it just makes me want to take their phone off them and hurtle it out of the window.



The drivers are probably reticent to say anything to them because they're afraid of a reprisal.

It's very annoying, especially that what you can actually hear is not music but some incomprehensible noise. I wish there was a way to make them lower the volume. When I first saw your question I thought it was about music played for all passengers on public transport. Sometimes you can listen to classical music on the local trains in Madrid. It has great influence on the passengers, it's very low so it doesn't disturb if you want to sleep or read, and it makes people calm down (everybody seems quite nervous in the morning here).

The best course of action would be to inform the driver what's happening. In most cases the driver probably isn't aware of the problem, and they can make a decision if you let them know.



If there's a continued problem they can inform Transport Police.

Narrow-minded people - How to deal with them?



Well some people might have had to face one or two of these people in their lives. It's not that I hate them... I just get quite angry and annoyed. But you have to understand where I'm coming from...
My definition of 'narrow-minded' doesn't simply mean someone has an opinion, where they dislike something or rather, but it's when they don't even try to see past their own personal set of values.



Sometimes the only way to be at peace is to agree with everything they say.



Does anyone have any ways to deal with them? Often I just give up on them... Or give up on everything, and let them prance around in their own small imaginary world. *Sigh*

i find the best way to deal with them is to just ignore them. often they just like to anger the other person, so saying something to them would probably just please them. they are always going to exist so just don't pay any attention to them and try not to let them bother you.

Just ignore them and I am pretty sure that one day they will ask you if they annoy you, just tell them the truth that day. You don't have to be shy to tell them that they are stupid coz people like them need someone to tell them that they are stupid.

I feel your pain, i have also dealt with lots of narrow minded people, don't let them think they are always right ! the only way i have or will deal with this type of people is by proving them wrong,this is not because i think im always right but for the shear arrogance of some people..so in answer to you question - no don't let them sit in there own world thinking they are always right because they are not...good luck :-)..

Ethnicity question and DNA testing?



Hello,



I know that it is hard to tell the ethnic background of someone by looking.
Virtually impossible.
But I would appreciate your opinion, if you wouldn't mind.
My friend who gave permission to post her picture for a short time
has done a DNA test for ethnicity and it showed European
and something else.
Can you guess by looking at this picture?
I will let here know.



Thanks so much!

If you do DNA testing (I did) you will find that your earliest ancestors came from Africa - everyone's did, period. If you're white, they migrated north several million years ago.

That if you hadn't been there that day or that night they would have been injured, ended up going to prison, dead or some other terrible outcome would have happened to them?

I saved my sister from drowning when I was about 6 and she was about 4 so she might not be here.
I worked in haematology and blood transfusion so I processed lots of samples that probably helped diagnose people's illnesses. I was also in charge of setting up the Anti-D program at the hospital (for the pregnant ladies) so I may have helped to prevent future miscarriages and ill babies.
I was also a forensic scientist so I probably helped a few people avoid being victims of crime by processing the evidence that put the criminal that might have committed the crime in prison.

I have possibly saved a number of lives through my work, converted several people to Christianity and more to vegetarianism, and opened a number of people's eyes to political issues.  The biggest influence other than on the existence of my children and a number of others indirectly, is probably a strand of research into childcare in lesbian mothers which is the result of persuading someone to stay in education and another into autism for a similar reason.

What would go thru your mind?



A young woman you work with has really bad asthma and was taken to the hospital for it earlier this year. But she's pretty shy and soft-spoken so she doesn't talk about it unless someone asks her about it. The other day, she mentioned how she had a rough night b/c an attack hit after midnight and she was up every few hours b/c of it. She seemed tired, but throughout the day she functioned normally and was her usual quiet self.

Well the first thing I would think about "what is there I can do to help this person." Most likely there isn't anything you can do in the kind of situation. However what you can do is maybe do some research and tell this person. It is most likely that they need to seek a health care professional. This sounds really serious and they need to find something that they can do to better help their situation for we all know that breathing is a pretty important thing and when that is constricted, that can be extremely life threatening.

<answer>



they both do have a huge impact on society, the problem is most will
not talk about compassion unless he/she is famous. and in general
no one talks about it cause it does not feel good or sound good.we either have it or not and when the occasion rises the person who receives it is grateful and the one who showed or gave compassion feels good about it, and i am positive he/she will not go around and brags about it.



but violence is something that we all hear about it.

I overheard a group of people talking about me at work today....?



.... calling me "weird" and whatnot. Not to mention there are cliques at my work and they all eat together, hang out together and never invite me to anything (unless they're selling something). How does this happen in the workplace and outside of high school? I'm really frustrated because the only time they're nice to me is when they want something and it hurts my feelings the rest of the time.

A lot of workplaces are exactly like high school sadly enough.  There are bullies, know-it-alls, and the "popular" people.  Deal with your coworkers the same way you dealt with the high schoolers, ignore them.  Someday, you'll be their boss.

Well, you could be weird somehow... Or maybe you just don't fit into their group! That would mean that maybe you should start looking for a new job where you'd fit better with the people there. Because it's worthless to try to convince them you're not "weird" if they already think you are and you don't want to have to put up with it, now do you?

why do you allow them to hurt your feelings.. no one can get to you unless you allow them too.
who cares what they say, they may be jealous, or talking about you because you have not tried to join in or sat with them at lunch.
Take a big step ask them if you can join them for lunch one day..



start talking to each one of them individually in the breakroom, at the copier, etc. don't sell yourself short at work.

Sadly the cliques don't stop with high school.  Just be yourself.  You want people to like you for who you are.  Maybe try to be a little more outgoing.  If you see someone in the hallway or a break room, ask them how their weekend was or open up a conversation.  If this doesn't work, maybe it's not you.  These might not be people that you want to hang out with.  I got treated like this at one place because there were a group of girls that liked to complain about everything and I liked my job and didn't want to be brought down by their negativity so I chose not to hang around them for that reason and they probably called me weird too.

How do I stop sucking at life?



I've always sucked at life. I'm in my first semester of university and If I'm not already I will soon be an academic joke. I don't have very many friends, I think my roommate might hate me and I don't know why. I am a good roommate, I don't touch her stuff and I keep my side of the room clean, I vacuum once a week, and I buy the air fresheners and febreeze. So it must be my personality. I lost my room key, my key chain had a clip and the clip fell off. I don't even have a key anymore and I looked everywhere for it and I can't find it. I'm supposed to be doing homework but I can't find an academic journal to discuss my problem of my chosen environmental issue small scale litter.



I am a major procrastinator and I would like to stop it but I can't. I have ADD and even my meds don't seem to be helping anymore. And last but not least I am as stupid as a doormat. Is there any way to improve intelligence? How are you guys good at life? Do you have any tips for someone who sucks at it?

You have taken the first two steps in helping yourself. The first is recognizing that you need help and the second is asking for help. Organization is one of the keys to success. If you have what you need when you need it you keep your stress down and you are able to make decisions. Another part is taking time to think before you react. Think about about the possible outcomes and make informed decisions. Being prepared also goes along with organization and success. If you are able to prepare before you go to class or work then you more often then not have success.



As far as the roommate goes you might want to ask her what is the matter. After all you have to live together might as well make the best of it.

Why do you think some blacks are "Angry"?



I just got done reading a post on here called is Michelle Obama a racis.  You can check my answers to read the post.  People think that she is racist for some odd reason without providing any proof, I asked them to prvide some and there was none.



This weekend I got called a "black-ee" at a beerfest party in the country part of Minnesota.  I just held my composure and didnt say anything because I dont wan to be the "angry black guy" there.  I just stayed as the life of the party as usual.  I have been called buckwheat 2 times at my job...(which was definitley handled)I have been called ****** so many times and I just keep it in to maintain my composure.



How are we as black people supposed to take in all this stuff and not say anything?  How do we keep ourselves from being called the angry black woman or man?  How do we stop this from happening?

You aren't the only one!  Us whites have black people do and say ignorant stuff to us too, just because we're white.  You can't stop it, but you can ignore it.  Reacting to people and their ignorant ways only brings you down to their level.  You know you're above them, so just hold your head high and let them be their ignorant selves!  You can only control what you do and say and who you are as a person!  You letting all this get to you is only making you the angry black man they say you are!  There are many things in this world that will make you angry, if you can't change them, you can only change how you deal with them!  I hope you find peace in yourself and in life!

Why are there so many brainless people on this?



Maybe someone is going to say that I am one of them because I'm asking this question, but seriously... How many people are going to ask "Am I pregnant?", "Am I ugly?", "How do I get my cheating ex-boyfriend back?"? And P.S. incase any of you morons haven't noticed, when you ask a question a little bubble pops up on the right that says, "Wait, I think this question may have been asked already" and gives you a list of options. 10 points to the person with the best brainless experience here (give me an example of one of the most redundant questions you've seen).

Oh, and to all those people with teachers that tell you "There's no such thing as a stupid question", well they're LYING!  There are such things as stupid questions, and sadly enough, more than half of the questions on here can be considered as "stupid questions".  It's common knowledge, really.  Learn how to start searching up simple, basic information, people.  Seriously.



Oh, also, this is not only directed towards those who asks stupid questions, but also those idiots that answer when they have no clue what they're talking about.  I despise that.

Just the fact that you're asking a question as stupid as "Why are there so many brainless people on this?" puts you in the brainless category.  At least people can actually answer the questions you're complaining about.  This isn't really even a question.  It's a statement.

Here  is  the  only  logical  answer  you  will  get. In  nature  the  weak  or  in  this  case  stupid  would  eliminate  themselves  in



the  process  of  natural  selection.  This  is  natures  way  of  insuring  the  survival  of  the  species  by  causing  only  the



strongest  offspring  to  continue  reproducing  which  in turn



should  produce  mostly  strong  and  non-defective  offspring.
However  when  it  comes  to  human  intervention  in  this  process  the  weak  are  nurtured  for  and  encouraged  to  reproduce  with



other  weak  offspring  and  this  is  how  you  end  up  with  people



who  can't  think  for  themselves.

I'm not really sure, but it could be a number of reasons.  Their dislike for the use of their own intellect to decide for themselves what is and what should be.  I.e. they follow the trends of thinking in society, which more or less tend to point towards the non thinking side.... eh.. so I think, I'm not really sure, but I seem to notice that the trendy people don't really have a clue about things that are important (although completely subjective but more or less true), like science, politics, history, economics, etc...  I could be completely/way off here, but to summarize my point it may be the society in which we live.  Although I"m not bashing it completely, there are very many good points to it.  Like yahoo answers and coming upon a well, but rare, thought out answer.



Source(s):



Alright, so it wasn't so thought out, and was mostly a half assed attempt to a reputable answer... I'm only guessing, but also it maybe because they were just brought up in an environment where thinking in a way that is more seen as "non-moronic" was not greatly nurtured to grow... or perhaps it's genetics, or point of view on life, which of course, I believe is due to ignorance or wealth of knowledge, and belief.

Why is it that generally fat and fugly women are successful?



When I speak of being successful, I don't mean being successful in hollywood or in the entertainment industry. I'm speaking of being successful in the corporate American industry. People who work office jobs. Generally speaking, most of the higher ups, most of the CEO's and executives who are women are fat and fugly. You never see a hot woman who is a 9 or a 10 that is a CEO or top executive. There's always an exception to the rule, but generally speaking you just don't see that. I think it's because no guy would want to see such a woman naked and have sex with her. She is unable to attract men, so they have all the time in the world to study, get those business and master degrees, and work their way up. A hot sexy woman who is a 9 or a 10 doesn't have to do that. They're so hot that they're able to attract a man who will pay their way. Anyone else agree?

I personally think this is an easy question:



The inconvenience of an unwanted pregnancy (don't dare say unborn CHILD) outweighs the value of that "innocent unborn".

I don't think so.  If your going for the "Sacrifice one person to save many others" deal, then it does not make any sense to kill more people to save one.  I guess maybe the presidents body guards might be applicable in the sense its better that they all take the bullet than the president does, but that's still morally wrong I believe.

Not really. In their mind they're winning the debate. They figure that if they're the only one being heard then they're right (because they're getting their point across). But in all actuality, they make themselves look like "buffoons" and childish, because they're not adult enough to engage in a sensible conversation. You can agree to disagree with someone and still be civil about it, but most people fail to grasp this concept. I don't waste my time debating with people like this, because you'll never get anywhere with them. In their mind they're right, and everyone (that can't be heard) is wrong.

Do you still watch tv, what shows?



I have a big problem with tv - what I like is on when I am at work, the rerun is at 5-6 in the morning, or its on weekends when I am out. Or if I like something and is on at decent hours like 8,9 in the evening, then obviously 2-3 other just as interesting things will be on at the very same time.
Tv is just frustrating...
And obviously others feels thisway too, this is why youtube exists.
Why is tv programming so lousy, bad hours, bad shows at good hours, total disrespect for the viewers?

Because they want you up for more advertising.  The hallmark of their existance.  Without advertising commercial T.V. would not exist.
Companies pay BIG BUCKS for air time and want as many buyers as possible viewing their sales pitch.  So, the most popular shows are scheduled later to insure a larger viewing audience.
It all comes down to $$$$$

You could just set-up a VCR or something to record the shows you want to watch, then just watch them when you get home and all the lame TV is on.  Then you could just do it again the next day.

Yes, I do find as I get older the less vain I get. To be honest there was a time when I was pretty vain, but as time goes by I find it is more important to be educated and goal focused rather than what your appearance is. Hope this helps.

(TURKISH POLITICS) Are GHP members not well mannered & their behaviour was insulting to their president today?



* Just heard in the Turkish news 1630/TGRT TV, that all GH party members didn't stand up as a respect to their president A. Gul when he visited their Parliament today.
* Even though I don't care about Turkish politics, I couldn't bear & stand that bad manner & behavior, it was an insulting behavior, not only to their president, but insulting to ever Turkish person including those who voted for GHP.
* GHP members are expected to do any various bad behavior to satisfy their aims, as most of them are miss behaved people, following their example Deniz Baykal!
* A plitician should be respectful, well behaved & always be a good example to the public!
** I BELIEVE ALL THOSE MISBEHAVED MEMBERS SHOULD BE DISCIPLINED!!

<question>



How are there so many porn stars in the world?



Type in "porn" or "XXX" into a search engine, and you get over 400 million porn entries. Each one of those sites has 1000-10,000 images.



Now, two things you'll notice about all porn images



1. every woman is extremely attractive



2. You never see a duplicate woman



If there is 400 million porn sites, each with 1000-10,000 images, that means there has to be 400 billion female porn stars in the world!!! Even if you take a conservative estimate and say that most of those porn sites are duplicates, there would still have to be well over a half a billion porn stars to account for all that porn.



If there is 6.6 billion people on earth, let's say half are woman, then the pool of women is 3.3. billion. Out of that number, only a small percentage is young enough to be in porn, a smaller percentage of that is attractive enough to be in porn, and an even smaller percentage of that would even want to be in porn. It is remarkable that there is even a million or ten million female porn stars, but a billion or more???



Question, how often do you actually see an attractive women on the street who has starred in a porn?



And why, with the exception of famous porn stars like Jenna Jameson and others, do you never see a duplicate in the millions of porn images on the website???



What the bleep is going on here???

I'm no expert on porn, but just some comments on your assumptions.



1.  there are duplicates
2.  each image is not of a different woman.  There are often hundreds of images of each woman.
3.  each hit (web site) doesn't necessarily contain unique images.



but- there sure are a lot of great looking young women out there ready to do anything for a few hundred dollars.

Actually, some of those site do have duplicates.



Also, most of those porn sites aren't porn actresses. That is the awesome thing about the internet, amateur girls can pose nude and open sites about just them.



Also, some of those are just nude models or strippers.



In all logic, probably one out of ten attractive women starred in a porn. You probably won't see that porn, but odds are, one in ten has posed for her lover at one point in time, or have a movie with her in it. It just won't get posted or sold anywhere.

How do you deal with unprofessional co-workers?



I work with, um, lets call her Debbie, she has no professionalism, no etiquette and no sense of courtesy.



She'll make fun of customers names in front of them.



Instead of using our paging system, she'll yell across the lobby in her hick accent.



She can't spell.



She'll tell me how to do my job when shes' been here a month and i've been here 8 months.



She has shown up in a blue jean mini skirt (she is about 300 pounds so its not flattering) after I told her professional attire... her reponse to being told thats not professional attire, "It is to me."



Her lack of professionalism makes her so repulsive to me.



She is just trashy.



I know my manager hired her out of panic because I was going to be gone for 2 weeks to get married and go on my honeymoon... well, I'm back and she is driving me and alot of our fellow co-workers crazy.



I have to actively TRY so hard to be nice to her.



Yesterday before I left, I was on the phone with a customer and she was telling me, loudly might I add, what to do with them... they heard her loud freakin mouth in the back ground and asked, "Excuse me!" I had to ignore her just to finish the conversation.



I have to TRY so hard... she is so unprofessional I wanna slap her....



Any ideas on handling her big mouth or dealing with her?



</question>



<additional details>



And she talks bad about me when I'm gone to the coworkers here asking why I'm so controlling... um... you're new into a position that I busted my butt to get into shape... and she has the nerve to try and change what I worked hard to achieve for the best interest of this company.... ugh...

Let your manager deal with her. Since you two are both employee, there is nothing you can do to fire her. But you can always file a complaint to your bosses. I think they'll listen to you but don't forget to show some evidence. About dealing with her... just ignore her completely. You don't need to go down to her level. I know its frustrating but it's her life that is going to be miserable not yours.

This is a manager's job;  he/she needs to sit everyone down and explain the rules, and make sure they are enforced.



You are doing the grown-up thing by still being nice despite miss attitude, and that is important.  You don't want to be dragged into any arguments, and the best way not to is to avoid taking this girl's bait.  You should remain professional as you are.



I would have a private discussion about this with your manager.  Proper attire and customer courtesy should be enforced with an iron hand or you are going to lose customers, and the business's reputation will be affected.  If the business had a dress code, no employee can dispute it and say "It's professionl attire to me."



You could also do the co-worker grading and make everyone aware that they are being graded so to speak, by their co-workers.  Anyone who gets a low grade is going to have to have a little chat with the manager to clean it up, or risk losing their job.



She sounds black, and lots of black women tend to have attitude; for better or for worse.  (yes I know, it sounds racist, but I have been around a lot of black women and they even admit this.)  This isn't going to go away, but she does need to figure out when it's apropriate to use it, and when it's not.



As far as the spelling, well, you need to pick your battles.  It is necessary for her job?  Is she writing speeches for the president, or just leaving sticky notes?



Anyways, keep up your professionalism, and have a chat with the manager and suggest an employee meeting where all the rules are talked about and how they will be enforced.

Largely speaking its how the west views the Orient (the east). The west is the Occident.



Edward Said wrote a book called "Orientalism" in which he tried to show that the Western writers are 'biased' (everyone is biased so it's no major news of his). The extension of this is that Westerners don't attribute all the debt we're supposed to owe the East (read "Islam") for our civilization. It's a means of preventing ciritique of Islam - as any criticisim of Islam is inherently 'biased', therefore not worth reading.



It's very popular theory amongst a certain age-group of historians. It's reflected in popular movies such as "Kingdom of Heaven"



The book has been answered already with "Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism"; a book written by Ibn Warraq.

I've heard of soapsuds enemas, but you have to be careful about what soap you use.  Ivory liquid or a baby soap is the most gentile and won't irritate the delicate tissues of the rectum.  Don't ask how I know, it's not what you think.

Well, sort of. my daughter was very constipated and she was 5 months old, i called my doctor and he recommended suppositories and i didnt have any, so my grandmother said back in her day lol they would cut a little piece off a bar of soap and make a little thing that looked just like a regular suppository, so i did it and it worked in about 15 seconds. So i ges the answer is yes



Source(s):



i also asked my doctor about it after the fact i did it and he gave a little laugh and asked if i called his mom, and he said it doesnt irritate or burn or hurt anything, and it works if u dont happen to have an actual suppository on hand.

Are you sure it was soap? Or was it a glycerin suppository? A glycerin suppository is a treatment for constipation. It is one of the safest things you can give a young child because they aren't actually ingesting any chemicals. I had to give one to my niece when she was only 2 weeks old because she was constipated and it was the only thing that could be done at her young age.

It could be when you are unhappy you have a warped view of other people and perceive them as trying to harm you, or don't notice when they are in fact trying to help. Or when you are unhappy you may behave irritable or depressed and you drive others away because frankly, unhappy people are not good company. However, yes people should learn to reach out to unhappy people a bit more, because everyone is going to be desperately unhappy at some point.

<question>



What is YOUR opinion on reverse-racism?



Let me clarify a little bit. Reverse-racism is where, to kind of apologize for the previous cruel racist status of white people, certain minorities get a huge bonus on their taxes and great scholarship opportunities.



I personally don't think this is right, because reverse-racism is actually being racist to while people now. I don't think the modern world should be "an eye for an eye".



I'm a believer that BET is a great channel for great comforts, but if there was a WET, it would but shut off after a day.



Here is an exact quote from somebody here on Yahoo "I mean we all know that most white people don't need scholarships like this because most of the time they already have money to pay for college but most blacks on the other hand have it harder because they just don't have the money so it makes sense that we have scholarships and you guys don't"



That does not make ANY sense to me. I have friends who have single parents, who work at stores like McDonald's and can't get a better job. They can't even pay for college. I know more white people like that than Blacks, or Hispanics.



My overall Opinion: make it actually EQUAL. Everybody in the world (well, usually) is a great mix of different races, where probably some in the mix were enslaved, mistreated, etc. I do not want a WET or anything, but why are we in the mindset that blacks can praise themselves but white people cannot? Trust us, we need the money.



Please tell me your opinion, even if its different from mine, so I can get a few ideas. I plan to go far with this.

The term "reverse-racism" is, itself, racist because it implies that the definition of racism is: "A white person hating someone of another race". This assumption is absurd. I actually heard a black woman, who was a member of the NAACP ("NAACP" is also a racist acronym), who said that white people are genetically predisposed to racism! We're genetically racist?! Genetically racist! What the hell kind of f*cking ridiculous junk science is that?!?!

Andrew, i see what you're saying. You are talking about affirmative action in essence. I do agree with you for the most part, but somehow a little bit I don't. I don't think people should be bending over backwards now to help minorities but on some levels I feel like sometimes they need a little extra help depending on the situation. While I was in sociology I learned that the average white male high school graduate makes more money in his life time than the Latina college graduate. That really isn't fair. I don't know, it is a really sticky issue. There was an affirmative action group on my college campus and all the member were hassling me to join just because I am black. When I said I didn't want to, I was looked down upon. So basically what I am I saying? I don't know. You do raise a very good point though. Life isn't fair. this is one of those occasions where life is more unfair and cruel to white people. Also I see what you're saying with BET. Black people created a channel like this (though it is now white owned) because there was little or no Black representation of our interest or desires in the media. The overall media and TV setup at the time, and for the most part currently, was catering to the Anglo-Saxon white majority. Now things are changing, and white people are not the majority in California but that still might not be represented in the media. I just want to say that I get what you're saying. I have white friends and they tell me the same thing. We get into friendly arguments because we don't agree but both parties can for the most part understand where the other is coming from.

Almost every day in work.
In my current job the management seem to believe they know best, however are letting their staff get away with murder. They are making decisions which will supposedly cut costs - however in doing so they are giving up all chance of checking on their staffs performance.



Every time I even try to reason with them... the outcome is the same.
"we are the management with our infinite wisdom and your view is worthless"



Never worth the effort.

Well, first -- look at THEM. Most of the time, people who spend all their time telling others what to do have plenty of issues of their own. If someone says, "you're this or that" or you need to do this or that -- don't automatically start listening to them and thinking, "hey.... maybe they're right... " They probably can't figure out their own life, so don't let them manage yours.  You just need practice making your own decisions on your own and sticking to them. Then, over time you'll get more secure and when people tell you to do things -- you might, if you think it's a good idea or you might just say, "uh, no -- I'm happy doing what I'm doing"  - but either way YOU'LL be making the decision :-)

It has always given me a headache, I don't know why but the smell of it makes it feel like someones crushing my head with a vice.. Anyway.. I started smoking it as I wanted to see what it was like, and my headaches stopped.



BUT..



I did alot of thinking about it, and I knew I'd been brought up better. Therefore I just stopped before I got addicted and whatever. I then got my headaches back and also hated it even more.
I really dislike the fact that my boyfriend smokes it.. and that everytime we go out thats all the conversation as most of our friends smoke it too. They never used to, but obviously peer pressure gets the better of some!



I try not to seem grumpy when my boyfriend is smoking it, he has cut down alot but I just want more from him. My only reasons are because of my headaches and that its illegal. I've been brought up better to know that its wrong.



I've spoken to him about it, and he just says the same thing everytime, ''you dont love me for who I am'' or ''your forcing me to quit''.
I just want me and him to work, but I'm far too stubborn to just 'put up with it'.. And I know I can do better.



What do I do?



</question>



<additional details>



By doing better I meant someone who doesn't smoke drugs..



And I'm asking a question not asking for ******* bitchy comments.

Never try and change someone - it doesn't work. You met him knowing he smoked cannabis so ultimately you're saying you accept it. Especially as you tried it yourself. He's right, that IS him and if you think you can do better then get out instead of whingeing about it.

It says:



Graphic pictures of throat cancer and rotting teeth are to appear on cigarette packets from Wednesday to illustrate the health risks of smoking.



Among the other images smokers will see are rotting lungs, a corpse in a morgue and a body cut open during surgery.



Do you think this is necessary? Why or why not?

I don't think it'll work.  Yes, the pics will be disgusting so I imagine some Internet whizz will start making decoarative cigarette boxes you can put your medical image pack in to.  But, smokers are addicted so a picture may shock but in most cases, won't stop them.

Theres a couple of the pics.



I think they are a good deterant, some people are smokers because they enjoy and will never give up, that's their chocie and their right.
However some people do try ti give up, and this may provide that extra incentive to go and get the gum, or get the patches.
Especially for young smokers, i think it particularly good. If you pick up a packet wanting to start, and see that....are you really going to buy them?
I know that peer pressure is hard to fight against, and at school it's hard if you don't fit 'in', but with smoking being shown in a progressively negative light, it might stop the 'cool' label cigarettes have and prevent children from starting.

Yes necessary - there is no benefit of smoking it is addictive and harmful anything that stops people smoking and not starting the better.  And this may help - banning it public places did.



I have heard all the arguments from smokers who say that it infringes their human rights they have rights to smoke etc....



But I have never met one who says they enjoy being addicted and everyone I speak to wants to give up but cant....



I am a former smoker (and therefore a hypocrite) and used all the same arguments to stop me admitting the fact that I was a prisoner to the tobacco companies and didnt have any freedom at all.

It's utterly pointless....a few weeks of morbid pictures arent' going to stop people. You have to be willing to quit, ready to quit. I am a smoker, and I have recently cut way back in efforts to quit. It's because I was ready to, and 6 months ago, had there been morbid pictures on the packages, I'm sure my friends and I would have just laughed at them...maybe even collected them. Again, just pointless. When you are a smoker, you KNOW what they do to your body. You don't need a picture of it.

How do you feel about " Made in China " ?



I am personally throwing everything out that even remotely deals with China I don't care if I have to live like a hippie, I will never ever again buy another product from China, how about you?



Christmas shopping is going to be odd ... They have had to many "accidents" for me now and I already bought mostly "USA" products but now.. I am cutting everything out.

Most of my large house items T/V's and such are either made in Thailand or Japan. I am fine with that.



Im waiting to see what else gets recalled from China. Its to risky.



Miss Grimm, well I guess thankfully your sister is older and not drinking the tainted baby milk that has killed 4 children in China huh? What was it, 54,000 sick was the last count 4 dead, Im just saying, sometimes reading the lable can save a life, they also recalled White Chocolate Bunnies in the US (thank god its not easter) for having the same crud in them. Also Lipton Milk Tea, Hope your sister does not drink that.. Made in China and has Melanamie in it..

Yes, it's possible to live w/o Chinese made products. But unless we go back to the 18 or 19 century life style, weaving, sewing, farming, tend your own cows to have some milk and cheese... I also have avoided C products as much as possible in the last few years. Definitely no food made in China. But the raw ingredients come from everywhere ?? You know. So I go to local farmer's markets and purchase locally grown, and organic USA products. But the electronics, light bulbs, stationary, just to name the few, impossible to avoid 100 %. I'm seeing items made in other Asian countries, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam... even Japan ? Encouraging signs.

The definition of 'war' is "the waging of armed conflict against an enemy," so therefore, it's natural whether armed or not. For instance, other animals like squirrels and birds would fight each other over territory, and that's a part of nature. The fact is we're smart and have more advanced technology to aid us in conflict, which is really no different than a regular fight, only nations are involved. It's animal nature to want to another for certain reasons.

Was Bob Marley really a rapist?



'When Rita Marley, in a recent interview, revealed that she had been raped by Marley during their marriage, I was forced to believe her. I believed her because she just could not be so stupid as to sully Marley's name with so heinous an infamy if it did not actually take place.'

Well, like any other marriage, we as outsiders never really know what goes on behind closed door between the two people involved. Many of us would like to think that Bob Marley (an advocate for peace) would not show us two faces.



But its always possible that she could be telling the truth. At times, fame, money, and an abundance of women can (and does) change a mans out look on life, and the difference between right and wrong. So honestly, we would never really know the truth (because we where not there).



Remember, there's a saying that goes there is three sides to every story; there's his side (which we'll never hear), her side, and what really happened. A persons perception of a situation can always have an affect on how the story is being told.



Edit: Cherry Pie, how old are you? You do understand that rape can take place between a man and his wife right? You do understand the concept of rape (meaning vaginal, anal, or oral penetration against some ones will; both male and female). I think you need to do some research on this subject matter prior to making uneducated comments. Think about this when you tell your husband you’re not in the mood and he still “takes him some” anyway. The more I read your comment the sillier and ridiculous you make yourself look to everyone here.

No he was a rap-ist..he talked during some of the songs..You have to wonder about why some people make the private details of their lives go public. If you love the man, and his art..then bless and appreciate him..is it possible he brought the world a message of peace and freedom from oppressors, and one love, but didn't get along with his wife? Does it matter?



I also heard John Lennon did heroin, wore a kotex on his head in a nightclub, and was bangin' another asain girl as a proxy for Yoko....does it matter? Does it diminish his legacy? I think not...Are you reminded to give peace a chance, and imagine a world free of religious warfare? I think so!

A few years ago when I was a young teen, my cousin had behavior problems and she was a prostitute. Her mother kicked her out of the house because grew tired of her, and she stayed with our family. Despite her going out having sex with random guys for money, she was like a big sister to me, and we always had a good time tonight. Well, during the night of April 28, I came home feeling upset and worried because of a fight I got into with a friend. My little sister was sleep, so I stayed up watching TV, still with that worried, shaky feeling. Also, during that night, when my mother tried talking to my cousin about the dangers of prostitution, they had a big argument. It woke up my little sister, and I was getting even more worried. I just had that feeling something really bad was going to happen. Then my cousin left the house when my mother told her not to. I remember, when she was leaving, I was crying when I begged her to stay, but she left anyways. Well, she didn't return home in a while, and we later discovered she was murdered by one of her costumers so he could rob and not pay her. It was a horrible year for everyone. I know it's just a coincidence, but it really did seem like I felt something bad was going to happen that night.

A University's students' union has stripped its lavatories of their genders so as not to offend transgendered people.
The ladies' lavatory at the University of Manchester's students' union is now simply called 'toilets' and the mens' as 'toilets with urinals'. Jennie killip, the women's officer said that the decision came after a number (although she refused to say how many) of complaints from transgendered students.

At my college in the 1960s, we had 3 sets of toilets.  The ones with urinals were called "Gents".  The ones where there were a number of traps but no urinals were called "Ladies".  The rest were scattered around the college and were just a room with a lavatory and a washbasin.  They were labelled "Suit yourself".



Manchester Students Union are actually breaking the law.  Although you are allowed to have unisex lavatories, you are also required to provide female only ones.

I blame the Union Rep who has nothing better to do than to comply with one or two complaints.  She should get tough and tell those who complained to go and and buy their own special toilets if they were so upset.



Personally I find the whole thing totally stupid, I know we have to be careful about what we say and name calling but for  goodness sake I feel sometimes that people are just too soft and are perhaps trying to make a name for themselves by thinking up another stupid scheme or idea.



Hey this is Britain, look what we have if you do not like it, or we offend you then do not come here, the choice is yours.  If you are offended by our traditions then tough, stop moaning and go about your life in peace and harmony.  End of.



If I was Prime Minister this is what I would say.  So there.

By pointing this out I fear that you a drawing attention to people who are different, so why do it.  Leave it as it is, especially if each cubicle has a door, then the whole thing is private.  What's the real problem, is it once again a small minority have a problem and we all have to jump to it.

You cannot be both Genders. There is nothing discriminatory about having a male and a female bathroom as it account for EVERYONE. It is the trans-gender student that needs to make the decision which toilet is appropriate. This isn't a case of being too politically correct, this is a case of overlooking the facts in a pitifull attempt at trying to please everyone.

Honestly the time and money being spent on this nonsense is too much.  Pick a gender, although I think that was already decided and go into the bathroom that most closely represents your sex.  Are we really trying to eliminate "men" and "women" so some self-appointed title nazi can feel good about heirmself?



What's next, foot washing stations for Muslims only but take down the crosses in the chapel because people *might* be offended?  Oh wait, that's already been done.

Everyone is different and it's safe to assume people have been bad ever since time began. Not everyone in the world can meet another person's standards, so therefore, we should leave the bad people alone, and not care about them unless they interfere with our lives.

The definition of 'war' is "the waging of armed conflict against an enemy," so therefore, it's natural whether armed or not. For instance, other animals like squirrels and birds fight each other over territory, which is a part of nature. However, The fact is we're more intelligent and we have advanced technology to aid us in conflict, which is really no different than a regular fight, only with the addition of nations, aircraft, and artillery. It's not only human, but animal nature to have particular reasons to fight.

It all narrows down to how to define Expectation. Relationships are inter-dependent in nature.



Take for Example, a mother asking her teenage daughter, to come home early.
U can call it Expectation, but it actually arises out of natural love and affection or more so, out of Concern for Safety.
Depends from which angle u look at things.



u can look at all relationships from an Expectation Free Angle.

A question about "African Americans"?



I was looking at a question and it asked why there is a month for "blacks, but not for whites." There were a lot of answers that said "There are eleven months out of the year for white people." I don't understand why some think that. I feel so hurt when they think they are treated bad and I know they have gone through a lot and still do. I want better for them, but I don't get why some of them feel whites are "over ruling them." I have never treated someone bad because of their race, and I feel that in the media there are equal whites and blacks, but I do feel their aren't has many other races.
Anyway, why do you or why do you think some blacks feel whites have eleven months of the year dedicated to white people?

Are you in history or if you have ever been in history? If you have or are what race did you study the most?
I think race is funny! What I mean is racial stereotypes!



Alright now I'm black and I'm 15 years old! I should be living in the hood or a bad neighborhood in poverty! I should walk around with a bad attitude giving every person that I see a bad look! I should also be a wearing hair extensions or a wig. And I should also be very promiscuous. And wear clothing that's either too small or too large for my body. I should not speak well or I should be receiving a bad education Well I'm neither of those things. And I don't fit those stereotypes!  Although I sometimes do wear large clothing because I suffer from bad self esteem and and poor self image of myself! I just don't know why!
And when people meet me they expect less of me and that's no what they get!
This is why I find stereotypes funny! Like Sarah Silverman! (I hope that I spelled her name correctly!)
And it's great that you don't judge people by the color of their skin! A lot of people do though! But they are not worth the effort!
Well have a great day!

You are wrong ten months of the year are for Chinese and Indian people as they make up one third of the human race! maybe more as Chinese and Indians are spread all over the globe! we may in the long run look like Filipino a little bit black. a little bit white, a little bit Asian,a little bit Oriental.

You must be just a child because it seems like you do not know much about what people continually go through on a daily basis. Yes, everyone is an individual and many people do not experience racism but ALOT still do. Just because YOU do not treat people badly does not mean OTHERS don't. Where have you been? Pick up a news paper or something.

We feel that way because in school that is the only history we are taught about.  More so than any other history.



As a Black woman, I can tell you more about European history and accomplishments than I can my own.



Why?  Because it isn't taught equally in schools.



Source(s):



The girl below me said "Blacks have it better today than ever, and they still aren't happy- they want more and more."



Don't you think White people want more and more when they dare to complain about there being Black history month?

Theoretically, the gregorian calender was made by half-white pagans



So all the names of the days, weeks and months are named after pagan gods, who are NOT all white. So even the basis of the calender is not white, I don't know why some people think americans invented the days of the week... its very ignorant.



I think alot, obviously not all, of african americans have superiority complexes, and don't know how racism works. Nobody opens their eyes and says "the jews got all the money" or "whites own the media", its all taught to you somehow, and this **** needs to stop if everybody truly wants to live in a multicultural/racial society.



Black history month is to celebrate the freedom of an unjust system after the confederacy, and has nothing to do with pride as alot of blacks would believe. Its not a time to walk around head-high and mighty if your black, its to honour the change that had to be made (abolishing racism, slavery and prejudice) to make a better country. And although lots of prejudice still exists today, black history month is to remember that although at one time an entire race was segregated, they are now a huge part of american history and what the country is today.



And just on a second note, don't feel bad for anything. Many many cultures and races were abused during the revolution/founding of america. Asians, irish, british, mexicans, blacks, everybody was treated badly at that time, racism was world-wide and accepted so its selfish for blacks to not acknowledge the suffering of other races in context to their own (is some african americans want compensation from white people for the slave trade, even though Mexico owned 65% of the WORLD pop of black slaves). It was government that enslaved races, using racism as a tool for division of civilians. Not one race controlling the other, that has -never- happened in american history, people need to get educated on where racism comes from and how it helps government keep their power.

I don't celebrate Black history month-  and all the people screaming about it today wasn't even there to be screaming about anything- Blacks have it better today than ever, and they still aren't happy- they want more and more- They say whites are racist-  yet we have Miss America, and they have Miss Black America, we have KKK, they have NAACP- they have welfare,and we have to work harder to support them- I am fed up with it all- why can't everyone just get along- and stop complaining about crap that happened so many years ago- Get over it!  Life is just unfair to all at times- white, black, yellow....we all get screwed eventually by someone or something!!

Women will NEVER be the equal of Men.



I'm not being controversial either!



Men are stronger. More intelligent, more instinctive, more inventive.



Women, in the main are mainly looking for men who will protect them and pay for their haircuts and new dresses. Have you noticed it's only ugly women who are feminists and why it's seen as a sign of success amongst women when one of them snags a rich footballer or banker?
Before I get a load of grief.....answer me this.



Would Coleen Rooney or Victoria Beckham have been as 'successful' as they have become without having married a rich footballer?

Not unless Angelina Jolie adopts you. No seriously, I wouldn't think you'd have much chance as a poor street child if you were in say India or some Asian or African country where social services aren't great. At least in the U.S or Europe you'd at least get an education and then aim high to get out of your situation.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of ignorant and emotionally disturbed people out there; and since no one in the real world wants to listen to their delusions, they come in here and dump it on us.



It's a shame, because they wreck it for those who see this forum as a serious way of communicating ideas.



Then there's that lame "freedom of speech" excuse.  Apparently, they don't realize that we have freedom of speech to tell them they're losers.

Why do people judge based on what others say...?



Why do people judge others based on what other people say about that person instead of getting to know that person themself? I have only 2 real friend where I live at,everyone else either pretends to be my friend or hates me and don't even know me. My husband and I have been married for 9 years we have two boys and we always like to have fun and play around a lot. Sure we are serious when we have to be,but most of the time we are fun loving people who do not like to be angry all the time. I think people view me as being a stupid,immature adult. Just because I am an adult,does not mean I have to act all snooty and angry all the time. We only live life once,and I don't plan on spending the rest of my life being a mean and crabby person. It's not that I am just looking for friends,but I wish people would stop listening to others who talk bad about me,and get to know me themself  before passing judgment on me(even though one has no right to judge) do I have a right to feel that way? Shouldn't we live life to the fullest and have fun doing so?

Because people would rather take the easy way out rather than spend the time to get to know someone.  Although for much of evolutionary history this trait has survived in humans because for a majority of the time it works, the sad truth.

Well I know what your saying I was at a party and this girl was giving me daggers all night, she was friends with my so called best mate.



The girl told me to my face she didn't like me I was shocked.
The thing was the girl who's party it was had told me she wanted to sleep with this girls hubby and they flirt a lot.
How do you think and what do you think I felt like saying to this girl who told me she didn't like me especially when I knew things that I would never do to her that her squeeky clean mate had already done.

You can't get a real answer unless you ask the hater personally. Seriously, we don't know the reason, but I can tell you every human being is different, meaning every human has different personalities. People were probably raised to make assumptions, to judge other before meeting them, or to be just plain mean. I think it's because of bad parenting or views on society. Chances are, they either spiteful because of a horrible life event, or their parents are mean too. I see you said, "My husband and I have been married for 9 years we have two boys and we always like to have fun and play around a lot. Sure we are serious when we have to be,but most of the time we are fun loving people who do not like to be angry all the time." Honestly, from that statement, if I lived in your area, I think I'd get along with you very fine. Now, what I just did was judge you in a positive light.

Who do you think is better in bed?



Ok so I have been with every type of woman out there. Black,white, Asian, Hispanic. I am rather hung (8 Inches long, but extremely thick.) In your opinion who do you think is better in bed? What type of woman or man does it for you?? I tend to find out that white girls give the best head, Hispanic girls will let you do anything to them. Black girls can ride like champ. And asian girls are so obedient. Chime in with your thoughts.



And please dont give me any racial remarks, it is a simple question and deserves a simple answer. No racism!

A voice in your head isn't sound.



As long as they can read, I'd say they do. That's what I consider a voice in your head, just like reading.



But if they can't read, how do they communicate to themselves in their head? Maybe just thinking of events and images.

Why are there so many brainless people on Y!A?



Maybe someone is going to say that I am one of them because I'm asking this question, but seriously... How many people are going to ask "Am I pregnant?", "Am I ugly?", "How do I get my cheating ex-boyfriend back?"? And P.S. incase any of you morons haven't noticed, when you ask a question a little bubble pops up on the right that says, "Wait, I think this question may have been asked already" and gives you a list of options. 10 points to the person with the best brainless experience here (give me an example of one of the most redundant questions you've seen). I already know why i just want to know if you guys agree or not.

They're asking questions, so what do you expect, them to be Albert Einstein? Also, there's nothing wrong with asking if you're ugly. it's better to hear it from strangers you'd never meet instead of close family members or friends. No matter how stupid the questions seem, people just want to know. Why not come to a site where thousands of people visit, and get quick answers? If you don't like the question, don't answer it. Simple as that. Also, majority of this site has been taken over by trolls, the rules are not being enforced correctly, and staff is automated. No questions asked.

Christianity. Just take a look at how many violent acts have occured throughout history in the name of Christianity, I'm sure it's alot easier to make a list of those than to make a list of violent acts done in the name of satanism.

most weddings i've been to have been pretty run of the mill...so when i marry my beau, i definately don't want run of the mill or tradition. I'm gonna hire a steel band, hand out lottery tickets instead of wedding favours, have a barbecue instead of a buffet, do the dollar dance with all my guests, wear a red dress and have a money dance instead of wedding presents (not as well as, it will look greedy!)

One friend's dad made a really awkward and clumsy speech about their falling out a year earlier - it's not the time and place unless you're making a grovelling apology!  Another friend's best man dragged out his speech waaaaayyy too long and people were bored of in-jokes after 35 minutes.



We went to one friends' wedding who had horrible food, they hadn't tried it and it was really cheap and nasty.  Think about what people like - nothing too exotic.



The worst thing at ours was the best man disappeared off to check into his hotel and held up all the photos and so there were loads we had to miss and we were really rushed :(  I've forgiven him... just.  On three hours sleep, I was a bit stressy and snappy at that point, and I regret that - count to ten, nothing matters that much.



The best... people were relaxed and enjoying themselves... we relaxed and enjoyed ourselves...



I also have a couple of regrets about not inviting a couple of old friends who I felt hadn't made much effort with me for a while - in hindsight I should have just included them because we've started to be friends again now. Although there's one acquaintance who thought she should be there who still isn't speaking to me (!) and I definitely stick to my rule of not having anyone there that you don't want there.



My most important advice is, I know everyone says it and you think you've heard them, but SAVOUR EVERY SECOND. It's over before you know it, and as long as you've got some great photos to remind you of each stage of the day, you'll never forget it.

My sister had a steam train to take her to the wedding and it broke down half way there with all the guests, bride, groom & vicar on board!!! Lucikly worked out ok in the end but was touch and go and meant the plan for the day had to scrapped and just go with the flow.



Don't get too stressed about it all and it'll be ok.



Other things - to much alchohol - worst thing I've seen is people getting stupidly drunk.  Bride and groom drunk is horrible for everyone, especially for them if they can't remember half of their wedding day/night and there's photo's of the bride in her dress kneeing by a loo being sick...



Best is always the smiles on the bride and grooms faces.  You only get proper smiles if you're relaxed though remember...

You could put a camera, and find out who the kids are, then once you doo look for them and talk to them or talk to their parents, dont yell.. first try to talk to them in a deep nice way, if  it  doesnt work , threaten them with the cops or yell at them, if that doesnt work either than hit them or throw eggs at their house but their parents should do something about it, so dont worry :)
GoodLuck, i hope they stop throwing =(

Put some flood lights outside so that your entire house is as bright as day. They won't be so interested in throwing things at your house if the whole neighborhood can see who they are. If the neighbors complain just tell them you are only going to keep the lights on until the vandalism stops maybe this will get the neighbors involved in helping you.

I hate when kids act like brats!  Especially when they are damaging my things!  If you have bushes outside, I would sneak out there and wait for them.  You can then either take photos of them in action, or come up with a method to scare the **** out of them.  Maybe download a sound that sounds like a shotgun cocking and have it ready to play?  I'm not sure I helped, but hope you can resolve the issue.

Wow! Sounds like a bad situation for sure. I think that if I am experiencing this then possibly my neighbors are as well. Maybe try going door to door and starting a neighborhood watch program. The city will usually put up signs once it is established and recorded with the local law enforcement. There are websites to show you how to get started. Then, if I could, I might try being a friend to these kids, showing them that although they can cause others pain, they also have potential and value and there are other options with there time. If you can get the leader to listen to you in any way possible (paying him for work done, etc.) then likely he will influence the others to "lay off my friend."

That all depends on lung capacity and how much you inhale each time you "puff".



The time between puffs and the weather can all change the time it takes to smoke one cigarette.

I don't think smokers are bad people UNTIL they inflict their habit on me.



I assume you are smoking near them for you to believe that to be the cause of their looks..? If I have to inhale your toxic air, then I will give you a filthy look, the same I would if someone let gas off near me.



Do what you like in your own home with willing companions (i.e. not children) but the moment your filthy (and stupid as you know it harms you) habit encroaches on my right to breathe fresh air, that's when I think you're being bad.



And that includes at train stations, in high streets, or right outside the door the building I'm trying to enter!!



But I'm not writing off smokers altogether, some are considerate and care about how their actions affect others - I'm talking about the mothers smoking over their own baby's buggy, or in the car with all the windows closed... or the man on the station platform standing upwind from me when I was stood there first.



Actually, this may come across as really wrong, but I'll chance my arm, but I always say to my husband (who smokes socially when drinking) that I see smoking as a weakness.  Addiction is letting something be in control of you rather than the other way around, and I hate thinking of him as a weak and pathetic person - I think he's very strong and determined, and I hate cigarettes for making him appear any less than that.

i hate smokers because they only care about their satisfaction. i'm at the bus station all the time. they have TWO areas reserved for them, but every time i sit down, they feel the need to smoke right next to me in the NON-smoking section. they can't read, or can't see or just dont care. me sitting next to a smoker is no different then me actually smoking. its bad enough the air is already dirty and they are helping to contaminate it all because they want to inhale poison. i almost have no respect for smokers because they dont respect or take into consideration if other people smoke when they sit next to someone. i lose my rights to sit at a non-smoking area becuase of them!



and yes they are dumb, they know its dangerous to their health but they do it anyway? what would posses someone to try this when they KNOW the risk? that doesn't make ANY sense at all.

No, I am never jealous of other women.  Why don't you lose weight and instead of being on the outside looking in you can be on the inside.  Not that insecurity is all about looks, but if you feel better about yourself you will be happier and less likley to have negative feelings towards others that only harm you in the end by causing bitterness, which is poison for your soul.

I hate feeling like I have to be some gym addicted, high maitenence twit with an eating disorder just to fit in.  I totally feel your pain.

i hate to admit that i get jealous too. i try not to be mean to them just because of my own insecurities but i dont necessarily go out of my way to be nice. this jealous trait never kicked in until i started dating my boyfriend-which it has now been a year and 4 month-tdy actually. i think it has part to do with my protective nature--and not wanting him to see anyone else that looks "more appealing" than me. the best way to deal with these feelings is to try n look your best-make yourself feel beautiful and remember that everyone is beautiful to someone. i dont think im ugly-but i can get myself real down by looking at a girl who does herself up really nice!! but my boyfriend says nice things that he thinks im "hotter" lol or beautiful. im lucky to have him, but anyways, by your comment im assuming you might be overweight. honestly, working out will build your confidence sooooo much!! and when you see results, even minor results, youll love yourself that much more. best of luck hun.. :-)

Negative. More people means more stress on our already stretched resources. More people means more carbon footprints which contribute to global warming, melting ice caps, and starving polar bears. More people means less food, less air, less space.  More people means more congestion, more wars.

I would have said suicide bombers as guns aren't only to kill people with... but what the heck else can you do with an extremist wrapped in dynamite blowing themselves up in the name of god in a highly populated area.... i'm pretty sure they weren't trying to catch their dinner.



Sure guns kill people, but it's the operators that end up killing.



I'm not for guns, but I'm not against them. They are a right to us. Plus hunting is fun... suicide bombings aren't typically fun....

No, because hand to hand combat there is much more likelihood of being injured defending yourself.
You make the assumption that without guns there would be no violence. I'm pleased that you are pacifistic but, not everyone is.

What do you think was wrong with this guy (from an outsiders point of view)?



Yesterday, I was over at my Nans with my cousins. They suddenly pointed out the window at this guy running past her house. He was wearing tracksuit bottoms and a grey top, but was running with no shoes on. We found this to be rather odd, especially when he started kicking his legs up and kneeing himself on the head and flapping his arms. My cousins drove past him later and he apparently looked very vacant, not with it and was doing swimming actions at the side of the road. What caused this bizarre behaviour, drugs? And I happen to work in a mental health ward, if its connected with a mental illness, but he was outside last night. Am a little concerned that he will try and do something stupid eg to someone or himself by running in the road or attacking someone. What should I do if he approaches me (I only carry an attack alarm in work!)

if he approached me i would just walk away, not in a rude way but jst make an excuse and leave if he started trying to talk to me. if u are reli worried about wht he might do then make sure that when u do go out that someone is with u and ur not alone. i would also keep my phone within good reach from my hand if he came near me and maybe get someone snumber up on the screen so that if trouble does break out then u can just phone them and get help. this said he might just be a nice guy whos a bit crazy, so i wouldnt stress out over it he might not mean any harm.. also i would tell ur family, or whoever u are going to call if he does approach u, the situation and that a call from you might mean u need help so they should always answer the phone.

<question>



Why are some people so self-absorbed and have a sense of entitlement?



I was at the store today, and was looking at a display of DVDs. Out of nowhere, some older "gentleman" lurched in front of me and started looking at the same thing. It wasn't one of those situations where he was off to the side and looking . . . I was literally forced to look at the back of his neck.



So, I muttered something like, "Thanks for being a jerk", and wandered up the aisle.



I suppose it was wrong of me to react in such a way, but I am just astonished at the rudeness and "tough sh*t if you don't like it" attitude that I find when I go shopping and elsewhere in public. On the highway, in a restaurant, or wherever.



Should I have maybe said in a polite tone, "Excuse me, but I was looking at this first", or perhaps, "I'm sorry, but can I have you move over a bit so I can also see. Thank you"?



Maybe the guy had Alzheimer's for all I know. Still seemed like he was rude though.

Serious question- Does MJ like black women? ?



I know he dated one during the time he was filming "The Wiz" but on the interview "Living with Michael Jackson" he said his first GF was Tatum Oneal and he met Tatum around 1979 and he Stephanie Mills in 1975.. What is that all about ?



I'm a big fan of MJ's and I'm a Ethiopian girl but I'm scared if I meet him what he would think....Whatever

Look at what he did to himself, he represents self-hatred at it's finest. His mother is black and sisters, it would definitely be ignorant of him to hate black women or black people. He's a business man and probably wants to make more money so it would be in his own interest to be welcoming to all of his fans regardless of race.

Sweet 16 parties are given mostly because it is the age you can legally drive in the US. It may have come from both Jewish (spiritual maturity) and Spanish (Quinceañera) traditions. But the tradition has become a commerical success because of MTV shows "MY SUPER SWEET 16".

I don't really know... but it really is a tradition. I guess it is because you are closer to being an adult and it's also the official driving age and also the age you can be to get a job. *shrug* that is the way I see it as being. don't get me wrong, it's a really fun thing to do, almost like a birthday party from when you're little, but more mature (though sometimes it is not) ;)

Dressing in a matter that looks different then everyone else. If everyone else is wearing jeans and t-shirts then wearing a bright colored suit or dress will definitely stand out. Women typically dress in revealing clothing to show off their cleavage and legs, men love to show their arms or muscles. In order for a person to be considered attractive, they have to get noticed and dressing differently to standout is the first step.

Why are the "Boy Scouts" tolerated?



Are boy scouts, as in the association, just molding kids for future work in service. Ranks, badges, flag ceremonies, it seems like a lot of former boy scouts are out there ready for a life of active service and killing. Wikipedia states that;



"The BSA has policies which prohibit atheists, agnostics, and "known or avowed" homosexuals from membership in its Scouting program; both youths and adults have had their memberships revoked as a result. The BSA contends that these policies are essential in its mission to instill in young people the values of the Scout Oath and Law" ..as well as a no girl policy.



-Which basically means, they're not allowed because they think all of the aforementioned is "evil".
So why is this group of homophobes, extremeists and sexists allowed to endure?

its a private orginization, they can let it (or anot let in) anybody they want.  I was in it for most my childhood, it could definately be looked at as preperation for the service, but I think its more of a preperation for life itself, Ive always been an outdoor entusiast and learned a lot from the scouts but I never joined the military

Your last sentence shows that you share the same sentiment you profess to abhor in BSA.  Why should you be tolerated and not BSA?  Seems as if you're simply trying to provoke someone instead of taking responsibility for your own feelings.

Here lately, I have had more and more people blatantly tell me that their job is more important than mine, ?



Because I work in my own home. I've had people contradict me more and more, insult me more and more, think my time is less important than theirs- is this just something everyone goes through? When I stayed at home and didn't even work, I didn't catch this kind of flack

How would you deal with a school that prohibits unusual hair styles?



My 14 year old son is going through a phase where he is dying his hair (blue).  He has been doing this for a few weeks and hasn't had any problems at school related to his hair color.  Well last night he had my wife give him "liberty spikes".  This morning, he went to school but was stopped in the hall and sent to the front office to go home and "fix" his hair.  The principal's issue with the hair was that it was "too disruptive".  Now even though I don't care for the hair style (color or spikes), I don't care that the school discriminates on his individuality/expression.  I know plenty of the kids at his school have multiple piercings, tattoos, clothing taste, and other hair styles that many people would disagree with but are permitted to attend school with.



Would you push the issue with the school and if so, how would you proceed?



Oh, we're in central Maryland and it is a public high school.

I would ask to see any written rules concerning hair style, if they are there I would expect that they are vague and open to interpretation.



You could quite Simply say that this is discrimination and that your son should not have to "fix" his hair unless every pupil at that school has to have their hair its natural colour.

Well this is a tough question. Its a question about attitude. The first thing is the color of hair is more noticeable than other things as piercing or tattoos. First u can fix his hair and then ask the school that my son is asking why can't i have my own individuality. If u don't fix is hair now, it'll be a matter of disobedience. It can effect his future life. So handle this situation carefully.

I teach college English.  I never cease to be amazed at how much energy public schools put into humiliating the students and how little they put into teaching them things such as how to communicate in a way that affords them the chance to be heard and to be respected.



People easily grow out of experimental fashion, but have a much harder time remediating for educational neglect in high school.  I think a little mention of going to the media on this might do the trick.  I have a son who is in his twenties now, and on this issue, I would go toe-to-toe with the principal.

How can I look like a teenager again? [Preferably ages 15-16]?



2 questions actually.



--Alright. I need open minded / non judgmental people to help me out here.



I'm 17, Going to be 18 and honestly... I'm not ready to grow up. I was forced into alot of it at a young age. And I want to look like a teen and do child like stuff.



I eat kid foods, I want to go trick or treating, play with barbies, play with toys In general. Get presents on Christmas.



So 1st--
How can I physically look that young? I look about... 19 now. Short, Heavy. Maybe if I lost weight I'd look more my acquired age. Could there be hair styles? Clothing? Make-up to do this?



And 2nd-- What do you think about me wanting to stay a kid a little bit longer until I'm ready to grow up? I know you all don't know me but I didn't get to go to high school. Hard to explain, but 13-16 I stayed inside due to us needing to stay out of the public because of whole thing with my family after us. Had do change houses so no-one knew where we were and everything.  So I guess you can see why I want to be a teen slash kid again since I missed out on so many years. But do you think this is wrong as long as I'm not hurting anyone?

awhh sweetie :(
it sounds like the growing up you were forced to do quickly has had abit of an effect on you...



true, it's not really normal to want to be playing with barbie and toys at 17 but as you say it's not hurting anyone -- what i'm most worried about for you is your psychological development :(



it might be good to have a friendly chat with a doctor and explain what's been going on as it could be a chemical imballance in your brain and not just a nostalgic thing...



remember there are lots of good things about being an adult including the clothes you can wear, experimenting with make-up and hanging out with friends as well as later bedtimes and better movies :)



don't feel like an outcast or that you'd be upsetting someone by feeling the way you are feeling - it's going to take time to adjust again.

I know you've been through alot but part of the reason being a kid is so great is that everything you do, you do with the intention of being more grown up. You've been deprived of a childhood and hurt but are you sure this is the best way of coping with things?



You can still go trick or treating, eat happy meals at Mcdonalds, chuck tempertantrums and everything that's fine...but looking like a kid and playing with barbie dolls is a bit extreme.



If you missed your childhood so much you don't you volounteer at the children's hospital and help other people also missing out on childhoods and possibly the rest of their lives. I know you don't want a lecture and if playing with dolls makes you happy, no one can dare judge you...



On another note, try wearing summer frocks and your hair in two pig tails.

You say just until your ready to grow up. I'm hoping you can at least speed up the process a little since there is no stopping growing up. Once you have grown up and have learned how to deal with responsibility you can be any way you want in private. Even like a teenager as long as its a responsible teenager. We all wish what you wish so your pretty much normal in that department.

LMAO...Yup - it's called Guy Fawkes Day and its celebrated in England on November 5 (I think).



The effigy isn't burnt because he's Catholic - he's burnt because he was caught in the plot to blow Parliament up during the reign of King James I.  It was a conspiracy that was designed and almost carried out by primarily English Catholics.  Their reason for this was because they were severely penalized because of their Catholicism.



Yeah - life sucked for English Catholics (as well as Scots & especially Irish) for a long time, but the holiday is to celebrate the capture of Guy Fawkes (who, most likely was an unfortunate patsy) and the prevention of the attempted destruction of an important part of the English government (not JUST the monarchy).  If it makes you feel any better, my dear - James I was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots - who herself was Catholic (James was raised Protestant though).



Course in America - which some take this view - we celebrate a holiday that is associated with us taking land from native inhabitants on this continent (Thanksgiving).  So I guess it's all relative.

i often wonder what women in their 40's are thinking trying to dress like their 16 yr old daughters.



or 2 people obviously in love often seem like a highly unlikely couple.



the worst ones are the 14 or 15 yr old girls that are pregnant. i wonder about the parents of these kids.

i always people watch. i am mostly fascinated by the inconsiderate, self-absorbed people... i cant help but wonder where they came from, what their childhood was like, if they feel they are doing the right thing, or if they dont even acknowledge the people they inconvenience or put in danger.  i wonder what people are thinking and feeling when they knowingly do something illegal or immoral or just dangerous (yeah, much of it is driving related) I wonder if they are that closed off to their hearts and reality that it doesnt even phase them... i seriously have to stop myself so i dont feel the need to disappear from this lack of humanity.

I want more out of life?



I really want more out of life...I mean I'm grateful for all that I have and I understand that in a way that I am blessed but I really hate my life right now...My mom is flat broke and she refuses to get a job...she depends on my stepdad for everything...who by the way seems to manage to screw everything up...he let his friends tear up 2 of our cars and he messed up the last one...He moved my mom, my older brother, me and my little sister down to Atlanta to persue a music career and none of his artists are doing anything!!! They actually hate him and they just use him to have a place to stay (OUR HOUSE!!!) for free...I tried to get a job but my mom made me stop looking for one to focus on school...I tried doing a little job like cutting grass for my neighbors for some money but as soon as I got it my mom took it and had to spend on gas money to pick up my stepdad from Chicago because he let his friend borrow his keys and they lost them. And then on top of that I hate having to sit back and look as this one girl basically lives the life I want...her dad is rich, she gets anything she wants (including the guy I want), and now she thinks she can rap but she can't, and her voice is really loud and annoying! I just think its unfair that other people who really don't diserve things just get them handed to them while I have to sit back and watch my dreams go down the drain thanks to somebody else (my parents).

<answer>



It may be Edinburgh.



In 1696, Britain introduced a tax on the number of windows in a house, which was believed to be a proxy for the size of the house and hence its value (Grinath, 1988). Clearly, the number of windows may be correlated with house value, but such a tax would place equal levies on homes with equal number of windows regardless of location or state of repair. The tax may also lead to underconsumption of windows. When homeowners attempted to replace windows with other methods of letting in air and light, the tax was expanded to include all other forms of ventilation. A whole row of houses was built in Edinburgh, without a single window in the bedroom storey of the homes. Other homeowners would stop-up windows and then reopen them after the assessor had been by their house. The Window Tax remained in effect well into the 1850's.

Its an interesting question.  Some people you avoid just because they look dangerous or scummy.  Yet I know of a guy who can't help the fact that he is amazingly ugly, but is a really nice guy, honest, a good worker, etc.  But people do avoid him like the plague as you said.  I usually think beautiful people of either sex are unapproachable or hopelessly stuck on themselves and frankly most of the time that proves to be true, but then you also sometimes get people who are astoundingly beautiful (or handsome) and are actually very kind and unassuming.  Appearances do count, its biological, a large per-centage of our brain is dedicated to facial recognition and whats attractive and what isn't has origins in both biology (healthy looking-good, unhealthy-not) and cultural (fat is good in some cultures, thin in others).

I would not be honest if I say no.I may not be as open to someone who is dressed and acts like a gang member who wants to rob me .Just an example.Other people may not want to be around overweight or mentally challenged people.Or maybe they would not approach someone beautiful or athletic.People just have phobias and pre judgments of people weather they admit it or not.All I can say is give people the benefit of the doubt and get to know them and as a person.At times I have thought "she is so beautiful she must be stuck up."she was not,she was.very friendly and we are best friends .Don't judge people by their wrapper,look inside.

Yes, all the time. You should meet my parents. They don't speak english and I do everything for them: finances, problem solving, work issues, doctor appointemts, dentist appointments, sorting out documments and then more usual things like house chores. I'm only 16 here! Anyway all I get in return is a whole load of complaints and threats if i don't do something for it. Frankly I'm getting sick of it... they're taking me for granted and soon I'm going to quit.

All the time. Even more so in the past.

I had to learn the hard way that this is not always true. So i just basically cut everyone off & now i only talk to my family. They were taking me for granted also, but im stuck with them.

yes. A little too much. I'm the type of person who always tries to do the right thing, but sometimes the right thing doesn't pay off so then I feel frustrated. My family , my friends, all take me for granted... hopefully one day they'll see that they are pretty lucky to have me.

Yes, I often feel that way, especially at work. It's way worse when they tell you that they actually care about you, but then when they don't need you anymore -- and you need their help -- they're gone. So much for loyalty...

So I have a tip for people like me. Never mind that they tell you how much you mean to them. Treat them like you want to be treated, anyway. But if you see that they talk **** about others behind their backs, when you know they pretend they care about them, you can tell that they are not very sincere about what they say. (Sorry about the run-on sentence.)

"Why does Canada not speak up?"

That's a good question. Indeed, Canada is certainly a peaceful country ... but what exactly do they do to promote that peace? Nothing. These days, Canada seems to be like an observer of the world. The Canadian government could speak up about many issues to the world, the Canadian government could help do something about genocide, but they don't. Why? Because like most western countries, they're only concerned about achieving more wealth and prosperity within their own nation. So long as Canada is prospering and there are no threats to Canada … their government really couldn’t be bothered to care about what’s going on in the rest of the world. These days, the closest a Canadian will get to "speaking up" is watching CNN and proudly boasting "Shame those Americans don't have "free" health care ... but we do!!"

Scottish people are British! If you mean the English then there's no real hatred there, although the English are often stereotyped as arrogant. All of the Celtic countries tend to gang up on England  but it's usually just sports rivalry etc. We're all British at the end of the day.

Whoa. Your geography and history need a little working on. Here's a little reprieve though. I arrived at a station called Berwick-upon-tweed and figured I was in England until a Scottish guy at the station told me I was in Scotland. Then met an English guy who reassured me I was in England. It went on all day. They all smiled through it though. Know what I'm trying to say?

The Scots, the Welsh and the Irish are of Celtic origin.  The English and the Celts have a long history of oppression and violence.

Time has healed many wounds, but some remain tender to the touch.

While most Brits are civil to each other, it might be best not to bring this subject up at the local pub.

Scots are Brits.

Britain  = England, Wales and Scotland.

Are you referring to the English?

And why are you lumping all  English (and Welsh?) people together - and claiming that everyone in England and Wales is "smug and arrogant" - thats very racist and prejudiced.  Have you met every English/Welsh person in the country? No? Then you're not in any position to make sure comments.

There are 100s of years of history between England and Scotland which is why there is friction between them

This answer is a slam dunk.

It's George W. Bush, of course.

Why?  Because he is a war criminal.  He has the world's most powerful and dangerous job, and he has performed as a fool would.  A fool willing to sacrifice American lives and billions of dollars for a cause that clearly was not true many years ago.  Like any coward, however, he was unable to admit he was wrong.  He cannot admit he made a mistake.  He should have been impeached and voted out of office 3 years ago, but our congress is too spineless.

The world will exhale with a gigantic sigh of relief come the end of January next year.

Worldwide, I've have to go with George Bush. The man is a a**hole.

However, Gordon Brown isn't exactly Mr Popular in the UK at the moment. The second he becomes PM the economy crashes. Go him :P

But yeah I agree with others who say Robert Mugabe, although I don't think he's despise, as in my opinion the media hasnt given it enough attention, and he's just being let to do what he wants.

Hope this helps,

Why are Hollywood movies absolutely useless



Hollywood has three stories:

1. Aliens invading the world.
2. American superhero saving the world from destruction.
3. Some crazy teenage girl with long black hair stalking and killing her prey.

Batman wasn't great either. It's the typical Hollywood movie - some guy blowing things up and an American hero saving the city from destruction. Seriously, why is Hollywood absolutely useless? People talk about Bollywood having no variety, Hollywood's the same crap.

Hollywood should make movies based on real life ie, Americans falling into debt; facing high gas prices; facing evictions from houses; facing inflation; buying Made in China products; watching their country dive into humongous debt as China and India emerge, don't ya think?

Take a deep breath, it's just the summer escapism. There are plenty of small independent films out there, they just don't get humongous distribution contracts with the near-monopoly theaters. You could sling some blame at the giant theater chains for that.

Collecting a survey for neighbourhood watch?



How exactly do you conduct a survey of resident to establish a neighbourhood watch scheme in the Republic of Ireland?

Should it be done door to door on a single A4 or an individual A4 to record each residents opinion?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Why don't you ask the neighbours? If you want to set up a neighbourhood watch, it's useful if you are friendly first so that they will want to look after your house. If they are friendly, then ask them for their thoughts not ours.  I would say single A4 though, better for the tree!

<question>



Why is the UK more expensive than USA



Ive converted all the prices to the US dollar as you can see

2 bedroom flat average
London $1,667
New York City $200

Petrol average
UK $10
USA $4

So guess your wages are lower than in the UK to even out the spending. So all your products must be very cheaper than ours. My friend who have been US to shop said everything is very cheap.

Why dont people here in the UK save all their money and spend it in the USA aint the USA like an all year half price sale to us.

Why is this is it because the fact in the UK there as so many benefits for immigrants and the unemployed. If so why are there many ghettos in the US compared to the UK we must have some rich poor people.

I get paid $60 a week by the government for going to college 
Every two weeks $176.54 if your over 18 and have no job and not in education its not much but if your living in your parents home is kind of a treat.

i dont know about any other benefits but this one
$754 a week if you were injured from working ever again or mentally injured many people live of this when they can work anyways

Do you have the same system in the US for college, unemployment & injury at work?

I think I need to save all my money and buy a holiday home in the US when im older.

Why is the richest country in the world, US cheaper than the like 10th richest UK

Lol, I love that fact that you've converted all that into dollars for the American yahoo users! The UK has always been more expensive than the US, because we are richer people (in terms of wages etc) we pay a hell of a lot of tax on practically everything here but we're not the worst for prices (apparently Norway and Sweden are really bad). I love your idea of buying a 'holiday home' in the US but the flights would probably skint you out! Don't forget though, the US do not have the NHS, they have to either have medical insurance or pay for their treatment which is very costly, that's one excellent thing about the UK.

i thought the same thing that is why i want to work in the uk or canada so i can make a sh!+ load of money. the reason we have more money as a country is because we have like 250 million more ppl than england. when you think of americans think of us as overworked underpaid and underphucked. i work 2 jobs go to college pay taxes and  get a little assistance but not alot. The poor people in this country get free health care, free college (financial aid grants), free food(food stamps, ebt), housing (reduced rent based on income), section 8 (basically free housing), free dental work until 21 yrs old, child circuit(free or reduced childcare based on income), and free heating gas. i only qualify for food stamps and free college only because my parents are deceased.
Whats even more phucked is all the ppl in there mid 20's-30's even 40's still living wid mommy and daddy because it is hard to have a place of your on with the economy being so bad.



unemployment only pays you half of what you use to make for up to 7 months.

we dont get paid to go to college but if your poor you go for free.

workers comp is only half of what you use to make.

Social Security is for:

disability its around $1000 a month and add additonal $1000 for each child you have.

if your husband or wife passes you get the same as disability.

if your mom or dad passes away its around $700 a month

senior citizens get paid dont know how much.

if you make alotta money than you qualify for social security but not for welfare or finacial aid.



In the UK the benefits seem to be better from what you explain so why do people wonder why so many immigrants are going over there. its obvious they want a better life. can you blame them to the idiot that was talking about immigrants.

First off, "Eleanor Rigby" has it all wrong. I know I shouldn't say that because, being an American, I couldn't possibly know anything, right? Do humor me. Several things are in play here:

a) Good luck trying to find anything for $200 in NY or anywhere else, rent control notwithstanding.

b) Fuel prices are as much a function of the economies of scale as anything else. From higher demand comes higher production, meaning a lower production cost per gallon. So too are the l taxes on fuel lower here (as a percentage) than in the UK. But before I read the latest diatribe about spoiled Americans, consider this; the average long-haul trip on the Continent is roughly 360 miles. I routinely truck 2,180 - ONE WAY. The adjusted price, seemingly near double in the UK, does not at all reflect the multiples of distance we face here. I live in Phoenix, Arizona. In a trip merely to my brother's house I'll drive 45 miles, also one way. And he lives in Phoenix metro too. In the militarty I used to drive from Heathrow to Holyloch. I'll take those distances any day, and at the UK fuel price, over what I shell out here at ours.

c) The broad social safety net Brits love to brag about costs money, and lots of it, aggravated further by the nature of any bureaucracy to waste it. Cool by me, but the higher prices typically found in the UK are a function of the much higher marginal rates Brits pay. Taxation is passed by business on to the consumer, and it can be no other way. In America we tend to be suspicious of the teeth-gritting love that is government. I share that suspicion, and would rather have my freedom and my earnings to spend as I like than live in a nanny state. We are citizens, not subjects; again, these are choices we all make.



d) The dollar, after years of being too high, is now much softer. This means that, at least for now, your money goes even farther here than it used to. "Eleanor" might take note of that. I hear New Jersey Wal-Marts are having a sale on e-large knickers.

I lost everything that I thought made "me" a number of years ago;
I lost my husband, marriage, children, family, home, farm, business...and I suffered from Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, leftover nonsense from Cancer... I lost the will to live, yeah.



It was not so much that I wanted to die, as that I just didn't want to slog through the struggle of living. I'd get through one day, and then there would be a whole nuther one to get through. It was rough. It was exhausting.



At one point, I was attending a group function and the leader of the group passed around paper and crayons and told us to draw ourselves and our life. I just sat there, and after about ten minutes, I got up and walked out.

I kept going to my support group because, well, because they told me to. I just kept going. After about 6 wrenching, horrendous years of work, I had the stunning revelation one day that I had been the one chosen to go through this ghastly gawdawful atrocity because I am the one who can survive it. And more than survive it, I am the one who can go on to find peace and even happiness, and stand witness for those who come after me, who think that their situation is not survivable.



You are not fooling, I remember long days of sitting on a sofa, staring at the wall, unable to decide to even eat or get dressed. Thank goodness for my little cat, who I carried out of the holocaust in my arms, and thank goodness for those people who said, "See you tomorrow night"...wherever the  support group meeting was the next night, they made sure to gently remind me that I was wanted and needed there, and when and where to show up.



So not only is it possible to lose the will to live, it is possible to get it back, as well. Thank you for asking.

Why have British people adopted American names?



Names like Jessica, Jason, Justin, Ashley etc are quite common in England.
What happened to British names like Doth, Queeny, Elizabeth, Sir Cheerio, Sir Crikey, McStewart, Sir Thomas, etc?
I think it may be due to the spread of the American culture - that America represents modernity, so people wanna follow it. What do you guys think?

Erm...its not the 16th century anymore...no one has names like that. Apart from Elizabeth, that's still a nice name.

And the names aren't necessarily American. Surely it doesn't matter. And the Americans started over here in the first place. So essentially you're all British anyway. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I like my accent =]

We have lots of people who were born here who are making a packet out of benefits.

When people come over here and work I wonder what they think of all the people on benefits who can actually work but don't.

It's not hard to get a good job these days if you make a good impression and have the right attitude. It's maybe not racist, but it is a bit harsh. But you are English (I'm Scottish), where you can get a good education for nothing which will enable you to get a good job... these people come here to improve their quality of life. And a bit of good grammar wouldn't go amiss either. Might help you in your searching for a job :D.

Yes you are racist..but at the same time no.  If you do research you will find that immigrants have little effect on the job market as they fill gaps and do jobs that no one else wants.  Most pay taxes and do everything properly.  Its some that ruin it for everyone else.

They work their butts off Doing night shifts etc (in YOUR shops) which you are too lazy to do, to keep this economy up and running, because hun it would collapse if THEY didn't do labour work for YOU , THEY pay all the taxes just like you do! They also spend money in YOUR shops!! They earn by hard work, just like everybody else

They do all of the labour work to make it a better country for you.. yet they aren't recognised, THEY are still seen as outsiders and it will always be YOUR country... and YOU will alway give THEM S**** :)

I see where you are coming from but I think its more down to the UK not being a contribution based state. I now live in Spain and here you only get out of the system what you put in. I have no problem with anyone who becomes successful through hard work and please don't forget that initially immigrants were encouraged to come to the UK to do the jobs that English people wouldn't do. My gripe is with respect for culture it seems very one sided. I now live in spain and as a guest in that Country I am encouraged to learn the language follow Spanish law, respect their traditions and customs. The Uk seems to have opened its doors to too many people and in an effort to encourage integration heterosexual anglo saxon people have less rights than the minority groups who now control the country. I wasn't happy with the way that the country was being managed and with the way that my culture was being eroded and when I saw how many asian lawyers doctors and law students were entering the universities it left me in no doubt that it will only be a few years before ethnic minority's become ethnic majority's. For my sanity and well being I decided to embrace a new country and a new culture by moving to Spain. I am now please to be a guest in that Country and although I am treated fairly and with respect I am under no illusion that I chose to join this country and accept its customs and cultures and I have no right to try and change any of them. If at any time I dont like the way Spain workd I can always return to my mother land. If the immigrants in the UK thought like this there would be alot less racism

Yes, yes you are racist as you seem to think you deserve more than them because you are english.
OK so what are you 14?
First thing is first how can they live off "your" taxes when you dont work so you are not paying anything, they wont be receiving benifits or anything if they are working here btw, if anything you ******* living off their taxes because they do the work lazy asses like you cant be bothered to do to be honest, because obviously you dont work do you?
There are hundreds of jobs in the papers and hundreds more in job centres and then even more with agencies.
Bottom line it is not your money, not your jobs not you shops not your nothing, you have to earn something if you want anything just because you are english doesnt mean anything is owed to you.

Nah, it's not racism, it's xenophobia (aka fear of foreigners).

What you probably don't realise is that every working foreigner pays taxes and National Insurance too.

And what about the Brits who live off "your" taxes by making a lot of kids, living off the dole and receiving benefits? Are they justified because it's "their" country?

Every time you think about the foreigners coming to this country, think of all the Brits who are leaving this country for a better life somewhere else, like Spain. Poor Spanish must probably think the same about all these Brits who come and take their jobs and their benefits.

Very interesting question. Have a read of 'critical social psychology' and 'discourse analysis'.

The ';us/them' debate is actually a bonafide discussion which talks about the 'us/them' divide and how the media perpatrates it. Particularly in tabloid trash and other things you see/hear on tv. It aims to create hatred and opression. People like to be 'haters' and this often stems from jealousy and insecurity, as well as narrow mindedness and ignorance.

Acceptance and tolerance are far mroe rewarding ways to live in our mixed society, and to benefit what other cultural groups have to offer instead of concentrating on negative things which may not even ecxist, and which would not affect you personally anyway. Thanks

If a man doesn't have pride in himself and tries to make

For the same reason a white guy who has become successful can get a woman...because he now has the ability to not only take care of himself, but also support a household if he so chooses.  Relationships are complex things, and according to studies one of the biggest factors that ends relationships is financial burden.  A successful man is more attractive than a poor man for this reason.  Some would call the woman a gold digger, but the factors go both ways.  A woman that is successful is also more attractive for the same reason so long as the man can accept that she is capable of being a bread winner to.  And in this day and age, men need to accept that because relationships involving one bread winner in the family are hard pressed to get by.

Also, it depends how you determine success. Like a well paid job which screws people over is sucessful? Having loads of money but being a scheming twatbag? Success could be a poor but loving, loyal man who.. Unsucessful could be a rich man who is lonely and beats his woman down.

"Get" a white woman???? Interesting question- I've actually seen quite a few white women with black men, so I don't find it to be totally out of the ordinary. However, what I do find peculiar (with most of my friends who happen to be white women) is that white women don't seem to have any qualms with associating with black men on a superficial, "friendly" kind of level, but they all seem to balk at the idea of actually having a black boyfriend, or being intimate with a black guy. All of them have been asked out by black guys on several occasions, and they simply refuse to go out with them unless we're in all in a group, going out to dinner or something. And yet I often see other white women dating black guys. I dunno- they may be foreign girls, or probably from a different part of the country or something. It is rather strange that none of the ones I know are willing to date black men. At any rate, don't limit yourself to one race- I definitely think people should date across races, because you have a lot more to choose from if you do!

Personally I'd say ideally the mother should be under 35, just because after this the chances of problems with the baby increase.

For a lower age range, I think it depends a lot on individuals and their circumstances, but ideally over 18 at least really, as it is so much easier then in terms of you can sign your own lease/get a mortgage, you are more likely to have qualifications to give you more life choices etc.

Having said that, ultimately it is obviously up to each set of parents to decide for themselves, not up to me to dictate to people!

Over 22 and under 40.

Under 22 and most people have no idea what life is really like.  They're either too blinded by idealism or too heavily influenced by other people's opinions.  Personally, I'd say 25-28 is ideal.  Usually by this time, you've not only matured to a reasonable level, but you're more financially able to handle having a child.

Over 40 and there are serious health issues which only get worse as time goes on.  Yes, it's possible for women over 40 to have a child, but invariably those women spend tons of money on some aspect of their pregnancy that younger women do not.  Extra "high risk" testing, etc.

Too many young girls in today's society think that they're ready to have a baby just because they want one.  Not only is it stupid to think you can handle having a baby before you're even out of high school, but it puts undue pressure on the mother in the most emotionally turbulent decade of her life.

Well, it's important for the mother's health to start younger but not too young and not wait untill later when age can be a huge issue. I'd say the best range is between 20 and 28 for having a kid. Past that, there are complications that occur with the woman's aging body. Not to mention, you'll want to go out and play catch with your kid while you're still relatively young.

Perhaps they didn't like you.

I've had foreign friends.  It all depends on the person. If they're friendly and outgoing then I have no problem making friends with them.

London is a hard place to fit into though, its very competitive, people there are usually not very friendly, everyone's stressed out to hell and working their backsides off.  If you'd gone to a smaller regional town you might have had more success in making friends.

A baby = forever. It means responsibility and growing up at a fast pace at a young age. Having sex before marriage is also a personal choice and, most of the time, only between the girl and her boy (hence I said "girl" and "boy" and not man and woman). But marriage means forever. It means something that you could possibly regret and want to change. Marriage is a sanctioned institution that is bound by law and God. At 17, you can choose to open your legs. You can choose to keep the being that is made by sex. But a 17 year old SHOULD be out having fun. Should be out doing things that you won't be able to do later. Being married holds you and constrains you to only a few things.



You have to put time and experience behind that big of a life choice. You have to have lots of time to think it over because it's a HUGE decision that you actually make. Having a baby at 17 is NOT planned. It happens and you live with it. That baby will make you feel so much more complete but being married means that you're stuck with that person (so to speak) forever.



Enjoy your younger years and don't worry about babies and a husband. It's, quite frankly, immature to be thinking that you can raise a family and live care-free for the rest of your life with a person that you don't REALLY know. Before getting married, you NEED to live with that person for at least a year. That way, you figure each other out. I know this sounds bad, but it's best to have sex before you get married aswell so you have a feel for if you could actually BE with this person every night for the rest of your life aswell.. Ok, I've talked enough about marriage and children, you have a good one hun.

Society doesn't think it is OK to have sex at seventeen or any age other then when the two people are responsible, MATURE, and aware of the consequences possible with their actions. But for the last 25 years sex has been in everyone's face so much, society is starting to get numb when responding to the challenge of warding off teenage pregnancy, AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and destroyed lives because of a few minutes of pleasure that the media and culture have turned into THE BIG DRIVE. Sex, love and marriage are never acceptable unless the people are mature and able to take full cognisant care of themselved AND the results.

well im part of society and i dont think its okay to have sex or have a baby at 17. Marrying...hard but the way society most seem to think 17 is too young for marraige because of ecomony...and that at 17 yrs old you don't know what you want.



and for some that is true. im seventeen and i dont know a thing about a thing. I mean im intelligent...got lots of scholarships to colleges...and i haven't even picked any place to go, because it is a proven fact that indecision lessens as you grow.

I think being a real man is when you are yourself, and you are who you are, You take care of your business.

My husband is a real man, he takes care of his family, and he is the same man he was when i first met him, he is genuine.... He is not all about money, or how to get ahead in life, he is a simple man, and that is what makes him my man....

He will not tell someone what they want to hear just because they want to hear it, and he cant say the truth...

He is also just honest, and self less, always thinking of others, he thinks about me and my children before himself, he lives for us... I live for him to dont get me wrong, but he always treats me right, and tells me that he will do what ever he has to, as to survive in thisworld with his family, he doesnt care about going out to a party, or making new friends, he rules his life, and he will tell you his life is his family...

A true man takes care of his family.

Good question, i could go on forever about it.

A real man has integrity, he says he will get it done and he does so.  He doesn't walk away from his family no matter how bad or how good it is(always supportive), he takes the responsibility to the utter max and then gives 100% more!  He knows his responsibilities are to God, his family and then his country.  The rest of what out there is meanless without those 3.  I am married to a guy just like that and wouldn't trade him for anyone!! (btw he has the same 'hairline' you do) ;-)

In 2007 the basic requirements of a real man haven't changed that much from 1900s CE or 2000 BCE.  We have to be able to provide for our families, be able to defend them from dangers, and provide a stable environment in which to raise our children.  A real man maintains good relationships with others.  Good standing in the community is often part of this, but a real man has to know when and where to  make a stand for his principals even if this goes against the norms.  A real man is not pushed around, is not a wimp, and doesn't whine or complain about things that he cannot change.  I am a Christian so I would also say that a real man walks a good and holy Christian walk and strives to be all that Jesus wants him to be.  In short being a real man is a tough job that most of us mess up from time to time.

If you are male and have a dangly bit, you are a man + If you are alive then you are real = You are a real man in 2007.

DICTIONARY - Real = existing, happening, actual, genuine.

A real man in 2007 should be all the above but more importantly, the latter.

My man is in his 60's. He is now, what he used to call his father, 'old school'. All he does in the house, although he tries, is what I have taught him, the basics but....... He can cook a mean roast.

I hope the men of 2007, although physically stronger, at least try to equal women on a mental and emotional level. The macho man is not an attractive quality.

I like the old idea of 'Macho'.

Before it came to mean a man who looked for trouble and maybe even enjoyed violence it used to mean a man who looked after his own and was responsible for them.

He did not seek trouble, but when it came he faced it squarely and did not back down.

He could not be bullied, he did not allow weaker people than him to be bullied; BUT he did not bully and despised those who did.

He worked hard and did his best to support those who relied on him.

If someone said that about me, I would be quite proud, and consider myself a real man.

A 'real man ' is one that is aware of his ability to think ahead and above those around him to go that extra mile, have compassion and to think before acting on impulse.

One that thinks about enviromental and Health issues, and does something about it , learn from his mistakes, and helps others with theirs , never lose's his temper towards them, but show them the way and praise them for their efforts

Treats all people equal from ' beggers to princes's  and to love people for their hearts and minds not by their wealth or materialistic possessions

To love his family to protect and provide for them, to be there for there needs, decisions, trust, and support, defend for them, encourage them to look for the goodness in everyone and everything

A real man should'nt be afraid to show his true emotions.

<question>



Why are cheap, simple weddings "unacceptable" in the UK these days?



I first got married at 22 - in a registry office - and we spent no more than £300 on the whole thing.  People I knew were so shocked

"OH I could NEVER do that, my mum would be HEARTBROKEN, she really wants me to have a big white wedding" blah blah drone drone

I'm about to get married again - registry office again - and we're spending maybe £1,000 tops on it all.

And again - same shock and disgust from my colleagues - I actually have to lie and pretend that our wedding rings are costing more than they are because of the disgusted looks I'd get if I told them we're getting £50 ones from Argos, lol . . .one girl I work with boasted incessantly about how she wouldn't get engaged unless her bf got her a ring costing AT LEAST £3,000 . . .

Why the snobbery? Why does a wedding HAVE to cost £20,000 or its somehow not seen as meaningful or valid? God knows, precious few people get married in the UK these days - if it wasn't so "shameful" to do it cheaply more might be tempted.  From my experience, the cost alone puts a lot of people off the thought of marriage.

No wonder we're all up to our armpits in debt in this country



. . .



</question>



<additional details>



We're not even having a reception as we can't afford it and our "guests" (family and friends) will understand this.  We're just all going for a pub lunch afterward the ceremony.  Terribly sorry if that "offends" our "guests" - this is probably why we only invited close friends/family who would understand and just be happy we're getting married.  We aren't in the position of indulging greedy people who expect us to spoil them when we can't afford to.



Lol Caicos - going abroad, what with air fares etc is still really expensive!!!  I think you've missed my point.  Why can't people just be satisfied with the local registry office and a home-made buffet or meal afterwards?!  Like they used to!  When did getting married become something which has to cost £1,000s?

I think that some of it has to do with the venue. If you choose somewhere very posh, guests assume that the reception will be equally grand. With the kind of prices you are discussing, I can see why so many people travel to the Caribbean for beach weddings. When all is said and done, you are not spending a fortune on the ceremony and the reception and you are right there on the spot for your honeymoon. People can come if they want to, but they pay their own way. I begin to like the idea more and more.

I think your attitude is spot on. Why waste money on that you will need to buy and never use again, I understand dresses can cost up to £2-3,000 which is absurd. Plus bridesmaids. What do you do with these clothes after the 'big day'. Then you get sucked into the church and you pay to decorate it and then the reception. It seems fashionable to have the reception and the rest of the days frivolities in a grand house style hotel, where the guests can stay over night (at their expense) but what about the food at the reception, the drink and after all that there is another crowd arrive for the evening reception, DJ more booze and nibbles. Total cost, well not much change out of £30,000. If you have that sort of money and most of us don't, then you are better off using for yourselves in your new married live and not try and out do the previous wedding you went to. Good on yer!

im pretty sure this is just true for mostly white people.

color really doesnt matter to me, unless theyre like an ugly hazel/green/light brown color, i also hate sky blue eyes because theyre so light and bright and it freaks me out.

but i do like dark brown, or dark blue or pretty hazel or pretty green eyes, but tis really not a big deal

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I did, when I sold my share in a software company to my partners and "retired" (at 35).

At first it was great - no mortgage or bills to worry about, a quiet life in the country with no commute, and I could act out my fantasy of being a writer for a couple of years and treat myself to a few things I'd always wanted - a sports car, a telescope, an expensive camera, a road-trip holiday through the USA.

But I got depressed (not badly enough to need medical treatment, but enough to stop me enjoying much of life). I got scared, obsessed with "protecting" the rest of the money - and as a result living more cheaply and less well than I had when I was working. I missed the buzz of work and the company of my colleagues.

I'm now back at work, still with no mortgage and no real money worries but with a family who help me spend any cash that's left :-), and in many ways it's almost as if I'd never had the money. I'm in a less-pressured job, but there's enough activity to still get that buzz, and it's great to be amongst people again. So be careful what you wish for!

Ten years' salary isn't really that much these days. I could pay off the mortgage and go travelling for the next 10 years. Or I could pay off the mortgage and save the rest for a rainy day. However your ten years' salary is a lot different to mine and I would have to be more careful with my money I suspect.

I would buy myself a newer car, as mine is starting to go in expensive places, and being disabled, I need my car big time, to not have to worry about it would be great.  I would also get a power chair, although not confined to a wheelchair, there are times I do need one, it would mean I could start doing things with my daughter again, like museums, parks, days out, that kind of thing.  I would spend a small amount doing bits of the flat up, but minimally, I enjoy finding a bargain but I need to be able to keep the place clutter free and clean.  Beyond that, I would stuff the rest in a high interest account and try and add to it, being unable to work (I know, how could I qualify for ten years' salary, but its hypothetical...) means that I never have money for emergencies, as soon as I save some (a challenge on benefits, but it is possible) something comes alone, like the car breaking down and its all gone.  I would be able to support the couple of local charities I occasionally support a bit more and just relax and have money to do nice things with my daughter.  Like a coupld of days away in the Cotswolds with our beautiful dog, a power chair and miles to walk/roll through together.  I would try and save a lot of it though.  Nice thought.

Well I'm still a student so I don't get a salary, but I would probably get a place in Majorca, I love it there and I would set up a publishing buisness for young authors who don't have agents, because it is rather unfair at the moment that people without agents cant get published or find it very hard, it would be nice for a change to have a publishers that only execpt un-agented manuscripts rather than companys that see the author hasn't come through a littery agent and just chuck their manuscript in the trash without so much as a glance or second thought.

Depends what my salary was; if I get £10k annually, I'd use it to tie up some loose ends. Maybe I'd take a few years out to bike round Europe - I drew up the plans, then realised I really didn't have the means to do it. I might use it tide me over whilst attempting to edit my book and get it published, promote it, etc; the first draft was written in calmer and easier times. To publish is a hard dream to keep alive. These sorts of unfinished projects have made me into the person I am; it'd be nice to see a couple of them through at last.

However, if I was on £100k per annum, I'd quit full time employment - £1,000,000 could sustain my current lifestyle. Instead, I'd do some freelance work - journalism, maybe some scripts - whilst enjoying my life. I only get one shot.

TV is one of the most insidious of the modern inventions. Quite apart from the promise it had at the beginning, as a means of entertainment and education, TV soon became the means of creating entire mindsets and controlling millions of minds.
Most do not question the integrity of the stuff they see, and sit motionless as each brainwashing session continues.
These mental lapses which they call programmes are nothing more than a mish mash of political propaganda and blatant commercial puff that seems to be what contemporary 'culture' parades itself as being. Its a concentration camp of the mind.
Our family gave up watching it two years ago along with unsubscribing from the daily newspaper. The changes were remarkable.Less stress 
and more time spent talking with friends and family as well as walks in the forest etc etc.
As Paul Simon said,"Switch off the TV and set yourself free"
He is right!

(I'm guessing, whoever deleted this question a while ago, arranges they're m&m's before eating them).

Those of you that correct our spelling mistakes...
I have to ask, in the overall scheme of things, is it really that important?

I'm shocked (and highly amused) that you people seem to get so upset about something so insignificant.

Some of you go as far, and this is where my amusement turns to amazement, as to read a question starting "please help me I just don't now what to do" and you reply "actually it is spelt know".

This is such an anal response to an obviously serious question I half expect you to continue "...and the word know is derived from the greek...". I mean, for goodness sake, what is so lacking in your lives that you can't over look a grammer or spelling mistake and just answer the damn question. It's Yahoo!Answers, not Yahoo!eggheads. Come on people, lighten up.

Do you even consider that some people may be partially dislexic, foreign or young. Maybe they may feel embarrassed that you publicly pointed out their mistake.



And if someone says "actually, it's not Greek..." I swear I'll fall of my chair.

OK, I don't correct people's spelling - although I AM paid to do so.
Let me ask you - isn't there something that makes you grit your teeth?  How about nails down a chalk board?  The sound of a bad player on a violin?  The site of a large person in tiny clothing they obviously bought when they WERE tiny?  How about a badly put together story in a book?  Or a delicious meal that has had the wrong type of sauce used in it?
Personally, badly spelled sentences and rubbish grammar do that to me.
I get toothache.  Please think twice before criticizing those of us with enough education to really dislike the ignorance that some people feel free to display.
Everyone makes errors - but that is why Yahoo and Microsoft gave us such reasonable spelling and grammar checkers.

And the ability to edit when we do make mistakes......

Yes they are anal people. It's like they just can't help themselves, they have a ridiculous sense of superiority over this poor person that just wants a bit of advice. You're very right in saying that not everybody has excellent spelling and grammar skills for many reasons, it doesn't necassarily mean they're thick. Sadly some people are just so far up their own backsides that they can't help it. Why on earth would someone delete a question like this? It's not offensive, racist or anything else that a lot of questions on here are yet most of them slip through the net with no complaint!

Just to mention to all those that say 'use the spell check', it is programmed to American spellings and is therefore useless to anyone from a different country (of which there are many on Y/A), in fact it's a complete pain.  It constantly flags up mistakes that don't exist if you don't live in the US!

I like my best friend and really need advice....



About halfway through my ninth grade year, I started talking to this one girl(lets call her “Marie”. She was one of those people who didn’t seem to hang out with a lot of people(I wasn’t the most popular person in school, but I hung out with a fair amount of people). She had some friends, but they seemed more of casual friends than strong friends. Marie tended to wear darker clothes, like she might have some “prep” shirts, but they were always darker colors.



Anyways, we had been doing this one class project, and her group did some stuff with mine, and we started talking in school a bit, and also on myspace. As I talked to Marie, I realized how cool she seemed. She had a bit of a violent humor, could listen to(even make) perverted jokes without being disgusted, swore quite a bit, had a dominating air about her(She seemed pretty strong willed), and overall just seemed pretty damn cool. It was the end of the second quarter in school when I first started talking to her, and it wasn’t till almost the end of the year that we really started hanging out(we had a total of like two classes together and, thanks to assigned seating, we typically weren’t close to each other). This was also the time that I first began developing a crush on her. Finally, we got relatively close within one class setting, and we were able to talk and get to know each other better(my god, I hated that class, but it was much better with her in there).



Marie had been single up to this point in time. Quite literally, on the last day of school she started going out with this one kid(“Rob”) who had had a crush on her for awhile(he was my friend, but I really didn’t understand why they got together, they seemed too different – he was very hyper while she was much more reserved in her demeanor). Anyways, we continued to talk over myspace throughout the summer, but neither of us are big on talking on the phone, and distance wises, it was kind of hard for us to really hang out.



Once my sophomore year started, we began hanging out quite a lot more. Since I was already pretty good friends with Rob, us, two other kids, “Ron” and “BJ” who were like best friends with Rob and pretty good friends with me , and Marie would all hang out together. Ron and BJ were Marie’s best friends, with BJ being her very best friend. So, it was a pretty good group.



It was during this period that I became really good friends with Marie(I was essentially still a step below Ron and BJ though). We still didn’t hang out alot outside of school, but we talked over myspace all the time, and always hung out at school. We really began trusting each other during this period. I learned that she had a few self-harming tendencies(but this slowly went away within the next half a year or so), and this helped to change my view of certain types of people. Also, I found that if something I did bugged her, and she mentioned it, I was more than wiling to change(in other words, I quit “gay bashing”, saying certain vulgar words[none of the wondrous swear words though], and a few things like that). We began helping each other out more and more(for example, we had this one project in class that we were both working on individually, but mine essentially sucked, so, about three minutes before either of us had to go up and present, we agreed that if I did ninety percent of the talking, we go up as partners[we were allowed to but we had been working individually before] and use her nice-looking project). Somewhere during this period, her and Rob began having sex, too.



This was all good until BJ got a girlfriend(he was kind of one of those nerdy kids that are really into video games) and he started changing. I had never been great friends(more of casual friends with him, me and Ron were good friends though) with him, so I had no problem totally ditching him when Marie did. Ron, on the other hand, had a little bit more trouble with it, but he managed to stay friends with both of them. It was during the climax of this situation that I think I essentially took the place of BJ in relation to Marie(our friendship is different now than it was then, but at the time, that’s what it was like). That night, when her and BJ ceased to be friends(it had been building up for awhile, but there was one point when they had an argument and that was essentially it for them), I must have spent at least three hours straight just talking to her on myspace. This was when I learned her deepest secret(lets just say something went terribly wrong in her life). She felt that it was her fault, in some way, and so I told her repeatedly that it wasn’t. I don’t know if it got through to her, but I truly hope it did. It was at that point, when she opened herself up to me completely, that I realized and decided that I loved her(as a friend) and that I would always be there for her. (When I first told her that I would always be there for her, she was like “that’s a big promise to make” and I was like “I know, I plan to always be there for you if you need me”[and I’ve kept good on that promise thus far, and plan to continue to do so]) Since that night, we haven’t talked about her past and that tragedy, for we both know of it, and it’s like a mutual silent agreement not to mention it ever again(if she ever needs to talk or anything, I’m obviously gonna be there for her, but I won’t ever bring it up).



The semester ended, and our group was down to four, instead of five. Me and Rob grew distant, for I didn’t really ever see him(due to classes), but we were still friends and were able to talk when we were around each other. Marie and Rob seemed to have a love-hate relationship. She used to get angry with him frequently, and they quarreled quite a bit. She was still pretty good friends with Ron. 
However, Ron started really hanging out with this one group of kids who she didn’t like. I thought that most of the people were pretty decent, if they were by themselves, but they turned into assholes once they all got together. Marie just thought they were assholes. 
So, slowly, Ron grew distant from Marie, and our friendship lessened a bit(we’re still pretty good friend, though). Finally, him and Marie had a falling out, and they have been bitter towards each other ever since. This left me as Marie’s only best friend.



By this point in time, Marie was one of my best friends(the only person I had her underneath on my myspace was a kid I’ve known for a few years over a decade and hang out with all the time). We hung out all the time in school, and a little after school. We were so close that people mistook us as a couple fairly often(she had more classes with me than she did with Rob, so we were together more). And yes, I still had a crush on her at this time. But, of course, our friendship always came first(it’s not like there was much I could do, she had a boyfriend).



The year ended, and summer began. I was gone halfway across the world with this one summer program for three weeks, and she was the only person I kept in real contact with throughout the trip(I called her twice, and the first time we talked for over two hours, and the second time we talked for about half an hour(the delay between when you said something and the other person heard it just got to annoying). In other words, she got two and a half hours of talk time, my other friend altogether got between a quarter of an hour and a half an hour, and my family got twelve minutes of talking to me). Once I got back, she broke the news to me that she might be pregnant(her period was being uber gay). Her boyfriend, Rob, was out of town for the next week or two, and she didn’t want to go and buy a pregnancy test herself, so she asked me(in a very demur manner[it’s not something you get asked every day]) if I would go out and buy them for her. I was like “Marie, I said I would always be there for you, so yeah, I’ll get them for you”. As you can see, we were pretty damn good friends. (she wasn’t pregnant, by the way, her period was just being slow)

Junior year rolled around, and her and Rob’s relationship fell to pieces. She began hanging out with one of Rob’s best friends, “Jay”. Rob began getting pretty angry when she would go and hang out with Jay, and like drive around or go and get coffee or whatnot. This really strained their relationship. Then, one day, she kissed Jay. Her and Rob decided to try and fix their relationship at that point, once she revealed that to him, but this failed terribly. After getting drunk one night, her and Jay had sex, and that was the end of her and Rob. 
Despite her actions going against just about all my morals, I stuck by her side, as her best friend(I had told her I would, and I damn well meant it). Almost none of my friends wanted me to hang out with her anymore, but I really didn’t care. And, I still liked her.



There was about a month transition period in which she was single, but essentially going out with Jay. I almost think that Jay was a bounce back, or possibly a revenge thing. He was willing to say things to please her, do stuff for her(be “whipped”[just like how I do a lot of small things for her, so people always say I’m whipped by her]), and make promises to her. I dislike him(and Marie knows this, and she used to bug me about why I don’t like him, but she hasn’t asked me why for months now[essentially since they started arguing more]). Like, he reminds me of myself in some ways(he has a sense of humor, is willing to do small things for Marie, etc), but with a lack of morals, a sense of over-pride(it’s like he doesn’t believe he can be wrong[except with Marie, and only sometimes at that]), and more of a party side to him(according to Marie, I’m the “good kid” between me and her, whereas Jay goes out and drinks and does some drugs). 
Anyways, they seem to fight quite a lot actually. It’s almost a repeat of her last relationship, in my opinion(both Rob and Jay are emotional crybabies, in my opinion, they fight over dumb **** with Marie, and almost break up from time to time and then don’t[but Jay graduated this year, so maybe that’ll help sever their ties]).



Jay graduated this year, so that means that he got to take off the last week of school. Unfortunately, I got MRSA on my leg and so I only got to spend two days of that week at school, hanging out with Marie. When I was gone at the hospital though, I called her quite a bit(and like the phone keep dropping the call[I think that the medical equipment was killing it], so instead of just hanging up, we called each other back like half a thousand times). After school ended, her and Jay almost broke up, and she had me call her(I have wondrous dial up so I was on the internet and she told me to call her), and we talked for a good amount of time. Anyways, they worked it out, and are back together. But like we were at this parade thingy the other day and I ran into her and Jay didn’t seem all that enthusiastic, like she wanted to get rid of him. And that’s essentially where we’re at now.



Now, for between Marie’s and my relation….we hang out all the time at school, we actually talk on the phone from time to time, and hang out sometimes after school. She has become my very best friend, surpassing even my friend of over a decade, and I am still her very best friend(she doesn’t really have any other best friends, either). I help her out with the big things(the other day, she didn’t do a book report for this one class, so I sent her the report I had done earlier in the year so that she could just turn that one in[and she got a higher grade than what I got for my book report. Ironic, huh?]), and the small(picking up her pencil of she drops it, buying her something from a concert of her favorite band that she wasn’t able to make it to[with my own money]). She has always been there for me when I have needed her and she is the one person I know I can turn to to talk with if I really need to. She has ALWAYS helped me out when I needed it or asked. She is so amazing. For next year, we have coordinated our classes so that we can have the majority of them together(I think we got between two thirds and three fourths of them together next year). And, obviously, I still have that crush on her.



I want your opinions on this. Please.

gr8 but somehow heartbreaking story!
ok i think that it is very sweet of you to be by her side all the time but somehow think that ur ruining ur life by not telling her that you have a crush on her! i mean this has happened twice with ron and jay and ur just letting it happen. but if u feel uncomfortable if u told her just well..wait for some time and start revealing it bit after bit. but not so fast because you might end up not being freinds with  her at all!
but gradually as i read on, u guys seemed to be getting closer and closer. sorry bout the MRSA on ur leg. i think you should keep on being by her side and im sure she'll realise that uve got a crush on her 1 day!
gd luck and hope i helped!

wow this story is .... crazy!

i think u should admit that u have a crush on her. i mean life's just too short to waste any time.
firstly explain to her everything u wrote up there bout ure feelings 4 her and explain how much u love her and how much the pain of not being with her is. if she loves u back GREAT! if she just wants to b friends then play cool and continue being the great friend that u r. soon she'll realise that shes really lucky to have a bestie as faithful and awesome as u.



GOODLUCK!

Where can I buy a PERISCOPE?  ?



My partner is in the building trade and sometimes needs to be able to see into very small spaces (e.g. yesterday he cut a small hole in a ceiling, to try to ascertain which way the joists were running, but he couldn't see and kept having to cut more and more of it away till he ended up with quite a large hole!).
I have looked on Amazon and serached on Google but the only ones advertised are toy ones and they're not even currently available on Amazon!
Thanks :o)

FETU FAJIYAS, there is always one arrogant twat and this time it had to be you...there is a false ceiling under the real ceiling...and he has been working in the construction industry for years- he can fit bathrooms, kitchens, do plumb anything, do electrician work, paint, decorate, build walls and OH YES, he also has a certificate for being able to take down walls safely (not just anybody is allowed to do this, lest the building should collapse on their head.....so, why don't you just SHUT UP and keep your stupid, uninformed opinions to yourself??!!!  I'd be far happier trusting someone careful and cautious like he is, to check for a joist, than a silly fool who thins all there is to it is to "tap on the ceiling".....try knowing something about a subject before you proclaim yourself as the expert, ok?

You can make one out of an orange juice carton and two compact mirrors -



At the top of one side of the carton, use a pencil to make three holes in a diagonal line.

Start at the top left corner of the box and head down towards the right.



Make three more holes in the same way at the bottom.



Flip the carton over, so that the side that was on the table is now facing up.

Make two more sets of holes like before, but this time starting in the top right corner of the box, and heading down to the left.



Take a look at the holes you made at the bottom of the carton. The holes in the corner of each side are either side of the face you now need to work on.

At the bottom of this side of the carton, make four holes in the shape of a rectangle.



On the opposite side to this one, make four more holes in the shape of a rectangle - this time at the top of the carton.



The holes you've made, are all to help you cut the box. Cut out the rectangle at the top of the box.



Do the same at the bottom of the carton.



Then cut down all the diagonal lines.



Finally slide the mirrors into the diagonal slots that you've just cut.



To make the periscope work as well as possible the two mirrors must be placed at exactly the same angle.



To do this, before you make the holes, cut a piece of card into a triangle shape and mark out where the holes will go.



Use the same piece of card to mark out where the holes will go at the top.

He can ascertain which way the joist run by simply tapping the ceiling with his finger and listening to the pitch.  When you hit a joist it will sound solid and not hollow.  I if I was a property owner I would be skeptical of someone that had to drill a hole to figure that out

Russian Army/ Navy surplus store? Seriously, just attach a small mirror to the end of a stick, like you would use to see up a girls skirt when you were at school. Mechanics sometimes use them to see into an awkward place under a car, dead simple.

When I walked to elementary school I used to see big trucks sitting immobile in some parking lot and fear that they would suddenly take off and try to crush me.  I even used to plan out where I would run if they were to start up.
Mushrooms.  Yeah, mushrooms are scary.

How did Dubai become so rich?



As many of you may know, Dubai is building & planning many large scale developments such as the Burj Al Arab, The Palm Islands & the soon-to-be- tallest building in the world, The Burj Dubai.
I recently discovered that they are also building the world's largest bridge & fountain, but i'm not sure how they make so much money when many claim that they don't rely on oil.

Oil is the reason. Are you kidding?  Oil is the reason the royal family of about 18,000 doesn't have to bring their country out of the dark ages and develop and compete in a modern world.  All they had to do was figure out how to make a hole in the ground and suck up the oil.  Forget putting the money into social services and thanks to good 'ol Islam, keep the women as second class citizen slaves.  Works for them.  And they love the conflict in the mid east.  If it weren't for that, the rest of the Arab nations would be all over Saudi Arabia.

<answer>



It all started with Petro dollars.  Although Dubai's (which is in the UAE, not Saudi as someone else has suggested) oil reserves are dwindling they still have a fair amount.  However, they have seen that the oil will not last forever so have heavily expanded into tourism, they are also the hub for most mid-east oil contractors and service companies.  As such they have a large ex-pat population.  They still practise conservitive laws and traditions, however they are somewhat relaxed.  The UAE is not Saudi, and women do have rights and have the choice of whether they wear traditional dress or not.  One thing about Dubai, it used to be a bit expensive and that helped keep the riff raff out, but recently there have been a spate of typical trailer trash crimes in UAE, sex on beaches, drunk and disorderly conduct, fighting on airplanes, etc.  Dubai has recently had a huge building boom, and everyone is making a profit, so they keep building.  One thing to remember as well is "it takes money to make money" They have LOTS of money, and "the more you have the more you make". So they still have petro-dollars coming in, but don't rely nearly as much on them as they used to.  They labour they have is also what the west would consider as cheap, but it is far from slavery, they pay better than the workers home industry, on average 3 times the wage.  So it is attractive for workers mainly from Asian countries to flock there to work as labourers.  Some employers have less than respectable working and living conditions for their workers but on average they are ok.  Dubai is a really nice place, and celebrates it's culture, history and heritage, and so long as you have a little self-disipline and act like a human and not an animal you will have a really good time.  A few other nice places to visit would be Abu Dhabi, Doha, and Bahrain.

What is the reputation of alpha phi? I have three female friends that just joined (2 friends and one close friend). They seem to fit almost exactly the ideals of alpha phi and they are intelligent, social (includes partying and drinking), witty, pretty, leadership qualities and basically the alpha female type. They always seem to make the best decisions. We're from a large university UBC of about 40000 students.

People are idiots? Some obviously.



Someone came up to me and said they heard that I was rich. I said, Come again? Who said that? How do they figure? It's ridiculous. It's not so clearly defined, is it?



You can have money in your pocket and in the bank. You must, right?



The implication is that you have a lot of money but who says? How do they know? If they work at the bank and tell someone else then you could have them fired.

Why do people moan about 'teenagers these days'........?



when the rate of teenage pregnancies in the 70s was higher than it is now?
and to me most teenagers are polite and charming, they just often have nothing better to do than to hang around so are seen as a nuisance

I come across far more rude insolent adults than teenagers (and I havent been a teenager for years so im not sticking up for my own)

I agree with you, although I think you may find that in the 70's people got married a lot younger and left school for work so many of those teenage pregnancies were brought up in a standard working family.

It annoys me when people talk about teenagers causing crime, which they do, but theyre also much more likley to be the victim of crime, so what are they supposed to do.

It seems to work like this.  Every generation of teenagers think the older generation don't know anything, have never lived, like awful music and are pretty stupid really.

Every generation of older adults thinks exactly the same thing about teenagers.  It's a kind of equilibrium - not entirely fair or indeed true - but it's always been the same.

I think every generation has complained about the teenagers of the times.



I agree with you about adults being rude, for example: my son often holds the door for people but very rarely gets a "thank you" much less a smile for his efforts.

What is the point of charity when this happens?



You vaccinate, heal, and help educate the children of a small rural village. A few days later, an army of genocidal government soldiers sweep in and exterminate every man, woman, and child. No survivors, no Rambo.

What the f*** was the point of it all?

I'd try to get out of it, it really lowers your rep when you fight plus, i'm trained i don't want to hurt them. If they hit me i'd block and resort to a huge slam to the locker. Then I'd repeat my offer "I do not want to fight" and if they keep on going i'd knee them and then do a take-down position untill the teacher comes :)

It depends on what you're fighting for. You should always try to avoid physical violence if possible, especially if the fight is over something stupid. But as soon as the person makes a move, or they make it obvious that the situation can't be ended peacefully, you fight back. In a serious situation the person who makes the 1st hit is usually the one who wins.

You can't only block without hitting back, if you did, they'd only keep hitting until they got tired, or someone broke the fight up. You can't block or duck every punch or kick.

Peace

the way i look at it, no matter what circumstances you or the other person are in, if they hit you first, you have the right to defend/protect yourself. no matter if the fight is over something stupid or serious. if i can help it, i wont get to the part where there will be fighting, but, if push comes to shove, i'll stand my ground and hurt somebody. if i get hurt during the fight, at least i know i tried. but, i don't think that will happen :)
i would rather go down with the fight than without a fight. so, my answer, is do what you have to do.

He went and performed it and his face was a picture when we told him it was us.

Well I had three friends over for a sleep over, and two arrived like an hour early so we decided to play one at mid night on the other friend. Basically I live in the middle of a load of Fields opposite a forest, so outside it is very creepy at night. I also don't have many neighbours. At 12 two said they needed the toilet, went off and turned the fuse box off, which turns off all the electricity in the house, then they screamed, and climbed out the window on to the lane where I live. I then said to my friend we were playing the prank on "what was that" et. then told her to stay there and I'll go check it out. Then I screamed and climbed out the window and shouted something like "please no, don't take me outside!" then I waited in the hedgerow with my friends outside. Five mins later my friend opened front door and looked around shouting our names. There was a fox making it's weird call which sounds really eerie and it was perfect. Anyway she walked into the lane, we crept out from the bushes from behind, and she screamed for ages! It was so funny. It worked so well, and she saw the funny side after. We did it cause it was fun.

Well, u can always assume. But you can only base a percentage of your decision on looks. Like, saying irish have lovely eyes... u cant decide ther irish because of that. Some indians and americans have lovely eyes too. (And other countries/nationalities... etc)

yes...they usually have pasty white, washed-out skin...what one calls a "horse-face"long face..sort of buck toothed...usually blonde/blue eyed...unless if your Welsh.



Usually, the lack of skin pigmenation..meaning you burn in the sun...peel and you're just as white as you before..is an indication of being English.

England has become very culturally diverse - so to say 'English' can mean many ethnicities. 'English' people from hundreds of years ago may more than likely be descendants of Celts, Vikings, Romans or the French. Due to the Empire, and influx of foreigners in the 19th, 20th and 21st century, means there are now many English people whose descendants were born in the Middle East, the Caribbean, India or Pakistan.

Well, the "stereotype" (think Austin Powers) is bad teeth but I don't belive in stereotypes and until someone says something that defines where they are from by their accent, I don't think you'd have a clue just by looking at them.  Heck, Hugh Laurie is English and he talks just like an American on the tv show House, so they could probably even fool you with their accent if they've got a good ear for linguistics.

Technically no. Far from it. But have circumstances kept me from being all that I could be in a better world? I'd have to say yes, like most people. Most of us are as retarded as the elite can possibly make us. It serves their purposes. This reminds me of something I read in a Robin Cook novel. A person with superior intelligence creates people in a lab with inferior intelligence because they make better servants.

Communications and relationship questions ?



I have mental health difference exacerbated by social  communications with others.(DID)

I want to make up a pre conversation  contract - not to actually use  but to keep in mind what my boundaries are and how to stop communications that are difficult for me and may lead me into an excess of symptoms.

For instance I find that being the recipient of moaning without any warning or clear indication of what is wanted from me or an understanding of how long it is going to go on for - will lead me to panic and sickness and most probably hurtng myself later.

if you were going to make a fantasy pre- conversation agreement what clauses would it have?

I am pretty vulnerable in this area and will read all the questions closely so please dont dump here - I get enough practice every where else.



My thoughts so far :-

1) How long  do you want to talk for?



2) What is it you want from talking to me?

Emo - short for Emotional Hardcore - a sub genre of Punk Rock music that emerged from the 80's Hardcore Punk scene in Washington DC in the early 80's.

There have been 3 Waves or Generations of Emo. The first two being part of the underground music scene. And the third which we know of today being the most commercialized form of Emo.

First Wave (1985-1994)

http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ob22sS5DiFY

Second Wave (1994-2000)

http://youtube.com/watch?v=QMkH6xi6-Og

Third Wave (2000-Present)

http://youtube.com/watch?v=jjWJfpODVIY

Misuse of the word Emo has become widespread in the US due to the popularity and distinctive attire worn by the Third Wave which was stolen from Heavy Metal, Punk Rock, and Gothic culture.

Just look at the answers posted below mine, many people have come to believe that Emo is a fashion, it isn't. The first two generations actually dressed quite differently.

Headbangers or Metalheads were the first to wear tight spandex denim and eye makeup in the early 80's. Androgynous fashion in rock music actually dates back to the early 1970's with the New York Dolls, who practically invented the Punk Rock.

EDIT: HELLBREEDER: so much for you being Goth, you obviously are lacking in a musical education.

emo is a genre of music that originated from hardcore punk, pop-punk and indie rock. It has since come to describe several variations of music with common roots and associated fashion and stereotypes.

The name "emo" has been in use in music circles since the 1990s, and as far back as the mid 1980s as "emotional hardcore" - describing a scene of punk bands in Washington, D.C. who made emotionally moving punk music about despair and heartache.

Who is in the wrong here? ?



My husband and I live 300 miles from where we grew up.  I hate it here and away from my family and friends, but this is where his business is.  This Saturday is one of my best friends Bridal Showers.  I am in her Wedding and she is 300 miles away.  I worked an extra shift to pay for the gas, but my hubby got sick at work and lost pay.  We decided I couldn't go.  The next week it comes up that my hubby has a meeting 200 miles away and has to go.  Although he'll be paid back for gas, I can't go because he wants me to stay home and watch his dog.  A few days ago a friend of his died and now the funeral is on the same day all of the rest of this is going on and he wants to go.  Now all of the sudden we can take the dog and I can go to the shower.  We don't have the money and I already told my friend I couldn't make it because of the later.  I think he is selfish, he never regards my life and feelings, but it's ok for him to move mountains for what he wants.  Who is wrong here?  What to do?

Prejudice against gothic people is not racism. Racism only applies to prejudice relating to someone's ethnic background, like being black, white, Asian, Native American, etc. Regarding styles of dress, the word you would use to describe negative treatment or opinions is "prejudice," like "are you prejudice against people who follow emo fashion?"

As for gothic style, I would wear it if I had the money and the willpower to wear some of the uncomfortable fabrics and cuts of clothing that come with it. I only look down on goths if they choose elements of that style that are extremely passe (such as random black lipstick),  or extremely distasteful (such as oversexualized clothing in public or extremely disrespectful shirts). I look down on people wearing other fashions for the same things.

im goth and totally against emo's there i a big difference. emo kids are just looking for attention whereas goth people just know what they like and go for it. also as far as the actual style goes there is a huge difference. emo kids where clothes so tight the need a shoe horn to get into them goths are more laid back and chill and their clothes tend to express that, relatively baggy but not to the point of looking like a bum. majority of emo's are lost in what they want. they are simply following a fad because they are unsure of where else to fit in and the same goes for their music. everything they say do and wear is a messed up mix of every style.

I don't mind real goths. I much prefer having them around than a whole bunch of preppies or people in business suits. I don't like emos, though, because they seem pretentious and their music is awful.

what´s up. actually not, i have even been descriminated by emos for not being emo.
but i actually dont understand if it is hearing music that makes people trying to make "outfit´s races"  and then fight with other different "outfit races" just because they are different, and then because the need to belong to some "outfited tribe" some music that should only be  "for having a little fun" became almost a religion where dumb retardeds of music that is even against violence became violent and fight and forget that they are suppoused to be peace loving.
if  you ask me becoming a  "styled people" is just because you want to fit. it is okay...well not really... because it took you apart from other "styled people" and it starts a lot of small social conflicts that are actually a bunch of crap...and divide us...just the same way cultures divide the world now....wow i just realized something very important by myself-...

First, its not racism.  If you want any adults to take you seriously, you have to call it by a correct term, such as, are you prejudiced against gothic people? Or something of that nature.



You say you didnt call goth a race, but by using the term racist, you are in fact calling it a race.

I was goth in high school, and would be today if it werent for the real world.  My career is in child care, and unfortunatly, most parents are prejudiced against the gothic style.  In fact, the only real world careers that are ok with the gothic style is art related careers.  In any other career, you would either get know where, or constantly have to prove yourself to the people you work with that you are a serious adult.

What made me sooo mad about people who were/are against goths is that the say you are just following some current fad.  And dressing at the Gap and support Walmart and slave labor isnt following a fad?  Its a double standard, and I hate double standards.

I have found that the most common reason people are prejudiced though is because they simply dont understand it.  Its human nature to fear what we dont understand, and I am sure if you did some soul searching you could find something that you fear simply because you dont understand it.  Anyone who says they dont is a flat lier.

Every group has stereotypes, and the gothic stereotype is devil worship, being a kid, anarchy, opposition to authority, refusal to cooperate, partying, drugs, raves, ect.  In the work place, those are the LEAST desirable qualities.  As I already said, any goth in the adult work place would constantly be fighting to prove themselves against this stereotype.

I've often wondered that myself. I guess it's like the other answerers said, they must be in some group where they all ask questions and pick themselves as best answer, or they have multiple accounts and give themselves best answer. Either way they must really have all sorts of free time.

It's Wednesday. Just because it's like Monday and Tuesday are like going up a hill and then Wednesday's the middle of the week, so Thursday and Friday are as easy as going down a hill.

Hump day is Wednesday. It just means your getting over the "hump" in the "middle" of the week. There nothing special about it.

Hehe I only found this out recently - Hump Day is Wednesday, so called because when you're working full-time Wednesday is the "hump" of the week - i.e. you get through Wednesday and you're over the hump and it's smooth sailing through til TGIF!

hump day is basicly a name for wednesday, or, the middle of the week.
it just refers to getting over the 3 day hump and making it through the hardest part of a new week.. the beginning!

basically it helps you look forward to the weekend.. theres no rituals or anything like that.. its just a name.. if you google it you probably can find some sites that have explanations if mine didnt make sense lol

wednesday is hump day. At the beginning of the week you fight up hill to get near the weekend. Thursday and Friday are downhill slides to the weekend. Thus Wednesday you get over the uphill hump to the downhill :o)
The proper ritual is to get up on Wednesday morning, run out into the middle of the street in your underwear and at the top of your lungs, yell "It's hump day everyone!". Then go have a coffee and get ready for the day.

Lol, since it's the middle day of the week (depending on the calendar, but it is for most people), you've got half of the week conquered and you've only got half left! Yay!! Go you!! Lol...

I don't really like that term, though. It's too perverted, and when you say "It's Hump Day!" people give you strange looks...=l Of course, judging by the way you phrased your question, I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you're one of the Hump Day perverts.

It's Wednesday because it's in the middle of the typical work week.  So you are climbing up the hill on Mon. & Tues.,  and on top of the hill or on the "hump" on Wednesday.  Then on Thursday & Friday you slide right into the weekend.



You just keep working or doing whatever you are supposed to do.

"Wednesday, or the hump of the week 
The absolute BEST day of the week, the day of maximum hope that maybe, you might make it out of this week alive. A particularly good hump day can last you the rest of the week, and by Doomday morning (Monday) you survive by anticipating hump day. Nothing goes wrong on hump day



Most other days can be defined by hump day. Tuesday is the day before hump day. Thursday is one day after hump day. Except Friday is WOOOH!!! FREEDOM!!! Day, Saturday is Mostly Hungover day, and Sunday is PreDoom day.



Hump day has nothing to do with sex. Unless one wants it to. I like to declare the existence of hump day just to see people's faces. Usually being conservative and all "

Are you sick of people posing with the 'peace' sign, when they don't even mean it?



It was a sixties icon for hippies and represented a bohemium minority. Now I've heard that it's Lindsey Lohan's "signiture icon" and all the kids are doing it in photos they post on Yahoo Questions "Am I Pretty?"

I sort of feel the same way.

All of the items, things, symbols, and struggles that occured before this huge globalization period are all forgotten. I doubt a lot of people know what the peace sign or music and the styles of those times even represented and what struggles had to be made to even get them to surface. 
People have forgotten what it means to be unique and new and are just recycling old trends in an effort to call it their own. Lohan needs to get a new 'signature icon' that represents her and doesn't deface the hippies because this alocholic, misguided, drug addicted girl is flashing a sign that represented years of battles with the police, years in jail because of a peaceful protest go wrong and a struggle that caught the eyes of a nation.

I think that they overuse the peace sign this generation.
They use it for t-shirts, earrings, necklaces, posing for pictures, and a lot don't even mean it. They just think it's cool to do it because all of their "role models" like Miley Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan, and etc are all doing it.
If you truly mean I think you should use the sign. But if you just do it for kicks then you should really stop.

Why do men who are cheaters go into relationships if they cannot be honest?



first of all im not generalizing , the man im talking about are ones who cant keep it in their pants and are into every kind of women , the ones who cheat all the time
tell me something if you cannot be with just one woman why do you go into relationships with a girl ?
why dont just hit the bar and pick up a different chick everyday ?
isnt that variety enough for you?
arent you ashamed of yourself when you lie and hurt a girl?
yes girls cheat too but men cheat more and please dont throw the 
men should reproduce as much they can"  explanation because when you have sex is obviously not to have children so keep this reason to yourself and try to be logic in your answer

What do you think about life?



I am not sure about my future in general, I am also not sure what I want to do either. I enjoy school, and I enjoy learning but I don't know what I could do for a job in the future. I plan to go to collage but I am not sure really for what though. I want to succeed in life.. but I want to enjoy life as well and not have to always be forced to do a job just so I can put food on my table. I know that sounds lazy, but if you think about it, does spending countless hours in an office for a paycheck really seem worth it. The only view you get is your computer screen and a lot of numbers. I want to see more than that, I want to live a life, go around and see the scenery on this damned earth.

I grew up with the fact that you have to work to get what you want in life, and I still find that true, especially in today's economy. Does anyone have any other details on how I can think about this. I am not asking you to answer my life long question, or just say "win the lottery, or become and Entrepreneur". I just want to be able to wake up in the future and not have to say "Time to go to work.. again".



Even if you have something small to say, it will at least make me ponder on it further.

The thing is, everyone wishes that.  That's a fantasy that will never come true.  You can have your dream of "seeing the world" but you'll have to work for it too.  You can't have one or the other.  It'd be nice to wake up everyday and not have to worry about working, spending time at a job.  However, that's not reality and its not the way life works no matter how much you want it to.  The only thing you can do is choose a career you enjoy to make things a bit easier for you to get up in the morning and work.  I enjoy learning too and i love the outdoors.  I would hate to spend every second of my life doing the exact same thing...over and over and over and over... you get the picture... So I'm going to college to become a geologist.  I'll always be learning and I'll be able to work outdoors too.  To me that's not work, so if you find something you enjoy that won't be work either.  Its up to you.  Find something you enjoy and not consider it work or work in an office or whatever.  And there is always the choice of becoming a bum... I guess.. but ultimately won't you have to work to get food too when you beg for it on the streets.  In life you have to work.  There is no way around it, unless you're born rich, but most of us aren't that lucky.

It's a good idea if it is. If a person simply follows the rules, in the manner of Little Jimmy Brown, they ought to be able to lead a happy fulfilling life.

It is sinful to make life tricky and hard for others.

However, things happen, and we all have to work through them. There is a choice to obsess over difficulties and aggravate them or to get to work, solve them, and put them behind us.

I know where you are coming from but sadly saving when you already have nothing is pretty hard.  Looks like the good times have come to an end.
Mainly I too shop at nettos and carefully choose, I also go to charity shops and have cut down as much a possible.  I go to bed at night and pray for all my family, so far we are just about keeping our heads above water, but I have no idea for how long.  I trust that God will take care of us all.

I only wish I knew what the heck has really happened to cause all this,
 suppose I am a little ignorant when it comes to politics.  My husband and I both work, we have no holidays or luxuries unless you call keeping a roof above your head a luxury, but both of us have to work to keep it there.

Funny thing is over 30 years ago when we were married we had more money then, and I did not work.  I have not got a clue what happened but there you have it, perhaps we should have saved, and saved and saved.  But we lived went on holiday with the kids, bought them great christmas presents and had a good family life.  Paid all our bills, including all our taxes and owed nobody anything.  30 years later, wham it has all gone pear shaped.  Sadly it has happened to a nation and not just to us.  Can anyone please tell me why, I sure would love to know.

Sorry I was supposed to be helping you and I just had a rant instead.

Maybe I could just buy a tent and camp out in a field, living off the land, fishing in the rivers and living on berries, not bl..dy likely, tried fishing recently in Wales and a farmer came out carrying a shotgun, did not wait around to see what his question was.

Ah well, I shall wait until I win the lottery, if of course I have a spare £1.

Now I am totally depressed, so I am off to bed.  Night night.

Learn to cook properly. It will save you so much money. 
I can cook a delicious meal for 7 (that's the average number of heads I have to feed at dinnertime) for about £3. Use lentils in stews so you don't have to use as much meat. Go to the market to buy you fruit and veg (much cheaper and tastier than Tesco). 
Never go shopping on an empty stomach - you WILL end up by unnecessary crap

This just doesnt make sense, Anyone that has bullied or has been bullied this question is a must see..?



Im currently in year 10 and ive been bullied for almost every day of my life until i got fed up with it, so i thought to myself why should we have to deal with these people who somehow get enjoyment from making other peoples life miserable. So i started to condition myself by working out and watching hours upon hours of martial arts instructional tapes and one day some guy tryed to pick a fight with me. Now this was about 5 months ago so anyway i fought back and he cryed like a little girl. I also got revenge on all the other asholes that have been meen to me over the years by doing the same things that theyve done to me and they react worse then i do. Ever since i fought back ive almost caused something more important then world peace, social peace. My question is how come more people dont stand up for themself and how come the people who make themselves out to be all tuff and all good be the biggest sooks out of any1. finally how do these people get enjoyment for picking on people smaller then them i doesnt feel to good when it hapens to you does it so stop!?



</question>

and i dont care how long it takes me i will put and end to bullying



hey faithless try telling me how they get enjoyment for making other peoples lives a living hell, its not the victims fault that they do it its theres!!



Just as a heads up i didnt go and learn self defence to go out and pick fights with everyone, i did it to defend myself and those around me.

Idk im like you a little bit just the fact i hate to see injustice or abusing of any type. I think some bullies do it because they have nothing better else to do or for fun. I've also heard it's because of prejudice they might not like that person for one reason or any other and they just figure that person is weaker than me so why not? Some people don't stick up for themselves for various purposes, like when it happened to me i'm like it isn't worth my time, i can fight (i know cause i beat about 2 gang members butt) but i don't like too. Fighting only leads more fighting it might bring some form of peace now, but some people hold grudges like you did eventually they might want payback. As for your question about the tough guys its just how some people are taught not to show any sign of weakness so they disguise them selves in that persona, And feeling good by beating someone else up is a social disorder called being sadistic, it might make then feel better knowing there superior in strength or something but anyways hope this helped.

<answer>



It's easy to see how you got that outlook - it's because you were the object of the teasing. You cannot end every and all forms or instances of bullying, but you can influence the would-be bullies in your environment. Not just the ones that mess with you but the ones that mess with others as well.



Physical conditioning and learning self defense are good things that everyone should do/know. But they are not the solution to every single problem. Some problems can, and have to be, worked out peacefully, whether that means leaving them alone/avoiding them, talking with them, doing better than them in whatever "it" may be, or simply talking to them, there are alternatives.



There are some people who have to be put in their place from a good *** whoopin, those are usually the assholes who are set in their ways. But there are also those who only act out of ignorance or for whatever reason, and depending on the situation an *** whoopin may set them straight too. You may not want, or even care, to know why that person treated you the way they did, but there is a reason.



there are many different reasons why people bully others, and each reason depends on the person. There are only general similarities. There is something that that person lacks that they need to get by "taking it" directly or indirectly from others. Usually those who seem slow to defend themselves or lacking something themselves. A lot of times it's got something to do with respect. In any case, although some people would say ignore them, that may or may not solve the problem, depending on who it is you're dealing with and what your situation is. In any case, usually you should try to solve the problem, whether it be through peaceful or violent means. And of course, the physical means should always be the last option.

But in closing, the point is there is a cause for every action, and one specific action is not the end-all of any one problem. Education (whether that be direct or indirect, physical or non-physical) creates true equality, which gives way to justice and creates peace.

Peace

Well, that's just how Republicans/Conservatives are (religion/tradition, economics, and war over environment, peace, and change/progression).

It doesn't mater to them that the environment (and people) suffer, as long as what they do improves the economy.

Most don't even believe that any type of human interaction is even a danger to the environment.

So the woman is a hunter. I don't have a problem with that because apparently most of what they kill they eat. Secondly, Alaska is still wilderness. Most of us don't worry about bears or wolves coming to attack in the middle of the night.

I have a problem with killing for killings sake, not with a purpose.

So she hunts. There are very few people in Alaska that don't. And wolves are considered a pest 'up there'. One hunts them from the air because of the terrain. And it is not considered sport to hunt the wolves. It is considered a civic duty.
 We cannot apply our morals to Alaska. It is a totally different world and different rules apply.



Just be glad that she only hunts four legged prey and not the two legged kind that attack her on here.

The MPAA rates all movies before they are distributed in the USA.



R rated movies generally have violence & swearing, not as much sex. Some nudity but much sex. There was a movie made about how the ratings boards work. Too many religious people are on it.



NC-17 movies are unrated & can have anything. Unfortunately most movie theaters refuse to play such movies.



European movies we see , usually at art houses, have much more nudity and sex than American movies.

States do have that authority.  It is the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) that regulates what can be broadcast over the public airwaves.  In movie theaters, we get the unedited version.

Many movies that are shown on broadcast TV are edited for content.  Cable and satellite broadcasts are more flexible.

both men and women have the potential to grow to the same height.
however, different physiological processes in men and women determine how long and thickly built are their bodies.

men have testosterone, which increases muscle mass and decreases body fat (lucky bast*rds!)
women have estrogen, which increases body fat and doesnt do much for muscles.

about length:  the females' hormones cause the epiphyses (that thing found at the end of long bones, such as the bones of the legs and arms) to start growing faster than in males, thus females start getting taller before males do.  however, they close much earlier too, thus, while males continue growing, females stop much earlier, and thus become less tall than males.

hope this helped!

Ok for people saying that its not always the case, of course its not, but we're talking in general and these results will always prevail in a large-scale survey that the 'average' man is taller, stronger and heavier than the 'average' woman. Statistics aren't interested in the exceptions.

Men have more testosterone which is a booster in bone development and maturation so they have heavier and thicker bones.

Women have alot of estrogen which is naturally aromatized into testosterone and so because testosterone peaking is what stops the height increase in boys towards the end of puberty, happens sooner in women and so the average adult woman is shorter and stops growing sooner than boys.

Women also lose alot of calcium via bleeding during their period and also have to use alot of calcium and nutrient reserves for the maintenance of an egg inside their womb.

So a woman really is eating for two.



Having taken into consideration the biological factors which first perpetuated this trend, we can proceed to considering evolutionary dynamics which magnified these differences in favour of the survival of the human species.



Men being naturally larger and stronger as a result of their biology were better suited to the role of hunting, gathering food and protecting the family.



The stronger, larger, heavier men whom the women felt more protected with were likely to get the female and pass down their genes and the weaker males were either killed because they weren't built to survive or were not chosen by females to reproduce and so their inferior genes died out.



Men wanted women they could protect and so the more independent, stronger women were chosen against and the more petite, smaller, lighter and more vulnerable women were picked by men and naturally went for the larger male and so looking at the larger picture, that is why things are the way they are today if you're looking at it from a bioevolutionary point of view.

All the factors contribute to the typical female anatomy.

This is not always true but i understand your point. Generally because men have thousands of years of being hunters and guardians for the family. Women on the other hand when pregnant and looking after children are physically much weaker. So to be smaller, move faster and hide easier is a greater ability than direct conflict. But depends on race, Europeans by nature are bigger than everyone simply because of the harsh weather and milk, meat has higher growth hormones rather than southern nation diets like China and India. Really depends on how to survive in that climate. Of course meat eaters will be more aggressive and bigger as their survival depends on killing.

I reckon most folk are uncomfortable about change but when you have done it and come out the other side you will find you will have always learnt something and there will be a new dimension to your character.
It's important to your development, you learn a lot about yourself and often find that not all change is bad.
All through my life i have had to deal with change and it has shaped me,made me who i am. Embrace change, don't fear it because you may be pleasantly surprised how it all pans out..

I remember being terrified to make a huge move away from my hometown, but once I did it, there was this strange feeling of "... that's it?  That wasn't so hard!"  I keep wondering what exactly I thought would happen that would be so scary, but it's just that vague fear of change.  Once you take the plunge, you'll be surprised how easy it was!

New job! It took me two years to accept the fact that I needed to change my life to get out of the rut. Doing the same thing was easy everyday. But when I changed the last digits of the year again on my calender and I was will unhappy from the last two times I changed it. I bit the bullet and changed... It was the best thing I ever did. For the first week I wasnt sure and was terrified.. Now after realising just how much better things are, it has helped me change a lot of things. I kinda think if its too scary to think of, then it must be good to change!! lol

It means different things. I would use it as another word for idiot. The strenght of its use depending on other words in the sentence. It can be quite light or quite mean depending on how it is used.
It can also be used in reference to female genitalia.

twat = c u n t = p u s s y = vagina

Like the word "****," I've embraced the word "twat" as an empowering word for my bits.  At a gynecological appointment (in spite of my being a nurse), I'm just as likely to refer to my twat or **** as I am to refer to my vagina.  Not sure of  its relative use in the U.K. versus the U.S., but it seems to be commonly used in the two countries I've spent most of my life in:  Canada and the U.S.

It's worth noting that the single word in this answer that Yahoo! Answers has chosen to edit is the word C U N T.  I did not insert any asterisk euphemisms in my original answer.  Wonder if they edit the words '****' or '****.'

Am I being childish? Am I weird?



I don't cuss much. I don't like typing the "F" word or saying it. I'm okay with the "B" word though. I'm also okay with dooshbag. Typing the proper term for female and male genitals makes me feel dirty. I can say that I've never said it once in my whole life. Also, the proper term for "touching yourself" also makes me feel dirty if I had to type it. I wouldn't say it either.

Am I weird...

<answer>



Many people in our culture feel this way.  Our culture has put such a huge taboo on recognizing our sexuality that many people feel incomfortable.  I grew up thinking that penis and vagina were dirty words never to be said.  I was told I was going to hell when my mom found a vibrator in my room.  I asked to go to a gynocologist when I was 17 because I was having menstrual issues and she said no, that only married adults go to that kind of doctor.

Then I got cancer at 21.  I suddenly had to talk to everyone about my body and all its functions.  I had to be view while naked and poked and proded.  And I quickly got over it.

I have found that talking about these things in a clinical frame of mind (using the correct medical terms, ect) makes it easier to talk about.  Saying penis to me definatly makes a conversation about sex more comfortable than looking for every euphamism in the book because I am too weirded out to say penis.



As far as curse words....  Again, our culture makes them so taboo.  What I feel there is that..  what makes those specfic words bad?  Why is it ok to say 'shoot' but not the other word?  Why is it ok to say darn, but not the other word?  Gosh, but not god?  Freaking, but not f?  You know what I mean?  Does replacing the taboo word with a nontaboo word really make it different?  If I stump my toe and hollar DARN IT, is it really different than saying DA*N IT?  I mean, really, is it?  You are using it in the exact same context, so why is one ok and the other not?

At the end of the day, during cancer I had to make myself comfortable with talking about my body.  I find myself so liberated that I am no longer ashamed of my body.  I HATE that our culture teaches us that our bodies are dirty and shameful.  I dont think it does anything positive.  In fact, the largest negative that comes from it is parents being uncomfortable talking about it to their children.  During cancer, my mom was my care giver at home.  She got embaressed and upset that I had the nerve to say the word vagina in front of her, or that it didnt bother me to undress in front of doctors.  But the real problem is that she never discussed sex with me growing up.  No conversations at all except to say if you do it before marriage you go to hell.  Thats not healthy, and thats why our unplanned teen preg rates are so high.  In Canada, where the freely and openly give all children sex education, the unplanned teen preg rate is very very very low.

Why not employ some harmless euphemisms to describe genitals such as spam javelin for penis or beef curtains for vagina ect?  And for f.ucking you could say getting your leg over.  For female masturbation you could say strumming the old banjo or flicking the old bean.  For male masturbation you could say bashing your bishop or jerking your gherkin.

Just be linguistically creative.

I think less than trying to push their beliefs on others, they are afraid of the possibility that they could be gay as well.  I mean think about it.  EVERYONE has been attracted to someone of the same sex at some point in their lives, and those that say no are flat lieing.  For the religious, the Bible says its wrong and that they will go to hell if they are gay.  So, in the end, they are afraid that they themselves are gay and wont go to heaven.
I say this because most people against gay marriage seem to really hate homosexuality, and to be homophobes.  You cant hate something that isnt a part of yourself, because you cant hate something that you dont know.

For the few people that arent in the group I just talked about...  i think they fear what will happen.  Most religious people consider homosexuality as bad as murder.  Wouldnt you be afraid of legalizing murder?

Well, overall, the potential customers will have less expendable income with which to purchase intercourse from these purveyors so there will be a direct downturn to some extent. 
Whether the industry considers this significant is something which only they may successfully analyse based on a series of reports over the last five years.

This is a good questtion.



I am retired but when I was working in a high pressured job that had many very exacting deadlines I would forgo lunch at times.  Grab a mars bar or something similar and not eat a meal of any description until I arrived home in the evening.



Only now, when  I stop, think, and remember do I realise how silly that was.



I guess there are very many people doing that now and I would tell them to think carefully about the risks they are taking with their own health.

As a registered nurse and one who should know better, I confess to fluctuating in between healthy and not. When I say unhealthy I do not mean pies, cakes, lollies, sweet drinks etc, but plain bread, pasta with nothing on it as a quick fix. I am however extremely particular about what my niece and nephew one who has a disability. They are not allowed junk food, have mainly fresh foods (which they help make). I guess I am a bad roll model time to change that to, thank you oh wise one lol



Thank you for the question reminded me to get back to healthy, hate the idea of open heart surgery or stroke. See too many some now in there twenties these days.

I usually buy my lunch at the store we are inventorying... the job requires a lot of physical labor, so when I eat lunch, I need it to have enough carbs to break down slowly, so that I do not become hungry before the day is over. We get only one break in a 10 - 12 hour work day, and that break is a 1-hour lunch.



Typically, I buy a sandwich, or something like that, at the deli... or I buy a fish sandwich at the McDonalds' that are usually inside the store we are inventorying. For a drink, I almost always get a bottle of water... and sometimes I supplement that with either orange juice (Simply Orange) or lemonade (Simply Lemonade). Also... I like dessert, so I usually get a York Peppermint Patty for dessert.

Is the British notion of keeping "a stiff, upper lip", "getting on with it" and not showing emotion (especially in public) considered old fashioned and outdated or is modern Britain just as likely to have these ideals as post-war Britain.



Also, does "a stiff, upper lip", etc.only apply to conduct  in public or do people act this way in private too (if modern Britain does still acts this way)?

How can I improve my Speech/ The way I talk???? Please help.?



I've been noticing the reason why some people don't take me seriously whatsoever, its because of the way I talk! First and foremost, I am Tall, very Attractive, Smart, Intelligent, Positive person, I have a unique personality. BUT For as long as I can remember people never take me seriously and some people actually think i'm slow, dumb, incompetent or mentally crazy!!!!!! This really has gotten to my head and honestly my self esteem has gone down, I find myself questioning my own intelligence and my own self worth. I think people around me look at me this way because when I talk i sound "slow" and sound almost childish and naive, as if I'm new in this world. I think when I talk I sound childish and extremely naive, WHEN I'M NOT. When i speak I sometimes don't speak clearly, sometimes stutter (not badly). This is something I myself have recently noticed, no one has told me this. This is something that came to my awareness a couple months ago. I have noticed that when I do talk as clearly as i possibly can and speak with a loud crisp tone people treat me differently, as if they look at me in a different manner. Is there any way I can improve and strengthen my speech??? Speak with authority and confidence and not sound slow or mentally incompetent. (by the way do any of you think I'm mentally incompetent by reading this??, answer honestly) Thanks.

Practice in front of a mirror is your best option.



Its easy to judge people as dumb when they have a dumb sounding voice. For guys it usually low and ape sounding. For girls its usually a high girly voice with the same inflection at the end.



Try not talking. Talk as little as possible.  When you do be confident and forceful with your words. Sometimes silence is the best tool of influence



Listen to how people respond to your ideas. There is of course a possibility that your just not that smart

Country least subject to censorship and social taboos?



I'm not talking about political censorship here, as many countries are free as far as political expression goes, I'm taling about censorship as far as the media goes. For example, in the US I feel the subject of sex is considered taboo in the media and is always spoken about in a "hush-hush" manner, and reference to drugs is kept to an absolute minimun, colourful language is also highly controversial.



Which country would you say is lease sensitive to "taboo" subjects, and prehaps has the least social taboos, and has media which is least subject to censorship as far as violence, sex, drugs, swearing, goes.



I hope I've articulated what I'm trying to say well enough.



Thanks

You need a hook. Your question has to attract attention and be open to easy interpretation. Many 'questions' on YA are not questions at all. They can be statements or seeking opinions.

I find that very often it's in the title that you give your question - If you give a title that is too long no-one will bother reading etc . You have to make sure the title makes people want to open your question and it has to be a title that people think that they can genuinely help you with so don't be too specific.



Also , make sure that your question itself itn't too long because otherwise people cant be bothered to read it - i know i never can ! So really summarise your questions .



Other than that, make sure they are in the right category of questioning etc

Well, I don't know about the questions you ask, but maybe you're asking in the wrong section.  Not that they don't fit in the category you put them in, it's just that some categories are more used than others and therefore get more answers.



Again, I don't know about the questions you ask, but the Language category under Society and Culture is a good one.  That's the only one I'm ever in so I don't know about the others.

Why was Bernie Mac not chastised for using the phrase" America, lets give an honest HONKEY a chance."?



He said this on a commercial on the history channel for the History channel! It was during February so he was talking about the History channel's programs for Black History Month. Why was there no public backlash on him or the writers of that commercial? Bernie mack = Cramer. The only difference is race so why no backlash and public anger?

were you hurt and offended by him saying HONKEY?



were your ancestors enslaved, ripped from their land, their name and culture and bestowed with the term "HONKEY"?



i'm latino, if someone calls me BEANER, i'm not offended. its funny. i grew up eating beans every day. with tortillas.



call me a *******? i still laugh because I'm Latino of Spanish descent on my dads side. More Native American/Mesitzo on my moms



side. I have zero relatives in Mexico, and in fact we've been in America since the 1700's.



It don't affect me.



but if you were offended by HONKEY, then he was wrong.



what is a HONKEY anyway. i need to google that term.

Do you think former slave owners should be considered heros?



Robert E. inhereted slaves from his father which he was supposed to set free but decided to keep them to work on a plantation, he also abused them and said they where better off in American(where they were slaves) instead of their home country. Some states celebrate his day on the same days as MLK. Do u find this to be disrespectful and do u consider this man to be a hero? if so what are ur justifications.

I'm assuming the head covering you're referring to is the hijab, worn by Muslim women in public.



The reason it is seen as offensive to women is that it represents a form of oppression, as most women were forced to wear them by their families (this is still often the case). Many women choose to wear them willingly in western cultures, but this does not erase the fact that they are a symbol of a male domination over women in Islamic cultures.

Because some women assume that the woman keeps her head covered out of modesty... and that implies that a woman who DOESN'T cover her head is immodest or impure.



Concealing the body implies that there is something wrong or shameful about the body, that it should be hidden... and many liberated women don't like to be told that there is something wrong about their natural bodies.  Many women want to feel that their bodies are just fine the way they are, and that they shouldn't have to cover up to be treated with respect or to be seen as a good person.



Ultimately, however, every woman should respect the choice of every other woman, no matter what it is.  It's unfair to assume that the other person is simply mindlessly following sexist cultural dictates of modesty or sexiness; it's better to give the other person the benefit of the doubt and assume they made the choice that was right for them, and it's not meant to be a reflection or judgement on anyone else.

<question>



I live in St Thomas, US Virgin Islands, and crime is becoming a big issue. Could it be a racial problem?



I live in the US virgin Islands. It's beautiful here. People come here everyday on cruise ships, vacation and some decide to stay down here because it's owned buy the US, it's called paradise and look like it too, the water is BEAUTIFUL. But there have been crimes going on here. Lot of it. Last year or earlier this year a caucasian guy got stabbed in St John, another small islands part of the US Virgin Islands. The police did a crappy job and almost let the killers go free, but the victim's family and some other residents here didn't let that happen. Just Sunday again, another caucasian guy offered two black dudes a ride just to get robbed a killed execution style. I'm black, but I'm also very open minded and always speak up about the racial double standard existing in the society. I start believing that maybe they are targeting White people here. It would be bad because tourism is a big part of the economy in the islands. In the USVI, a lot of "natives" don't like "outsiders" like they call them, even if you're black. I'm from another French island and have been a victim of discrimination here but Caucasians have been victim of murder. Way different than what I get. I can't talk about that with any of them here because they are narrow minded. Am I blowing things out of proportion? Could I be right?

Will you save an animals life today?



Halloween is a day of happiness for children, but a time of horror for animals.
Many people do horrible things to animals (such as torcher and "sacrifice") on Halloween.



But there is a way to stop it.



All you have to do is report any suspicious behavior to the police, ASPCA, or Humane Society regarding animals.



IT COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE.



My question is, will you be a hero today?

Overpopulation? They take black cats from anywhere they can find them - including people's homes (A.K.A. PETS.)



Funny how an Asian is talking about overpopulation.



I'm looking at the facts:



Population of Asia: 3,902,404,193



Population of pets in America: Less than 69,000,000

Do you think that somewhere in the back of your head you feel that african americans live up to the typical black stereotypes.



Just answer honestly. Just to let you know, I am not white, i am mixed, and i feel that some do and many do not live up to the stereotype. at the same time, i also feel that many other cultural groups live up to so-called stereotypes as well, but i was just curious, after having a heated discussion w. a co-worker the other day at work.

I feel a bit sorry for Russell Brand - what a witch-hunt! Why should The Sun/Mirror force someone from a job?



Ok, what he said was wrong, but if it was that bad it shouldn't have been broadcast.  He apologised.  That should have been it really.  If they'd left the same message on someone like Piers Morgan's answerphone no-one would have cared a less.  I agree Andrew Sachs deserved to be treated with more respect but this is all going way too far!  The Sun and Mirror make a living out of saying far worse about people and sprawling it all over their front pages for all the world to see...I'm sure the families of their victims are none to happy either - but no-one gets fired...

Bad things never happen to bad people?  That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  Bad things happen to everyone.  I think you would classify a prostitute as a bad person, so for all you know she was molested when she was younger.  I guess you just figure when bad things happen to bad people, it's ok.  By the way, clarify who qualifies as a bad person.  Because you, sweetheart, aren't perfect.

Usually the enablers act out of what they think of as love.



I do however, agree with you that to enable the morbidly obese should be considered criminal as should the act of allowing ones self to become so. It is a crime against all of society.

This is a very important question. You should immediate seek help.  If you can not afford to seek the services of a professional counselor then you should call your local Department of Health.  They will put you in touch with no-cost services either under their direction, through charitable organizations or through volunteer professional counselors.

Circumcision in america ... Purely Cultural ?



I asked a question a few days ago about whether american men were all circumcised because that only happens in the UK for religious reasons.



The replies all told me that it was so much cleaner and healthier but not a percentage of the population but from the amount of defence im guessing it was a lot.



So is circumcision in the USA purely a cultural practise ???



Surely most first world county's would have adopted the practise if it were beneficial.

It seems to be a standard procedure here. It's not done for religious reason though it can be I guess. My parents were agnostic and they still had it done on me. Personally I think it's cleaner (and uncircumcised penises just look freaky to me). But when I asked my mom about it she did it so it'd be harder for me to "play with myself." Well that didn't exactly work. I also heard horror stories about foreskin getting pulled off with too much friction during sex. Also all kinds of nasty junk gets collected there so you have to clean it regularly. I'm glad I don't have to deal with that.



One thing I can say about uncircumcised penises is that as goofy as they look (to me) they seem bigger. Maybe the little bit of extra skin makes that much of difference.

I think it's cultural for the most part... there are a few medical conditions that can require circumcision but for a healthy person it's unnecessary. You're absolutely right... if it were needed, men over here (in Britain) would be having all sorts of problems!



From personal experience, a circumcised penis isn't any cleaner than an uncircumcised one... it's washing that keeps you clean, not whether or not you have a foreskin!



By the way, i think circumcising babies when there's no medical reason is just plain wrong. It's an unecessary procedure which they cannot consent to. I would hope the use of anaesthetic is now universal (maybe i'm wrong?)... but even then, it must cause a great deal of discomfort. I don't give a damn for religious reasons. We used to do all sorts of nasty things in the name of religion, but once society realised how cruel these practises were, they were abandoned. How sad that some still remain.

I don't know why others do it, but I know that in my family it's done purely for hygienic reasons. Little boys aren't known for being the cleanest. Most of them wont brush their teeth unless you stand over them, what are the chances they're going to take the time to carefully clean that area? When I have kids, if I have a boy I'll be doing the same thing, for the same reason.

Yes, it's simply cultural. Guys are circumised so they promote it, doctors are circumcised, women are used to circumcised men, etc. However rates are dropping significantly and it's not as common as it once was. They are just slower to catch up to other countries that used to do it but abandoned it, because they don't have nationalised health care, so it's a HUGE money making business over there.

Circumcision was introduced into mainstream american society in an attempt to limit masturbation by teenage boys.  Whether or not it had any impact back then, it seems to have little impact now.



It was only when circumcicion had been in full swing for a generation, and fear of masturbation had dropped out of the medical literature, that 'hygiene' became the reason.  Its easy to say that it is 'cleaner' - our fingers would similarly be 'cleaner' if we removed the fingernails.  But the benefit is minimal, cleaning is easy, and it only seems reasonable because circumcision had _allready_ become normal.  Other countries that did not share the puritan fear of masturbation never started circumcising in large numbers, and certainly didn't pick it up for hygiene reasons.

Circumcision in America thrives based on a mixture of culture, ignornance and the insecurity of circumcised men.



As you astutely point out, the "medical" benefits of circumcision are hogwash. If they were, the more than 80 percent of men in the world who have their penises INTACT would be sick as dogs. But they're not, because circumcision doesn't cure or prevent a damn thing.



Circumcision was put into place as a culture in the US shortly after World War II and the country has yet to shake it off. While it's not ABNORMAL to not be circumcised, the majority of males still are. The stats nationwide break down to 60 percent circumcised, 40 not.



And when circumcised men become fathers, they insist rabidly that their sons MUST be circumcised like them. Son must match father. If it sounds creepy, it's cause it is. Who the hell goes around playing a penis matching game with their father?



Anyway, to answer your question again: Yes, circumcision in America is purely cultural.

Yes it's purely cultural. It's not any healthier because if it was then pediatricians would recommend that babies are circumcised. THEY DON'T! Not even the American Academy of Pediatrics considers it medically necessary. That proves that it's just a cultural misconception and it's kind of embarrassing because we Americans are the only people that think that.



I'm not circumcised so some of the kids made fun of me in the locker room for being different and you hear about girls not liking uncircumcised guys. It's all really stupid though. Americans are taught that the foreskin is dirty and ugly because we have been circumcising the majority of boys over here for so long, people forgot why it originally became popular (to prevent boys from masturbating). Now everyone just thinks a circumcised penis is normal over here and since they don't really teach you about the foreskin at all in health class, people don't understand it and assume that we are supposed to be circumcised. Now that I've grown up a bit and done some research, I'm actually glad I was among the minority over here that was kept natural. Circumcision is supposed to decrease sensitivity and most circumcised guys need lube to masturbate! That would suck, so I'm glad I still have my foreskin.

Circumcision is done in the USA for cultural, religious, and medical reasons.  The reason it has been sustained for so long is because there are medical benefits to this.



The UK was at one time 40 percent circumcised.  the only reason it dropped is because the NHS wont pay for it.



The upper class in the UK still circumcise culturally just as they do in the us.  Prince Charles and his two sons are all circumcised.



If you have not heard of any medical conditions from being uncircumcised, then you have been looking in the wrong place.



Just do a search here on yahoo answers for phimosis, balanitis or foreskin problems or uncircumcised.



here is an article and you can look at all the foreskin questions while you are there:

Circumcision is a cleanliness thing as far as being American.  Both my boys were circumcised and my ex-husband was circumcised when he joined the army, do to many calling him an ant eater.  There is no voodoo or cultural practice as far as I know.  It's just a matter of preference.

What's the rush? You're ONLY 17! Why not enjoy being a teenager now instead of being in such a hurry to grow up so fast and then get tied down and possibly feel trapped.



The problem comes in because so many young people THINK they're ready when in reality they are not!



Statistics show that people who marry in their teens or marry for reasons of pregnancy have a higher likelihood of divorce. These were ALL people who allegedly "considered the factors" and then had second thoughts after the fact. Then it's the taxpayer who winds up shouldering the burden.



No having a baby outside of marriage isn't the end of the world...but it's not the best circumstance...either for the parent or the child. It's like walking uphill against the wind.



If you're truly serious, then you should wait until you are older (at least over 21), ideally married, and have established careers (so you and your child don't wind up on welfare when the father abandons you as so many often do).  You have the rest of your life to become a parent. So sloooow down.

People are quick to judge, but mostly they know how difficult and time consuming it is to raise a child.

I guess that I have a problem with it because I deal with so many kids who are the children of young parents.



They often struggle in many ways because they have parents who are not really parenting, but instead are just surviving...which means that the child is not the focus.  Even when the parents are doing more than just surviving, there is a higher likelihood of the child being in a single parent home or being raised by proxy (which doesn't necessarily mean that the kid will have problems, but it doesn't help).



Of course, this is not true in all cases, but it's true more often than not in my experience.

You realize you're just going to get alot of answers you don't want to hear right?



Here's another one:



Babies are a commitment, and as far as I'm concerned, if you can't afford to get married right now, then you can't afford to have a baby.



It's also a fact that teenagers haven't fully matured yet, that's key to being a good spouse and parent.



The younger generation never listens to this but the bottom line is... Why rush? Wait til you're older. There's a REASON why people have a problem with it!!!

I think it is absolutely AWFUL when young girls think they can raise a kid when theyre still kids themselves.  WHO CARES IF YOU DO GOOD IN SCHOOL? that has NOTHING to do with raising a child.  You think you are responsible, obviously you're not otherwise you wouldn't be contemplating on having a child with a "boyfriend" who will LEAVE your asss the second you gain weight.  I hope you seriously think about this and realize what a ridiculous idea you have made. and if you do decide to have one.. God Bless the poor child!

People have such a problem with it because the majority of girls your age that get pregnant are not responsible and can't handle it. For me, it would be a religious thing, but you may not have the same beliefs as I do, so I can't tell you what to do. If you really think you can do it, and afford it, then by all means, proceed. But just remember that a lot of things that you can do now, you won't be able to do with a baby. If you decide to do this, you'll want to talk to both of your families about it, and be prepared to hear some negativity. It's a big decision to make, so take some time to think about your future, and be sure that you will be able to bring up a child in a loving and stable home. Good luck!

I dont think that in this day and age, people have a problem with unmarried mothers.  I wasnt married when I had my two kiddies and nobody judged me but I was 26 when I fell pregnant with my first kiddie.  Would it not be better to wait until you finish school before having a baby?  especially as you are doing very well.  It would be a shame to have to put your schooling on hold; if you stopped now, you would be less likely to go on and do something much greater.



I wanted babies when I was 17 and looking back I was really glad I waited because I lived a little; went out and enjoyed myself, went to college, did a spot of travelling and generally did everything I wanted to do.  I look back and dont think 'I wished I did that'.



At college I watched the parents with children juggling their home life and assignments and still wonder how they did it (one woman was single and had 4 children!).  The people who got to 30 years old and had a 'mid-life crisis' and went off the rails a bit were the ones who felt like they missed out because they had kiddies young.  I am sure your lovely families have told you all this.



But at the end of the day, it is your life and you have to live it how you and your chap want it.  I cant imagine life without my kiddies.  They are so ace  and I totally see why you want them ;-)

For now, relish in the fact that you have a good paying job. Find the silver linings in that. Treat yourself to nice vacation, when vacation time come. Have a extravagant Christmas. Go shopping. Eventually though, you will have to get another job. Just hang in there.

I think you know the answer to that. If you need the money, you need to keep your job until you can find another. That's a no brainer.



What you might what to do is start looking at your job in a positive rather than a negative way. Not easy I know, but it just might make your time on the job a little easier for you.



You do have a lot to be thankful for, You have a job. You are paying your bills, you have a roof over your head, and you have money to buy food, so you aren't starving.



There are a lot of people in this world who would love to trade places with you.



Having said that, I truly hope that you are able to find a job that you really enjoy going to because it is hard to have to go to work every day doing something that you don't like.



Good Luck to you!

The economy is pretty bad right now so I think many people have jobs they aren't thrilled with. My mother always told me the saying "beggars can't be choosers" meaning sometimes you just have to take what you can get. I'm not saying settle for this job but I do  agree with others that you shouldn't quit this job no matter how horrible until you find another one. You never know how long it will be before you find another one. Maybe to alleviate stress you could exercise or meditate if you don't already. Try to find positive things about your job and focus on that. For instance, at least you make decent money when many people these days can't even find a job to begin with. Basically I find that counting my blessing makes any situation seem like it's not as bad as it really is.

<question>



What do you think of the idea of saving your first kiss for your future husband?



I know a lot of people wear "promise rings" to show chastity, but should chastity include kissing as well?



What do you think? I've seen some people who think kissing--and more-- before marriage is all right, while some make an arguement that just kissing before marriage is fine, and some think total chastity is best.

Ok the romantic thought is there but realistically...



What if you wait until that day comes and he finds out you are a horrible kisser? I'm not saying that you are a horrible kisser but some people need practice. Most times its the guy that needs help. Some guys are slobberers (wet kisses) so it takes a girl who can deal with the slobber by sucking as they kiss, basically drinking it. I guess that brings new meaning to the term "drinking in the kiss".



Do you know your future husband? If not they I don't see why you should wait. I'm not saying go and sleep with everybody. But its really weird to have a kiss with someone who doesn't know how.



Edit:
This is the definition of chastity:
1: the quality or state of being chaste: as a: abstention from unlawful sexual intercourse b: abstention from all sexual intercourse c: purity in conduct and intention d: restraint and simplicity in design or expression



2: personal integrity



It doesn't say you can't kiss so I would say it is okay. But what it boils down to is what is going to keep you chaste? If you are kissing while laying in bed that is likely to lead to something more. Its your call really. And if this future husband of yours respects you he will respect your wishes and wait.

my first kiss was from my future husband but it just happened that way, I didn't plan it that way, we kiss all the time and we didn't save sex for marriage either but we had been together for six months before the sex, if he was a virgin I may have waited because I was. I don't know how people can save kissing till after marriage, if you don't have kissing what closeness do you have?

I think what is best is what you are most comfortable with, no matter what any one else thinks so listen to your heart above all. But if you want my opinion, I think kissing before marriage is just fine. I don't think you are unchaste if you kiss the one you are going to marry. My fiancee and I enjoy kissing and we plan to go no farther than that until we are married. I think kissing helps us show our love and affection for each other. I also think it helps us get to know each other better. I've kissed other guys before and didn't really feel any sparks so I knew they probably weren't the guy for me.

I read a book by Sam and Bethany Torode where they argued that you should save kissing until your wedding day.  I didn't think they made a persuasive case that it's wrong to do otherwise, but on the other hand, I can see how a couple who did that could get a thrill out of it and feel pretty good about themselves.  It's not for me, though.  I see nothing wrong with premarital kissing, and I enjoy it.

Do black folks from Philly and NY talk the same?



This is not meant to be offensive.



I have friends from both places, and they sound exactly the same to me. Both friends talk in the standard black accent they show on TV. I think its pretty cool that people from 2 different states talk in a similar accent. Do all black Americans born and bred here talk in a standard accent?



If they dont, could you guys also give me the name of some famous celebrities that talk in maybe a southern accent, or an accent different from hte NY accent; because what we watch on TV, black people have a typical accent; much like the white americans have a standard accent. Thanks! Not meaning to offend anyone :) peace...

For the most part, people in philly talk differently then people from new york.  It's sort of similar but very different.  Not just black people, all people.  You can't base that they talk the same just from one experience or one group of friends.  Also people can talk the same way from state to state.  I don't like your question.  You should know better than to not judge people by just what you see on tv.



EDIT:  I don't mean to come off as rude, it's just you can't really tell how someone is saying something by just reading words.  I know you said you didn't mean to offend anyone.

Just be yourself and enjoy high school whilst you still can.
I spent my years being a manipulative little snob with lots of friends and now I just think: what was the point? When you're that young and you're so naive to think that popularity matters, you waste so much of your time when you could actually be having fun (like you're meant to be doing at your age!!!)



And as for the people who take 'popularity' past high school, you'll see them in five to tens years working in burger king. :)

don't waste you're time. Believe me those "popular" kids eventually end up working in a factory of mcdonalds. Trust me, they aren't as cool as they may seem to be. Be yourself find friends who like you for you. Sounds lame but it's true. Don't sell yourself short just because you want to be accepted. Everybody want's to be accepted but hanging with "the cool kids" isnt that cool.



why the heck would you want to be with somebody who only likes rich and popular kids??? thats just stupid (no offense) You want to be with somebody who likes you for you, not for what you aren't. You dont NEED to be one of them. It's obvious you are a little young, so i will tell you this the nicest way i can. in a few years you will look back on this and think about how stupid it was to even think about selling out. Be who YOU are.



by the way define popular? there are many different kinds of popular. each group of kids are different in a good way. Being poor is no excuse. I was poor my whole life but i still had friends and was firends with just about everybody but i wasnt popular.. just makes friends but don't pretend to be somebody you aren't

He probably won't say yes to your date if he is loyal to his friend. He wouldn't want to hurt him like that. Just keep that in mind.



Maybe make it clear to his friend that you are only friends, and nothing more.



Also, try to become even better friends with George, because a friendship is a good foundation for everything. :)



Take care.

Why hasn't George said anything? If his best friend is really his best friend he should be the one to talk to him and explain the situation. But it sounds like George is playing games. I mean, it is not that hard to tell someone whether or not you want to date them or at least it shouldn't be hard to tell them that you aren't trying to date anyone.

I don't think they should legalize all drugs, just marijuana.



ESPECIALLY if they're going to keep alcohol legal, which they are and should.



Kids do marijuana and its just as illegal as cocaine or heroin so what would stop them from just trying some other drug just as illegal as marijuana?

it could happen, but since you've broken up before, i would definitely be prepared for it to happen again. i've been with my boyfriend since my 15th birthday, and we're now freshmen in college. it can work out, but its really hard at times and if you're really serious and you want to be together forever, you really can't be breaking up every time you have an argument. good luck with whatever you decide to do!

Why do so many people think that Humans are mean and cruel, especially towards animals? If your cat was sudden?



If your cute little cat named Fluffy were suddenly 4 feet tall at the shoulder and 300 pounds, you would not survive another night. He would be latched onto your jugular vein and you'd be dinner.
Almost all large animals, whether herbivores or carnivores are known to kill humans. .Hippos and Elephants eat plants, but they kill more people than crocodiles or sharks.
Of course, crocs and sharks kill a lot of people too.
Not to mention wolves, bears, and tigers etc.
My point is, your pets would kill you instantly if they were large enough, and you'd be doggy doo within 12 hours.
Chew on that :)

<answer>



Well, that's not exactly true. There are domesticated large cats and there were actually two people that "owned" a lion that they had to release into the wilderness. They went to go find him a few years later and not only did he remember them but he also introduced them to his "wife". But anyway, either way, that doesn't justify being cruel to animals. We do kill animals for food, just like they would kill us but it would be hard to find some animal that gets together all of their friends and goes hunting for other animals for sport. I understand what you're saying but it's just not the same thing. Being cruel and surviving are too different things. And also, we're humans. We don't "need" to kill other animals at all. If they do, they die. If we don't we may be malnourished but we certainly wouldn't die of starvation.

I need some advice on a whole life situation deal?



I don't have that much money, who does? I am living in an apartment with my brother and mother who I would be better off without it seems, but I am dependent on my mother for survival at this point, I am 20 years old and I have 6 college credits, so in other words, two classes competed, and I don't have a job and I have about 340 dollars left in my bank account, I live in San Diego, and it costs a lot to live here, I can't afford my own place unless I room with a couple other people, but I don't have anyone to room with. Ideally I would love to move out and become completely independent but I'm not sure as to the right way of going about it. For the last 4 years I have been working at various restaurants, the last one being a fifteen minute drive away, which wasn't too good for gas, and I don't have any budget plan, I just buy things, small things, coffee, and about a book a week, I owe 350 dollars to my bank and when I bought a piano on credit, which I will never use again, it has taken me a year and a half to pay it off, I have probably given them close to 2000 dollars total trying to pay it back. At this point I feel trapped and doomed to a life of poverty. I know I am in a better situation than a lot of people, but this is how I feel. Working at these dead end jobs because I can't afford to pay for college, and when I go I can't stand it because it's all a LIE...it teaches you nothing about yourself, it prepares you to be the slaves of lazy older slaves who have inherited the top positions of these companies that don't require any real effort to work for, so we get our little slips of paper that declare that we have been robbed of a **** load of money because we are the blood that the colleges suck from our veins. Unfortunately these are the thoughts that go through my mind about these issues. I firmly believe that everyone has become a zombie to the outside world and they think that it is normal to sit in a room and learn things that they have no interest in, working long and hard hours on it so that we can spend more money on it and waste more time on it for a certain amount of time so as to ensure that there is always a steady income flowing from that part of the big ugly economy, enslaving everyone for the "greater good" of money. What I am trying to ask is that is it possible for a person in today's society to not go to college and still succeed, or are mostly all doors to all businesses closed to those who don't slave away on trying to know a bunch of various facts from different subjects that they could easily find better information for using other means, for a lot less money, and more efficiently because of instead of taking all types of courses involved in different subjects and only remembering bits and pieces of each, one can channel one's effort and energy toward the subjects one wants to learn about and become as best as possible in that area?

A question for guys (and girls I guess...why not)?  What is more appealing, "natural" or "enhanced"?



For me it's a hands down no-brainer.  I love natural breasts, no matter the size.  I hate fake....all of them, even the good surgeries.  What do you think?  Fake...or natural?

I've already found that business professionals are becoming lax w/ their spelling in their business communications.  And it seems misspellings and abbreviations and things like that are becoming more commonplace.  It's sad really, but I think society's standards are going to lower to the standards of the people (i.e. the text generation).

I need some help gathering facts?



I am presenting an argument around alcohol. I need facts like those listed bellow, as well as their sources. I have been gathering my own, but I would like to overwhelm them with the facts. So, thank you in advance.



Example Facts-
Alcohol is referred to as a "social lubricant"
7 of 10 Americans drink alcohol
1 of those 7 are alcoholics
for those of you incapable of simple math, 10% of Americans 21 or older (but lets be honest you and I both know, very few people wait till they are 21)
40% of adult Americans have direct family experience with alcohol abuse.



54% of murders and attempted murders
68% of manslaughters
52% of rape/sexual assaults
48% of robberies
are alcohol related



There are 3 alcohol related fatalities per day in Florida alone
1.4 million people were arrested for DUI/DWI in the US, but that didn't stop the 15,786 deaths in drunk driving cases.... Think it's going down?



drunk driving crashes in Florida
1997 457
1998 510
1999 518
2000 515
2001 555



It has been proven that drinking alcohol greatly increases your chances of getting cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophagus



~ 1/1000 babies are born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome today



90% of students drink alcohol
55% are binge drinkers
35% are frequent binge drinkers
&gt;20% are alcoholics of have some other diagnosable drinking disorder



for those of you who liked to complain about government finances....
Leon County had to spend ~$61 million in 2000 fighting underage drinking
there are 3077 Counties in the US, but for the benefit of the doubt lets take that figure and drop it down to $10 million county^-1



Want to know what the first stages of alcoholism are? Dependence on the mood altering ability of alcohol. Ie drinking to perk up, calm down, celebrate, mourn or to be sociable.



1400 college students age 18-24 die every year due to alcohol abuse. The average college student spends $900 dollars a semester on alcohol.



20% of corn produced goes to alcohol production. However the government subsidizes those farms $15 billion in total because more fossil energy is used to produce alcohol from corn, than alcohols calorific value.

Tiger Woods had a pretty tough year. I really respected the way he ignored the whole "lynching" controversy. Way to rise above it Tiger. He's mixed Caucasian, Black, Native American and Asian.



I would say people with partly black backgrounds have the toughest time because society automatically pegs you as "black." The media refers to Tiger, Halle Berry, Barack Obama, Thandie Newton and many more as black even though they are mixed race. I'm proud to be black but I don't want the media or other people deciding which race I am.



But I don't mean any disrespect to other multiracial people - it's probably tough to be biracial Middle Eastern right now.

In America, any of them...I've noticed that many (not all) Americans are very racist, having lived all over the world and being able to compare.  However, you get racism everywhere, and one will always be discriminated against for ONE thing or another:(  Whether it be your hair, skin, culture, religion, etc...

Is demoting myself the best thing to do?



OK, I am 16 and work at McDonald's. I was promoted in August from Crew Trainer to Team Leader. It is quite a big change, more responsibility, etc. But immediately after my promotion, one of my former Crew Trainers was really jealous, everyone could tell. She even came up to me a day later and said "I would make a great Team Leader too, I work twice as many hours as you too".



Lately she has taken way too far, she has freaked out at two managers telling them she deserves to be promoted, and she deserves it. She even back stabs me to the managers and tells them things I say (she tries to be my friend, and being young and trying to be nice, go with it, and I talk to her), she exaggerates what I say to make it sound like I'm really bad and she exaggerates what I say.



It is EXTREMELY un-professional and I can't being working everyday when its a soap opera. I think I should just go to the manager and tell her how I feel, and tell her that she should demote me, and give it to her since she wants it way more then me, and I'll tell her its not worth the 45 cent raise to put up with all this stress.



What do you think I should do?



</question>



<additional details>



The manger might not except it. But at least then they will know that I am damn well fed-up with this. If all else fails I can quit and take my awesome experience elsewhere, its not worth my youth to put up with this, I got my whole life ahead.



The giving her what she wants part. She feels like she deserves it, but if she gets promoted on the grounds that I stepped down, she would feel like she has not earned it.

I don't see why you should be demoted because someone else is jealous and won't stfu.  If you talk to the manager, you should tell them you are fed up with listening to this person, and ask what should be done about it.

Now, you didn't REALLY think those of us who are neither French living in France nor White nor male would ignore this question, did you?  lol



Here's my 2 cent from a black woman who has dated European men.



Relax. Your chances for finding romance in France are as good as anyone else's. Some white frenchmen like Black women. Some don't. Same as anyplace else.



Heck, there's even one European prince who married a Black woman.  She's the Princess Angela of Leichenstein.  Lest we forget, Prince Albert of Monaco fathered a half-Black child with a woman he'd been involved with for several years.



I know personally of a number of Black American women who are dating or married to men from all over Europe.



Just be yourself...and don't limit yourself...and the right guy will come along.



Your biggest worry really should be if the guy who is hitting you up really is single and available...or even straight for that matter!  Married men in France are notorious for cheating with single American women and breaking their hearts...so be careful.



as for the last bit, I learned that lesson the hard way....when I was 30, I went out on one date with a Frenchman who was attending my church. Turned out he was a closeted gay and involved with the church organist  :(

Of course I'd stop. What kind of person wouldn't. I'd stop to check on them while saying oh sh*t oh sh*t oh sh*t are you okay? im so sorry oh sh*t, oh sh*t.  If I left someone there to die the guilt would kill me too. Not to mention, it was an accident, and that can be explained (after all why were they in the middle of the road at 3am?) but if you keep driving and try to hide what you did, then it can be questionable if it was an accident or not..and the cops will use that when they're throwing your butt in jail

State IDs- what are they?



What's a state ID and what can you do with it? Can you buy cigarettes with it?



Also, does it look like a drivers license? Does it have your picture on it?



And what exactly is its purpose? Is it for people who can't drive but are 18 & older?

It is a valid ID issued by State Governments, It saves the same function as DL. You can use it where official ID is required (assuming you have no DL). It has your picture, may or maynot look like DL, but serves the same function as DL EXCEPT it is not for Driving.

What a tough one.  My grandmother is 93 and in relatively good health.  I visited her a month ago, at the manor where she has lived for 4 years.  She talked often about hoping she doesn't live too much longer.  She is a strong woman and has a very sharp mind which is fading.  She gets frustrated daily because her short term memory is not what it used to be.  She is very fearful that one day she will be sitting alone in the corner, not having a clue about what is going on in the world.  I think it should be her right to end her life if she wanted to.  But, sometimes people feel one way, but with proper care, may feel differently.



If some one could determine a person was of sound mind, I think it is your choice.

I don't think it's appropriate to take human life, no matter the suffering.  I visited my grandmother when she was very ill and dying.  She had two broken femurs and a ruptured intestine and all sorts of other ailments and was in constant pain and delirious, but I still think it's morally wrong to kill just to ease her pain.  It's pretty much the same thing as suicide.

I used to think it was a horrible thing that people would do because they were lazy and didn't want to take care of the sick or elderly.  I had to change my opinion as I watched my grandmother die a horrible death from pancreatic cancer.  It was the most awful thing I have ever had to witness.



She was my rock for my entire life.  She was the only person that I ever KNEW loved me and I love her so much.  She dwindled to nothing and was unconscious, most of the time, without the ability to wake up.  The only thing she could do was to moan in agony.  She couldn't eat and she had orders in place to not take a feeding tube.  She was in horrible pain, even an animal shouldn't be forced to suffer the way she had to.  She was a Christian and knew she was going to Heaven.  I would have given anything if someone could have given her a lethal dose of morphine and let go to sleep peacefully.  It still breaks my heart to think about it.  I would love to have her back, in good health,  for 5 minutes because I miss her so much.  Letting go of her was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.

I think that it does suck but if a person is in such pain that it would be a relief to them. Some diseases are horrible and to live in pain is no life at all. None of  us here can really give an opion unless we were in that situation. But I am for it, it should be the patient's decision if they can no longer tolerate the disease and that is the only way to stop it then they should be allowed to end it.

assisted suicide, in my opinion is neither morally or spiritually correct. i feel that everyone has an appointed time to die. when the Lord is ready for us He will call us home. the Lord allows us to suffer to strengthen our faith. we must suffer as Christ suffered to be counted worthy in His sight. so my answer is no to assisted suicide.

Human (ie dr assisted suicide) - It's still suicide. I don't think it's right. But then again, I've never had to really suffer. Maybe I'd change my mind.

yes. i've read an article a few months ago that when employers calculate and allocate your sick time. they've already considered the fact that some employees call their work off even if they're not sick.



if you think about it, when you dont really feel like working, you'de be unproductive or less productive. so, you might as well call off sick.

MAKING ECSTASY IN THE UNITED STATES?



Ok. I'm working on a script which requires my characters to make ecstasy right here in the present day in the U.S. I know... no easy task. All my research indicates that the government has super strict regulations on the materials needed to make it (primarily sassafras oil). So my question is... how can I make it so that the characters make the ecstacy? It has to be realistic. They are regular people. They can't just fly to foreign countries to buy the banned materials or anything like that.



One idea I had was that they have access to perfumes and soaps that were made before the ban on sassafras oil and contain safrole. Would that work? Any info on things that could've contained it in the past and may still be around now would be helpful. All that matters is that the premise is realistic. Please let me know. Been working on project for six months and to not find a way for the characters to make it would kill the story. I know it's hard but please try to help me find a way. Thanks in advance.

5,5 is average. So anything over that is pretty tall. Some teenagers shoot up very fast but then stop growing. I wouldnt worry about it. Just because the doctor told you that you would stop growing when your 15 does not mean your going to keep getting taller. You might just stay 5,5. Which is a normal good height for a girl.

At 5' 5", you are not considered short.  You will add more inches in growth---well beyond 15.

Will people remember her?



I’ve served on my ship for over twenty years and she has been a fine ship, she’s seen more than her fair share of action and done herself proud. But now she is being decommissioned and I cant help but think she’ll be forgotten.
Do you think people will remember our ship and all she has done, also do you think they’ll be giving me another command?

Absolutely everything and everyone will be forgotten, it is only a matter of time.

<question>



How can I solve my feeling of having no meaning in my life?



Please no "seek God/Jesus" answers.



I have good health, am self employed, have a few friends, my finances are in order. I have many things to be thankful for and I acknowledge that. I am a single gay male approaching middle age.



Lately my dreams have been unpleasantly empty. When I wake up I feel lonely and without purpose. I go through my routine thinking positively and counting my blessings to cheer myself up.



But I know it's more than that. I feel deep inside that I'm missing some kind of meaning in my life. Age does not phase me so this is not a midlife crises thing.



Do you have any constructive thoughts/suggestions?  Thanks!

Why do people justify killing animals for fun as population control?



This was said about Sarah Palin



"she hunts for food and to control the wildlife population so that they don't over breed and then starve to death when there's not enough food."



Really?  So instead of letting them overbreed and starve...she beats them to the punch and shoots them to death from a helicopter instead. Logical.



Surely there must be another species on the earth that is overpopulated even worse wolves or moose, or any other mammal....that one species, there's about 7 billion of them....should we justify hunting of that species for sport as a way to control their population too?

It's the increase of gas in your lower intestine due a massive yeast infection that is filling your gut with hydrogen and blocking your vagina. You are actually having periods, but they are backing up, causing you to get even more bloated. You also now cannot pee, so this is contributing to your now whale-like proportions.
I recommend a large pin. (Pretend this answer is as feasible as your question!)

How can one person helps to save the World?



Today we all face a great challenge. The use of fossil fuels to create electricity and power cars, trucks and planes has begun to impact the global climate. Without immediate action, many scientists predict climate change may soon cause major crop losses and lack of drinking water throughout the world.



Our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren now depend upon each of us taking immediate action to stop climate change. This may seem like an overwhelming task, but it isn't. Stopping climate change is a simple problem that each of us has the ability to solve.



Many people look to governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations to solve our environmental problems. In reality, however, no organization or government can stop climate change, only individuals can. Each of us has the ability to make minor changes to our own lives that can have a rapid and positive impact on the global environment.

Sure enough, write about more than one major city from each country like New York City, Honk Kong, Cairo, Paris, and London. Each city has a lot of culture in my opinion. Also, before you begin writing, I recommend you work on your grammar, and remember, it's spelled 'city cultures.' I don't want you to get a horrible grade on your essay.

I believe the Middle-Easterns you see flirting with Black women are probably just simply attracted to them. Sure enough, if the woman was Middle-Eastern, White, Hispanic, Asian, etc., and he was attracted to her, he'd flirt with her too. Therefore, I don't believe the situation is racial, I think it's just flirting with whomever he's attracted to.

Well they're not exactly the best looking bunch of males around, & i refuse to end up marrying one, (just not attracted to them) but i'm a female Middle Eastern person, & i'm very much attracted to men who are of African (& Pacific Islander) descent. Is it so bad, though? i mean, yes i can see why you might be a bit repelled by them (i am too) but, if the flirting is reciprocated, then who's to say that it's wrong?

Why do so many English & Irish move to Australia?



Ok, we generally don't mind you lot & yes we helped to a large extent to save you from Hitler, well before the Americans set foot in Europe or Africa in WWII and what was our repayment? Not that you would i good time return our Troops to defend their homeland against the Japanese, but rather you swarm our beaches and hotels like 'blow-ins' from some strange, distant, cold, pale skinned place!



Why do you come in such large numbers and lengthen the ques at the bars waiting for a drink? Ok some of your women can compete with ours, but really England isn't known for producing too many Miss Universe winners are they!



Funnily enough the Irish & Scottish we don't mind, they can at least keep up and most often always return home - broke hahaha.....So why must you all come? Is it that bad in England? Are you lot all 'Bondi dreaming'?



FINALLY, WHY DO THE ENGLISH USE THE WORD 'MATE'? Thats globally known as an Aussie term....

I don't know what to say Bruce, you've stumped me on this one. Perhaps it's because Australia's a long way away from England. Maybe we're just too lazy to learn a foreign language, or perhaps we think it's where Fosters Lager comes from.
I've never been to Australia but I'd like to go there, just for a short while mind. I'd like to go to Alice Springs just to see if it's really as good as Peter Finch said it was. I've met lots of Australians in Earls Court and they seem OK to me.
Thanks for the help you gave in WWII, but you really did us an even bigger favour at Gallipoli in WWI and we all owe you a few beers for that.

I say it wouldn't make a difference because, in my opinion, it depends on what you do on the battlefield to be considered the "ultimate service." For example, is a troop died fighting for his country, he deserves honor because it shows how much he cared for the nation. However, if the guy was killed in the act of betraying his country, he's a disgrace. Nevertheless, if the troop is genuine, brave, and willing to fight, I agree, he should never surrender to the enemy.

I think most wars are stupid and are all about the people in charge getting rich by selling weapons or trading commodities. So I would have to say that death on the battlefield is evidence of naivete if not outright stupidity.

The stereotype about Blacks drinking Kool-Aid has been around long before Obama was even running for President. My best advice is to not get offended by it because, trust me, what's so bad about drinking Kool-Aid? It tastes great and it's favored by a lot of people. It's quite similar to the watermelon stereotype whereas it's non-offensive because there's nothing wrong with liking it, and it's normal food. I mean, it's not like we're eating crap or drinking pee or anything.



EDIT: Trust me, drinking Kool-Aid has nothing to do with intelligence. It's all about personal preference to quench one's thirst.



EDIT - 7:05AM: And we have the right to consume any drink we please. No one said we had to be offended, or even listen to the stereotypes.

Australians always seem to do very well and generally have come to expect victory when competing in most things, finishing just outside the 3 largest Global Powers with a far greater population. So why does Australia always out perform much larger countries?

Australia has a national identity for being 'sporty' and giving everyone a 'fair go' - or at least it likes to think itself as being those things. Australia spends a lot of money promoting sport so that the people living there can be healthier and they can become better known as a country.

When you feel watched, try to stay calm. It is hard to say what this could be or mean, so say a few things out loud, hum, or recite something for a moment and maybe this watched feeling will go away. If nothing else, hopefully it will calm you down enough that the watched feeling won't bother you as much and you can continue with whatever you were doing to begin with. If it persists after another week or so, I would suggest talking to someone about your fear because it does seem a little creepy.

I am sorry that you have fallen on some tough times, but I would have to agree with one of the previous answers and hold a huge garage/yard sale and go onto craigslist . com to see if maybe there is a small job you can pick up in your area. The best way for job searching though is networking and word of mouth. If someone you know is in a place that needs a temp worker, I would apply for that if you can. Good luck out there.

Yeah, that's not good- I know those lax gun laws in Texas paid off for a cousin of mine last week- he shot and wounded some guy who was going  around the neighborhood putting up McCain signs in people's yards. When this guy stepped onto my cousin's lawn and pulled out a McCain sign to hammer into the grass,  my cousin was ready, and flung open his front door and shot him (non-fatal, thank goodness). Fortunately, the gun laws are quite liberal  in Texas, and my cousin was actually justified in shooting this "trespasser" in exactly the same way Joe Horn shot and killed those two robbers in the Houston area. Gotta love those 2nd amendment rights!

Question about American cigarette packages?



I just switched from my Canadian cigs to American Spirits.  Our Canadian packs come in a stiff cardboard that are easy to transport in your purse.
How do you people in the US keep your cigarettes from falling out in your purse or squishing.  I'm thinking of getting a cigarette case.

<answer>



The American Dream is belief in the freedom that allows all citizens and residents of the United States to pursue their goals in life through hard work. Today, it often refers to one's material prosperity, which is dependent upon one's abilities and work ethic, and not on a rigid class structure.



Although the phrase's meaning has evolved over the course of American history, for some people, it is the opportunity to achieve greater material prosperity than was possible in their countries of origin. For others it is the opportunity for their children to grow up and receive an education and its consequent career opportunities. It is the opportunity to make individual choices without the restrictions of class, caste, religion, race, or ethnic group.

I don't tend to go out barefoot but if the shoes are crippling it has been known for me to take them off once I am at somewhere..thats the problem with so many lovely looking shoes, they murder your feet!



It kinda depends where you are going how dirty your feet get..surprisingly I have got less dirty feet from some pavements than certain pubs/clubs!!



I would definitely suggest you take a pair of shoes with you, as some pubs or whatever can be really gross, and you wouldn't want to be walking through some of those places without any shoes on!  And be prepared for a lot of foot scrubbing when you get home!

What does God do for those people born and influenced by culture that dictates their religion?



I'm a 15 year-old christian and strongly believer of God. I'm just wondering, if there are different religions, and most probably a person will fall into a religion where he/she is exposed ( through the kind of culture and norm or through his/her environment), then how can they know the true God ( speaking in the context of Christianity)? I mean what does God do about the inevitable inequality among all people when pertaining to factors like the culture where you are born and the beliefs ingrained in your mind by your family, society and lifestyle? I was scared when I realized that if I was just born in a chinese family, I would be believing in Buddha or Confucian teachings, or when I was born in India, I would be practicing Hinduism or Jainism or Zoroastrianism....which means I could have found God...Please help me understand.

<question>



How can i find a Witchcraft teacher/mentor?



Hello everyone, I am looking for someone, I prefer a woman but a man is ok. I just need some guidance some help. I have been interested in witchcraft for most of my life for as long as i can remember. Unfortunately my life choices and issues has put me in a place that has not made it easy for me to learn the craft. So if there is anyone willing to help me i will take it.
One thing that i have to say is that i would like to be able to meet offline is that is possible if its not then online is great.(e-mail me and we will talk about meeting up offline)
And second I don't want people saying anything about age or anything like that because age race... do not define your knowledge base. I read the answers to a young women who was offering help and i may not know everything but i do know that Wiccans, witches and others by other names are kind giving and helpful people and the way some people responded to her was not kind at all so if you want to bash people for want to offer help based on there age then don't respond to me because because I only want the help of true kind minded people. Also if someone grew up in family of witches i think that at even a young age she or he would be most helpful to just about anyone even if they are way older.



Just a tip to those who judge by age and not knowledge.
So anyone who wants to help me or help me find help learning about the craft e-mail me @ Badygurl1986@yahoo.com



My main interests are in healing, potions, herb and candle magick, rituals(healing, meditation, helping others, ...), and more along those lines.

New York Men.....ugh oh!!! help help help!!! ?



okay here's the thing (and I'll try to say all of this w/o getting 2 graphic)
i want to live in NYC (manhattan to be exact)
and i was wondering about the dating scene up there
especially because i happen to actually have a few values
now dont get me wrong im not a "prude"!!!!
i love to do sexual things w/ my man like fooling around, oral, "sumata" (lol look up the definition plz) i just dont want to



have sex until im married...i really want to have a special connection
on that physical/spirtual/mental level with him that i wont have with anyone else...call me out dated but that is just how i feel : ) im not shy nor am i boring i love to go out party, dance or do something silly and random around town with my friends or sometimes just chill at home with my boyfriend or my good friends...and im not shallow, heartless, or a golddigger



do you think that my option to not have sex until marriage will hurt me on the dating scene?

How has the Credit Crunch and Recession effected people giving to charity?



Are people becoming less charitable? Have you seen any examples?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The Credit Crunch and Recession have effected people giving to charity as people are struggling with their mortgages and are facing repossessions so they are saving up money and not giving like some people do regularly.



Most people are really tight with money but they still try give to charity as much as they can, but because of the credit crunch their wages are affected as they work on commission.



Hope it Helps X

well if your talking about why we hold most of the power its because of these two reasons:



1. women are very competitive so they don't get along; whereas, men compete in groups so end up obtaining more power



2. women carry children and most naturally want to have kids in their late twenties and early thirties. from then on its a decision between should i be a mother to my children or work full time and leave them at the day care center

It's because the world has not listened to the promised Messiah's teachings. Everyone else is waiting , one way or the other, for Jesus to come back in this world and guide the people. But those who are humans and are dead cannot come again to this world. The promised Messiah appeared in India and declared that he was the one who was to come. He has a large muslim community today spread all over the world and this community is called Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.  This community is trying to spread in the world the true Islam. An Islam which teaches the people how to be good neighbours.The slogan of this community is LOVE FOR ALL AND HATRED FOR NONE.

<question>



What was the culture like in Pakistan before the whole Talibization and extremism?



I want Pakistanis (or anyone) who know what I'm ACTUALLY talking about to answer this question.



I was born to Turkish parents. My dad was in the embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan for 5 years. I lived in Pakistan from 1988 to 1993. I then came to the US in 1993, and became a citizen of this country.



Anyways, I had a unique experience in Pakistan. The culture was up and booming in Pakistan. I studied in an international school in Islamabad, and the media was definite pro-America. The Pakistani kids with me were REALLY into the rock culture of the west, and I developed my "fatal" addiction to Led Zeppelin and The Beatles in Pakistan. I formed a rock band with some kids there, had posters plastered all over my room; and had all the rock albums. Those were great days for me.



Pakistan had a unique culture at my time there: Benazir Bhutto was the prime minister, and there was a really 'hip' element in Pakistan then. Female music artists like Nazia Hasan were prevalent too. At my time in Pakistan, i saw true rockers there, and had an amazing time. They showed all the cool stuff on TV, all the cool ads (like Don Carlos). And the girls were just so cool at that time.



I will cherish my five years in Pakistan, and will reminisce those times; because i had cool amazing friends. However, it saddens me what the country is going through today. I would love to visit that country sometime if they still had those people there.



So, moderate Pakistanis, please give me your analysis on what you think the Pakistani culture was like in the past. And leave behind some good memories.



This is not a question to offend anyone, so please answer if you know SOMETHING about it.

To be honest, I'm pretty mixed in my reaction.  On one hand, I think the guys a bit of a dick sometimes, on the other hand... if he gets sacked then the genuinely funny, to-the-bone comedy presenters will be scared and smothered by the fear of their off-the-wall antics and possible reprisals.



I just don't know if sacking the dick Ross will be a good thing for entertainment on the whole but I would like to see him made a fool of as he isn't really that funny.



And as for the other tool involved, he was never funny.  Just an ugly bastard who shouts a lot.

We are all Indian right,so we should have equal right accross India.
Who ever wants to divide us on regional basis is definately not a right person.
Indeed mumbai is more popular due to its blending with other language Indian people in movies industry or other industries. so is the case of other big cities. About benefit from state government scheme 15 yrs residence status is very important to give some benefits for locals also. But there should not be any thing else againts people from other states.

Summers were hotter, the mud used to crack.  You could play out without fear, even after dark.  Street parties happened a lot.  You could play conkers in school.  We weren't wrapped up in cotton wool.



We had respect and a healthy fear of older people.  If you gave cheek and they stopped to confront you, you ran away with genuine fear.



I'd say it was very much like growing up in any other country and things have degenerated the world over.

Iwas born in 1973 in Plymouth, I remember being allowed to go to school when I was 4 years old I was brought up in Devonport whis is  a rough area of the city but back then everyone was poor, they were all in the same boat, when I was 5 I moved to Tavistock a town on the edge of the moors about 15 miles away, I remember before we left Plymouth we celebrated the queens Silver Jubilee and I dressed up as Mrs Mop, (I kept on getting told off for eating the candy cigarettes)  Life was rural in Tavistock at the time, but the people seemed richer, my dad didnt have  a TV for some years yet.  It was still the middle of the cold war and I remember being upset because I saw a map on the news and it showed the SW of England as a major target for a Soviet tactical nuclear missile strike.  When I left school 1989 it was the middle of  a recession the year before my friends had all got jobs in construction and were earning amounts that you would expect school leavers to earn even now, the recession put an end to that, soon, there were well over 3 million people on the dole, including me and all of my school leaver friends, I went on a YTS scheme and earned £29.50 a week, when I qualified in Horticulture, they threw me off the scheme so they didn't have to pay any money and take me on.  I remember that if you were naughty at primary school you would get a smacked bottom in front of the whole class.  Thats just  a few memories, but here are some links that might help you out.

Asking questions,what do u think?



I am new to yahoo ask but find it very helpful, when i read a question and post an answer to the best of my knowledge that might help someone in need of advice it makes me feel a little better about myself,my main motive is not for mere self satisfaction or gratification but because i genuinely like to help people. So why do some people leave quite horrible answers which are often insensitive and unkind or snide comments left for people who may or may not be in severe distress!!!? Is this site just a competition to rack up points or is everyone else just completely missing the point?

What's funny about fundamentalists on both sides, to me, is this:



Abortion is a hot button issue to presidential races.  Let's take a look at the 10th Amendment, shall we?



The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.



And the whole Theist or Atheist thing.  Let's read the first Amendment now:



Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The politics of humor?



Hi all, I'm new here and would like some feedback from you guys.



I suppose this is more about the politics of humor.



I am having a discussion on another forum with someone from the US about the US presidential election and the discussion got sidetracked into talking about the legacy of slavery in the US and I suppose how that still affects how people in the North and South feel.



Anyway, at one point this person was answering some questions of mine and posted this...



Quote:
''Buying a slave was on the order of buying a car today, some were more expensive than others but none were really cheap, meaning it was nothing you did on a whim. In 1860 a quality slave would go for $1500 which would be $16,500 or more today. The price depended on lots of things as you’d imagine and others apart from the obvious - the type of work, type of crop, crop prices to some extent and the person’s attitude. Somebody like Tupac would have been cheaper than usual.''



When challenged about the last sentence in that paragraph he said it was a joke.



I personally believe that this joke was completely inappropriate to make in a serious discussion.



I have told him as much and now he is calling me uptight and telling me his Black American friends would have no problem with him making such a joke because they have a 'healthy disposition' with regard such humor.



Anyway, what do you guys think?



Is that joke funny?



Is that the kind of joke an African American would be happy for their White friends making?



Just curious about the nature of humor there in the US.



Thanks for reading, I look forward to your replies.

This is... Very dificult to really say. Slavery has been a part of a lot of countries for a very very very long time. The American enslavement of African American's is pretty minor in comparison to alot of other events, and people tend to forget North America took a very small percentage of the slaves anyways.

You mean in the US..?
Well if the white men didn't take the Africans away from their homeland while threatening to kill them, bring them over to America in tight, uncomfortable conditions, and auction them off like pigs.. then I guess we wouldn't have that much African Americans living in the US.

I think countries would be less interesting because they would have less culture. People by inter-grating with other cultures have become more open and have experienced things they never would have before such as foods and festivals . Slavery was bad but it has taught the world to be more accepting then it would have been before.

For one thing, we wouldn't have the pyramids in Egypt.  Slave labor built them.  And Aztecs in the Americas used slave labor to build their pyramid-type structures where they sacrificed people by removing their hearts while they were still alive.  Taj Mahal.  Roman Colliseum.  Lots of famous landmarks wouldn't exist if there hadn't been slaves throughout history.



Doesn't make slavery right, of course, but those are instances of what the world would be like without slavery which is the question you asked.

Do you agree with trick or treat?



I am left wondering. I don't like the idea of trick or treating, for me personally its confusing for children and dangerous. I find myself wondering why parents spend all year telling children not to accept things from strangers and not to talk to anyone they dont know and then send them out on Halloween to knock on their doors
Does it not also say to children that for one night of the year all the rules go out the window and you can take whatever you want from whoever you want, be that by way of older children mugging the younger ones or the younger ones effectively begging on someones doorstep,



In addition to that is it fair on the people that don't celebrate halloween to be constantly bothered all night long and risk damage to their properties if they ask children to leave empty handed
Is it just me who feels this way???



</question>



<additional details>



I don't disagree with Halloween like you all said its a bit of fun, I just think its safer to throw a party for chldren and their friends than send kids out on to the streets.
As for valentines day, no i don't celebrate that and my partner is happy with that, Christmas and New years are holidays i spend with my family, not in a pub and nope not in Harlem, In UK, which depending where you are is equally as dangerous.



Its a personal choice, I just wanted to get other peoples views on it, out of curiosity

Yeah its good.. its a holiday, people get to enjoy it which is always good, children that young go out with their parents so they are safe and know its only one day a year when they dress up and get sweets.. older children (like me!) also enjoy it and know its a one off day.. i think as long as no one is out all on their own then its fine.

It's a form of celebration so I agree with it. If you are afraid of retribution, then keep your lights off and go to the back of your house and enjoy a movie or something. If you have kids, make sure you just answer any questions they have about it and try to teach them your values and what you believe is important for their growth mentally and physically.



I have to ask... What do you think about Valentines day then? It is a day where men are expected to give gifts to women but nothing is really expected the other way around. It is a sexist holiday. Sure you can get your man a sexy pair of boxers or a heart covered tie with a box of chocolates but just think of the VOLUMES of gifts out there for the woman. I'm male and I love my woman so I'm still completely for it.



What do you think about New Years day then? It's a day of drinking till you puke if you even remember midnight and suffer for it the next day.  What a great way to bring in the New Year.. with alcohol. I only drink a glass or two in moderation and I enjoy myself and my company so I am for it.



Want to focus on kids?  What about Christmas and birthdays? You are teaching your kids that they are only worthy of large quantities of gifts and extra love on 2 days out of the year. I always loved these holidays and when I have children, I'll still celebrate these.



The same can be said about any holiday for anyone that wants to find something wrong with it. I believe that a holiday is just another day to let lose to relax and enjoy. I think it's fine for children and if you have issues with something or some event, explain your point of view to your children.

Well, for one, Halloween is tradition, people have been doing it for a looonngg time. For the little ones trick or treating, parents are either THERE, or close behind watching. Policemen are circling around the area so its quite safe. Also, most parents inspect the kid's candy to make sure its safe.



If you don't celebrate Halloween, and you dont want the kids to knock on your doorbell, everybody knows to keep your porch light off. Every trick or treater knows the candy is where the lights are.



I love Halloween, its my favorite holiday.

Wow, you really take things seriously.



Honestly, it's just a light-hearted day for kids to dress is costumes and get candy. If you don't wish to have trick-or-treaters, you don't turn on your porch light-that's the signal that you're willing to accept Halloweeners.



I do not equate it with begging because it's a well-known expected thing, and people participate (or don't) at their own discretion.



My husband is a photographer, and every Halloween, he opens the studio to anyone in costume, has a Halloween set and takes their photo. While they're waiting for their picture, he gives them a candy bar and cookies--not because he's forced to, but because it's a wonderful thing to share your blessings and talents with others. The kids are so happy to get the treats, the parents are thrilled to have the picture or their little ones. Families come back year after year--he did 450 kids last year--all free. I cannot understand what's negative about neighbors sharing with each other! Kids do understand they can do this only because it's Halloween-there is no confusion.

No i don't agree with trick or treat. many years ago I would have said yes i do. but now days there are so many people out there that think it is funny to put things in the candy , apples , and other goodies. It is pretty bad when the Sheriffs department and the hospital will have people work overtime just checking candy for kids, the hospital here will even X-ray the candy to see if there is any Metal like pins or razer blades in it for the kids. It you have to go to that extreme it is not worth it.

Though the world is dangerous as the media is all to eager to tell us, most people are good people. I think it is a good way to get to know your neighbors. It really does not help further progress the world to automatically assume people are trying to harm you and your family.  If you are that worried I know my church does what is called a tricker trunk. Members of the parish line up their cars in the church parking lot and hand out candy.

I never have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I know however, when I wake up, I'm still really tired sometimes, and therefore, I take a shower, make breakfast, then do a couple of exercises to fully wake me up. You should try it sometimes. ^___^

i do the thing you dont do is wake up when your alarm rings and stay in bed for an extra 5 or 10 minutes because that makes it worse the thing that i do is pull up the covers so cold air gets in and that normally wake me up and opening your eyes fully instead of opening them a little bit and telling yourself your gonna wake up any minute now which youu dont lol

Sometimes. Yes. Putting the alarm clock across the room so I have to get out of bed to turn it off helps. Otherwise I can hear the alarm, press snooze a million times and never really remember doing it until its too late. lol. Zombie type sleepiness seems to be heavier right around the time I'm supposed to be waking up! I asked my doctor about it once and he said something odd. He said to eat protein right before going to sleep. Like peanut butter on a spoon. I wish I could remember his reasoning. I tried it and it did seem to work, but I have no idea why.



Going to sleep at the same time every night, and getting up at the same time every morning are supposed to help...but for me, thats impossible..who wants to never sleep in? Crazy. But I think the idea is to set your body clock to a regulated circadian cycle so you naturally spring awake in the morning at the same time. (Who does this?) haha. jk. I wish I could. I would think cutting down or eliminating caffeine would be helpful too as it disrupts your nervous system. But for me, the nasty sounding alarm clock on the other side of the room works great. Not fun, but gets the job done.

Why is hanging considered racial?



Historically more white people have been executed by hanging than black people. So why is hanging considered to be a racist sign against black people nowadays? Both black and white people were lynched so that can't be the answer. Maybe it has something to do with the KKK?

<additional details>



Even if I was ignorant... which I don't think I am because eveything I say makes sense when you look at logic and not your emotions... at least I'm asking a question about it to learn more. So none of that.



I am not downplaying what minorities face. I just don't think this has anything to do with race. I also believe that latinos suffer a great more nowadays than african americans do.



I am black.

Haha.  All the people calling him ignorant for saying that more whites were hanged than blacks, are you aware that A) the best way to cure ignorance is to ask questions, and B) there is actually another continent outside of the US that some people occasionally refer to as "Europe"?  In case you haven't, all you not-ignorant people, it's a land absolutely FULL of white people who have a long history of using the gallows as the primary means of capital punishment.  Muslim-influenced countries such as those in Africa generally used beheading instead, as well as China and Japan.



On top of that, between 1880 and 1951 the Tuskegee Institute recorded that over a quarter of all people lynched were white, and that's on top of all the legally hanged criminals from thousands of years ago all the way up until 1996.



"Why are people always trying to downplay what minorities face in this country?"



Umm... Because not everybody is so insecure about their morality that they need to flatter minorities at every turn?  Seriously, you guys don't fool anybody.



As for the original question, it's because lynching is far more sensational than hanging, so it is more likely to be remembered, especially since the practice as a legal method of execution has long since been out of common use while we are still reminded of the horrors of lynchings fairly often.  Not to mention everybody is embarrassed that America once acted so inconceivably cruel towards people just because they were different.

Not only does this thouroughly answer my question, it also puts you jerks in your place. If our country can't answer the hard questions peacefully, and is offensive whenever race comes up you know we are doomed. From your answers it seems to me U.S.A is full of so many racist people, white and black

hmm, I never knew hanging was associated mainly with executing black people?  Personally anytime I think of hanging I think of old western movies, which of course didnt have many (if any) black people in them.  I guess its just me :\



But, if the word lynching is mentioned specifically, yes I do think of the KKK.

<answer>



It's not HANGING that is considered to be racial, it's LYNCHING. That is, mobs of people grabbing blacks and hanging them as part of a whole social event and terrorism party, scaring other blacks in the community into obedience for fear of also being lynched. A noose is considered to be a racist sign because it's one of the ways that racists terrorized blacks in the U.S. Hangings were done more under the aegis of the law, as punishment, not as terror. No one ever went around grabbing white people and hanging them in the middle of the night for fun.



And also, you have a) no evidence that more white people have been executed by hanging than black people, and b) even if we say for the sake of evidence that it is true, you've provided no evidence regarding percentages killed. That is, whites are a majority in the  U.S., so you'd expect greater numbers of them to show up in whatever statistics you have, and blacks are a minority, so smaller numbers will show up. But 5 white people hanged represents a much smaller percent of the white population than 5 black people hanged as part of the black population as a whole.



Also, it's pointless to say something like "Latinos suffer more than African-Americans." You can't quantify suffering, and you can't make a generalization like that--some have it worse than others, some have it better.

Asking questions,what do u think?



I am new to yahoo ask but find it very helpful, when i read a question and post an answer to the best of my knowledge that might help someone in need of advice it makes me feel a little better about myself,my main motive is not for mere self satisfaction or gratification but because i genuinely like to help people. So why do some people leave quite horrible answers which are often insensitive and unkind or snide comments left for people who may or may not be in severe distress!!!?

It's because most people on this site join not to help people, but offend them with hateful answers. Usually, every question has at least one of those types of people, while the higher level or Top Contributors provide the sensible answers. Sure enough, regular members like level 1 could also provide good answers, but that somewhat rare. They're usually trolls.

I have found that there are many members here who are bored and looking for some entertainment. They have no intention of trying to help people, they only want a good laugh.
I try to answer question in a way that will help the asker, but some questions are so odd that I just can't help myself from leaving an odd answer.
One thing you can try is whenever you see an answer that bothers you, block that user. This way, you will not get that user answering any of your questions.

Not everyone is a diplomat and not everyone wants to ***** foot around every subject. This is a questions and answers forum and as such is not an appropriate medium for people to use if they have serious problems etc.  You cannot dictate how other people will answer and you cannot assume you are the only one who knows the "point".  YA is a game - that is the only point and its one you can't even win!

Neighbors can be part of your tribe.  It's important to have good relations with the people who live next or near to you because, your home is your safe, comfort zone.  The place where you can "let your hair down."  So, neighbors play a vital role in community and also in learning how to and practicing socialization and integration in society.  It also just feels good to have the place where you live be surrounded with good feelings.

Good neighbours are very important. I will give a simple example in my life which illustrates the necessity of having helping neighbours.  Few years back me & my wife had to visit UK to help my daughter' family during her delivary.  I have an very old mother who requires to be looked after in our absence.  Our neighbours voluntarily came forward took the burden of the same.  We in India involve ourselves in the lives of our neighbours(some times it may disturb you/your privacy) but they are the ones who could attend you to help in case of need.  I was totally free to leave India.  Here I want to put few lines how an ununderstanding neighbour would be miserable- during our same visit on the day when my daughter was in hospital with labour pains-it was in the night , as we are not supposed to visit her in the hospital- in a state of anxiety we were awake althrough the night & our lights were on.  The next day the neighbour came up with harsh worded complaint alleging our lights disturbed them as through ventilators light passes to their house.  Their children could not sleep even with little lighting.  Without knowing what made us awake & put on lights during night they complained.  So  neighbours of good nature are most welcome- they are more needed than a friend who could not be in a position to extend his helping hand.

we were considering moving when a new family moved into the other side of our semidetached house.Two children, and they are from Brazil.



We had adopted a Brazilian family when they came to our church and they were expecting a baby they went on to have a second child before returning to Brazil.Both these families are friends our adopted family have returned to the UK.so we are very happy.But it does not stop their we saw that our next door house was up for sale, never spoken to the owner not even a smile.I phone a young couple who were looking to move and wanted to purchase a sun-trap as ours are on this small estate.I said I had found a three bedroom house with the Best Neighbours in the world,wow who are they S & B that's my wife and I.We laughed they came,yes you got it they are moving in this weekend,and are fellow members of our church,so it feels so blessed they came over last night for a meal, but we have a problem now as our Brazilian neighbours ask us in on Christmas's eve our new neighbours also want us with them ain't it great from no friendly next door neighbours to this and they are from India.Yes you gust it our old neighbours were english and never even said "Good Morning" we tried but sorry our smiles words feel on STONE ground.Popa

We're raised on Dunkin. My dad (who was a cop) used to bring me to Dunkin Donuts everyday when I was a baby. I would eat Munchkins and a sip a small coffee with tons of milk and sugar. We would frequently see his cop buddies there too. Whenever I think of my dad, I think of Old Spice Aftershave and Dunkin Donuts.

Question For Brits - Stiff Upper Lip . . . ?



Is the British notion of keeping "a stiff, upper lip", "getting on with it" and not showing emotion (especially in public) considered old fashioned and outdated or is modern Britain just as likely to have these ideals as post-war Britain.



Also, does "a stiff, upper lip", etc.only apply to conduct  in public or do people act this way in private too (if modern Britain does still acts this way)?

The stiff-upper lip, posh type of accent is no longer prevalent, and is considered an old-fashioned/stuck-up way of speaking. British people are quite unreserved amongst their friends, and outgoing, and can often be quite loud, even in public. However, British people have a manner of being very closed to strangers and people they don't know, and do not show their true feelings or emotions. Speaking to random people in Britian is not considered socially acceptable and people would be quite taken back by such behaviour.



People aren't as reserved as they were before the war, but people are still quite reserved as far as strangers go, I think that's the main distinguishment between reservation towards people.

I would make empathy and compassion the main goal to achieve in society.  It's value would surpass education, weath, travel experience, etc.  in importance and be revered as the greatest asset to possess.

I'd make the distructive tendencies in humans, disappear.  Instead fill the soul with love, kindness and consideration for all mankind.  Now wouldn't that be the perfect world.  Money would no longer be the prime goal, instead helping those in need would take first place.  Now that would be an impossible dream, but if I could that is what it would be.  Happy world would mean, I could be happy as well.  I am selfish if nothing else.

Cute question! I think they are also here to help others. I help out my single girl friend who is raising her son on her own and living off meager means, but she in turn can look for someone more needy than her to help. There are needy people everywhere and the neediness can be measured in many degrees.

What happens in an addictions recovery group that is anonymous when one member admits to cheating on their spouse, without their spouses knowledge? Are they encouraged to tell their spouse or is the spouse notified or what is the procedure on that?



</question>



<additional details>



Well they admit to the group anonymously that they have a problem. As far as I know they don't need to reveal their last names or proessions to the group, or anything about their family.

Don't really have time for them.Now someone who can back up their words with actions, now there is a person to admire.

Was it overreacting, when what he said was humiliating and I felt he was defaming my character.?



While at a friends house with a group of friends. A guy she was hesitant on inviting was there. There was 8-10 of us in her family room watching a movie and talking amongst each other, having cocktails. The guy started saying that I was drunk once and passed out and he did things to me. he repeated it and was getting more graphic.



By the 3rd x, I said "so you are saying that you sexually assaulted me, since I was passed out, that's not consensual. I said "in a room full of people you are admitting to raping me."  He said no and was saying things like "you liked it you were moaning" and he was getting more graphic, and I do mean graphic.



I started to believe it myself, because he was so detailed.  I had to step back and shake my self I said to myself I only seen this guy 2x in my life. The 1st x was here a yr. prior, and the 2nd x at a picnic this summer, and he tried to come on to me and I brushed him off because I remember how beligerant and rude he was the 1st x, I met him.  I began telling him he has me confused with someone else. He denied that, and was continuing with his story, with all eyes on us. The more he talked the more pissed and humiliated I was getting. I got up to a full bucket of ice and through it in his face then through the bucket in his face. He charged after me luckily thee was a couple of guys who handled him. One of the guests, was steaming she started yelling at me for what I did, I said "Oh it was okay for him to assault me while i was unconscious, according to his story, or is it okay for him to defame my character with his lies in a room full of people. When he doesn't even know me. Everyone was saying he deserved, a few others said the never liked him. How would you have reacted



</question>



<additional details>



I thought about the police.That was  where I was going  "your admitting in fornt of all these people that you sexually assaulted me" .  2 of the guest said ''yep I am a witness".  but then when he tried to change it up by saying I was liking it, incited hositlity in me.

You reacted in a way you should have, but i would have kept my cool whilst saying, ok, you are telling all of us that us raped me. It had to be rape if you didn't remember it. And even if you were stoned out of your mind does not make it right. He was getting back at you for brushing him off. And in the same breath after saying he had his way with you, I would be picking up the phone to call the police with all the witnesses there.

nah, it's fairly normal, it depends on what type of mood you're in. At a night out, you often feel loud and feel like taking risks, whereas in the daytime the mood feels more calm and ordinary and we conform to the mood around us. If your friends are bad at night, it makes you feel like you ought to be so you blend in with the surroundings.

OMG all the people who brought up cussing. Is it that big of a deal? Really? Is cussing going to cause the death of somebody? Is it going to do anything else but hurt your feelings, Is not cussing going to do anything else but propagate the need to shelter your children so much that when they do hear it they will use it and have no idea it is wrong.



There is nothing wrong with Cussing they are just words. Words that can show frustration or add emphasis on other words. So use them Proudly. It not going to hurt anyone. Other than your fragile minds.

you don't have confidence. I don't want to be mean, but it's true. First of all, don't cuss with so many young teens on this website. I know you think I'm cruel right now, but I'm being honest. I'm sorry. Look at the little things in life. I don't know what you don't care about but find a meaning or reason for life. Make a list of what you enjoy and make that your goal. Maybe you have or want kids. Make a goal to be a good influence and good person out of them and yourself.

You're in a routine and now that you've been lazy for a while, it's getting more and more difficult to get out. Try to exercise or do something similar. You will feel great afterwards and is the first step to overcoming your llaziness.

Seems like you have some issues....like no motivation.  If you're at your parents house, then I'm surprised that they don't push you into cleaning up and maintaining decentcy.  Of course, staying up the whole night does'nt help neither.  If you feel insistent on staying up the whole night, then maybe you can get some things done during this time.

you're probably feeling run-down and not getting enough fresh air/ exercise. Your sleeping pattern seems all over the place. Make sure you don't drink coffee or watch TV before you go to bed, and try not to eat a big meal straight before you go to sleep as it needs time to digest and could prevent you from sleeping. Set your alarm earlier in the morning, so you can take more time getting up and no matter how you feel, take a quick shower in the morning- as this can help you feel more alert and awake, and makes you feel better.
In the daytime, try to do some form of exercise outside, even if its just walking to school/work. This will make you feel more naturally tired for bed. But when you get home, try hard not to fall asleep until its your bedtime and soon your sleeping patteren will get back in sync.
If none of this works, try going to the doctors to check you're not anemaic.
Sorry for the long answer and I hope this helps :)

It is lack of motivation. I suggest you to break that routine for once. Have a shower...a cold shower. I don't mean to be mean or anything. But it is just to wake you up a little. You'll feel energized in no time. Try it you'll feel better.

Not at all.



It is the Chinese Buddha that is fat, and my understanding is that this is the Buddha already taken up.



Fat is simply a symbol for full, for satisfied, healthy, sated, wealthy, etc....



Siddhartha was not fat.



Buddhist monks in China are not fat, just like thay are not fat anywhere else.



I think the larger message is, if you live the austere life and follow Siddhartha's example, you will find enlightenment and be satisfied.



That satisfaction is depicted on the Chinese Buddha as a belly.



My Buddha statue is marble, 19th century, Burmese.



He is beautiful and not fat.



But the smile on his face is one of contentment, enlightenment.



It is merely a difference in the way different cultures depict the satisfaction achieved through Buddhism's spiritual pursuit.

Lord Buddha was not that fatty. He possessed self control power but not in all areas. He could not control his bodily nervous system. There is a story. Once Lord Buddha was travelling with his deciple Ananda.
Suddenly he stopped walking. Ananda asked, Prabhu "what happened"? He replied " Ananda, one fly sat on my forehead and suddenly my hand went on my forehead to remove the fly".Ananda said, this is common to every one. This happens automatically. He said, no Ananda. This happened to a man like me. After leading a long life in the area of meditation when everything is in my control, my hand went up to my forehead without my permission: This is something to be thought of. Then what about the normal common people. We will have to be more cautious. Thereafter, it is learnt that Lord Buddha did lot more Tapasya on this and explained many things on the subject.

The tru Budah was not Fat "He was Asiatic Blackman, that came from rebelllous of the people , because He guide people to right path to Elightment One the "Supreme Being". Buddhism is 35,000 years old. However, Buddha was born in 500 B.C. This makes Buddhism only 2,500 . According to the definition of Buddhism in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd edition, published by the Houghton Mifflin Company in Boston, New York, Buddhism is "the doctrine attributed to Buddah..."



The doctrine ( the principle or body of principles presented for acceptance or belief) of Buddhism existed long before the birth of Siddhartha Gautama (Buddah).



The word 'Buddha' is a title and not a name. It means 'one who is awake' in the sense of having 'woken up to reality'. This title was first given to a man called Siddharta Gautama, who lived 2,500 years ago in northern India.

Will you save an animals life today?



Halloween is a day of happiness for children, but a time of horror for animals.
Many people do horrible things to animals (such as torcher and "sacrifice") on Halloween.



But there is a way to stop it.



All you have to do is report any suspicious behavior to the police, ASPCA, or Humane Society regarding animals.



IT COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE.



My question is, will you be a hero today?

Overpopulation? They take black cats from anywhere they can find them - including people's homes (A.K.A. PETS.)



Funny how an Asian is talking about overpopulation.



I'm looking at the facts:



Population of Asia: 3,902,404,193



Population of pets in America: Less than 69,000,000



You do the math.



The issue isn't about overpopulation, it is about ANIMAL TORCHER.



If you aren't smart enough to see that, that is YOUR problem - not mine.



I hardly think the Humane Society would think torchering animals is a good way of making the population smaller.

Your a great person!! Keep it up. Try to educate them.. people who are racist are usually ignorant and suffering from inferiority complex and like the great MLK said, "Don't hate it's too big a burden to bear" the best you can do is show them the light. If they do not there is nothing you can do you have to agree to disagree. Although they are ur family and you can never get rid of them you do not have to accept their bigotry. Good luck to you and unless you want be to associated with those views i wouldnt "show them off"You might end up with less friends and not grow as a person.

Do you think that hippies back in the 60s before Roe v. Wade were pro-life?



I only ask this because it seems to be more in line with the anti-war and "love" aspects of the hippie movement.  I could always imagine Jimi Hendrix or someone saying "let's save all those unborn children out there, let's support life and love baby" in some kind of drug induced rant at woodstock

lol good question.  i think so.  but not the radicals or feminists-i think they'd be pro-choice.  a lot of women died during that time period trying to abort because they could nt get it done in a hospital.  it was done at home, in alleys, in secret by doctors.

i am from the 60's and the ones who got abortions had to risk alot. no real dr. would do one. and back then i'm not sure any one thought of the unborn as a human. it was all alot of selfishness.  it was a relief when they made abortions legal. a woman's going to do what she's going to do. legal or not. i can't picture any one at woodstock caring about saving the unborn. look what they were doing in front of the kids they had .  the love of the hippies was just different.

um, no. Since there was no legal abortions and many of the girls that did risk them died it wasn't like that. I saw Jimi Hedrix once and he was so messed up he could barely perform so I don't think he was spending a lot of time thinking about the unborn

Anyone else a young adult, but stilll called a kid, get disrespected, and not taken seriously?



I'm 22. I went out to eat yesterday and 4 different people thought I was a kid. I was asked if I wanted a kid cup and a kid menu. Then someone came over and did that annoying voice people do for kids: "OH LOOK AT YOU HONEY, THAT BOWL OF SOUP IS BIGGER THAN YOU, AWW!".



I was so angry, I wanted to scream at them, but I assume they didn't mean to hurt my feelings. I also get told things I can't do because my parents aren't there, and ignored in stores because they think I'm just a kid. Anyone else get disrespected like this?



Also, I haven't been able to get a job. I know unemployment is high, but do you think it's harder to get taken seriously when people don't believe you're over 13? Do you have to be tougher on job interviews? In general, do you have to try extra hard to prove yourself? (I am a college graduate.)

Not really to get a rise out of posters, but to check something out. I asked who was going to watch Larry King and his special guest last night. I got some Republicans answering that they wouldn't watch that show basically because it and everybody on it supported the leftist view. Larry King's guest was John McCain. Strange the answers stopped after one poster acknowledged McCain was to be King's guest.

Do you think former slave owners should be considered heros?



Robert E. inhereted slaves from his father which he was supposed to set free but decided to keep them to work on a plantation, he also abused them and said they where better off in American(where they were slaves) instead of their home country. Some states celebrate his day on the same days as MLK. Do u find this to be disrespectful and do u consider this man to be a hero? if so what are ur justifications.

I don't think anyone who keeps another person as a slave should be considered a hero.  I find it vary disrespectful for anyone to own another person.  I think it is a shame our country at one time allowed slavery.

I have never considered him a hero.  That may have something to do with my being born and raised in the north.  I don't know much about the history of it, but if celebrating his day is a direct response to MLK day, then I do think that is disrespectful.  The two are incomparable.

I get Racist comments all of the time, so I don't really happen to rate them.



I'm sure that sashed away inside of me was one truly racist thing.



This boy at my school said he could "Blindfold me with his shoelace".
Just Yesterday a post-pregnant student asked me if I were an Asian, and I told her that I wasn't, then she asked me if I were Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese, Indonesian, Malaysian or Filippino, and I replied no, she then told me to return to my own country. I told her Australia was my home since I was born here, and she laughed and yelled Hysterically at me. She has stretch marks on her knees.



And another boy in Year 12 called me an In-bred Asian, and he's actually an in-bred.

lol! you sounded just like me after my first week at a boarding school. you're just having culture shock. calm down. you'll get used to it. how long have you been there? you really want to give up? I ended up LOVING boarding school, even though I HATED it during the first few months. really, you'll come to love it, after you got over your shock and fit in. unless the teachers and students there torture you, and I assume that isn't your case.

<answer>



I agree with this to some extent.



I live in the UK and some of the sentences handed out for serious crimes such as rape, murder and armed robbery are very lenient to say the least. For these sorts of crimes it is my belief that they should be locked up for life (and life meaning life) unless by some miracle they manage to change their ways, which in most cases doesn't happen.



However for more petty crimes such as shoplifting I don't think a prison sentence should be handed out in many of these cases because most people will commit petty crimes because of social reasons like poverty. If the social reason was addressed then the person wouldn't feel the need to commit the crime, like stealing some food so that they can feed their children. I do think though that they should be punished, perhaps fined or given some community service but is putting a desperate parent or a debt ridden individual in prison really the answer to solving crime? I don't think so because if the offender has children, the child could end up in care if there are no other family members to look after them or the person with the debt will still come out of prison with the debt so are likely to re-offend. I know this is not the case for all petty offenders, but many are desperate and feel there is no other way to try and escape their problems.



Those who commit serious crimes on the other hand often have a psychological issue, which often stems from childhood. Perhaps they suffered abuse when they were younger and commit crime to get revenge for what happened to them.



Another thing is that children in care (so if the authorities put a child of a petty criminal in prison) are more likely to become criminals. So we should be trying to keep the petty offenders with their children if possible. If we separate them then we are risking breeding more serious offenders.



Another thing is what is a crime? What may be a crime in one country may be perfectly acceptable in another country, just like punishments for crimes vary between countries. A good example would be about 3 years ago it was perfectly acceptable to smoke in a pub (uk) but now you are labeled a criminal if you do. Crimes are just laws that over the years have been thought of by whoever was the govt of that time and have then been implemented.



So my answer to your question is..... prison for serious offenders and rehabilitation/ addressing the issues of petty offenders

In September 2007, the world's population is believed to have reached over 6.6 billion.



In line with population projections, this figure continues to grow at rates that were unprecedented before the 20th century, although the rate of increase has almost halved since its peak, which was reached in 1963, of 2.2 percent per year. The world's population is expected to reach over 9 billion by the year 2050.-

I think that, if you're looking for people who fit stereotypes, they're easy to find. People who think blonds are dumb only notice the dumb blonds. It is the same with black people. If you think they are all undereducated thieves, then you won't remember the ones you meet who are intelligent and prosperous. But when you see a black person who happens to be on welfare and have a low IQ, you'll say to yourself, "See? I they really are like that!"

Do you believe education is important?



I'm a freshman in college and I absolutely hate that no one truly cares for education. Many of the students I'm around with have their college education, room/board paid off by their parents and they don't take advantage of it. They emphasize too much on their physical nature, partying, and socializing. What's also funny is that half of the people in my dorm floor are gone! as in they either dropped out of college or got in trouble with the law.



I'm really not trying to be offensive to those who don't take their education seriously, but they have the opportunity to learn, when many others do not.



I just want to know your opinions if possible

This is common during freshman year. These people will be almost entirely weeded out by next year, and you'll start to find more like-minded people. As your education progresses, you will notice a bigger gap between yourself and those who never went to college. (Not that you will be superior, but you will have less to talk about with them, and they will understand less of where you are coming from and what you feel is important.)

Education is very important but not because you learn geography and history etc. Its the disciplines it teaches and the socializing (and I'm not talking about the Saturday night drinking sessions, I'm meaning the fact that when a young child goes to school they learn how to behave around other people, how to communicate and compromise with others and how to share) It also gets people into a routine (which for young children is very important)



However things you learn in classes such as history and geography are not so important unless you want to be a history/geography teacher or a historian. Apart from that they won't help you learn how to get a job or about things that happen in adult life like debt, budgeting, buying your own house.



So while its important. It doesn't teach you every single thing you need to know in life. When you leave school, college, uni you'll still be learning a lot more. Because not everything is academic

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I did, when I sold my share in a software company to my partners and "retired" (at 35).



At first it was great - no mortgage or bills to worry about, a quiet life in the country with no commute, and I could act out my fantasy of being a writer for a couple of years and treat myself to a few things I'd always wanted - a sports car, a telescope, an expensive camera, a road-trip holiday through the USA.



But I got depressed (not badly enough to need medical treatment, but enough to stop me enjoying much of life). I got scared, obsessed with "protecting" the rest of the money - and as a result living more cheaply and less well than I had when I was working. I missed the buzz of work and the company of my colleagues.



I'm now back at work, still with no mortgage and no real money worries but with a family who help me spend any cash that's left :-), and in many ways it's almost as if I'd never had the money. I'm in a less-pressured job, but there's enough activity to still get that buzz, and it's great to be amongst people again. So be careful what you wish for!

Not a salary, really . . . a lottery win!



Every year, plus perks!

I would firstly put a five figure sum into a secure savings fund for my son's education.



After that I would spend about half the remainder on buying and renovating a property for resale.  This would form the cautious basis of a development business.



The other half would be banked, and I would allow myself a stipend each month from the amount to live on.  If I was working still, this stipend would be a cursory amount, maybe to cover any days I didn't earn, because I was working on the property renovation.



I would also ensure that a percentage of any income from the banked sum or the property development was reinvested into a charitable trust, to be used towards any number of good causes.



And no doubt I'd be tempted to replace my car as she is rather elderly.  But that would take a sizeable chunk from the whole, so that might have to wait.

An interesting proposition.  After deleting the rubbish I was left with 4 answers:- Andy T; Weregunn; Airies6qu and Tori Bell.  They all had merit.  However, the nature of your question is simply that instead of receiving your pay month by month YOU are going to receive it in one lump sum at the outset, after that you are a prisoner to the 'Payer'.
Based on this, you obviously have ti invest your money in such a way that you have an income for the next ten years.
The nearest answer already given which is the most sensible is that of Tori Bell.



However, she overlooked one important detail; you can't invest the lot at the outset because you'll have nothing left to live on.



So the amended solution is that if the economy is stagnating you will have operate progressively.



Keep 10% of the cash fluid;



invest in short term fixed bonds high interest rates say 30%;



10% blue chip stock with good yield relative to depressed market and the remaining 50% in smaller housing 'plots' - this is a loose expression because they can be either new or modern pre lived in.  Being smaller we mean those properties which will appeal to the majority, which in turn means ok for 2/3 persons to live in and in areas where the employment is viable.
Finally, you cannot sit back; you have to be continually reviewing and taking stock to alter investment strategy as you go along.
There is something to be said for a steady safe reliable job connected to Teaching, Local Government or Politics.
No Holidays, No fine clothes, No opposite sex encounters.

I'd build a time machine, probably. I know it took Doc Brown thirty years, but he didn't really have a proper job so I figure I could use the lump sum I'd just been given (plus the income from another job that I'd go and get) to build one much faster.



And I'd also build it out of a Bond Bug.



Then I'd go back in time and win back all the money I'd spent so I was back where I started, with a time machine to boot. And I'd spend that money on jam, because everyone likes jam.



Alternatively, I'd just buy a couple of tanks of petrol.

Ten years salary in a lump sum would not amount to very much for me.  If your question means that i would then be out of a job, I doubt if I would get another one due to my age therefore I would have to use the amount for day to day living expenses and hopefully get another couple of years out of it by properly investing it for annual income and reducing the capital by living off the lump sum.



If however I received the amount in a lump sum and carried on working, I would pay off my mortgage, have a good holiday, help family members and invest the rest.  By carrying on working, I could therefore retire in about 3 years ( 6 years early) and live off my investment, and with pension at 65, hopefully after having got rid of this government!!

i'm a student so don't get a real salary,but if i had a good job and had all my salary in 1 lump sum i would most prob give some towards charity then use the rest for living a basic life with no debt truble!



but then again i wouldn't get money for the next 10 years so in that case i would put it all in the bank (interest!!!)
and what i gain in that 10 years, give to a charity that supports familys who have lost a child.



i can become very sensable when i need to! x

Ten years salary invested at 5% pa would bring in half a years salary, so it would not be that easy to rely on it forever as inflation would reduce the real income over time.



I would use it to reduce debt if I had any or purchase a nicer house or flat.



The remainder I would use to buy a nice car clothes etc and leave some of this invested to provide a safeguard for  future expenditure.



Sounds boring but I think this would result in a happier and more secure future.



Of course I would need to continue in work, but the added security might allow me to improve my job position by letting me take relevant work related courses

Well ten years Salary for me would be enough to invest sensibly and the interest on that sum would mean I could afford to work part-time and be comfortable. With my free time I could get involved in doing something useful in the community, and possibly study for a degree in law, which i want to do but never had the time or money. I would also spend more time with my children who live with my ex, and I can only afford to see them once a week.

If I had to make it last over ten years, then nothing much would change (if of course I had a salary- being a student, I don't).



If I did have a salary, and did receive ten year's worth in a lump sum, I'd probably spend about a third on myself, a third on my family (including helping my mum go private for knee surgery- the NHS is so rubbish and takes absolutely forever thanks to privatisation), a fifth on my friends and give the rest to charity.

Invest it in higher order or the sum will dissipate rapidly.  As a traderand long term investor I can assure you this the case.



The amount of money you earn or receive is irrelevant in terms of becoming financially in dependant as proven by a recent lottery winner who is now 300k in debt.



What is important is 'saving' which attracts money from nowhere to pay the bills.  When you take a leap of faith and save financial miracles happen.



You value, nuture and look after money and money look after you.



I was diagnosed with a meningioma which prevented me from holding down a 'job' yet still I have persisted with my savings plan and it is beginning to flourish.



Dr John Demartini's book "How to make one hell of a profit and still get to heaven" is probably one of the best financial resources for anyone wishing to build wealth and become financially independent.

Hi
Now this is a tricky one, lol.
I don't wish to offend anyone but I also am very ill and have been waiting for hip replacement and have been since I was 27 yrs old! Ten years later and  I cannot walk due to my spine being so bad but has anyone thought about others also?
Lets not forget the poor little children who suffer from severe, chronic pain due to being ill also!
Please forgive, if I have offended anyone as I would never wish to do that xx



Serioulsy, apart from taking a holiday back to Hawaii, with my hubby and kids due to my being serioulsy ill, I would try to invest the rest as much as possiable.



Of course it would never be the same as winng Billions on the lottery, i should be so lucky, lol....my aim would be to try to gain enough savings to help those that are genuinly living rough!



It has always been a dream of mine to buy large wearhouses in all the large cities centres to enable a safe place for these poor people to go.
Of course there would also be support/rehabilitation for drug users etc. and also a seperate safe place for the young kids, some as young as 13!



I would love to be able to help so many, even if it is just somewhere they could go for avice and help with many different issues.



So many are ignorent and believe that these poor people deserve everything they get but I wonder?



Would they still be saying that is they had to run way due to abuse and no-one would help, if they maybe lost everything due to losing their jobs etc.. sorry, but I could go on forever with this so I will try not to but what I will say, too many in society are ready to judge others and so many of these people do try so hard to get their lives back on track and some actualy succsed!



If only people realised that not everyone has a good life and some of these people (yes good luck to them, if they are self made millionares) are very quick to forget their roots!
Lets not forget that some of these poor people actualy turn to drink or drugs because they feel they have nothing to live for!



Of course, im not saying this is right but it is a fact and who are we to judge? we are not them!
Some are mentily ill, just put there, due to the so called care in the community that did not work! So much to say and such a wide topic that we could be here all night, lol.
Take care and good luck with your new film .
Love  Sandy xx

I think it would be good to pay off our mortgage, and maybe put some money towards another house, nearer to my son's school, that would be a good idea.  Then my hubby would probably buy himself a taxi, so he could work for himself, we would use some money for doing up our new house, then probably just put the rest in the savings account.

If I were to receive ten (10) years salary as a lump-sum, I would invest it all with Post Office Income Bonds.  The sum invested would be in the region of £400,000 - £500,000.  The return would be about 5%+ a year.  Not a massive income, but a person might be able to live on it provided there were no mortgage or rent to pay.



Five percent of £400,000 = an annual income of £20,000.  The UK tax on an income from savings of £20,000 = £4,000 - which leave an income of £16,000 after all income tax has been paid.



I could live with that.



Please note the above income figs are fictional and do not relate to my real income.  They are based upon a persion with an income of between £40,000 to £50,000 p.a.

Could I have ten years of your salary rather than mine? Pay off my debts, buy a small house somewhere in Africa on the beach and donate the rest to providing some kind of rehabilitation programme to former child soldiers in africa. Studying Psychology now so I can get involved with this on a personal pro-active level.
Why? Because although there are many charities out there and many deserving our help, I feel these 'children' who have their childhoods stolen from them are largely derided or forgotten . Somebody needs to help them, their families and their victims.

Of course I'd have to pay off a few bills but I'd spend a ton of trying to make sure the Democratic Party conducts its future nominating process in a truly "Democratic" way.



Super delegates may well decide the 2008 Presidential race.  They are not obligated to support the candidate chosen by voters.



From what I have read each super delegate vote is equivalent to about 10,000 democratic votes.  Does the one really represent the 10,000?  Is this really a democratic process?



But, then again, I may just decide to use this money on making a great flick.  I'd hire someone like Steve Lewis and Tony Owens to write a great screenplay and Jonathan Gershfeild to direct it and turn my ten years' salary turn into a fortune!  I could always use the profits to pursue the above.  What do you think?

first of all, money is nothing to me, i see it as a constant flow, like water being passed around the world pointlessly, its just you need it to be comfortable in life, but not more than you need.



ok lets say a years salary is 18k x 10, thats £180,000. first id pay off some of my parents mortgage, lets say £40,000. because they have done so much for me, and do nothing but work, they deserve it.



i'd give £5-10,000 to good causes or charity,  lets say £8,000



that leaves £132,000.



£4000 for a massive party for all my family and friends, maybe on an island somewhere



that leaves £128,000



£18,000 to tour the world for 5-10 years and give to those who need help



that leaves £110,000



which i would use to migrate from the uk to New zealand and australia where i would invest in some land on a beach with some good surf, build a bar/surf shop and apartment, shape boards and live there for the rest of my life, later on building a house for my family to move into aswell.

I would buy myself a newer car, as mine is starting to go in expensive places, and being disabled, I need my car big time, to not have to worry about it would be great.  I would also get a power chair, although not confined to a wheelchair, there are times I do need one, it would mean I could start doing things with my daughter again, like museums, parks, days out, that kind of thing.  I would spend a small amount doing bits of the flat up, but minimally, I enjoy finding a bargain but I need to be able to keep the place clutter free and clean.  Beyond that, I would stuff the rest in a high interest account and try and add to it, being unable to work (I know, how could I qualify for ten years' salary, but its hypothetical...) means that I never have money for emergencies, as soon as I save some (a challenge on benefits, but it is possible) something comes alone, like the car breaking down and its all gone.  I would be able to support the couple of local charities I occasionally support a bit more and just relax and have money to do nice things with my daughter.  Like a coupld of days away in the Cotswolds with our beautiful dog, a power chair and miles to walk/roll through together.  I would try and save a lot of it though.  Nice thought.

Hmm...good one. In a way I perhaps shouldn't be answering this as I'm an impoverished student and consequently not earning a salary. However, before that I was an impoverished accounts clerk. Considering that when I was working I was less likely to be paid off with that kind of money than I am to win the lottery this week, I shall proceed on the basis that we're dealing with the realms of fantasy here. So what would I do with the money?



1)Give some to my parents and grandparents as I love them so much and they've been good to me over the years. Very corny I know, but that's how I feel. Also if I could I would bankroll my struggling swordfighting and jiu-jitsu clubs. The people I met there are my best friends and it would mean a lot to me to be able to make sure both clubs were able to keep running, and maybe afford some new equipment too.



2) I'm a total geek who's in love with all things ancient/medieval, so I'd buy myself a few new swords and a nice shiny suit of plate armour.



3) Get a decent guitar? Maybe I'd finally get some motivation up to learn if I had a good one. I'd have to get a massive amp as well. I mean, so big that it shatters the windows whenever I strum a chord. That'll teach the neighbours' kids to practice the trumpet whenever I'm trying to sleep, watch a film or study!



4) Then I suppose I'd have to be uber-sensible and try to invest the rest in something to try and get a return on it. Shares in Northern Rock perhaps? Hmm...Maybe not. I know, I'll ask my old boss, he's an accountant, so should be clued up on that type of thing. Oh wait, hang on. He's the one who's just paid me off. That means that I haven't been injured or traumatised or anything. If this was the case he'd still find a way of keeping me working whilst not paying me anything. He must have bought my silence somehow. Maybe I caught him cooking the books on my way out one night. Either way, he's not going to want to give me any free financial advice.



But, having said all that, even 10 years salary wouldn't have amounted to much in my case, so the plate armour is probably a no-no. And the guitar (Especially the concert amp that was to go with it). Never mind, huh?

and personally (and i reiterate the word 'personally' here, since i know some people who will read this may not be very spiritual), but for me, a person who has good values in their lives is someone who sees God in every person, everyday.  because if i can see God in you, then i will celebrate you.  but i guess in the general scheme of things, as long as you try and remain a positive presence in the lives of the people around you, then thats what it means to be considered someone who has good values in life.

What does the (US) expression "my bad" mean?



I've heard this is in a few US-made programmes now, primarily sitcoms - can anyone tell me what it means? I've got an idea just want it clarified.

There is no Orion Planet. Orion is a star.
The Masonic connections are numerous, but the Orion connection is primarily Egyptian, not Masonic. There may be some confusion as many Masonic rituals are based upon the construction of Solomans temple, and the Master Mason Hiram Abiff was Egyptian.
The Ancient Egyptians believed that the departing soul travelled to Orion, and the alignment of the pyramids is in accordance with this belief.

<question>



Why is it that Salma Hayek, Penelope Cruz, and Shakira are all considered Latinas when they are caucasian?



Penelope Cruz = 100% Spaniard
Salma Hayek = 1/2 Lebanese, 1/2 Spaniard, born in Mexico
Shakira = 1/2 Lebanese, 1/2 Spaniard/Italian, born in Colombia



All of these women are frequently described as "Latina", but racially speaking, I would say that it would be more accurate to refer to them as Caucasians of Mediterranean origin.  When I think "Latina" I think Mestiza (mixed Native Indian/European) or Native Indian.  Penelope Cruz has NO Indian blood, and Shakira and Salma Hayek probably have very little if any Indian blood and are most likely 100% Caucasian.



Why, then, are they so frequently offered as examples of "Latinas" when, in reality they are Mediterranean Caucasians?

'Latino' or 'Latina' is not a race. Its more of a nationality. Most of the people who say they are not white but they are 'Latino' are probably wiggers without a racial identity.



People want to mistake any spaniard or latin american person as a non white 'latino' or 'latina' to try and elevate people of indigenous south american descent and deceive their race into thinking that those caucasian women that you mentioned are of their racial group, when in reality they are not and the native people who think that are in denial.

People don't like to "think" too much. They take what appears to be the obvious conclusion to someone's appearance and go with it, no questions asked. I've been told by many people that I am Filipino or German. My father is German and my mother is half Filipino half Caucasian. They take whatever appeals to them and then they tell me what I am. I was under the impression that I was American, but I guess not.

Freedom is your ability to take action based on something you believe in, even if other people tell you that you can't or shouldn't.  This includes something as simple as staying out an hour past curfew, or as risky as defying Hitler during the war.  Of course, the greater the act of freedom the more you stand to lose that freedom.

I like the freedom to not be a victim of criminals!



But on the other hand if you have served your sentance then yes you should be freed and have the chance to run your hand through the sand. Could you please try to educate other criminals you are with in jail not to commit crime please.

(I'm a female as you see...)
She's our choreographer. Once she looked at my eyes, it was kind of strange. She sometimes catch my hand when we all dance and she settle her wrist, I can hardly explain this, but I feel like she discreetly caress mine. Yesterday I couldn't understand the dance and I asked her for help. While we were dancing, she pulled my hand and it touched her breast. I don't know if I'm wrong and I fancy this or it's true. Help me to find out.

I have been to other countries where it is acceptable to smoke and they drink in the day and evening!! Maybe they don't binge drink like we do. But my boyfriend smokes and I worry so much for his health and always will. When we have been away on holiday everybody seems to be smoking so i just wondered what you all thought really!!!!!

I feel a bit sorry for Russell Brand - what a witch-hunt! Why should The Sun/Mirror force someone from a job?



Ok, what he said was wrong, but if it was that bad it shouldn't have been broadcast.  He apologised.  That should have been it really.  If they'd left the same message on someone like Piers Morgan's answerphone no-one would have cared a less.  I agree Andrew Sachs deserved to be treated with more respect but this is all going way too far!  The Sun and Mirror make a living out of saying far worse about people and sprawling it all over their front pages for all the world to see...I'm sure the families of their victims are none to happy either - but no-one gets fired...

What they did was completely out of order and I hope the other guy has to go as well. They should have known what would have happened so why do it.  I am sorry but you are wrong he did the right thing in resigning, with the amount that both of them are earning they should be careful.  Have you actually read what they said.

We seem to get everything from sociopaths to Nazis to masochistic cannibals on here. They don't call themselves that but it's pretty clear they are f***ed up.



Do you think these people are putting on a ruse or is humanity really going down the s***er?



There was this one guy talking about killing the handicapped, the mentally disabled, the religious and justifying child molestation. Really scary freak.

The scary thing is that the said scary freak wrote with excellent prose and actually started to make a lot of sense for a few seconds. I think he might be the real thing (i.e real f***ing psycho).

The internet, for all it's greatness, tends to attract fringe minorities like these people you see on here a lot. The net is seen as a "safe" place to express wacked-out or offensive opinions and beliefs. There are also a ton of 13-year-old kids on here, so...Also, don't forget that people love to troll.

I'd bet money that most of the "feather rufflers"  are somewhere between the ages of 13 and 16 years old. They're bored, don't want to do their homework, and are out ruffling feathers just for the sake of ruffling feathers.

<question>



Why do western straight men are so scared of physical/ emotional intimacy with other men?



... when for straight men in the rest of the world it is an integral part of manhood/ masculinity?



Examples:



http://flickr.com/photos/antoniotardio/2...



http://flickr.com/photos/cchrissy55/2629...

http://flickr.com/photos/sakena/82181508...



</question>



<additional details>



ok, so because a lot of the 'supposedly' straight western men think its 'gay', then should we say that men in the other parts of the world are all 'gay'?



If this is so, either being 'gay' is the natural way to be, or modern western men are biologically different from men in the traditional world, including pre-modern west?



Could it be that it is queer not to be intimate with men, than to be intimate with them? I mean in India, men who were afraid to be intimate with men, but would rather be intimate with women were not so long ago thought to be queer, transgendered or unmanly.



Could the western society be putting unnecessary pressures on straight men in order to break them from other men and make them queer?



Which one do you think is part of natural manhood and why?



How likely is it that all those men who answered that this is 'gay' or 'unacceptable' are those who  have a strong sexuality for men which they are afraid will spill out or be detected when they are being intimate with men?

It's too ingrained in our society now and men being that friendly with other men is seen as a sign of weakness, or homosexuality.  I find it really sad.  I think it shows a lack of self understanding and confidence. It just isn't done.  Even gay couples rarely hold hands.  I have quite a few Asian friends and you feel closer and more comfortable as friends when physical contact is natural and non-assuming - as with brothers and sisters.  I guess we're just brought up to believe that everything revolves around sex.  Your question might actually be the answer as to why Western society is so cold and dysfunctional in so many ways!

See how everyone who has answered proves ur point exactly?



I don't know really. I mean homosexuality is supposedly accepted in society, but there is still this massive stigma in it all. I suppose it's become an insult - you're a f*g, that's so gay - and guys these days protect their masculinity with an iron fence, and if anyone even almost challenges it, it completely freaks people out.



I don't see the problem with it, personally. I mean girls do it, so why shouldn't we?



PLUS men have a much larger sex drive than women... and physical contact is considered sexual... put the two together.

Being a cheapskate could get you in trouble with the law. Fulton County authorities arrested 40-year-old Dan Linscomb of Texas City, Texas, last week for refusing to pay his tab at the all-you-can-eat Iron Skillet buffet in northwest Atlanta. Officials say Linscomb ate at the buffet and let his girlfriend eat from his plate.

I agree with the part about he being arrested. When you go into a restaurant, and you know it is buffet, and you know that is per person, it is wrong to share...it is wrong to think you can get by with it..These restaurants has costs of their own, and they can' feed the public for free. Mr. Linscomb will wind up paying more than he would have if he had just paid for his girlfriends meal. I am speaking for experience. I work in a popular restaurant, and I deal with this everyday, someone trying to steal a meal, but ...they don't know, once they are caught, they either pay or they get arrested...

It has not affected me yet.



I am having new floors installed in my home (which is a big ticket item) so apparently I dont think I need to sock away all my money under the mattress yet.



My wife and I still spend entirely too much money going out to nice restaurants and having our mid-week trip to the wine bar to relax.



At work, I HAVE seen a decline in my company's work load, and a few of our clients have had to lay-off people and cut back on work they send us.



So far, I think anything that has been done in the business world is just a reaction of what they THINK will come. We shall see if it really ever gets as bad as some people think.

Thanks, a bit of optimism among the doom and gloom is not a bad idea at the moment.

Effects of Racism



Racism affects people in many ways. Some people take it really seriously when someone tells them that their skin colour looks ugly or the clothes they wear are different to what you wear. Propobly if it happens once, the victim wont take it deeply, but if it continues everyday, the victim will feel really sad, alone and different to others.



Imagine going to a school where everybody dislikes you because of your skin colour or your religion. Racism can lead to hating school and very low self-esteem. Every time victims of racism wake up, they don't want to go to school (or the place where they may see the racist person) and every time they go to school they have a sad face and think "How are the people going to tease me today?"



In the past racism was more common than in these days. Before, people didn't realise what were they doing to people when teasing them (even as a joke). Now, people are not so racist but still a lot of people don't even know what racism is and what it can lead to.



Here are some things that victims can do because they have been the subject of racism:



- skip school lessons
- have problems with learning and education
- change their hair colour
- hate their own religion
- not make any friends
- be scared all the time
- have trouble trusting people



Violence Aside, Racism May Be Harmful to Our Health
In 1990 a 15-year-old African-American male in Harlem had a 37 percent chance of surviving to age 65. The shorter life expectancy of this black child compared with his poor white neighbor on the Lower East Side--who had a 70 percent chance of survival to the same age--has traditionally been blamed on genetics and the effects of poverty.



But what if there were another player in the game? A character that stalks the health of African Americans no matter where they live, what their income or education levels are, or how many drinks or cigarettes they have. A character that wears many masks, including that of poverty. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health believe that such a beast exists. Its name is racism.



Nancy Krieger, Camara Jones, and Lisa Berkman research the detrimental health effects of the many forms of racism.



Camara Jones, assistant professor in the Department of Health and Social Behavior and in Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, is a staunch believer that racism is bad for your health. But how can something that starts as an abstract attitude affect one's biology? To explain the connection, Jones uses allegories (see sidebar p. 8) to describe three levels of racism and how each is detrimental to health.



The most visible type of racism, encompassing prejudice and discrimination, is personally mediated racism, Jones says. The black man being beaten for the color of his skin is a victim of this kind of racism, and the effect on his health is easy to see.



When people who have been subjected to racial prejudice and discrimination begin to doubt their own worth and ability, Jones says, they become victims of internalized racism. "The stigmatized people become hopeless and helpless, and those things can impact on health."



Institutionalized racism, characterized by restricted access to well-paying jobs, safe housing, and high-quality health care, is the third classification, and potentially the most profound. "It's because of institutionalized racism that there is an association between social class and race in this country," says Jones.



It is too early to say how much of African Americans' poor health is attributable to institutionalized racism and how much is induced by prejudice and discrimination, but Lisa Berkman, chair of health and social behavior, believes that scientists are now at the brink of being able to look at this empirically.

Levels of Racism: A Gardener's Tale
The following allegory is used by Camara Jones in her class "Race and Racism."



A gardener has two kinds of seed, red and pink, and two flower boxes. One contains rich soil and one has poor, rocky soil. The gardener favors red flowers over pink, so she plants the red seed in the rich soil and the pink seed in the poor soil. Year after year, the rains water, the sun shines, and the gardener harvests the flowers. But she never changes the soil.



The red flowers flourish in the rich soil. But the pink flowers languish--the strongest make it to middling height, the weakest die. The gardener notices the difference, but soon forgets her original decision to put poor soil in one flower box and rich soil in the other. "It's really good that I liked red flowers because they're much prettier," she thinks.



The analogy to institutionalized racism arises from the flowers being contained in separate boxes, and it is perpetuated by the gardener failing to fertilize or mix the soil. An example of personally mediated racism would be if she purpos

I've seen that happen.  I've also see white men who don't like white women dating black men.



I think it's more a male territorial thing than racial.
