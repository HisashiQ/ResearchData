My brother in law is a complete snob!?



He lives in a different country to us with his wife and their daughter.  He has a high paid job and thinks he is above everyone else.  He once offered his brother in law some wine and not me and my husband, saying that we wouldn't appreciate it.

He also wouldn't hold our son when he was born and neither would his wife.  We went to stay with them a couple of years ago and they were both rude to me and my husband and made us feel so unwelcome that i wanted to leave.  His wife held back with my husband because it's her husbands brother, but with me she was short and nasty.

I'm not a nasty person, i'm friendly and get on with most people. I ffered to help her with dinner and helped wash and wipe up when we stayed with them and i'm never brash or rude back.  So i can't see why they dislike us, especially me so much.

I've tried hard with them, i even emailed them regularly for a while, but they've barely replied.  it's not the sort of thing you can ask them about because the things they do and say are so subtle.  My husband has noticed this too.



My brother in law is the mother of all snobs, he even ignored his parents for a while because he was ashamed of where he grew up.  This man is not my cup of tea and to be honest i get on with most people but they just don't seem to want to know.  Then on the other hand they will send my son a birthday and christmas gift, yet they don't ever ask about him or how he is.

Do i ignore them completely.  I'd feel guilty if i did that because then my son wouldn't know his uncle, aunt or his cousin.  I need your advice please?

I think that you should not worry about the matter, you should continue with your acting of being friendly because it will keep the family together. I know how you feel the must be a right pain in the backside but try and forget about it. Life is too short for silly little stress-full SNOBS

Prayer changes things. I wouldn't worry about what they think of you. You sound just fine to me. I'm sure that they are doing this because obviously something is wrong on their end. Kill them with your kindness. It would help if you did talk to them about it. A lot of times when you leave things unsaid it actually hurts more. The more you let it go on the longer it will last. The more it will grow too...so if you want to change thigns. I encourage you to pray first and then talk to them like an adult would. You know how to do it.

You arent going to win this battle.  I have also been in a similar situation many years ago.
They are terrified of being found out that their roots are humble or ordinary so they are going to avoid any contact with it like the plague.
You are not part of the new life so you represent where they came from.
Its insecurity in a big big way.
All you can do is to keep the contact light, send christmas and birthday cards, the odd e.mail keeping them updated of family events etc and then just leave it.
You wont change them.  You wont get them to alter the way they look at you and their past.  So dont waste your energy trying but rather save it for something you can make a difference to in life.
Dont hate them - they are shortsighted and silly and yet they are terrified.  They live in a house of cards and that can come tumbling down at any time.
So long as you understand that there is nothing whatsoever wrong with you.
Shame when this happens isnt it?

Please do not ignore them completely for your son's sake. I have seen a similar situation happen with my own cousin. He fought for and got a place at Oxford university then carved out a high flying career with a merchant bank in The City. Good for him - he earned it.

But he too has become a total snob. I send him birthday and Christmas cards but he does not even acknowledge them let alone send any back now. He did not officially disown his own family but he might as well have done.

And yet even though I get on with most people I cannot get on with him anymore. Yet I still go thorough the motions. I believe I could be an inverted snob if I acted in a similar manner to him.

At least your son can see how not to act...

You sound like you're describing my husband's sister perfectly.  Only I don't have the good fortune to have her in another country, she lives fairly close.  She visits when I'm at work to see my husband, and hasn't spoken to me in about three years, even when we meet at my in-laws for Christmas and family occasions and I speak directly to her, she'll ignore me.  She sends my kids birthday presents, but she couriers the presents over, when she lives 20 minutes from our house.  I personally want to be the better person, so I say hello when I see her, but to save on friction I don't invite her over.

Little do my parents know, I'm not going to college I need serious advice!?



I just got out of high school and everything. We were suppose to sign up for classes before they are all out. I did register for my classes but my parents didn't pay for it. We delayed so that I can match my class times with my sister so she would be able to take me cuz I cant drive yet, But I havent gotten my classes at all. I procrastinated and now there are NO CLASSES LEFT. My parents dont even know about this yet and school starts tomorrow! I dont want to go to school yet yet tho, I planned this from the start. I wanted to take one semester off so that I can get a job and get money. My mom said something about if I dont go...that something about the "insurance" and I have no idea what she meant. What do I do now? My parents would be furiouse, especially if my parents want me to go to school...Its too late to get classes. I can't drive. My parents think Im going to college but Im not...They might kick me out...

You've been given some seriously good advice already.  You're not going to be able to keep this a secret so you might as well come clean as advised.  I would tell them that the school was all booked up and that I will be going for a full time job.  I can't figure out what insurance has to do with anything where going to school is concerned unless she is referring to a college annuity or something.  From the sounds of things, if they don't boot you out they will likely expect you to pay some sort of rent towards your upkeep which would have otherwise been going to the college costs.  Working could open other doors of opportunity for you.  Many businesses of any size, especially government, have financial assistance programs in place that could help you with your college education and relieve your parents of some of the financial burdens that go along with putting kids through college.  In fact, that could be a point of persuasion for your parents to let you do your thing.  In the meantime, prepare to go to college.  The income betterment can make the difference between a successful life and barely making ends meet.

Be honest with your parents. Explain the situation to them.  Tell them that you plan to work full-time and that you are not just going to be screwing around.  I quit school to join the military, my mom is cool with it, but my dad flipped.  Be Honest, and good luck.

Since you had the wit to plan this little "conspiracy" of yours, I am afraid now you have to have the guts to spill it out on them; I really doubt your sister will be able to help you keep up with a fabricated lie. One thing though, there is usually a way to "force add" classes if you talk to the professors so maybe you want to do that. Good luck!

first of all u should tell ur parents and deal with the consiquences.u're not a child any more,u have to take responsibility for ur actions.second of all,taking a semester off is a bad idea cuz u might get used to it and end up never going to college at all,and that's not a good plan for life.
tell ur parents and they might be able to help u.or go to the registration office and tell them ur situation,say u couldnt register on time and ask if there's any classes u can take.even if they're easy classes,like olectives or something.but what ever u do dont take a semestr off,it's a bad idea.

Sign up for ANYTHING and they can count towards your degree as electives. They may not be in the subject you intend to study, but they will still count for something in the end.



If you don't have college, or can't prove you are attending college, then it looks like the only job you'll be able to get will be in the fast food industry at $4 an hour...Or something just as crappy. I bet after 30 seconds of working at McDonald's you'll wish you were in college chatting up cute girls and going out to parties with new friends.

If you are looking for sympathy or some plausible excuse you are out of luck. You stated that you "Planned" this, you also know how your parents would react, so what's the problem, you made a decision that has immediate consequences (tomorrow). You can try to deceive them and may get away with it for a few weeks, but of course that will only serve to infuriate them more. You definitely need to grow up and stop acting like a spoiled brat who wants his own way. The first step towards maturity is accepting responsibility for your actions, so go and tell your parents Exactly what you have done and accept their consequences. If you were my child and had done this you would have 2 weeks to find a job or Get out of the house, after 6 weeks of working I would then decide if you should remain at home or go and find your own place......it would totally depend on you, your attitude and if I think you are making an honest effort to change. You want to have the privileges of an adult so now you can also accept all that being an adult entails.

How am i supposed to carry on dealing with this?



my dad has always been a heavy drinker and drinks every day, i can say that obviously its a big if but if he hadn't been a problem drinker he would have been a completely diff person,husbans father etc,he does work,but other stuff he doesn't do is mainly down to him being a man and my mum not expecting alot of him,his drinking is more routine like he will only go certain times but i must say that it is something that has come first,not only that but for the last 6 years he has been having helth problems god knows what exactly it is although i have a few ideas and because i know he is worried and scarde deep down and he probably knows the drinking has caused it and now makes things worse he has never asked a gp about it,although he's been about other things in between,its really hard livbing with all of this,i am 28 by the way,cause in a way noone has said its ok to push things aside but you sort of learn this is how it is and you cope cause if nothings going to change what do you do,but then i spend half the time very down,anxious,don't feel like doing anything,worrting about his condition,please don't say talk to him or you must do something,as i know i am asking for advice so that may some of your answers but i have tried in small ways and when i did approach him about his health probs he goes yeah there gonna say do you smoke or do you drink,so i'm like so what ,thats cause he knows that his drinking and health probs are related,which makes me think it comes across like he really has a problem,its so unfair whereas most other people i think that didn't have other factors in the story would go and get treatment and help,but i guess someone who is a problem drinker is not just going to go and do that,i don't really see anything changing unless it falls upon him,i have been reading that people say as i know there are diff type of problem drinkers,but soem say its not when you drink its how much and why,whereas others are saying if you drink everyday you are a alcoholic,my sister says hes not that bad thats only cause she knows things are going along just the same as always,plus shes unfortunatly known people whom have died from alcohol abuse and there ways must have been more worse than my dad,and i look at  my mum and think how could you have married someone like this,and obviously it has affected ther marriage and her life,but she gets on with life whereas with me it does affect me out of the house,but i feel when i'm at home like i don't want to do anything indoors sometimes,this is also a reason why i've never been keen on having boyfriends around or friends,but then because my parents are different like everyone is they are not interested about things like this,which i find wrong,and also don't like me bringing people round like evryone else does. I do feel though upon talking to others though,that have had parents that don't drink at all,were on diff sides of the world,cause i think there are many who do drink that aren't problem drinkers but does come into your life sometimes,and i think even drinkers that do stick within legal limits per week must have diff lifestyles to others as alcohol is still included in ther life,cause they do say the legal limit is your units your aloud per week with a few days off inbetween. Anyway i would just appreciate anyones opinion on my situation,advice or if anyones had or got a situation like this in there own life. Thanks

thanks for your answers so far,i know it is happening to many others maybe in diff ways but it is happening,i just think sometimes after all the thinking i do and worrying,why me,i think of my cousins two girls whose parents weren't getting on and divorced but apart from that they are very good people no other probs,very good parents and both girls have great relationship with there parents they are so lucky,but i am honest and do remeber those that didn't even know there father or didn't have much luck when they got in contact,also others who have died from alcohol related lifestyle,but still doesn't help,yes you are right they only do it if ever when they want,but my dads 64 so i just don't know!



thankyou douglas for your answer yes i know alcoholic is the term for it,but i was just calling it what other term people sometimes use. i do feel not as a way to cope that i know this is going on with many other people,but at the same time feel that i know so many who are lucky neither parent has any addiction of any type,plus alot of my friends parents and family are muslim so alcohol would never come into ther life at all,as its the devil which is true,so they look down on you cause they can;t understand it,but yes aside form help and  advice i do need to move out,and i do need to start living my own life now i'm grown up,i have worked full time for last few years,and do have what is supposed to be a career now as i'm a dental nurse but unfortunatly apart from having to keep moving upwards with courses etc,which obviously i feel is hard cause of these probs,my job doesn't pay that great

Alcoholism is a disease.



It is not always how much you drink or how often that puts you in the category.

My father was an alcoholic. He learned to drink with the best, the Marines! It got to a point where it was devastating to us and him as well. We as a family put our foot down and drove him to an Outpatient Rehabilitation Center. Humbled a bit he accepted the help and did well. He even went to work in a Young Adult Alcohol Rehab Unit for a year afterwards. The kid's loved him and looked up to him because he was a retired Marine and he was not too proud to admit to them his faults. The sad part of this is that my mother never let him live it down and at home he was what you call a "dry drunk". He never drank again even if there were times he wished he could have.



If the concern is there in you then it should be a concern with your mother and she is the one that needs to step up and let him know her limitations with it and try to get him to seek help.



You can get in with an Al-Anon Group n your area and learn more about how to deal with this. There are good ones and bad ones, big picky about it. When we as a family went I stopped going because all they wanted to do was talk about the bad things their family member did drinking. Nothing positive was ever mentioned about the fact they were making their life better for being a part of rehab. I chose to look forward and not backwards. I wish my mother had done the same.

Alcoholism is a disease and you get to a point that it is not so much a choice of the one drinking it is something their body craves and the crave overtakes what is right or wrong. They loose control, just like smoking.



Again, work together as a family. Instead of confronting your father at this point confront your mother and other siblings that may be too use to living with it and dealing with it only to wake up the next day and deal again. There has to be a stopping point and it will either be his health that does it or a fmaily that cares enough to not live around it.

Well, for a start, he is obviously an alcoholic and is damaging his own health anyway  - and certainly not helping any health problems he already has.
It`s a known fact that alcoholics can only stop drinking themselves.  They really have to want to.
I think all you can do is mention it to him occasionally  - and point out that it will finally end in an early and unpleasant death.  But it`s no use nagging, as that will only make it worse.
Sorry about this worrying thing in your life - but it is happening in hundreds if not thousands of homes.



Alcoholics are selfish people: it`s a free country to do whatever we want within the law and as long as it is not hurting or impacting on others...but alcoholism  does impact on others. Very much so.

OK let's get something straight right at the start. While you prefer to describe your dad as a "problem drinker", by definition he is an ALCOHOLIC!  Anyone who has problems in his/her life due to an addiction such as alcohol, recognizes that there are problems, but continues to abuse their substance of choice is an addict, & your dad's addiction is to alcohol, so that makes him an alcoholic OK?

Once it was established that your dad is an alcoholic, all of that other stuff you wrote about (while very relevant) didn't need to be said, since your story is very typical of a child of an alcoholic. 
You could very well write down your entire life story with your father from your earliest memory all the way to the present, & it could easily end up being a word for word description, & life manual for what life is like living with an alcoholic in your family.

Since you are now a young adult, & have more options & choices open to you then you did when you were a small child forced to live under the same roof as an alcoholic, then my advice to you is to turn your focus from HIM, to YOU.
I know that many of us are raised with the belief that it is our burden from birth to protect our family members from all perils, even when it risks our own safety & well-being. But there needs to be limits to that, especially when the family member in harms way seems to be so determined to self-destruct.

That is why I know that you could be helped tremedously by meeting with others, & learning how they have coped with their lives with their addicts. So don't be shy, contact your nearest chapter of ALANON, (they may be closer than you think).

Meanwhile I highly, highly recommend that you read a book by Melodie Beatty titled "Co-Dependant No More".
It helped me, & I KNOW it will help you to read it as well, so find a copy. Start with the library if you want, but I'll bet they have trouble keeping their copy available because, as I said, your story is not unusual so therefore you are not alone.

Good Luck!

My dad drinks and is unwell?



my dada has drank everyday since and before i was born,he has now in the last 6years lost weight,not able to eat certain foods without it upsetting his digestive system,whatever problem he has it has changed his appetite,his main symptom is that he always used to suffer heartburn and now also plus i think indigestion,but mainly its that he eats and at no particular point he gets really bad hiccups and brings up his food,or sometimes may take a first or second mouthful and brings its back up,of course because of this going on for a long time he has lost weight,but i am worried it may be another problem cause sometimes with certain things your body is not absorbing foods properly,also worry about what the exact problem may be that has caused him to lose weight,may i add that this does not happen all the time,although there does seem to have been times where he has a spate of it then it goes away,alcohol definatly worsens it if it has not caused it,he doesn't want to go to the doctors and carries on as he is,not only has his drinking always affected all of us and our relationships with him,and his role in our life,also now his ill health is affecting me greatly,i know to worry and nothing is changing anyway is not helping me,but i feel affected by this nearly everyday,and also think its wrong to sit and do nothing,although nothing is changing,any comments would be appreciated



</question>



<additional details>



we do care about him but yes i think it has become a case of just living with it,and thinking that if others are getting on with it then it must be just the way i see it,plus people always looking at others and thinking its not as bad as this one or that one,i think yes you either get help together,or sometimes things end like as you say with death,or families break up,but i feel me moving out is something i need to do anyway as i am now 28,i'm not saying its a answer to it either but soemtimes alot of marriges break up like the wife will leave and seperate with the husband and kids leave too,i know of a lady whom did that,she divorced him and her and the two daughters lived together and so to speak got on with ther lives,cause they either relised it was a struggle that wasn't going to happen or couldn't be bothered fighting for,and that also it was affecting there lives freatly,he lived in his own place for many years,and even had a girlfriend i think or lady friend



and few years ago there was a time when one of his daughters both are grown up now by the way,was supposed to see him and it didn't happen.and a few days later he was found dead in his flat so sad,i suppose even though they left with there mother when they were younger it was still always apart of ther life to some degree,and must have been very upsetting when he died,i feel like whatever happens once someones in your life whos like that it never ends,it always there



my mum has nevr wanted to nor sees it as that serious and i'm afraid has just got used to it,terrible thing about life that we go through all these things and were all going to die at the end of it,and so much of life has been filled with probs and unhappiness

<question>



Dads a alcoholic and advice just doesn't help me so far?



my dads always been a alcoholic,and side from how he is as a person,husband,father or how he would have been anyway,his alcoholism has always affected life,i suppose by asking things people are only going to give you advice that they can,i'm not saying i want someone to tell me its ok to see things carry on,but what i am saying is , is it ok for me now at 28 to move out and get on with my life,as i feel any changed is ever will happen when they will,and the only thing that is horrible is that even with me oved out,its still happening and will still continue to affect my life



</question>



<additional details>



but what if i don't want to get him help don't mean that in a bad way of course but is that really the answer with all alcoholic stories as i don't think that all  problems in life are about them happening and then everything gets sorted out nicely,but i know you was just trying to help as things aren't any better this way, i just feel its not a easy thing to do,but i suppose i've moaned on about it,but don't want to do anything about it,but i also feel that as we all know alcoholism is not just the persons problem it ends up being everyones problem in a family,so even if just for ourselves we should do something,but i feel that is wqrong in a way as it his problem too,he has said some serious and some silly things about it in the past,but knows what he is,but think it would be a blue moon before he would ever get help,it would only ever maybe come up if he were to go about his health probs he's having or something else and alcohol came into the conversation and he was pushed a bit but



other than that no chance, i also feel sometimes oh well he's swimming along getting on with life why shouldn't i even though of course he is suffering and thinking and feeling alot inside,



last couple of answers are true statements,but in a very rude way which people will not think good of me for saying i think is there some way where if hes like that then you have to accept it rather than think one day things will change,or one day we will get him to change,whereas i would rather think of myself and my life,and get help and advice and be able to talk about it to help me live with it



oh by the way to the 4th answerer i'm female not male



what i find hard to understand is that although i have asked for answers and people are only saying whats best but do people not realise some will never change,other things will happen but it all seems people are set on saying this or that will happen eventually or in its own good time,but i'm trying to find ways of underrtsanding and coping with it for the future as soem situations are not going to change in the ways others have



yes ture last answerer i suppose in w ay i'd like someone to say its ok to let this go on and deal with it in this or that way,i just wish it wasn't happening to me,hope that doesn't seem unfair or selfish to all the others that have or do have to cope with similar things



To jasemuk,thanks for your answer sometimes people need a hit of reality,but have you had a alcoholic parent,it seems not,and i was not using his probs for me not moving out i was saying that because of his probs and my age i think i should move out,as this is not only a necessary thing in life anyway and something we all do leaving our parents,but laos because of the way things are its the only,not the most preferred way of me seperating myself from it.

Its bound to affect you whatever happens, but if i was you i would move out, and see your Dad when you choose to see him. It doesnt matter whether you live with him or not, he will still drink, and he will not stop until he wants too( i was married to a alcoholic). You deserve a life, and its not much fun living with an alcoholic, they bring you down, you worry about them!! Make a break, get your own place, then it will be your choice when you see him and for how long!!

Its hard for any family member living with and alcoholic or drug addict i think hes not had to change because life has always been the same the only person who can help your dad is his self he needs to want help first before any changes will happen you need to get on with your own life and if he needs you then let him know you will be there for him sometimes people need to lose everything to realise what they had a lost before they can change good luck xxx

based on experience, i can tell you that unfortunately, your dad is only going to get help when he sees that he needs it. nothing you, or anyone else, can say will make him get help until he realizes that he has a problem.

i am sure you already know this, but alcoholics see drinking as a solution, not as the problem. sometimes it takes losing everything to realize what they had.

you should move out if that's what you want to do, and you should not feel guilty about leaving your dad to deal with his problem. in fact, it would probably help him.

if you have other family members that are also affected by this, you could try something like an "intervention". in my situation, we did that, and it actually got a little worse before it got better. but you kind of have to expect that. people with drinking problems will get offended when they are approached about it, and they will feel like they are being attacked. i am not sure if this has ever happened to you, but for me, whenever we tried to approach the person, they would place the blame on us, in order to take the attention off of themselves. that is a form of denial... making you feel guilty for their problems.

to summarize everything i just said, i think you should move out and move on with your life. you won't be affected as much that way as you are now, with living with it. you may be worried about your father, but like i said, this is something he is going to have to get through himself. unfortunately, it is hard, but it will all come in time.

you could try mentioning getting help for him, but he may become angry with you, since he doesn't see it as a problem.

i really wish you the best, and i hope you can get through this in a healthy way. i know drinking problems affect everyone around the person, and i think the best thing for you to do is create a life for yourself, and stay away from that type of environment.

unfortunately, before your dad seeks help he needs to acknowledge the fact that he has a drink problem if he does not things will carry on and nothing will change and only become worse.  Sad fact but true.  I have no doubt that it is affecting your life, it is not pleasant.  Perhaps a change of scene for you may help but you wont be able to stop worrying or caring for your dad.  A frank discussion might be in order when you tell him how you feel and that you cant no longer reside under the same roof, perhaps a jolt is what he needs. There is no easy answer just a prayer that he may seek help when he realises what he is going to lose.  take care of yourself

You are 28 and it's time for you to move out of your parents house.  I'm sorry your father is a alcoholic but there is nothing you or anyone else can do until he wants to help himself.



There is no use for you to worry about him.  He's not worried about himself and he knows what alcohol can do to a person.

I don't really understand why you've stayed there until you are 28. Maybe you feel some misplaced sense of responsibility for your father. The fact is that he is the one who was (until you were 18, at least) supposed to be responsible for you, not the other way around. You do not need to feel, or be, responsible for him or trying to save him or look after him.
He has chosen the life that he leads. Everyone, including alcoholics, make their choices, and he has made his. If he had chosen a different path, he could have put caring for his family first and got help from AA or some similar organisation. He chose not to do that, so don't hold yourself responsible for taking care of him. 
Get out now and make a life for yourself. It's totally your choice whether you even stay in contact with him. As things currently stand, it sounds as though you are enabling him more than anything else. Most alcoholics have to hit rock bottom before they will get help, and you are right that problems don't always just get neatly sorted out. He may never give up drinking, and if he doesn't, that is 100% his own choice. He can choose to get help at any time. 
Anyway, go and live your own life to the full. Join a support group for the families of alcoholics. Al-Anon is one, and they will be able to help you put things in perspective.
Good luck.

Absolutely not, sometimes you cry so much you don't have any tears regarding the situation.  I have done that with certain situations in my life and it is just not worth it to get upset.  You can not change the situation so it is okay to not cry anymore just stay strong for you family in general and live with the life that you have been given.  take advantage of what your family still has instead of dwelling on what you don't have anymore.

SAM, I would like to know how young you are?. I hope you will not go a
strayed now seen that you do not have your Father to Lean on because
you sound like you are @ the stage where you need a male influence in your life & I mean a POSSITIVE male not just a person who wears trousers but a MAN, so what you & your Brother should do if you have a uncle, a Teacher, a neighbor, or some male that you can talk with or even your father, DO NOT, I mean DO NOT turned your back on him not because he & your Mother is not to gather you should remember he is still your Parents, he is still your Father & if it was not he & your
Mother you would not be in this world & it's not really your business it's
your Mother & your Father's Business I hope he did not use to hit her!.
and think about it this way. It is better they Divorce & go there own way more than killing each other or one of them kill the other one so just call your Dad, go & see him & be close with him, I hope your Mother is not telling the both of you any bad thing about him as well, If
she dose, you should tell her in a nice way that you do not want to here those bad things about your father. And BY THE way, Do not be
nasty to your Mother's Friend If or when she should have one try and be good to him if he should be good to you, do not judge him from the
start, if he is nice to you & your brother you should respect him and do not hate him if he is good to the both of you OK??
You ask for help that is why I spend the time to speak to you. may be I could be your Grand Father so please listen to what I have said to you OK BIG MAN??.

It sounds like you've been resigned to it for a long time, which shows some maturity on your part.

I do feel sad for your mother though, it's possible she still loves your dad and wants to keep trying, but it's hard when the other person really doesn't want to.



I think the best thing to do for your mother is to encourage her to keep busy and active, so that she is at least tired enough to sleep at night - sleep is a great healer of both body and spirit. The last thing she needs is to have other men in her life right now, so don't try to encourage her to date or whatever. Much better that she makes new friends instead, particularly people in similar situations.

Take your dad out...Let him talk about his feelings for the day. He needs to talk what he feels inside...share some amusing anecdotes about your mum.



It seems he needs someone to talk to and that is you ;-) You will get to know more things about your dad if you just listen :-)

Well I think a naughty school girl is a bit sick when you think about it. If men get turned on by a woman dressed as a school girl to me its a bit peadophilish because one day (if they haven't already) chances they will have kids themselves so if you can see where I am coming from.
As for the playboy bunny tis good but everyone does that then again devil and angel aren't really that rare but whatever you decide to go as. Hope you have a good time

I'm feeling really annoyed and upset that I have no money...Plz help!!!?



Hi there, I'm 14 years old, and wanted to get a Saturday job. But hardly anywhere will employ me and there are no vacancies. And as the minimum age limit doesnt aply to mje, they could very easily take advantage of me and pay some crappy money like £2-3 an hour.

I didn't wanna take money from my Mum, and as we are not doing so well at the moment we dont have lot of money to spend.



We recently moved from a refuge, and are now living in a 2 bedroom house, and the rent is £1000 a month.

So now you see why we have no money to spend.

As a teenage girl I wanna buy all kinda stuf, go to the cinema, etc. But I have no money TO spend.

We are looking for a house where the rent is cheaper, but and my Mum said that she will give me and my 2 brothers pocket money then.



I feel really sad, please can u help me? How can I overcome this feeling?

I am grateful 4 what I have, it's just that I wanted to be more independent, and now I can't. We won't be moving house 4 ages, so plz help!

Can you babysit or do things for people that you can earn some funds to spend?  Even helping deliver the paper in your neighborhood could be of some help.
Are you good at poetry? Short stories? there are some publishing companies for teens that will pay $100.00 and more for each.........now hows that.
I live in a apartment complex that goes by your income and sweetie at my age I don't even have enough to have food at the end of the month sometimes, and I think they are going to raise my rent because of the improvements.
Don't think I am putting you down, I am not .Just want you to know that when you get older like me its not a sure thing  in having funds to spend.

All I can suggest is that you work hard at school, get good GCSE and A-level grades, go to a good Uni, and get a decent job when you're older.

The least you can do is prepare for your OWN future so that you and your future kids should not have to endure what you've already been through.

It sounds like you're a really good kid trying hard to help.
Most parents don't get kids like you, she's lucky.
I would go around the neighborhood and offer to do jobs.
For example, you could clean up houses, watch kids and pets, et cetera.
And if you have a lawn mower, I have a friend who charges £20 an acre to mow, and we live on a 4 acre lot.
@_@
You could also have a bake sale, where you make cookies and scones and cakes, as well as other treats, and sell them.
You could even pair it up with some tea or lemonade for extra.
Actually, I like the last idea.
You could set it up at your apartment or mall, or perhaps a local cafe will let you.
Best of luck!

Aww!! First of all can I just say I think you are doing really well,and your willingness to help is amazing,I'm really sure your mum will appreciate it.

How about you extend on things you are interested in such as if you are into drawing you van try and market ideas to companies or shops.Or if it's singing maybe you can see if there are any events close by that are willing to pay you for your time.

Im not sure if you have done work experience at school if/when..maybe if you have been their they can give you some sort of placement .Or even some sort of some sort of cooking for people like a neighbour or friends.Also you can try retail shops like River Island and JD Sports.Although one thing I think is that you shouldn't be working long or late hours,although it's up to you,I just don't think it's right for companies to employ you that way or for you even.Also you can write into magazine such as 'That's Life' and 'Chat' (they are in newsagents and supermarkets) and you can send in stories and pictures etc.Also they have crosswords and things to fill out and win prizes,and I know someone that knows someone lol that won something.

I know it might seem hard but try not to feel down,because I can tell you are caring just by reading what you wrote I'm sure you Mum and brothers are appreciating everything you do.

I really do wish you all the best!

Watching Tyra Banks show about purity balls?



Has anyone ever been to one of these? it seems kinda weird to me, is anyone else creeped out by this or do you think it is normal??? they showed a 5 year old girl, A 5 year old shouldnt even know what virginity means.

I think it's really sad how kids are finding out about sex and virginity etc at a younger and younger age. I only found out about it when I was six because my older brother who was eight heard about it from kids at school got in the car at afternoon pick-up and blabbed it all to me. Also my cousin who is my age got it from somewhere, parents I don't know but she told me the word. I forgot all about it till Mum explained the birds and the bees to me aged nine. I doubt this innocent five year old will end up keeping her word. I'm not sure about Australian teens but I've heard in America 1 in 4 teens have/have had a STD/STI

I'm 17, at college and live at home with my mom,About 3 months ago, I stayed overnight at a friend's house without telling my mom where I was (I guess I got a little tipsy and totally forgot).She was frantic with worry and blew a gasket when I got home next morning.She hauled me into my bedroom and gave me six swats with the paddle.

You're still a minor so technically speaking your mom was in the right. You also have to remember though, if you had a daughter who was meant to be home one night and she didn't turn up until the next morning, you'd be frantic with panic.

I think your mom was right to panic although her reaction is way over the top with regards to the paddling, i'd say you'd be a bit old for that....

What you said pretty much wraps it up.

What you did was wrong, but what she did was wrong...er.

She loves you and was worried about you, but swatting you with a paddle at any age is inappropriate and doesn't solve anything in the long run. And at your age, she really needs to stop being so over protective (moms never will :P ) because you won't always be at home with her where she can see you.

In the future, call her. And talk to her about this if you want.

Good Luck!

Physical (corporal) punishment is inappropriate at any age and under any circumstances and is usually the recourse of people with little imagination or who have been brought up themselves with beatings.  You should approach her when she's in a calm moment and tell her that you won't take that from her ever again.
You should also apologise for having caused her so much anxiety that she had to lose control in that way.  Do this with the respect due to your mother, point out the respect that you feel for her and ask her to show you the respect that you also deserve.
Good luck, it might seem like an overwhelming situation right at the moment, but it will fade into insignificance with time.

Sorry veronica but you just really disgust me.  All you are worried about is a few swats with a paddle.  Try to put your self in your mom's position when you did'nt come home!  Every newspaper she picks up will have stories of muggings, rapes, abductions and murders and you can bet that she imagined every one of them when you did not come home!  Your briefly sore tail end is nothing compared to the anguish she went through that night.

You may be are thinking of this the wrong way, I think that spanking you should have ended a long time ago however your behavior warranted her her treating you as a child, simply because of your childish behavior.



underage drinking, no phone call, allowing her to worry all night. 
these are not the actions of a mature young lady, still living with and dependent on your mother you should have more respect for her.

Honestly, I think you are too old to be spanked. I haven't been spanked since I was 6... that was 6 years ago. You are almost a legal adult, so no I think you have a right to go out when and where you want.

I would say that at your age YOUR behaviour was inappropriate. You are certainly old enough to read the papers and listen to the news and hear about the dreadful things that happen to young ladies who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.



Clearly it took something drastic to get through to you. You caused your mum unbelievable anxiety which needed an outlet. Your behind WAS that outlet. Seems fair to me.



You won't ever forget to let her know where you are again - will you?

after all your parents are worried about you..they punish you because they love you..they are just teaching you to be more discipline..we don't have all our lifetime with our parents, so just accept whatever they do to make us a better person, and of course it must be rasional.

Right, do not give her any food or drink with sugar in, so that's like sweets, coke, drink squashes, etc...Try to give her wholesome foods and drink like water milk, weetabix, y'know.



If it continues, take her to see a doctor, which over a few years may diagnose her with ADHD or other disorders.

You have said it all here. Now, as a teen I assume you're computer savvy......so you find some really beautiful nature scenes (sunsets, waterfalls, forest at autumn) and superimpose some of your favorite snapshots of her into them and attach some of the metaphors as if she's the one talking. Maybe even get one of the olympic symbol and a pic with her as prom queen or something. Just let your imagination run with it gurl!

When I found out that I had to make this speech I found an agent who could get in touch with the word's most glamorous women so that at long last my mother could join the firmament of the stars. My idea was a necklace where she would be the chief diadem. Harry, the agent, called around, got Kirsten Dunst on the phone, and asked her, as a special favor--he also offered $2 million--to be here, but when she heard that my mother was going to be present too, she couldn't stand the competition, so we had to nix her. Then after that we tried Angelina Jolie. She was hard to reach, in France. She considered the idea, but became very evasive when she heard why Dunst had said no.

In the next three weeks, we ran through a roster of Hollywood, everyone from Eva Longoria to Beyonce, and Paris Hilton to Kate Olsen, Reese Witherspoon to Drew Barrymore. Only Phyllis Diller said that she would come, but I don't think _I_ could stand that. We had no shortage of male applicants, including Brad Pitt, Matt Damon (he's getting kind of heavy, though), George Clooney, and the Jonas Brothers--but we are not trying to set my mother up: we're trying to set her off.

So there she is, a rose in a field yarrow, a dahlia in a field of clover, Botticelli's inspiration and despair, the original for Helen of Troy, Eve, Juliet, Cleopatra, Ishtar, Daisy Buchanan, and the girl in the car in _American Grafitti._ Fall upon the thorns of life, ye proud, and bleed!

If you have powerpoint software could you do a montage of her life with some  photos superimposed over say a field of flowers and if you are not happy giving an actual speech then you could just type meaningful words at the top of bottom of the picture.  eg: a picture of mum in her teens with a caption "a teenage beauty".  a picture of her with you as a baby "the perfect mother".



You could just let your imagine run riot and she would really enjoy seeing photos of herself and the fact that you have put so much effect into her party.

My parents are really controlling, im almost 20 what should i do?



I was out of the house for a little less then a year and i made some mistakes. (like i believe most college students do) my parents have always been riding me so when i got out of the house i went a little crazy. i drank. and i didn't do very good in school...I Hated it! i want to find success my own way and in my own time. but they are always looking over my shoulder (not in a supportive kind of way) they are always telling me how I'm failing and that I'm lazy. they act like they hate supporting me but the refuse to let me move out. i would just leave but i know that our relationship would be ruined forever. its like they want to plan every aspect of my life. also they don't really like my boyfriend that i want to marry. he is going into the national guard. he didn't come from a family like ours...barely even a family. and they judge him all of the time because he doesn't have any money. how do i get my parents off my back but keep them in my life?

You get your parents off your back by getting back on track. Get a nice job, move out, and make something of yourself. They probably won't let you move out because you don't have enough money to pay the rent and they don't want you making the same mistakes. Get a job, unless you already have one, and start making success.
good luck

tell them how you feel - keep it calm and rational. remind them that they were kids once too and they need to allow you to make some choices in your life or you'll never get the practice. tell them that you respect their wishes and respect the choices they make for you (trust me just say it - even if you don't mean it! this one is crucial for sounding grown up and mature) but you would like the opportunity to PROVE to them that you are becoming a responsible young adult.

This is exaclty the same as my older brother, he always being shouted at by my parents because of the things he does and doesnt do. Im sad to say that failing in school is perhaps the worst thing you can do in life but, i would ask the question why you failed. maybe your mum and dad didnt help or support you enough. as for the nagging its the same in every house hold. Just help around the house without being asked. offer to take them out for dinner. anythign that will butter them up. it works.

wow. that's my exact life though i'm 18 now and i started drinking from it all some time ago.
very VERY controlling.

really there is no way. i've sort of lost my care for having parents and i have no contact with the dad anymore.

mom's always telling me i'm lazy though i do VERY much to help her with the yard and house and i record weddings and code sites for money.

dad doesn't live here anymore so it's really mom anymore.
but she tells me how i'm failing all the time and that selling prints and coding and these weddings won't support me forever.. though.. i'm making very good money with it just at 18...

it's more that i'm wanted to go through life as they want me to. that they don't want me to make my own decisions that if i don't do it their way, then there is no way.

you really just have to ignore them for some time and let them know you're doing the right thing.

even if it takes years.. eventually they have to accept it.

mine havn't quite done so but i know the more i fall away from them.. the more the ease into accepting who i am and what i do. and they sort of lay off much more

The first thing you need to do is find a way to support yourself, if your still in school get a part time job. Start saving as much money as you possibly can to get your own car or something like that. then find your own place to live and move out of your parents house. Once they realize your trying to support yourself they should back off and become more supportive of you.

Your parents really love you, and with that said they will love you no matter what life choices you make.  It may take some time to heal, but you need to be your own person.  Talk to them and explain that you were not ready for college and you need to figure life out on your own and then move out, get a house or apt and start living your life.  Just before you do, really consider what your parents are telling you, because they know from experience what life is like and they only want to make sure you have a good one---a college education, a good career and a good husband.

When people control, they have no intentions of having a good relationship or caring.
In that sense, it is already ruined.

You can challenge them and face them challenging you which may deliver you some high magnitude pain for a short time until they surrender.
Or you can continue with the mild pain of being a slave all the time, which is in net terms *worse*.

Tell them to stuff them selves.
Do what ever you can to defend your self and get what ever help you can.
Plan your tactical measures and what you are to do to make your assault against them.
Do not get physical though.



But also, do not live a life of drugs, sex and dossing about wasting money on credit cards and other crap.
Set a good example to the world, your not like your parents!

No hon, it is time to be honest and it is going to hurt.
You want to do what you want to do and them support you.It don't work that way.You are 20 and CAN move out and make it on your own,but the fact is you do not WANT to you like someone paying your way,you do not like being told what to do though.The thing is it is their house and their rules.Now me,I would have packed your things and took you to a homeless shelter.Not to be mean,but you NEED to grow up and learn how to stand on your own 2 feet and you are going to find, without a college degree your going to be scraping bottom to  exist.
Otherwise you will be at the mercy of whoever will support you.For instance, if you get pregnant and dumped who is going to take care of you?

Just noticed how rubbish my parents are...?



When i was little. I was put to bed at 7.30 EVERY NIGHT, even on weekends. And i had to stay there and not move.
my mum got re-married and had another child who is 7 now.
This is what happend tonight, that i really just can't believe.
Fern, my little half sister who is 7.. was in bed..
Fern: "DADDDDD IM HUNGRY GET ME SOME FOOD"
Her Dad: "No, Fern.. youv'e not long had dinner"
Fern: "YOUR NOT ME, YOU DONT KNOW IF IM HUNGRY OR NOT"
Her Dad: "No!, go to sleep!"
Fern: "I HATE U"
Her Dad: "Fine, you can have a packet of crisps and that's it"
And then later on the night she started complaining about a book thats gone missing. And then my mum and step dad, like a couple of T***s, search high and low for it. How is that going to sleep? I would of told her to wait till the morning. There such bad parents. And fern is a little bratt. I know she's my half sister but i really dislike her somtimes and i know its the bad parenting skills that have made her like this. But seriously  i even hate my parents.



What advice can a 16 year old give her mother on parenting skills without her step dad tryin to attack her again because i aparently think im the boss of the house and tryin to be an adult?

thanks

When there is an age gap your going to notice differences on upbringing, times have changed and alot of parents have changed too, I wouldn't say they are bad parents, Yes your sister does sound spoiled, perhaps your parents are lots older and just give in because they want a quiet life? I'd say let them handle her their own way, then nothing can be said to you..

You comparing her upbringing to yours!



You can't comment on your parents parenting skills because you acting too immature about it all.

Just because you may deal with it differently doesn't mean your parents are rubbish parents! They just have their own parenting technique and if it works for them and makes them happy, let them get on with it.

Until you grown up and mature enough to have your own kids you no idea how hard it is.

You may one day have your own child and find yourself doing exact same thing.

In mean time learn to be mature as jealously is such an ugly trait!

I think some of the answers have been unfair on you. It's bound to be difficult for you having to adapt to having someone who isn't your dad laying down the law. You can see that your mum has willingly and happily  changed her rules to suit you. (I'm guessing by your ages that it was your mum's rule, rather than your dad's that you had to be in bed etc). You have a right to feel aggrieved, but what to do about it?



First of all you already realise that it's not Fern's fault, so maybe you can try not to blame her too much. Secondly, maybe you can have a quiet word with your mum when your step-dad isn't around and point out that she isn't being fair to you, or true to herself by falling in with your step-dad's ways to that extent without at least acknowledging that she isn't being fair to you. Other than that, you have little choice but to accept things as they are and make plans for your own life and leave them to get on with theirs. Then maybe, when you are an old lady of 26 with your own home and career, and your little sister is an impossible teenager you can say I told you so.

Say nothing. Much better policy.



And when they ask you to babysit, lay down the law with that child. She can wrap her parents around her little finger, but you are another story. And let her blab to the parents! Tell them you're perfectly happy if they want to set up a CCTV camera system in the house, because you have nothing to hide.



They are far more likely to shell out for another babysitter than go the CCTV route. Which means you are off the hook as are as your little sister is concerned. As soon as you are old enough, move out.

I think 10pm during the week is very reasonable, at 17 you should not be out drinking in bars (I'm not saying you do, just that bars tend to be the only places open so late in the week), and 11.30 pm at weekends is also good. Just hold out until you're 18, move out, and then set your own rules!

If you're wanting comparison, my eighteen year old son, who is a senior this year, has to be home by 10 pm on school nights, and 1 am on weekends.  I allow this because he is mature, doesn't drink, and is always available to me by cell phone.  That way I don't worry myself sick that he is crashed and dead along the road somewhere.

Just think if you were funding someone to study with your finances you would expect to have a say in the way they use their time so they can get the most out of their studies.  Would you like someone who's education you are supporting to stay out late?

V,  ten years down the line when you have passed your exams and are in a good job, and able to do anything you want to do. you will look down your nose at them girls that had freedom, went out got drunk, had fun, because they will be messed up in the head (usually comes as throwback from drug taking) and each have a few kids, and wearing dirty chavvy sweat pants,
Trust me i KNOW! i totally hated my mothers rules so i left home and did what i wanted to do, I didn't even bother doing my exams and had 3 kids. It was seeing the girls "WE USED TO MAKE FUN OF AND HAVING TOTAL RESPECT FOR THEM FOR BEING somebody, unlike i was, that made me go to college and try again. 
but i say do it the first time, Its easier, Everything else can wait. Everything else will always be there, you will never get this time back.
Your mother is trying to protect you, and I will do the same thing with my daughters as well!

my daughter is 20years old, and there's no such thing as a curfew 
in my house. she is not allowed to go any where unless she's 
going to work, or doctor's appointment and most time i 'm the one 
who has to take her for her appointment.she do not go to party
or hang out..shes very pretty and popular, has a good sense of humor
and a lot of friends, people just love her. but she do not hang out. they see her when she goes to school and when she's at work.and she thanks me for been strict, i believe she will be more appreciative when she gets much older.

As long as you are living under her roof your mother has the right to impose ANY rules upon you .  If you don't like it then become self supporting and move out and take care of yourself.

YOur Parents wants only whats the best for you, sound silly right? coz you not really understand what that meaning of these words. When you old enough you will understand why you Parents act weirdo especially when you get married and have children you'll see, that what your Parents did to you (like having curfew) is you also do that to your children.



They only think about your good future. If you want your Mom will trust you then you have to build a trust for yourself and her. Give time to share and spend time with your Mom, tell her what you want and what you like to be in your future, then she will see that you can really trust coz you open up your mind, secrets and ambition with her. Maybe you too much secret or you not that close with your Mom that is why she so stict and very protective to you coz she doesn't know what you want to do or what will you do if she's not around you.

Get close with her and build for each others trust.

I HATE MY F***ING JOB! How am I gonna last for 3 months??????????



I hate my job and I hate my boss, she's such a bully. They've been really unfair to me so I decided to leave. I didn't want to just move into another dead end job though so I took a secretarial course that ended last week. But I found out today it will take 3 -4 months before I get my results. They originally told me 3 weeks, although they did apologise for thr mistake. My plan was to have left in a months time, but now I can't. I have to wait 3 or 4 months, THEN find another job and THEN work my 4 weeks notice! I am desperate to leave. I have to go back today after 2 weeks off for stress, and i'm really dreading it. I feel so low and miserable.

Just go out and find yourself another job/take another course something you are really interested in and would enjoy doing. If your boss is a bully don't stay, there are workplaces out there that deserve you more than her.

If you're boss is such a bully, complain to HER boss. Have a list of the times she bullied you. If her boss does nothing about it, go to your local citizen's information bureau or equivalent and ask them what to do about this.



I'm afraid unless you can get someone to back you up, or there is a record of this somewhere, it could boil down to your word against hers.



I would go back to the place where you did your course, and tell them that you are really serious about finding another job, and could they give you a letter of recommendation, something like that, that you can present to potential employers. Ask them if they know of any vacancies that you can fill in, even if these are temporary. And go to temping agencies also. Work on your look, most of these places like their temps to look professional. Don't be afraid to ask how you can improve yourself in ways other than the actual job.



You could also ask your current boss' boss if there are vacancies in other departments, so you don't have to deal with your current boss in the same way. Real mud in her eye if you end up working at a higher end than she is now! Revenge is a dish best served cold ....

I would say without judging, that yes, your Dad does need to grow up. he has you to consider in all of this selfish behaviour. If he wasn't a father, it wouldn't be a problem because he wouldn't be harming anyone other than himself. Talk to him, let him know how irresponsible you think he is.

Getting nicked and going to prison isn't terribly clever, but apart from that it sounds like he's been living the dream...

But seriously, if you're a little youngster and he's neglecting you then he needs a mighty boot up the a**e. If you're an adult and able to fend for yourself, then you could start rejoicing in the fact that your Dad is still full of beans and is a handsome rogue who can still pull the birds.

My great grandfather (who I never met or talked to) who lives in China died yesterday, and my parents want me to attend his funeral in a week.  However, that's also when my first year of high school starts, and I really don't want to have to miss the important first week of school.



Should I be trying to convince my parents to let me not go, or am I just a heartless freak?

Well, he is your grandfather, and you do have 3 more "important weeks of school" left, soooo i would go the funeral. I wouldn't try to convince your parents because that would most likely hurt their feelings. From what i remember, i don't think i really did anything important during the first week. except go over class procedures and stufff..................



But if you were to have a funeral, wouldn't you want all of your family members there? even the ones you haven't met?

but remember, this is just my opinion

I recently turned 14 and I got quite a bad school report stating that I had misbehaved alot. so my parents have decided to punish me. My normal bedtime is 8.30 which i think is too early but because i've been bad a mum and dad have decided that for the summer they are lowering my bedtime to 6.30 pm!!!! i have to be in my pj's straight after dinner and inbed at 6.30 on the dot. even on weekends!!! they told me after summer is over not to have my bedtime back to it's normal time and they are putting my bedtime to 7.30, because they think my behavior is because due to lack of sleep. my little sister gets to go to bedlater then me and she is 12. she has gone up to 8.30. i feel like theere treating me like a little kid :(

Well yes and no, I think that it is a little to early to go to bed, but I'm sure that you know that u should have not misbehaved in school. Your parents want the best for you, and i guess this is their way of punishing you. Your best bet right now is to suck it up and just do it. Cause this is going to get you nowhere. Maybe they will see that you are doing it without complaints and change their minds. :)

I don't think it's the right way for them to deal with it, they are being unfair and giving you every reason to build up resentment that might never go away  I'd have hated to go to bed right after dinner, and seriously resented having my little sister stay up later - it I had one that is. especially through the summer when the evenings are light and everyone is out and about during the evenings. but hey, I'm not in their shoes.

Maybe you could be the adult and talk to them about why your behaviour and school report was bad, and what else could be done about it. Can you think of a likely reason and solution for the problem?



If you show that you can be mature about things then maybe they'll relent a bit, even if it's just at weekends.

6:30pm in the summer in the UK is still daylight and a bit early, however, you could appeal the sentence and ask to be sent to bed at a later time but do extra studying/homework during the extra two hours or some form of community service instead. That way you are still being punished but you stay up later and learn something at the same time.

Sure it sounds harsh to you - but try to take a stepback and accept it as a consequence of your actions.
Also going to bed that early does not mean you cab be forced to sleep - use the time - read - write - msn to friends, catch up on all that stuff. Am sure that if your parents found you tidying your room they would not force you into bed. Also - a bit radical - how about study?  Then maybe you can trade up when you return to school?
A may seem a bummer but try to make it work for you, at your age - on average you need about 9 hours of sleep on a regular basis. so maybe you can work around it by getting up earlier and using that to your advantage.

What is my moms problem with me?



Here is the deal. ANYTIME I go make plans with someone which is not too often my mom at first acts cool and fine with it-- then when it comes down to the day of me actually going to do this she gets crazy by nitpicking about everything like she will say the house is dirty or I need to vacum or mop the floor. Its ALWAYS something!! She yells and acts like she is all pissed off but yet she didnt act like that when I had made the plans before its always the day of that she acts crazy. she will tell me I need to clean up or do something or she gets into her control issues and says I cant use the car. I admit I am an adult living with my parents but I do clean. I do what they ask me to. I pay rent. I pay child care to my mom. I maintain the car that I drive. But my mom acts jealous of me for some reason. like for instance this past week my dad and I had planned a camping trip to take my kid camping. Its something we do every summer. my mom doesnt like camping so she never wants to go. she was perfectly FINE up until the day we were suppose to leave. Then she literally went into one of her tyraids and started screaming and yelling literally telling ME that its MY fault that things dont get done and my dad had asked her what she meant because the house was clean but she managed to nit pick about crap that she shouldnt had.The mop wasnt where she put it(when she was the one that moved it and my dad told her that) then it was that the trash wasnt taken out(there wasnt much trash to take out its just her way of getting someone else to take it out because she doesnt want to do it)then it was that my kid had like 4 toys out(which I put away)then it was the kitchen floor wasnt swept(My dad told her she was being ridiculous and that she can sweep it but she had a massive fit about it)then it was that the dog didnt have clean water. I swear its like she purposly LOOKS for things. My dad finally got mad and told her that she was acting crazy over things that she shouldnt and that he said she was perfectly fine until we were getting ready to leave and how she is holding us up on purpose and he said that he would cancel the trip and I said NO because I had taken time off work to go camping and how my kid had been looking forward to it. My mom finally stopped and apoligized. Then I constantly hear her bad mouthing me to her friends basically telling them everything I do wrong and how my brother is the golden child-- I called her out once in front of her friend  and my mom got pissed.What the hell is my moms problem? Why does she hate me so much? She said she doesnt but I asked her why is she always putting me down to her friends when I bend over backwards and do what she wants- I cook. I help clean. I drive her lazy *** around town because she doesnt want to drive(I finally told her I wasnt going to drive her anymore)



</question>



<additional details>



I dont understand because I TRY my hardest to do things to her satisfaction!! my dad sees the effort I make... he appreciates it but she cant and whenever he tries to say something to her its wrong



its not an issue of that I am in her space- She doesnt really cook- its me that does that... Like I said I RARELY go out and do anything and when I do she is like dr jecky and mr hyde-- my friends see my effort-- my dad sees my effort--but she cant..

You never said how old you were or your mom, but adult children need there own space. You are not doing things to your mothers satisfaction so strive to get out of her space and get your own. She may not hate you or is holding anything against you, but two cooks in the kitchen spoil the soup. If she's a nick picky, bossy, controlling overbearing,emotional bully, YOU ARE STILL IN HER SPACE!!!!!!! Think about getting YOUR OWN more than worrying about how to be as comfortable as you can be in HER SPACE. 
Perhaps, your mother is issuing orders prior to your gallivanting, as last ditch efforts to enforce discipline and responsibility on you that she feels has been lacking in other or similar areas. Life as you know is more than concentration on just 'fun plans." You don't get something for nothing in the real world maybe, she's trying to expose you to this reality.

Try to plan a time for your fiance to walk in unexpectedly during one of these times.  See what her reaction is toward her mother then?????
Or tell the mother-in-law to dress more conservatively in your presences????  And add--no insult intended.  Good Luck.

Well, if she is your fiance, then she isn't technically your mother-in-law, is she?  Just an observation.  As far as what you should do about it?  Well, that all depends upon whether you wish for your fiance to actually become your wife, doesn't it?  Wink.  Seriously, though.  You would find some who would say that you should have a little fun on the side.  I think that is a bad idea for several reasons, personally.  Is the mother-in-law to be married?  Is she a widow?  What is the situation?  If she is not married, maybe you could help her find someone else to direct that sexual energy toward?  A blind date, or something?  If she is married, then that would be a bad idea, would it not be?  It is a difficult thing to answer without having additional information about the situation.  It isn't exactly a common situation, but it certainly is far from the first time that such a thing has occurred.  Without additional information, I don't know how to give a solid answer.  I do know that if you love your fiance and wish for her to become your wife, than you should certainly not give into the mother-in-law to be's advances.  That much is for certain.

the best thing would be to tell your fiance . tell her you are not SURE she is doing it on purpose or towards you because you dont want her to think you are just making it up. mothers and daughters can be very close, so there is a thin line there, but just tell her it is making you uncomfortable and that you would like for her to see if she sees what you are seeing. i think that would be the best way to handle it. that way, you dont sound jealous of the mother but you get the point across to your fiance. you never know, she may have had this problem in the past with her mom?

She might be in competition with her daughter in all things.  Submitting to the bait will likely end your relationship with the daughter as she will throw it up in her face.  If she isn't in competition but just trying to feel sexy to herself with the nearest available man.



You could tell her, in a non-flirtatious way, that she looks attractive but it is too distracting and embarrassing for you.  That might be enough to make her put her housecoat back on.



Discussing it with your lady is required.  she may give you insights and be able to make mom stop or go out to a good meat-market bar where something my come  of her to be seductive.

If you are a decent person, which it sounds like you are or else you wouldn't be seeking advice, you already know the answer! Tell your fiance how uncomfortable the situation is for you, she will get to the bottom of it if indeed there is something wrong with the picture. It might be that her Mom just dresses slutty! Good luck!

I would agree that it would be a good idea to let your fiancee know you are concerned about her mother's behaviour (bit more diplomatic than describing it as overtly sexual). Then she can tell you whether it is her mother's usual way of behaving, which will take some worry from you; if it is not usual, then she can say something to her mother. Her mother will hopefully realise where your loyalties lie and take note.
Hope that helps. Good luck

MY F****** STEPMOTHER READ MY DIARY AND NOW SHE KNOWS I HATE HER TO DEATH! Help?



My stepmother was in my room as usual and she found my diary and now knows I hate her to death. She can go to hell for all I care, if I had a car, I would run her a** over. She’s a gold-digger, she’s a slutt she’s a whore and she’s plotting to dominate my motherfuckin a** all over the damn house when my dad dies. I’m barely 15 years old and my dad’s very sick. My stepmother and her daughter will stop at nothing to get rid of either of us: My dad and me. My dad’s clueless about this and thinks I’m lying. These girls are backstabbing bitches, they’re manipulators, liars. I wanna see both of these bitches dead tonight. If I had a gun I will shoot their asses to hell. These bitches will pay for their mistakes, they’ll pay.



What do I do, I’m scared for my a** on what’s going to happen if I attempt worst because I will.

remember you journal is a legal document. so anything that she does that is shady you can write.... but she will read and you dont want her on to you. so my best bet is to lock it up with some dead bolt in a bin or something. i used to tell my dad off in my diary because i knew he would read it. he used to get mad at me and confront me but she gets what she diserves. just dont write that you want to kill her in there.... that might not look good if you all go to court. sorry and good luck!!!

She probably already knew you don't like her, so don't be too concerned.  She shouldn't be reading your diary anyway.



However, you need help and you need it immediately. You should talk with one or all of these people, RIGHT AWAY. 
1) a counselor at school
2) a priest or minister
3) a mature relative that you trust
4) tell your dad you need to speak with a therapist right away

Nobody is allowed to hurt you  (and you can't hurt anybody either).  DON'T do anything that you will regret later. Especially, don't do anything violent, don't get pregnant and move in with your boyfriend, don't steal from her, etc.)



She could vanish you from the house if you do that.  Instead talk to people who can understand your feelings and help you.

Ok, first of all calm the god damn down!

Threatening violence and murder is pretty awful and will make you look bad and those two girls like victims, do you want that?

You should confront her and let her know she has NO right whatsoever to read your diary or go through your things, no matter how angry your words are. Even if you talk about harming them (I hope its just anger and not real !) . Explain to her that it may seem like you want to kill her but you're just letting off steam. Tell her you dislike her and why and tell her to leave you the hell alone!

That woman has no right to go through your belongings if i was you i'd have a huge go at her for it (without the violence...)



I think you might also want to check into to a psychologist for anger management and learning how to let off steam without taking it too far.



Don't hurt anybody! Go for a run, buy a punching bag and stick a picture of her face on it if you prefer but for gods sake don't sink so low as to harm another human being, no matter how much of a whore she may be.

You guys are asses if you think what your put down as a answer if funny.

Your dad doesn't believe you right? If your step-mom and her daughter talk about how they want to get rid of you, and your dad, then you need to get proof. Hide a tape recorder in their room or something, or hide it on yourself, and talk them into bad-mouthing you.

Hopefully you get the proof, and your dad comes to his senses and divorces your step mom or something.

But do they really do that? If you've never heard them say anything like that, then you have no right to say that. But if they have, and you know it, then do what I stated above.

just calm down ,if you do something stupid you are just playing into their hands and that's what they want ,watch your step sweetie cause it could come back and bite you,and then your step-mom will get what she wants just avoid her if you can and don't write any more in your diary or if you do ..pour it on about how bad you feel that she thinks you really hate her and you really didn't mean it etc. because odds are she's going to read it again and maybe even show it to your dad so you don't want to look like the bad guy in all of this .you don't want her to convince him to send you away .also if your dad is sick you should try not to upset him just spend as much time as you can with him and love him

For some strange reason mothers have a bond with their sons no matter if they like it or not, no woman is good enough for him, prob because women know what they are like.



All you can do is talk to your partner and try if you can to continue your relationship on your own 2 company 3 a crowd.  I would not bother making a fuss and try really hard, why should you, be who you are and all you can be.

She's probably finding it difficult to let her little boy grow up, some mothers get very protective over their sons if they seem to be putting a girlfriend first. Best thing to do is try and keep yourself out of any situation involving your boyfriend and his parents and hope if they don't see you often they'll lighten up, enjoy the time with your boyfriend instead and let them see you're serious about each other and they should come round in the end. It's not an easy position to be in but may improve with time, my fella's mum did the same thing but 8 years on we're actually pretty close, only time and perseverance can really tell on this one, I wish you all the best.

does it really matter if his parents dont like you?
as long as you love each other then youll be fine. unless youre madly in love with each other and then you get separated if you go to different unis. in which case you could change both youre lives by going together even if youre prospects are completely different
good luck.

Older generation - how do you cope being the older generation.  I mean without your folks, other loved ones ?



etc?  I am 32 and today I am just having a really lousy day (not like me normally I am so cheery!) and as daft as it sounds, the thought of being older (not the older but the other things that come with it) and not having my folks, the world having changed radically, knowing more people dead than living etc etc all really scares me.



I just wondered how older people cope with these inevitable stages of life?  Especially in a society where age is not respected and all your experience is not always appreciated?

I understand your feelings. When I was 32 turning 50 scared the crap out of me. But this year I turned fifty and its great. I get to spoil and spend the time with my grandchildren that I didnt get to do while raising my own kids. I have so much time to do the things I didnt have the time or the money before. Lots and lots of me time and me and hubby time. As far as losing the people you love, I have the closest relationship Ive ever had with my dad because I treasure and appreciate every moment we have together.  Yes you may get a little slower as you get older but you also start to see the world with new eyes. Im having the time of my life. Im more relaxed and in touch with myself then I ever was in my thirties. And the people in my life dead and living are more precious to me then ever.

old age is difficult to handle I agree. but you are 32, dont
start worrying about 60. Live your life today, today is
present, yesterday past, tomorrow is dream. Live the life
of today. do your duties and enjoy life reasonably. 
Thinking about life after another 30 years is not wise.
Present is valuable, live it up.

With age comes wisdom.  Small irritations are insignificant. Our experience taught us we can't always have our way so we have to look at aging and dying as another step in life. But we have also learned to enjoy things that at one time we were too busy to enjoy. One thing that has helped me is getting into genealogy. Just looking at my ancestry brings them back to life and I am just a part of a chain.

Age really is just a number.  If you keep a positive outlook and never stop trying to learn and see new and different things you can keep your life exciting to you.  The pain of lost loved one can be painful and life without them is often lonely but even younger generation members feel pain and are lonely at times.  I suppose what I want to tell you is that life is life  I am 56 hopefully not as old as you were directing this question but I find life goes on in the same way.  The things you have to do change, I no longer need to think about school or homework for myself or my children because they are now grown.  I continue to do the things I always enjoyed and have learned that  we can live very full and very happy lives even if we spend a lot of time alone.  Old friends linger and those now gone remain in memory but in learning and doing new things new friends come into your life.  They do not replace the old but they are the friends of now.  If you keep you mind and heart in the now you can live happily at any age, if that is what you want to do.

Happy Birthday Smiley. Being old is great, no more work. Seen it all before so nothing much frightens me. Sad when friends die 3 of my friends have died in their 50s. Lovely to have the grandchildren then send them home. Time to stop and watch the flowers grow, go on answers or read a book. Planted lots of veg this morning. As you get older you can always make new friends, lots of clubs to join,. Don't care if my experience is not appreciated, each generation must learn their own lessons. We will be getting a fuel allowance at Christmas, yippee, will spend it on gin and wrap a blanket around my toes. Don't be scared grow old disgracefully like me. xx

I really understand your question, I used to wonder that myself. I know the answer now that I am sixty. Life evolves, it is ever changing and one cannot stop it, life and death is just a natural cycle. Yes it is hard losing the ones you love but, of course, we have a lot more lovely memories at this age which helps.It sounds very banal now but when younger I absolutely loved to dance and I worried that when I got older I would not be able to dance like I did, I need not have worried because, thank goodness, I don't want to dance as much!!! As for my experience well, in my family it is appreciated hence I am always baby sitting for several of my 10 grandchildred as I brought my 4 up on my own, my kids seem to think I know it all!!!!!! Keeping young inside is a must, I manage to do that but it gives one more of a shock when one looks in the mirror. LOL. So worry not my dear, and enjoy your birthday

I need some advice, from a Mum?



I wish I could write only a small piece here but it's a slightly long story. Ok... my Mum died in November last year, very suddenly, leaving behind myself (21) my sister (24) and my Dad (52). Very soon after she passed, I took on the roles of my Mum, cooking cleaning washing ironing etc, mainly because I knew my Dad and sister wouldn't have a clue what to do. Soon after my college work was failing and I told my Dad I needed some more help, so my sister then took care of the washing and ironing, I still do cooking cleaning shopping pay bills etc. So all was well then my sister moved out, and I done all of my own things, and my Dad's when need be. I got on very well, my house was always clean, washing always up to date etc, and I enjoyed that but hated living alone. I then got a puppy whom I adore and my sister moved home so we decided to share the responsibilities with both the dog and the house. The thing is that now my sister keeps on about how little I do around the house and I am lazy and all this, what she doesn't realise is that she wouldn't eat if it weren't for me, she probably wouldn't have her car, and most certainly wouldn't have a roof over her head as for a long time we had trouble paying bills after Mum's death and I was the one who took care of it. I wish my family could see and appreciate what I do for them, I hardly have any nights out because I have people and a house to look after yet I took a night 'off' last night and went out, and because I havn't gotten dressed my sister thinks I'm lazy, even although I have done the dishes, looked after the puppy, cleaned, and prepared and cooked tea, she has worked for 2 hours and walked the dog so she thinks she has done more, I need some motherly advice... my Mum was the only person my family ever listened to and I desperatly need to say something to make them change, and realise just how much I do, my Dad isn't here just now but doesn't really give a damn anyway, he's too interested in his new girlfriend.. sorry to have gone on so much but it just upsets me so much so that my hair has stopped growing and is about 15% grey... I need some good advice please x

I think you need to tell your sister to get her own place and stand on her own two feet. You've been there for her and done all you can but she cannot expect you not to have a life now. You had to grow up quick when your mum died (sorry to hear that) but that doesn't mean that your sister should take advantage of you and call you lazy. She's 24 and needs to do her own thing. Sorry to sound harsh x

People never notice the things you do until you don't do them. Try and get away for a few days maybe you can visit relatives or a friend they will see how much you do for them. I'm a mum and my hubby occasionally calls me lazy and I pointed out that it wasn't the washing fairy that puts his clean socks in the draw and that if i went on strike he wouldn't last a week.

you are young and need to live a life for u also. Your family is being selfish big time. I am a mom though my kids are younger but i too lost my mom at 55 I needed her too! But faimly did fall apart on my end after she passed.I dispised my sisters for their stupid way of thinking and how they only looked out for self.But i learned to stop doing everything and worrying about everyone! Do your share and then let them pick up the rest don't enable them to just do nothing.Tough Love! you can't do everything u know that go have fun without guilt u deserve it and tell your faimly to either reconize or ur done with it! Your going to be ok really! And stop thinking so had about it all relax!

I'm sorry that you lost your Mum. It sounds like you've done an amazing job holding your family together, even though it was a truly difficult time. I know, I lost my Dad and you can hardly find the energy to move for a few months. So, as a Mum here, you've done so well and your own Mum would be very very proud of you.



Here's a simple solution for you. People just aren't listening to you. I could just smack them for you. Write a list for 2 days of everything that you do and all of the bills you've paid.  They'll be stunned. Stick it on the fridge as a reminder also. Every time your Sis fires up, point it out to her. With your Father, I think he's dealing with things by hiding. If you have to, tell him unless he chips in- you quit. And mean it.

Hugs from a Mum.

Being a mother is a thankless task and unfortunately you do not even have the benefit of seeing your "child" grow up. I suggest you  move out of the house and make your own life. Your father's new girlfriend can take over the cleaning of the house and see how long that will last. The dog is a bit of a problem. I wonder why your sister moved back in: maybe after some time on her own she realised it was cheaper to stay at home and have someone else skivvy for her. Sorry to sound so negative.

You are taking on far too much responsibility in the house.  It sounds like your father needs to step up to the plate and take back his responsibilities.  It is very admirable that you helped so much and continue to do so.  But you also have a life that you are missing out on because you are taking care of your family.  Consider getting your own place for a while so that you can focus on taking care of yourself and the other members of your family can learn to take care of themselves as well.  Good luck to you.

three adults live in a house, all three work/attend school and have their right to a social life and friends and free time. I'm so sorry this has happened to your family. I know you want to do the right thing by your mum and look after everyone, but remember, your mum loved you and did these things for you because she wanted you to be happy and suceed in life. she would to hate to think of you being unhappy now. you have a much right to have a life as your dad and your sister. You need to put up a rota of cleaning duties and chores, that are split equally and fairly, not you doing the lions share, or daily arguments about what each of you have done on a separate day. you all have the right to laze about in your pj's and do nothing once in a while. It sounds to me that you are overstretched and you know it. From now on, do a third of what needs done in the house, nothing more, nothing less. If a rota's up and something needs done, you can simply say, 'Ive done all my chores today, Im going out with my mates. You do not have to look after a house or your dad and sister. You are a daughter and a sister. Not a mother. If, shudder at the thought, i was to pass before my children I would be heartbroken if one of them wasnt given the care and support and opportunity to do what they wanted to do, because they had to fulfill my role. When will it end, are you going to live at home and take care of your dad for ever? What about marriage and kids? Im sorry, Im not being mean, just trying to play devils advocate. At the age you and your sister are, you should have had a family dynamic that meant everyone pitched in anyway. Time to teach that dad of yours how to load the dishwasher, lol. You are important too, don't forget that. You should draw up a rota, get them to help, and just say it's to stop the arguments between you because you don't want to argue with them. And split the bills in three, if your sister cant afford to live their, then tough, she needs a new job. ((HUgs))

First of all you are all grieving for your mum, each in your own way, even if it doesn't look like that, the process takes around two years before you have acceptance.



It sounds as though your way of dealing with things was to take over from her, keep the house nice and look after the family just as your mum had done, and now you're being taken for granted.

Maybe you can get the family together and work out a fair division of jobs. Tell your dad and sister that it's going to be difficult to take over all the stuff your mum did, but that you all have to work together to keep the family and the home going, for all your sakes. After all, your sister is older, and should take the lead.

A few days away and a chance to recharge your batteries and have some time for yourself would be a good idea. Is there anyone you could visit, or anywhere you can go, just for a short breather?

As your dad isn't at home a lot perhaps you should suggest to your sister that you both look after yourselves and have a rota for doing the cleaning of the house.  You both do your own cooking, washing, ironing, bedrooms but agree who will do the cleaning of say the living room and bathrooms.  As you bought the puppy say that you are happy to take responsibility for it, unless she wants to take him for a walk but it is up to her and she should not try to get out of the housework just because she has taken the dog for a walk.
Alternatively see if you can find a place of your own.  Although it will be lonely at least you will only have your own mess to worry about.  I think you have done really well so don't let your sister and dad get you down.

I agree, it's so wrong.  Sometimes the most innocent question gets answered with vile insults from morons.  I think these people are called "Trolls".  They do it to see the effect.  What idiots.

I have been victim a few times myself and it did actually really get to me.

The best thing you can do in my opinion is report these idiots.  they are acting against the rules.  You can also block these people from answering your own questions.

Some very serious questions from some very worried people can be posted on Answers, they have enough to deal with already.

So who-ever you saw violating the rules, I hope you reported them. xxx

Not all the questions asked require help so to say. They require a harsh comment to make them actually think about what they had the nerve to ask in the first place.

You also have to relaize that not everyone that uses this site or another are using it for the good, they abuse it and those are more than likely the ones you do not like the answer to.

Hi,



I on the fence on this one.



Don't get me wrong some people can take the mick and be insulting to someone posting for advice, however ...

Sometimes the person may be posting a post that is so fairytale or insulting and sometimes as a person giving advice you let your emotions and anger come out at the person posting silly unbelievable messages.

Also sometimes you need to be cruel to be kind - people sometimes need to hear the blunt truth even if it is very painful to hear.



If people don't like others to critise them or comment on them or their situation then they have a choice.



If they don't want to be under scunity then they shouldn't post on these boards as people will be honest, that the whole point of Yahoo Answers.



It for others to comment and although I have come across some great advice, most of the best advice is from someone being blunt honest with me which is what I have needed.



Just my opinion.

Ok I always have to do everything around the house which isnt fair on me as I have school work to do.

My parents always blame things on me but most of the time it's my brother.



They have accused me of being anorexic cos i dont eat much at meal times. But i'm not im just trying to watch what i eat.

I feel so angry sometimes with them that i self harm, it just makes the pain drift out of me. I have tried talking to them but they say im stupid and shouldnt go against them.

What can I do?

You really need to talk to your family. Point out that now you're at an age when you are getting a lot more school work to do at home you just can't cope with that and housework too. You need an outlet for all your anger too, maybe you could take up some kind of physical activity to de-stress a bit? If your parents continue to call you stupid you may need to seek support from school or from a relative such as a grandparent. It sounds as though you have been cast as the family scape goat, and it really has to stop.

What would you assume if?



your "other" half made plans to go with you to a football game. After constant relations you expect it after the game, and it was somewhat chilly out but she was dressed into alot of thick clothes and then only let u make out with her in your car for alittle bit and said she was on her rag and not feelin good. Then she left and u called her and she talked for maybe 5 minutes and said she was going to sleep. Then the next day tells u her mom and daughter werent home. But then the next weekend supposedly gets into a fight with her mother about taking care of her kid, and ignores u that night and will only text u... and then a week later breaks up with you.....saying your "too attached"

To her you wanted too much.  To you she did not want enough.  Looks like you two were not on the same page or the timing is off.  Besides she has a kid she should be taking care of, instead of giving some dude attention.  I would not read into it too much, but I would consider how you treat a woman as far as what you want and how much you want from them.

umm woah. i can see why she broke up with you.. you read into things way too much.

first off, if she went to a football game without you - big deal, its healthy to do things seperately once in a while.

secondly if she was on her rags then that is a good enough reason not to do anything other than kiss you in the car.

Thirdly she left and you called her? Like straight away after she left? Thats creepy.



Fourth - she said her parents weren't home THAT DAY - just cos they went out one day doesn't mean they wouldn't be there the next weekend... like, why wouldn't they be?



Sorry but I would break up with you too if thats what you do. Most people don't like to be smothered and you sound a little bit obsessive. People need space!

Cultural and religious differences with in-laws...?



I have a long going issue with my in-laws. I am Asian American and I married a man who was raised in a conservative, formal caucasian upbringing. I was mostly raised in an Asian culture because my mother was pretty much a single parent all of my life and that was all that she knew. I try to explain to them my culture and my religious beleifs, but they don't understand or care to WHOLEHEARTLY accept the different changes my family and I bring. They seem to always make light of my culture and relgious beleifs and think it's me trying to dominate my husband. They tend to mock my beliefs and cultural upbringing and I have shared with them that what they do hurts me and it will push me away...all they say is that "Oh we are trying to understand" but they don't. They expect me to raise my children the way they raised my husband. It really hurts and it makes me mad to think that people can't be open-minded to other cultures and religiious stand points. What am I to do?? Whenever I see them, they ignore me and just end up having dry converstations with my husband about politics and crap and never try to enjoy what I love in life. I just feel like they just care about showing off how "educated" and "well-mannered" they are when in fact I beleve that a "well- mannered and educated person" does what they can to be unselfish and make those around them as comfortable as possible. Am I wrong?

Damn, that sucks. I think that is one of the worst situations one could get into.



But then who hasn't trouble with their in-laws.



I think that you should have you husband talk to them since they wont listen to you. They may listen to him and then they may show you more respect.



But still they are conservative republicans. Its impossible to change their minds even if they know their wrong.

if you cant stand being around your hubby's relatives, tell him. he should at least protect you from the mocking of his family.



what matters is that your hubby is always there for you and is not letting you down. for as long as your hubby understands and loves you, you have nothing to worry about. he is the one you are living with not his entire family. just be happy your hubby accepted you the way your are. you have nothing to be insecure with

If you did something pretty bad then maybe she was just saying it out of anger and maybe try to get a little shock value out of you, obviously it did.  If this was over something trivial then that just sucks she said that.

First what happened before she said this to you? Second even though we are parents we make mistakes, say things out of frustration, anger etc. depending on situation.  I would hope that she did not mean it but was angry of hurt because of some situation that happenend before hand.  Let her cool off while you do the same then try to talk to her and listen.

For now, he is right.
But legally you are a major boy, you can take legal advise by meeting an Attorney.
But, how about the money for expenditure.
If you are earning and independent, then there will be no problem.
Otherwise you are under the mercy of your father, just now and till you start earning for money.

do a bit of genealogical searching first, after all you need to get the facts straight first. Once you have established which side of the family,  then write a letter to the head of the family, but as the relationship is somewhat distant, you may get a reply, but you also have to determine what exactly it is you want from them.

Should i stop talking to my bf because my parents don't like him?



i've been with my bf since i was 16, i'm now 21, however my parents especially my mum,doesn't like him, although she hasn't met him before,  she's heard things, about him, which most of them are untrue. she thinks he's not good enough for me, as he comes from a poor background, and she says he's not in my class, or on my level, and calls me worthless, and says i have no ambition for talking to him, although i've just graduated from university, and got a job. she says if i continue to talk to him still she'll have nothing to do with me, and over her dead body will i marry him.



</question>



<additional details>



i kinda know where all this is coming from, she grew up hard, and had to work hard to get where she is now. she also comes from a strict christian family, who have a tendency to dictate each others lives. however in have had enough of trying to please her cause when i told her i had stopped talking to him she still went on about, does my happiness count for anything?



She's the one who doesn't want to meet him, he wanted to from the beginning. I've meet his mother, and she treats me like one of her own.

No you should not stop. Your mother is a snob and dislikes him for reasons that she does not even know. If you give in you will be giving in your whole like. If she will disown you for being happy, I would ignore her and make yourself happy. You need to live your life for you. Only trash would call their child worthless. She is the one beneath him.

your 21, your mom has only as much influence in your life as you want her too and cannot say who you can or cannot marry or date. If your love your man then forget about what your mom says especially if she hasn't even met him. shes obviously not a very good person if she would judge someone before she met them and base it on gossip. but if she hasn't met your boyfriend that you've had since you were 16 then maybe she thinks there is a reason youve been hiding him from her all these years and that it must not be good.

Will you have another mother in the future? What u need to realize is the mother that you are talking about is the one she was dying for you, when you were a blood inside her for 9 months and she had been through a lot just to make u a very normal women in the planet of the earth as you are now. not only your mother every mother in this world have done the same . She was dreaming about smiling at you when you where in b/n her arms the best day of happiness for you before even you start to call her mom. You gone give up all of this because u like this guy?
 put your mother as apriority first and try to convince your mother it’s not about classes and money this is love and life , remind her if she was born with this money or her parents was.
 sister you are in a war between a mother that she will be there for you any time any were,  the one that you will never find one like her &gt;&gt;AND&lt;&lt; a man that you thought he will be the part of your happiness DO YOU KNOW FOR HOW LONG THAT CAN END&lt;??????????????

I can definitely relate to your situation. My parents have basically rejected any notion of even meeting my boyfriend based on the fact that they think that he's not on my level because of his background, etc. Whilst I understand that they only want the best for me, the fact that they place my financial security (which I can take care of myself, thank you very much) as a much higher priority than my happiness is an issue that I am unlikely to ever reconcile with them on. Anyway, enough about me.

Although parents will always try to do what's best for their children, they are human and as such it is possible that they will not always end up doing what actually is best. Of course, you're human as well and may well be missing something they see that isn't right.

Essentially, it is up to you to take into account everyone's perspective and to make your own decision based on what you think is correct. Regardless of whether you go with what you want or what your parents want, at the end of the day, regardless of how things turn out, then it's still up to you to deal with the consequences. After all, you're the one who has the final say on what action you take.

If you're 21 and think he's the man for you, there's nothing your parents can do about it if you want to marry him.



If your mother insists on believing gossip, that's her problem. Clearly, you trying to please her is never going to work, she cannot be happy with her own lot in life so she's taking it out on you! This doesn't have to be your problem. If I were you, I would walk away from it, but make it clear to her that you are always open to talking to her, but that she must respect the fact that you can and will make your own decisions concerning your own happiness, and that you don't have to answer to her in this regard.

That'ss horrible, I really hope she gets better and Icompletelyy sympathise with you. Stay strong and make sure she has parts of her day that she really looks forward to. Bring her little treats to cheer her up. She must be even more upset than you. Try talking to her about how she feels and see if there's anything she wants to do before these 6 months are up. But plenty of people get told they have 6 months to live and go on to live way longer. People can beat cancer so stay with her and make sure she stays strong. She cant do this without you all so make sure she knows your with her and you are there for her. I really hope she will be fine and I'll be thinking of her

You have some tough questions, but you're asking all the right ones. Pretending something didn't happen when it did is just denial. You're facing up to an awkward situation so do your best to deal with it. If you can handle the circumstance with maturity, then the parent in question should be able to. Seems to me you are ready to do this thing with grace and dignity. Forgive mistakes of others and don't hold it against the innocent ones. You would want to be treated the same.

All of the feelings you mentioned would be happening. I would not mention it to the parent who doesn't know they were cheated on. I would be curious to see or meet my 1/2 sibling too but until you talk with the parent who did this I would keep this to myself. Get all the information first

Helpful Feedback for decision making?



My spouse is interested in joining a religious tour to Italy. I agreed to it although I am not too keen because of the cost and time issue. My spouse has been concerned how this trip is going to affect his job since he will be out for 10 week days. He had never been out of his job that long and there will be a project going on during the10 days he will be out from work. We have been holding on to commit to this trip over the last month, and tomorrow is the last day for us to decide whether we should commit or not. I personally am not too keen of going to the trip, but my spouse wanted to go, but with mixed feelings. Something is telling me that this may not be a good time for us to be going for a trip like this, but I feel like I have to go through it because I don't want to let my spouse down. However, I feel that am something is pulling me back and can't seem to make any kind of decision. Has anyone ever in this situation and can share advice as you may think is best to do? Would it be a good idea to go or not? Thanks.

from what your writing yes it is not a good time he is risking his job, and your future chances at trips like this there is always next year. to tell you the truth at this point in time traveling abroad as an American is not a keen idea any way just watch the world news and what euro's think about americans.



Save it for next year where you can plan this properly and not worry so much he will understand.

I just found out today that my DAD IS NOT MY REAL DAD!?



I’m 23yrs old and I just found out today by my mom…that that guy I taught all this yrs to b my dad…is not my real dad.  My mom had an affair with my uncle… (his wife’s is the sister of my fake dad) anyways I guess back then my dad used to beat up my mom n stuff n my biological dad was always after my mom…so one day when my fake dad beat her really bad she went out grocery shopping and they ended up having sex…I guess they continue seeing each other n having sex for a couple of days…n then my mom got pregnant with me.. Anyways I’m not sure how I feel now...all this yrs I been living a lie…my real “dad” is my uncle n he has 3 daughters n 2 sons…who I taught were my cousins but I guess their my half-brother/sisters…I don’t really keep in touch with them even though we live in the same city. Now that I know the true nothing really  changes for me bc am going to keep seeing my dad as my dad cuz he raise me like his daughter n only of my sisters know this..the others ones don’t know it but I know they would still love me n care for me the same way as they have always have but I don’t want them to know…bc I don’t want them to think bad of my mom…I don’t blame my mom for having done what she did..bc I believe everyone has to live their own life’s n only GOD can judge then. Well my Biological father has like 3 houses n has giving a house to all his sons….should I ask for anything to? I probably won’t cuz I want nothing to do with him…to me his still just the uncle who I never talk 2 or c. Well I would like to hear some feedback on this.. tnx *_*

Tnx everyone 4 ur answr.. so far, Oops my bad I said I was 23..I'm 22..anyways next month I will turn 23..anyhow.....My mom only told me this bc me n my sis insited her on telling us the true...bc we have anothe sis that is not my dad's (fake dad's) but he know my mom had her when they got married...n last yr my mom had another afair so me n my sis wanted to know if any of us had a difrent dad too...my fake dad doesn't know about me not bing his...n my mom said she's very sure Im "my uncles" n yes my biological dad know's the true...honestly I don't care if his my dad or not I'm going to leave things that way they r am never going 2 asking 4 anything but if one day he was to offer me money/house I would prob take it but I don't want him as a dad or anything...I also plan on doing a DNA test in the future just 2 b sure.

My god I don't know what to tell you. It depends mostly on how you feel. But I think you are old enough to realize that at least your mother waited long enough to let you know. I would have done the same thing. Everything else its up to your conscience.

Just keep loving your dad your biological dad is not your real dad. Your mother made up for her stupid behavior of her youth by marrying your father and giving you a secure and loving life that made you who you are today. You will have your own children one day and your dad not bio day deserves to be their grandfather. Bio dad should have offered you a house, like he did for his kids; he obviously doesn't think of you as one of them.

Well you've got to get this sorted because whether you like it or not it will haunt you until you know the truth.  Why did your mom suddenly decide to tell you.  Does she really know who your dad is or does she just think she knows.  Also does your Uncle Dad know he has another child?.  Why not try and get a DNA test done.

Don't let this take over your life because I think one way or another we're all related.  Don't ask for a house, but if in the future he offers you one, say yes please and thank you very much.

I'm not sure where to start, but I think there are deeper questions to worry about other than should you ask your bio dad for a house.

My first concern is WHY did your mother play this horrible trick on you?  Why did she wait till you were TWENTY THREE to tell you the truth?  Is she really for sure who your REAL father is or is this just her feelings?  Does your stepfather (fake) know about this trick?  Does your bio (real) father know about this trick?

At this point, it's up to you if you want to re-establish a relationship with your bio, but personally I would let things remain as they are after this long.

good for you you didnt judge your mom. everybody's got reasons for doing what they did. if you think your dad doesnt know about it or your mom told you he actually doenst know, knowing your dad, do you think he'll curse your mom for lying to your so-known dad all those years? you think your dad can handle it? if you think your relationship with your sibs will change because of it you may not as well let them know.

Two Questions 1. Do you think she still sees him and 2. Half sister?



Question 1. Do you think Mum still sees him all this time? Well before 7-8 years ago Mum met this man named Sid I only saw him in mornings in bed with her (this was ages ago not happening now) and was really furious because I know he is the reason Dad left because of him and hate him but never shew it. But six years ago mum met this boyfriend (Sid idnt her boy just 'play mate') his name was Paul he loved her and had a child named Jenna who is four now. And I remember one year Mum was constantly texting him (Think last year actually) and I am wondering, Do you think she still text him? All this years of contact ... What can I do to make sure? =) Thanks

Question 2 - Okay this is a bit upset for me. I want my mum ex boyfriend (only here to see jenna his four year old daughter) to stop arguing with my Mum. How can I stop this? It isnt nice for jenna the last fight between them what happened paul strangled mum and threw comp montitor) and Jenna was upstairs thankfully and mum came

the best you can do for her is to try and give her all the love you can and always tell her you love her and will always be there for her ,keep her out the way when the arguments start cause she dont need to see that and if he has come to see her then thats what he sould do tell your mum to go out and you will stay with them so nothing happens to her so then the time jenna has with her dad is happy times not bad cause she will remember one day and she will hate both mum and dad for it . i have a half sister but as far as i am concerened she is just my sister and i kept her from that sort of thing aswell and now i am 36 and she is 23 and we are the best of mates and we are always there for each other we would do anything to help each other out

Can a child be put into foster care if .......?



Hi there,

My little cousin has just had a child at 13 yeah i know ok its young. But social services are trying to put her and the baby into foster care because i think her dad is unsuitable.



Can they do this even though my aunt has a three bedroom house with only one son so there is a bed room free and she is willing to take my cousin and the baby in. Now they have money and her house is spotless but social services wont even come to the house to give her a chance.

So can they still put my little cousin into foster care without her consent and her parents consent and my aunty wants to take her and the baby in.



It will tear our family apart if she gets put into foster care i mean i am actually crying typing this. please help does anyone know anything.

Thanks xx

They were supposed to come today but instead they went to the hospital and tried to get my little cousin to sign forms to put her and the baby into foster care. I mean can they do this



I forgot to mention my aunt has had 4 children of her own so its not as if she cannot raise my cousin and her baby.

Social services will not put the baby in foster care unless they fear the child is at risk. In my own experience CPS visited my daughter and they tried to be pushy but lucky for my daughter she has me to fight for her and explain to them that I did not care if my daughter wanted the baby or not I was there to be her mother. They are very intimidating so just tell your aunt she needs to be very short and let the worker know what the child's plan will be and why it will be safe. That is their job and if they given a plan and it appears safe there is nothing they can do. The child belongs with her mother so don't stress it will be ok. Tell your aunt not to be intimated by the worker just to be straight forward and she will be gone. Trust me I have already been through this and everything went fine.

You need to contact a family lawyer.  Your aunt needs to get custody of the baby.  Yes they can remove them if they find probable cause to. A  13 yr old having a baby sounds like abuse to me.  At the least child neglect and endangerment.

If another member of the family TURNS UP TO COURT, when Social services request permission to take the child, you can appeal to take the child instead, as you are family and more suitable for contact with parents etc, and you can provide a caring home in the family.



If they won't come and check...try to file an complaint with the "Higher Ups" in social services.
Xxx

And BTW....BEWARE OF SOCIAL SERVICES:

They can twist things so bad that they make you the bad guys...KEEP YOUR COUSIN AWAY FROM THEM. And the father! And look up the underage rape thing, make sure they can't get him on that.

Get a pastor, I mean a strong experienced pastor who is filled with the Holy spirit not just anyone to help you and also consider a lawyer.  You might want to get a lawyer now, but even better, ask the pastor to recommend one for you if you can.  I mean if he knows him I think the chances might be better.  Pray first.  prayer works wonders.

actually yes they can even if they have tons of room it won't matter if the state find that the legal guardians aren't suitable then they have the power and the will to make sure that child is safe,not to say that she isn't but , my advice is too show that they are and that it was not there fault!

I had a friend go through something similar. I know that if the children were in danger the social worker would normally contact family members first and try to find placement for the children. If they don't contact relatives before they take the kids to foster care, what happens is they go to family court and they usually come up with a home plan there. So if they go to court make sure that your aunt knows about it and shows up because they will ask for family members that they can stay with.Try to have as much family support as possible at the court. Maybe even have your aunt get a few character letters to help out. After finding someone willing to take the kids in, they will come to their home to make it is suitable for them to stay there. I think they will also do a background check on everyone who lives in the home. Good luck!

Well foster care people favourite job is to get a hold of someones child when they can do so, luckily for them they have the law on their side so no matter how emotionally a family is attached to a child and how willing and supportive the family will be to the baby as long as social services have an opportunity to gain access to your little cousin they won't stop. Fact is they will probably make sure they will get your cousin. Ignoring your appointments are apart of getting your little cousin, if you say something wrong in other words rude, offencive they will use it on you so be careful; because your are war with them.

Does any one know how i can get over it and move on?



emotionally I've reached a dead end. i am just so full of anger resentment and pain from something that happened months ago towards my family, ive tried to move on, to forgive and get over it but its not working, i don't love my mum the way i used to. shes done so much for me when i was younger i should be able to forgive this i normally am quite good at forgiving but i just cant. and she gets angry 'cos she can tell i don't love her any more, i've tried pretending tried looking at things from her perspective tried spending more time with her but its not working im 18 years old and im not going to stay at home for much longer i cant its unbearable i just don't want to leave and burn all my bridges i really want what i had back again the nature of my family has always been violent but its never been so scary does anyone know what i can do?

Sometimes it's a little bit hard for parents to watch their little girl grow up. In a violent or abusive environment I think you need to remove yourself from it. When your angry you can't think straight and the mistakes you make now could profoundly affect your life. If you decide that you need to move out keep your options open, perhaps move in with another family relation or a friend maybe even a room or shared rental accomodation, but avoid long term contracts because your situation could change again. If you choose a relative be aware that your parents ( mother ) will probably have a falling out with them too!! If you can get a job then you will feel a lot better about yourself in terms of independence. Then after some time let your mother know that your'e happy with the way your situation has changed and I'm sure she'll come to the party, after all you'll always be your mother's daughter. Time is a great healer and can fix most problems if you let it. Good luck.

Can any stay at home mothers help me with this please?



Can anyone tell me if they are a stay at home mother who prefers to shower etc after returning home from taking their child to school. Is this a less stressful way of doing things rather than getting up really early to shower, get yourself ready etc and then still have to get the child ready and to school on time. Am I making life harder for myself than it really needs to be by doing it the way I do? Should I be taking advantage of the fact that I'm not working and that I don't have to go to work straight after the school run? What do you think?

Yes, why put more stress on yourself when you do not have too.  The shower can wait until you can come back home and have more time.  You can spend those few extra minutes in the morning with your child instead of in the shower.

It is better if you get up early and get ready for the day before you take the kids to school. Then you are ready for the day. Treat it like a job, you may be more efficient throughout the day.

I am a stay at home mom of 3 boys and I have one in school. I honestly hate to wake up early. In my opinion it depends on what you like to do. I feel that you do not have to be all dressed up and ready to take your children to school. Especially if you are just going home after that. That way you can focus on getting your children ready then after you get home you can spend more time on your self instead of having to rush like crazy to get all of you ready. I feel unless you have something really really important to do or to go to after you drop your kids off you should just wait. I like to clean house before I shower also so I even wait until that's all done. I hope this helps.

I think it would be easier to have a shower while you are having "me time" with the kids in school.
I havn't got to the school run years yet so I have to jump in the shower whenever I get the chance (mum to 7 month old)
You must be super mom if you can dress, feed and tend to kids early in the morning AND have time to take a shower.  wow don't be so hard on yourself!

hi, im mostly a stay at home mum tho i do do occasional days work.  i think i would wait till u get back gives u more time to get things ready for the kids with less stress.  i make sure i put their uniform out each night before i go to bed (i have 3 kids) and make their drinks etc ready for their lunch so in the morning i dont have to worry, i also try to make sure the kids are ready 10 mins before we are due to leave so that if theres a last minute problem or something they have forgotten they need then we stil have plenty of time.  on days when i work i follow the same routine but get up 1/2 hr earlier so i am ready before i get them up.

hi , ive been a stay at home mum now for the past 15yrs, i have 4 children, 15, 10, 5,and 4. Basically you do whatever works best for you. I myself get my bath/shower after the school run, because i dont have to go to work,and also so i can have it in peace. I have everything ready for the morning , the night before, ie; all uniforms layed out, breakfast table ready, pack-ups done, that way we are all organised and calm( no one is at his/her best first thing on a morning)and when i take them to school(dressed in jeans and t-shirt and coat)i kiss them all good bye tell them i love them and hope they have a good day. I believe this is a good stress free start to a day, i witness many mum's shouting at their kids going into school,and it must be on their little minds all day that mum was cross!. Then like you do , i go home and have my bath/shower and get myself ready stress free for the day ahead.

Does anyone else have a sibling that they share little physical/personality traits?



I'm asking this because I have one younger brother (he has always looked than me older from when he was aged 15). He is 6ft1, has poker straight dark blonde hair, blue eyes ,olive skin doesn't like reading, is a confirmed meat eater, doesn't like theatre , is good at art and DIY.

I'm 5ft 4 and a half , look younger than 36, have light skin  with freckles on my nose and cheeks, hazel eyes and brown wavy hair, I like to read and act and I am a vegetarian.

I'm convinced there was a switch in the Hospital, he was the only male baby and I'm sure that there is a fluffy haired woman of 5ft 5 ish with brown/hazel eyes aged almost 34 wandering around Newcastle !!

The switch thingie was a little 'Andielep' humour. Mum told me when I was 10 years old that the baby was a boy straight away 'cos I harped on a lot about this then . I kept asking her if SHE was sure that she had gotten the right baby!!

there isn't a switch in the hospital because I truly believed that I was given to the wrong mother!  I look like my English/Germanic father.  She looks very much Native American.  My late husband had dark eyes and hair and I have very pale skin with dark eyes and auburn curly hair.  Our son came out with blond hair and blue eyes.  My marriage broke up because DNA wasn't as advanced then as it is now. My siblings all look very different and we do not have much in common.  they love southern California and I love my lovely home in Alaska.  They can't handle the sub zero weather.  I am much tougher amd more athletic.  they are fat and sedate.  I love them, but I do tell them to go on diets and quit eating themselves to death!

With the drastic differences in physical appearances between the two of you, there is one other thought maybe your mom might have had a little thing with someone else?  Just a thought.

I heard of this and thought it's cute. Have the doctor write it down and seal it in an envelope. Make a nice dinner and then at the right moment bring out the envelope and you get to find out together at the same time. Another idea would be to buy some stuff in a theme, such as football outfits or a ballerina dress and wrap it up and have him open it. He would be able to tell from the outfits what sex your baby is. Congrats :)

Awkward discovery?...?



[this story might not be suitable for younger people.. :/ idk?] hello.. okay so my dad, he's always been really protective of his laptop. he bought a new one just a couple months ago or so, and before that one he had another that he was very protective of as well. i thought this was completely normal, because he uses it for work, always, and obviously he wouldn't want anything on it to get messed with... so basically the laptop is off-limits. and ive respected that completely. but there's been this family friend staying at our house for about a week now, hes 49, and ive been taught that you HAVE to do everything that you are asked to do by a person that's older than you, [im 15.] so one day he asks me to look up ... on my dad's laptop.... a website for some car website, or something.. and i cant say no- because mom said i have to do everything im asked.. so he told me to check the "favorites" list.. and i do... and i found a whole bunch of websites on my dad's list that just made me want to cry.. i was clicking through the links to see if any of them were the website he was talking about... and a couple, i assumed, just by the title of the websites: "XXX PORNO" .. etc , etc.. and .. i mean.. its my dad, i immediately felt this really awkward feeling in my chest. i dont know, i found about 3-4 of these between the other websites, i didnt click any of them, but i mean its obvious that my dad's been watching porn. and that makes me think well, maybe THAT'S also why he was so protective of his laptops; maybe because he didnt want me to run across them. obviously not. and you see i feel so guilty, but still not at fault, because i didnt mean to stumble across them... i also saw that there was a website on .. some.. quitting smoking stuff; which made me proud... but ever since then ive had trouble just looking at my dad, i feel really awkward. i dont know, is this normal? im not really sure how to digest what happened i guess. and i havent told my mom or anything, nor my older sister, because i know for a fact my mom is unaware of this. i dont know what to do, because i feel uncomfortable just walking around my dad at this point. it's just a strange thing to think about. what should i do, if anything? i love my dad to death, really, but this is just .. strange. :/



</question>



<additional details>



ive noticed other strange things about my dad as well.. just some months ago i found a pipe with a ziploc of weed next to it in the kitchen drawer.. i dont know, im rather worried that something's changing about my dad. my dad is extremely faithful to my mom, so im not trying to imply that he has any thoughts of cheating on her- cuz hes a really good person at heart.... i just, am really worried, that he might be going in the wrong direction and as his youngest daughter i just feel the need to step in and do something- or maybe im not supposed to. that's really what im trying to figure out here..

I think it's gonna create more awkwardness if your whole family knows about this so I think its best not to tell anyone else in your family. Maybe you should tell your dad what you saw and tell him he should stop looking at porn. Because this may grow into something bigger like chatting with women online or illegal porn.

Hi, hun, I know how uncomfortable you must feel but you gotta understand that your dad is a guy and  guys do this all the time, maybe there isn't a real harm in this i bet you everyone's dad has some sort of porn either on their computer, magazines, paper cut outs, they all do some stuff like that as weird as it sounds.
My dad had a lot of porn mags, too! i saw them when i was a little under 12 , i felt the same cause at that age you don't know what is normal when it comes to sex .
After i became a grown woman i became curious too.
I sometimes do watch it cause i like to be imaginative in the bedroom , =P
Try and forgive your dad, i know its hard to see him the way you used to, i know it  makes me sick to my stomach to think of my parents as sexual beings, but unfortunately  they are LOL .
Sometimes my mom wants to share stuff about her sexual life and i don't wann hear it and i am 28 , but i have to think she has noone else to share stuff with , i often tell her as a joke  that i like to think she only had sex twice in her life , when she had me and my brother , as the lord wants it LOL.

Good luck, sweetheart

porns are normal stuff of guys nowadays. the guilt feeling you are feeling now is normal since you touched something your dad prohibits. i believe your mom knows about the porn thing in your dad's laptop(these stuff are shared by couples. its just pron, be happy your dad's not cheating on your mom, well i think i cannot discuss to you things like this but i really believe your mom knows as i did with my ex). anyway, if you are bothered like you feel your a traitor or the like, talk to your big sis and tell her everything you saw, in a way it will relieve your guilt feeling coz not only you knows about the porn in your dad's laptop, your sister does too..............
good luck

Friend, your dad has a personal area into which you are not permitted to enter in.  Every person has such areas.  And it would be honorable of a good daughter like you to just protect the privacy of your parents as you would protect your own.  Don't discuss with anyone - let your dad live his life, your mom hers, you live yours.  You know very well that it is evil to watch porn - and you keep away from it.  Addiction to porn is like addiction to drinking or smoking or any other bad habit - but a more hidden one.  Pray for God to release your dad from the evil one.

As for feeling uncomfortable about walking around with your dad, I would say that if you peep into the life of every person around you (your friends, your older sisters, anybody), there will be some hidden things that stink.  Don't despise your dad for that nor mock at him.  Don't make him feel uncomfortable either.  So, just be your own good self as you have been all these years, and accept your dad as he is.  Mahatma Gandhi said, "Hate sin - not the sinner."  Keep yourself away from all those rubbish and unwanted things and thoughts, not from your loving dad and mom.  Just forget what you saw.  You will discover many such things about many loving people around you, and you have a duty and responsibility to pray them out of those evils (talk to God - He has the solution).

Remember, no man is perfect - only God is perfect.  Make God your friend and you will never be disapointed with anybody or anything in life.

Ok. First of all - I know exactly how you feel. The same thing happened to me and I didn't know what to do either. And the worst thing was that when I found that stuff I was about 17 - and he was looking up TEENAGE PORN. Really, really freaky.



Dont worry about how you looked in your dads laptop - that wasn't your fault, you weren't to know that you would find that, and if you've been raised to do what adults tell you then you did nothing wrong.

But I guess (and its really hard when it comes to your dad) that we have to realise that its kind of normal, a lot of men and women look up that stuff and even though its kind of disgusting, dads are grown men and they have the right to look at that if they want to.



I know that your opinion of your dad is changing - here you were thinking he was just protective of his work, which is kind of noble - but then you find out its not that at all.. I know its hard but as you grow up you are going to realise more and more that parents arent' the perfect people we thought they were when we were growing up. It can be heartbreaking, but I think everybody comes to this realisation at some point.



I wouldn't say anything about the porn... but if your mum doesn't know about the weed already, I would be telling her. Porn doesn't affect you as such, but your dad doing drugs will affect the whole family. Your mum needs to know about that. Quietly take her aside and alert her attention to it.



Lastly, try not to worry about it too much - although it seems intense right now i'm sure that you will look back at this in a few years and giggle.

I've been thinking about selling my piano that has sentimental value.?



When only me and my dad lived in Guam we were on a budget, but he found a way and saved up to buy me a digital piano (kawai L1). Its just a little bit damaged after about 5 years. But I have really needing the money for a car to find a job. Everyone knows that the economy is down, so I need to find more than just the jobs that are walking distance. Should I sell my piano that my dad worked hard for 5 years ago? Or should I keep it and just keep looking for a job in my area, THEN save up for car?

Family Advice. Sister in bad relationship.?



My little sister is 15. she has been going out with this boy who is also 15. From the very start i hated him. he Controls her and he also used to hit her until i told my parents. he also left me with a bruised arm. he got a kicking one night about a month ago and i was there. But the problem is that he got into a fight with my Friend the last day and i was also there. My friend said hello to my sister and he hit my friend leaving him with a nasty cut on his head. He tells my sister what to do and i never see her. but one night i asked her to go to the fair with me and me and him got into a fight. I am blamed for everything happening in their relationship. His family are not a good family either. After the fight with my friend my sister wasn't speaking to him for a while and then she started speaking to him again. I gave her advice but she says he wont listen. He cannot accept the fact that my sister has to spend time with her family and even at school she has lost all her friends because of him. I am really scared for her safety and my safety as well. She do sent understand that he is ruining her life because she hates school and has no friends. I don't know what to do. I don't want to fall out with her and im only looking out for her. Can anyone give me advice on this situation. I am only 17 but i am worried. Please help.

You definately need to go to your parents about this.  It sounds like this boy grew up in an abusive household and that's where he is learning this behavior.  Your sister needs to break off complete contact with him.  Inform the school that she attends that this boy is controling and violent twards her.  If this doesn't work, involve the police and a restraining order.

A little sibling rivalry...?



I think I put this in the wrong category last time...

I have three children, and the rivalry problems occur between the middle and youngest children, ages 7 (nearly 8) and 4 (nearly 5). My little one just started school this week. She'd been very nervous so when she got back on her first day I mamde a fuss and told her how proud I was of her (it's difficult for the parent, too, when your last child starts school!)



Anyway, my middle boy has been picking on her this week. She wanted to play a video game with him and he lashed out, making her come to me crying for comfort. He calls her a baby and argues and hits her for no apparent reason.

Anyway, I took him to one side and told him that he shouldn't hit and bully her and he told me that I shouldn't side with her all the time and that he's not a 'big boy' and wants to be cuddled, and then he stormed off in a tantrum and won't talk to me.

I'll probably have some stick for saying this, but I've always been closer and got on better with my son than both my girls. This week I've made the effort to say that I'm proud of him too and that he's a good boy looking after his sister in school. I don't feel in anyway that I'm brushing him aside.



I'd say he's jealous that he's not in the limelight this week, but I don't know how to handle the situation. If I just give in and appologise, I'll be reinforcing this jealous behaviour, yet he's tugging at my heartstrings here.

How would you go about it?

Maybe instead of just sitting her down alone you should have given her a little attention and let her know you were proud, and maybe say that you're proud, like you were on your other childrens first day of school , and i'm assuming it was the first day for all of them. Take them out for a treat (ice cream) for going back to school, it's hard for everyone on their first day back, even if they're 14.



And sometimes middle children feel a little left out. For example you feel special in someway for being the only boy or girl, the first child, the youngest child, if you don't fit into that you could feel a little jelousy.

You have created a monster :)  Just kidding, actually he has been your "baby" till the youngest came along and now he does feel jealous  and left out at times.  Recall he was about 3 when she was born, you were caring for her, feeding her, bathing, and such while he suddenly began to do everything for himself as he was now a "big boy".



Though she is your baby girl, he is your baby boy and should be looked at it in that manner, giving a little special attention to each of them but don't forget to have a little special one on one time with your eldest daughter too.  You could try having some type of special treat snack for them when they come home from school.  Taking one day at a time making that something special for who ever day it is.



It wouldn't hurt to give him a little extra love and treatment too, rather it be coming up and giving him a hug now and then letting him know how much you love him.  A little extra reward for watching over his little sister or playing together in a nice manner.



As a dad of seven 5 girls and 2 boys, having special time for each was very stressful but rewarding in the end.  The fact that he still sees himself as your little boy and wants your attention is a positive thing.  Give him a little extra time now and then, even joking or playing with him with some game or toys.  It helps and no it isn't feeding his behavior it is letting him know that being the "middle child" doesn't mean that he is left out.



Good luck and wish you the best, there are never any easy answers to being a parent.

Has this ever happened to you?



My sister and I are 10 years apart. 
I took her to a Mexican restaurant one day (we are Argentinian, so we like Hispanic food) and the waiter asked me [in Spanish] is that your daughter?



I was 17 or 18. Why would I have a 7 or 8 year old daughter. I was really offended he asked me that.



Has that happened to you? A sibling confused as your child.

by the way: I am a lot lighter than my sister. I look caucasian compared to her.



</question>



<additional details>



If she was mine, that means I was 10 when I had her! I wasn't menstruating so it's impossible.

Basically to me, he called me a whore. I'm not American, my people don't have children at that young of an age.



And at 21 years old, I am confused for being 14. So I am sure at 17 I didn't look any older.

Many times! I am the oldest sister from 5 other siblings. And when we all go out as a family, my parents sit on one table, and then all of us siblings sit on another table, and then usually a old lady or anyone will come up to me and say "your kids are so polite and behaved." I'm like "thanks, my parents taught us well." *points at parents*. Yeah, i felt kinda  offended, but then I would just let it pass, and then we would all laugh. It happens.

Why are you still dwelling on something that happened 3-4 years ago?
The waiter was probably just trying to make conversation or trying to be nice. He probably saw some resemblance between you and your sister and just assumed that she was your daughter. Not only that, you might have just looked older to him. Im sure he wasn't implying that you were a whore. I don't even how you ever came to that conclusion. I think you blew a simple mistake waaaaay out of proportion.

Relationship troubles: We are new parents?



Most of the time our relationship is really good, but lately we have been fighting a LOT. When we fight it is BAD. It usually happens when we are stressed about something, and lately it seems that we are stressed about lots of things....e.g. being new parents, in a strange city, where we do not know ANYONE.



We were in Houston which is where my entire family lives (mom, grandparents, sisters, nephews, aunts). I am 29 and have never lived outside of Houston until now. Not that I had many friends, but the friends I DO have are in Houston.



Don't get me wrong. We love our son, he is the joy and hope in our lives that makes life worth living. This is not about our son, it is about our inability to cope with the demands of the many changes/stressors that are taking place in our lives.



</question>



<additional details>



I meant to say that, we recently moved across the country, to a city where we do not know ANYONE. Yes I have tried joining "mommy" groups, but I honestly don't fit in with most of those people.



I am suffering from postpartum depression/anxiety. Sometimes I don't think he "gets it" because he yells at me when my anxiety interferes with our daily activities. Like sometimes it takes me three hours to leave the house and its not like I get dressed up or anything. I just panic and he doesn't understand that I can't help it.



I had a seriously high risk pregnancy and I am still recovering from it. I had pre-eclampsia and bp was so high I could have had a stroke. It took several months to come down and now my thyroid and blood sugar are screwed up too.



I just wish he understood the gravity of the situation regarding my health and how I was sort of "traumatized" by some of the things that happened during my pregnancy and delivery. He thinks if I am short with him that I dont love him and he doesn't understand that I can't help it. My panic attacks are getting more and more severe and sometimes I just snap. When that happens he gets hurt and calls me all kinds of names and says that I am the meanest person he has ever met, that I am the worst thing that ever happened to him, and that he wished he never met me.



Then later he will apologize and say he was just mad, but problem is now I am starting to believe him and I wonder if I am destroying his life.



Aside from marriage counseling, WHAT can I do about this? How do I make him understand what is happening to me?



We moved when my son was 5.5 months old, because his prof got transferred to another university.

Oh, Sun... I'm sorry to hear things are not going well. Piling too much on a relationship can be so tough. My hubby and I piled a ton on our plate at the same time that we got married. I won't even go into all of that, but it was ugly, believe me! We could e-mail and trade some nasty stuff I'm sure. You are not the only one who has such bad fights.
One thing I've learned is that all bets are off when it comes to family. I mean that you are always more likely to be short or ugly with them than with others BECAUSE they love you and will allow you to get away with more. (Just imagine if you talked to a co-worker like you do your hubby! THAT would get ugly!) The funny thing is that the same allowance is gone when it comes to suffering. Somehow, we never quite believe the severity of their suffering whether it be a cold or something more serious. Maybe we hear their daily complaints, so then when they have something worth complaining about, we aren't as sympathetic as we should be. 
SO....what I'm getting at here is that it might be a very useful thing for your hubby to hear from some source, other than you, what exactly is going on with all the medical problems in your life, recent past and present. (Books, internet research, a doctor, a women who has experienced it or her husband for that matter!) It might open his eyes a bit. It may also help him to REALLY know that there is some THING that is coming between you two, and it is not a lack of your love for him that makes you panic or snap at him. He may know all the facts about your condition. You may have told him a million times that it is the PPD or something else that is causing some of the tension, but it's hard to make your inner self believe it sometimes when the negative is coming from the safest person you know. Does that make sense?

About the panic attacks
When you are both calm, maybe you two could talk about what kind of situations typically bring on the attacks. Then maybe you could come up with a plan for helping ease that tension. Like if you get panicked feelings when you are getting the baby ready to go out because you are thinking of all the possible problems, clothing changes, diaper shortages, formula mixing dilemmas, etc. that could arise, then maybe you could put together bags of stuff for any and every situation to keep in both cars. And it is his job to keep them stocked and calmly brief you of their sufficient contents when you are trying to get ready so that you know it's under control. 
Find something that calms the whole family. My hubby and I love putting the kids in the car and going for a drive or heading to the mall. When we drive, we often just cruise around and look at houses (our area is growing rapidly). When we go to the mall, we take our girl to the playground and then get chocolate chip cookies. That part is routine, and then we just do what seems fun; walk, shop, play some more, eat, people-watch, whatever. It relaxes us. And, aside from the cookies and drink, both activites are free (and priceless).

About making new friends...
it gets harder as you get older. I know this to be very true. My closest friend and I were drifting and then finally had a falling out several months back. I have friends that are shared with my sister or my hubby, but I have no friends left who are mine and mine alone. I miss those. But you must keep yourself open to possibilities and don't get discouraged when they don't come quickly or easily. Adult life has, sadly, less room from growing good, strong freindships than childhood did. Cherish any connection, whether flesh and blood or here on Yahoo, or anywhere for that matter. Even if they are only shortlived.

Wow - kind of a crappy time to move just when you need your family and friends around you the most.  How about just you, going back home for a while to get some much needed help from your family and have a kind of cooling off period from your husband.  I'm going to assume you moved because of his job?  Well, he could be doing better at it I suppose if he didn't wonder if you two would get into another fight the moment you saw each other.

Maybe after a few weeks of separation you'll have both settled into your routines and can cope with the togetherness part once again.  I'm sure your parents would understand and want to help?

First you need to seek help for yourself, therapy/antidepressants, no matter what people say about them, they have saved me for the most part.Secondly sit down with your husband and do some research with him about postpartum depression and anxiety, make him understand with research what exactly it is that you are going through. Third couples therapy, especially being in a new place, you guys more than ever have to stick together and fight for what you believe in, don't let the bad come between you guys. Instead of raising your voice even though he may be raising his, talk in a normal tone, it will help the fight and help both of you to calm down and talk like adults. People say so many hurtful things in anger, just let it go in one ear and out the other, because if you keep dwelling on this it will only hurt you more than you already are.

My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family as you figure out your hard times.

Good Luck and God Bless

I went through the same sort of thing, moved to a different country and then had our first son 5 weeks later.  It's tough to have big moves and even tougher with babies.  You need help with your panic attacks, that probably isn't going to get better by itself.  It will be very damaging to all of you if you can't get this under control.  I did a few sessions with a psychologist as I was having some problems with adjustment to being a mother and the move, it helped a lot.

You probably should keep trying the mother's group thing or a toddlers library session or something.  You don't have to find a bosom buddy there but just getting yourself out will help and you will want to have playmates for your son soon.



Try to take a course or join a group for yourself.  It doesn't have to be anything heavy, just something for fun, but something that gets you out and interacting with other people.

Get a phone plan that has a good long distance rate so you can easily keep in touch with your Houston friends and family.



A digital camera makes sharing photos easy.

Remember that this has been a big change for your husband too.  It sounds like he has switched to a different university and if so he is under some stress trying to establish himself in a new environment.  But snapping at each other and calling names is not going to help either of you.  The two of you might need marriage counseling but I really think that the panic attacks need to be addressed first.

Wow, this is very similar to what happened to me. I had a high-risk pregnancy; couldn't keep anything down, including water, and wound up on an IV every weekend. The baby wound up premature due to dehydration, and when he was only about 2 or 3 months old we left my home to be nearer my husband's family. I didn't know anyone, my son wound up having colic (24 hour screams) for a year, and he didn't sleep through the night for a year and a half due to other medical problems. My husband and I fought a lot, but our son's medical issues actually wound up making us really connect. When you're up together all night "fighting the good fight," you either come together or you fray apart.

This is the crux of your issue. You really need your husband's support, and he's not providing it to you. You need to ask him at a mellow, unrelated time how he feels about you and the child in his life. You need to explain what's going on with you and explain you need him (he may feel confused and left out, and leaning on him may boost his ego). Also, if your PPD has lasted a while you need a good OB to talk it out with. Ask for recommendations or go online and google some doctors. It sounds to me like you need outside help. My hub and I went it alone, and we felt the effects for so many years we didn't have another kid till the preemie was 9!!! Best wishes.

I think your husband should intercede and get you two back on speaking terms. A double apology is in order. For the sake of your kids and their father . In the future it would be best to just roll over to keep the peace. I am not aware of your religious back ground. Prayer or meditation  could help.

It sounds like to me your mother in law is trying to play the dominance game.  I know it well.  Just act cool around her and dont talk about what happened.  You shouldn't always have to say im sorry first.  Maybe after awhile bring it up and say how silly BOTH of you acted.  That may prompt her to agree, thus, an apology.

why are you cussing out your elders?  Especially your MIL?



And, it's I am not "imam"



You know, your MIL is older than you are, and maybe she hears the way you speak and knows that you are uneducated and wants to help you.  AND, given the fact that you resort to cussing instead of using intelligent words to convey your thoughts and feelings leads me to believe that your MIL might be right.

Also honey, it's wedding not "weeding"

yes, you are experiencing a natural reaction to your loss.  It's a rough time for you, and you may feel a whole range of emotions as the time goes on.  It's not nice, but it IS normal.  You've lost the best friend you'll ever have.  We each have to go through that.

What you're going through, the not sleeping and the not eating, it's perfectly normal. You've just had a major bereavement, and I imagine you're in shock. If you're not diabetic, have a cup of strong, sweet tea, this helps with shock.

god im sorry, i no how u feel aswell i lost my mom 2 years ago aswell she died sudden and ever since lifes not the same nothing seems to go right. i just long for her every day she was my best friend i told her everything and each day i find it hard to come to terms with the fact that shes not her. its so hard because iv got no1 to talk to about it my friends are there but they dont understand. it took me a while to be able to sit down and eat a meal and in the end i became abit more strong and started eating. however my dad to this day never eats a thing hes lost at least 5 stone hes just a bag of bones. what youve got to think is this what ur mom would want to see u like because she is with u everyday there by ur side. maybe u feel guilty eating i used to. and you need 2 cry it helps so much honestly dont lock it allinside beacuse u are in denial and u will find it even harder if u keep it all locked up and end up taking it out on the closest people to you like i have. i no this sounds bad but u have got o try and move foreard with ur life and enjoy what life u have because if ur mom was hear now thats probly what she would tell u. Just be greatful uve got ur own gardian angel watching over u and shes amazing make her proud of u!!!! i hope u start to eat and get ur self back on track email me if u ever need anyone to talk to !!!!! xxx

turn off the lights in your room and a light on in another room down the hall, he will leave your room and go to the other room down the hall.  He will be attracted to the light.  That is at least an answer for now.  It will get him out of your room so he will leave you alone.  Then maybe when someone else is home or awake that can feel comfortable swatting him they can take care of it.

My son, my husband and I all had a fight tonight, or should I say I completely blew up (in an immature way using the "F" word and nearly every other one as well) at my son and husband and then proceeded to leave the house leaving them both behind. My son has apologized but frankly often does and we wind up fighting again just 5 minutes later. I should add, I often apologize too. I am seriously am frustrated and self admittedly, not handling myself very well anymore. By my sons perception, I "freaked out because he has not handed in a homework assignment" and I over reacted by telling/screaming at him he makes Me angry every single Fing day of the week which lately is just a fact. I got angry with my husband because frankly, every single day as my son and I argue about EVERYTHING, he just sits there watching TV or ignoring the entire event, NEVER supporting me. To paint the picture, my son is an absolutely awesome kid and has great values but the truth is he is lazy and a procrastinantor and it is driving me crazy. He does not do drugs or alcohol and is very wholesome. Aside from that he talks back to me EVERYDAY and everytime I insist that he steps up to the plate. He is 18 years old and a senior and for the past 6-8 years he has missed homework assignments, made excuses, played video games, etc... Every single day I rode him to do his work and he would decieve me and pretend it was done. His grades were crappy enough that he will be going to a community college, he does not have grades to get into a four year school. Grades vary from a F-B average 2.0 GPA. I know academics are not everything but these are BAD habits not conducive to having a successful life. He sees my constant critism as "ragging" everyday and being "mean". At 18 years old, never having a job and being lazy and talking back non stop, I feel like I am starting to crack. My husband, not his father, but in the picture since he was four offers ZERO support. That is a seperate issue I am completely disturbed about and his biological father does NOTHING and lives 2000 miles away...visits once a year for 5 days and leaves a hero. Might I add never a dime in child support.
This morning I got up at 600 am (up before my husband) ....got ready, went to work until 500pm as a nurse, picked my son up from the "gym"-which I paid for, brought him home, fed the dogs, changed, went for a walk and then grocery shopping for groceries(at 10 pm) since my son claims there is nothing to eat if he doesn;t have skim milk (can't be 2%), low sugar bread, cold cuts, shredded wheat, honey, soups, snacks etc... I will also mention he does not have a drivers liscence yet as he has not shown the level of maturity necessary for me to trust he will make safe decisions behind the wheel. His room is a PIG STY, and he thinks I am just being a ***** if I comment on any of these things. Frankly, it is getting old....I feel like I have a really good "12" year old. I also feel like a failure because I feel resposnible for his being so ill prepared for the real world and lastly I am completely PISSED OFF that I have a husband who hasn't stepped up to plate to help parent in 14 years and a deadbeat for an ex husband too. So maybe I am an angry bitter woman? Will someone give me a reality check? I don;t want to be mean to my son and husbnad but I feel like I am going crazy some days and it is not my hormones. It is my REAL feelings!! please give me feedback....



Thoughts from SON: Ok basically like she said my mom is the only real authority in life. As of right now I have C's B's and A's last year I did fail chem and math so I know where she is coming from. Often Times I do talk back but often times my mom freaks out Curses at me which I never do to her and becomes so unresonible I cant even talk to her. Sometimes I think she gets mad at my step dad and takes it out on me or vice versa. I know she is stressed but I honestly think she has a problem. And maybe I do 2. I would go for support and would like outside views. Yes I didnt do my math homework. That just started it. She takes things and blows them to an extreme. Sometimes she is awesome, lovely and encouraging but when she snaps which is daily as do I 1. She will say make her angry everyday and stand the way. Which admit I do talk back alot but I instantly apoligize and am ALWAYS the first one 2 admit im wrong and try to make things better. But really how bad am i. I have a dirty room and get average grades. That isnt horrible. I dont do drugs and I am an eagle scout (with my moms support). Arent I just the average kid? Also she makes me clean my room every 2 days and it only takes about 10-20 mins so how bad can it be. The things she yells at me for are things like are things i do over and over like YOU DIDNT GET A TOWEL FOR YOUR SHOWER? THERES C

ok, if he's really that bad and just plays video games all the time and doesn't have a job, who provided him with the video games and allows him to play them? If his grades are so terrible and he doesn't do his homework, why are you paying for a gym membership when he should be home studying? ever heard of enabling?

I couldnt even read all this!! First of all..... is something wrong with a community college??????????????????? be thankful he even wants to go to college. Secondly.. my daughter was the same way with her homework, chores, whatever.... but she graduated high school and that was ALL I needed. Theres too many kids who drop out and become nothing, so if your son graduates REGARDLESS of his grades, be happy!!! And you said it yourself--- constant "criticism" WHY must you criticize at all?? thats why your husband stay out of it because he probably thinks your a B*tch. This is your son for crying out loud... your making him grow up to feel "never good enough for you"! Your going to ruin any relationship with your son when he moves outta your house, you know that dont you? Hes not going to wanna visit mom because all he'll hear is her nagging. And God forbid he bring his children (your grandkids) around you... you might make them feel like their "less of a person" also... LOVE your son, regardless of his damn grades, as long as he graduates, who cares!!! You sound like a very hostile woman and maybe you should see someone.... you may have bi-polar disorder or something....

I honestly feel that you are just stressed out from basically being the man of the house since your husband won't step up. You are basically a single mother with a man in the house who doesn't help defend you while you are arguing with your son. Your son has the potential but he is just lazy, HE'S 18, when he graduates and goes into the real world he'll wish that he would of did better in school, because doors aren't going to open for you in life; you must be willing to work for what you want. But I really applaud your efforts of being a strong women, and wanting what's best for your kids. I suggest that you should sit everyone down, and have a talk with both your HUSBAND AND SON and let them know how you feel.

i honestly believe that mum u feel as tho you are so overwhelmed your doing everything for everyone and your not getting any respect in return at all.  I have 5 sons 2 step sons an a step daughter i know it is never easy and all you want is for them to be good to enjoy their childhood and to see them grow into healthy happy young men an women that are well adjusted and stand every chance out in the real world.  I used to do everything for my kids but it got to the point where there is no time left over for me and for my partner (even tho my kids are some what younger) now they know what is expected of them if they want their treats if they want to go to certain places then they must do their chores n such first an they must be well behaved otherwise i wont give into them and give them what they want.
I believe that SON you are a good person but sometimes u lack the motivation to do the things that you do need to and your mum just wants the best for you and to be happy with you and would it be so hard for you just to put in that little bit of effort to not answer back to pick up a few things after yourself in your room just for the sake of being happy at home and enjoying the time you spend with your mum.
MUM i honestly believe you need to take a big step back make them do things for themselves (both your son an your husband) you arnt a slave you just wanna be happy but it sounds as tho your losing your identity in the roles an things that you feel you must do, walk away if you feel thats what you need to do (trust me i learned that i needed to do that one otherwise you just end up exhausted physically and emotionally) take time out for you and you know what if his room is a mess thats his problem shut his door cos when he asks for something maybe he wont get it till he does what is expected of him.
Raising children is never easy and believe me i am in no way an expert but with a little bit of open communication and the want to be happy together it can all work out
I hope i have helped
Good Luck

Hello, I am 43 years old have a 22 year old daughter from 1st marriage and 13 year old from current .  So I think I am in a position to help you both.

The last year my daughter was in high school we did not get along at all.

She made good grades but was very messy and used the house as a pit stop.



My husband got transferred the last year she was in high school so I had to leave her with some friend until she graduated because I had to get my younger son in school in the new local.

She has been in college for 4 years now and I was stressed out with the finances of her going to school away from home.



All of this had a negative effect on our relationship , but it has improved as she gets older and more mature.

I regret how I behaved and wish I had not been so hard on her now.



Your son will get on with his life soon enough so try not to waste the last years he is at home fighting over petty issues like his messy room.

He needs to motivate himself to do well in school you cannot do this for him.

You sound like you are really tired and overworked and depressed , you might try getting some antidepressants from your doctor.

Depression can come out as being irritable, so do not put off seeing your doctor and the meds do take the edge off.

To the son, Mom is stressed out and tired so try to understand that she is only worried about your future because she loves you.

Oh dear. You sound like a lot of people I know. You both should go to family counseling. Its frustrating parenting a teenager and its frustrating being a teenager. Counseling can help you both.

From what you have told us, I think there is a good chance that you both have form of ADHD or a similar disorder.There are different types of ADHD. No one has to be hyper to have it. That is just one type.



Were things always like this or only the last couple of years? If its been an ongoing thing, you should check into it. It might have escalated over the last few years but if there has always been the lack of impulse control and the son has always had problems remembering things like taking his towel in for his shower, its very possible.



There is no shame in having it. It is caused by the neurons in your brain misfiring much as a spark plug misfires. Both cause a faulty  connection which results in lack of impulse control and organization, such as not remembering a towel, putting off homework until its too late, etc. with ADHD and stuttering and puttering with your car.

There are many ways to treat it now. Some will work better for you than others. You don't always have to take medications to learn to control it. Each person is different so you need to try what you are comfortable with and go from there.

Read up on it. See if it sounds like it could be you. This site has both an adult ADHD board and one for children. Between them, you should be able to figure out whether or not you should be tested.

mom i think you should let go of your boy. he's 18 and he'll be having his own family in no time. leave him with his choices, you dont have to choose for him. and if he made the wrong choice let him face it, support him but dont untangle things for him. you feel exhausted because you want everything in place which is something you could never do with a kid like yours(who brought him up anyway?). i mean he grew up with you so you should know him well enough and maybe know better than to bug him with all the things you have to do for him. 
the assignment thing isnt that big issue at all. grades arent the basis of who you really are. when he applies for work, he might not impress with his grades but he could impress his future boss with what he could do.
and to your hubby...eeerrrrrrrrrr...........

and son, i think you should be considerate with your mom. she has given you everything she could afford. the least you could for her is give her the due respect and the least headache possible when she gets home from work. have a merry christmas in advance

Mom, first I want to say I completely understand how frustrating it is!  It is so hard to know what is right and what is wrong parenting teenagers.  What I see from reading this is a couple or a few things.  First I see that you are totally overwhelmed and stressed from trying to do too many things and trying to control things that you just don't have control over.  Your son is 18!  He is old enough to know to do his homework on his own!!  He will suffer the consequences if he doesn't!  Tell him you will not pay for gym if he doesn't pass college with a C or better!  That might motivate him.  Also, please tell me you are praising him at some points along the way.  From this letter I hear mostly negatives.  A lot of nagging.  It takes 10 positive things said to erase the damage that ONE negative thing said did.  My dad put me down my entire child hood.  He told me I was no good, deserved nothing and would turn into nothing.  I believed him.  I grew up depressed and ended up in a horrible relationship and dropped out of college.  Thank goodness I got turned around, divorced and back in school, but the negative talk takes it's toll!!



When my son turned 18 I was very careful how I treated him.  I decided he was 18, a legal adult.  He could move out if he wanted to and I definitely didn't want that.  I wanted him to stay at home and go to COMMUNITY COLLEGE!  Yes!  We were PROUD of him for going to community college!  In fact statistically kids that go to community college first are more prepared to go to a four yr university and do better the second half at the four yr school than the people who started there.

Son...hang in there.  Your mom loves you and wants the best for you.  I think you are a good kid who is on the right track.  Give your mom a break.  Help her around the house and tell her you love her and thank her for being a great mom.  She might lighten up just knowing you appreciate her!!

Good luck to both of you.

By the way.  This is a perfect situation for a family therapist!

Moving out before legal?



Me and my boyfriend who is going to be 18 next summer would like to get a house together next summer, he lives in Maryland, and I live in Ohio. My parents want to move to Arizona for some god awful reason, and I don't want to be any further from him than I already am. Me and my boyfriend were talking about talking to my mom about moving out and getting a house in Maryland with my boyfriend. I'm only sixteen but by next summer I would be 17. Is this legal for me to move out if my mom allows it? Would someone else have to take custody of me because I'd only be 17? Also how should I go about asking her?

If your going to give me answers such as "you're too young to be settling down." Just save it because I'm aware of what I'm getting myself into.

You have to be emancipated which is legally made your own gaurdian. I believe if your parents don't have a problem with it then its not a big deal but if they do then you have to prove you either have graduated, have a G.E.D., or are attending school as well as a place to stay and a source of income. Visit your local courthouse and they should be able to help you.

i'm Canadian so it might be different in the states but from my own experience I would say that you don't need legal documentation to say you can support yourself. No you do not need to have someone take custody of you. You are near the age where the world considers you an adult (not to mention you can buy guns at that age).

how to tell your mother? it would be easier if she knows yo are gay (which i assume) best way in my opinion is to be firm, state what you want to do but (this is a must) ask her if she would still take you in if this doesn't work out (this way she gets to feel like you still depend on her/love her but doesn't feel the full blade of rejection) and gives you a fallback as well if everything goes down the porcelain throne. also tell her that you have to take this chance, whether it works or not isn't important as trying and experiencing. and aways say that you love her.



Fall-backs? money. make sure you've got money coming in and in decent amounts, you won't be able to rely on your mother or your bf for such things.
oh, and make sure you have a decent place, a cabin with no fridge or H2O is not worth it, trust me!

why are you going through your dads underwear drawer, and he is the pervert?  He is an old man with a porn, you are the one sneaking through his undergarments.

I wonder what you would be saying right now if he had it lying out on his bedside table instead of put away in a drawer?

"Dad's a freakin pervert, he leaves porno laying around his room".



How is his having the respect for your mother and for his children to not leave it laying around in plain sight make him a pervert.  He isn't hiding it, he is keeping it put away.  Seriously.....

No, I think it is just normal for some people.
My dad is still checking out girls as he drives past them, they are usually 14 yrs old, which I tell him off for. I do not think he realises how young they are though as girls look older than they do I just know because I am a young woman.
Some men just like looking at things like these papers and mags, it is not wrong it is just what they like.

In-laws sleeping arrangements?



Chris is 27 and I am 22, and STILL Chris's parents make us sleep in separate rooms when we are staying at their house. We are spending Christmas with them this year (if Chris is back from Afghanistan in time) I hate sleeping on my own! When Chris is away, one of my girlfriends always stays over. Should I try talking to Chris's mom? I know it's like their house and we should respect that and everything but still! Chris parents live in Wisconsin, it's cold there in the winter! And because I am a skinny Minnie I get cold and I like something to cuddle. TBH, I was just planning on sneaking into his room when everyone is asleep, but I feel guilty! Also EVERY floorboard creaks!! How would you handle this situation? Should I just suck it up, stop being a baby, and sleep on my own for a few weeks or maybe talk to his mom? Chris has little brothers and sisters and I think Chris mom is worried they may walk in on us..and she would have to explain why two unmarried people are sharing a room (she's kind of 'proper')
Comments and suggestions are as always appreciated

Also parents out there? Do you allow your son/daughter and their partner to share a room when staying with you? I guess it kind of feels weird for parents maybe?

To be honest, it's their house and their rules for their children. They probably are very adamant about this because they have younger children still at home. If you don't want to deal with this then I'd suggest finding a hotel/motel or a cabin/cottage in the local area to rent while your visiting. That way you two don't have to compromise about your desires to share a bed, will be able to have some alone time and his parents don't have to compromise on the values they want their children to adhere to in their home.

i suggest that you and chris sit them down and tell them - unless they drop this rediculous AND IT IS REDICULOUS TELLING ADULTS WHAT THEY CAN AND CANT DO behavior that you and he will simply rent out a cheap motel so that you CAN sleep in each others arms and be cuddled.



please do NOT suck it up. you live one life, and it is so wonderful to be held while you sleep.

suck it up or get a hotel. its their house their rules even if they are stupid rules. or get married. if you are an adult then dont expect for someone to give you a roof over their head if you do something they dont like. you have to pay for a hotel to sleep with him. or learn to sleep alone. seriously, you have a friend sleep over when hes not there? i think you need to sort this out if you are 22.

I don't think you should be the one talking to Chris's mom.  I think Chris should be.  You 2 are adults and it's not like you two aren't sleeping together when your not there (at their Home)  If Chris doesn't want to ask him mom I would stay in a hotel instead of at their home  You say he is in Afghanistan and I assume it's for military purposes.  I think if he is old enough to fight for our country then he is old enough to sleep in the same room as his girlfriend.  Good luck and I hope this helps you out.

Perhaps you and Chris should get a HOTEL ROOM instead. This way both sides are comfortable with the arrangement. It would probably be better verses being uncomfortable and trying to talk about this with his mom. Mothers tend to be a little more protective, and in this case while his mother knows that the 2 of you do sleep together when your not there. It is something that she as his mother may NOT be comfortable with since the 2 of you aren't married yet. You shouldn't be offended by it though either, she wants her son to be respectful towards you @ least while your both under her roof.

good luck
if not housework, cup of tea and breakfast in bed maybe some flowers.. should do the trick

Although waiting would be the best course of action, it sounds like you don't want to wait. First off, you must realize what you have done wrong and why they took it away. All I can say is that in the future avoid fighting with your brother. Or get a job (though it's hard at that age) and pay for your cell bill yourself.

Prove to your parents that you are mature enough at 13 to have a phone. Have a talk with them and apologize to them and your brother for whatever it is you did.



When I was 13 I didn't have a phone and that wasn't too long ago... Until you get your phone back, go on a bikeride, go visit your friends in person, read a book... You'll be fine.

How can i tell my mum i'm in a three-way marriage?



I'm visiting my mum next weekend for the first time in three years (we lost touch). I told her i was married and she wants to meet my husband and i said fine.
Thin is, i'm in a three way marriage. I'm actually married to my partner Tony, but my other partner Nick lives with us and refers to us as his husband and his wife, and me and Tony call him our husband as well. Should i take them both along? I love Nick with all my heart, and i dont want to deny our relationship, but i dont want to lose touch with my mum after so long apart. what should i do??

P.S - i am well aware my situation is a little unorthadox and not to some people's taste so please dont leave answers like 'eew' or whatever. Thanks.

Maybe you could introduce one as your partner and another at a later date as a close friend. Surely that's basically what you all are - friends. It's not lying and she doesn't have to accept something she doesn't understand or pass uncomfortable judgements.

I would just keep that to myself. Introduce the other 'partner' as a room mate. That way, you are not lying, but not disclosing too much info either.

If your mom is uber conservative and extremely religious, I don't think coming up to her for the first time in years and telling her this flat out is such a good idea. I'd slowly drop small hints over time to lessen the likely shock factor and build up some level of acceptance in her towards your relationship.

I think part of our job in life is to annoy/freak out our parent (ages 1 to 999). Just calmly sit down with her one day and tell her. At first she maybe shocked with you, but if she is an understanding mother, eventually she will come to terms with your situation and you husbands.

Thank you for reading.

You can't really worry about what your mum thinks, or anyone else for that matter. It's your life and supposedly, parents say they just want their children to grow up and be happy. Just tell her the three of you are very happy and it should be OK. Life is your own experience and I don't see any need to hide it. There's always people out there to put you down, but who needs them. People accept you or they don't. Be with the people who treat you with love. That's what makes a good life!

U should know ur mum best.



If I'm not wrong, u r married to Tony rite and Nick is just living in. That is in general.



Then bring Tony home to meet mum. You r just being honest. I'm sure Nick would understand the whole situaltion. Ur relationship with ur mum us as important as ur marriage and other relations. Just try to minimize the complications by making parties involved understand where they stand and why u hv to make some decisions the way they were.

All the best

One thing I'm surprised hasn't been said so far...



If you lost touch with your mom, I'm assuming she did something 'wrong' and so she ought to be thankful that you're in her life again at all...  That said, if that's how the situation is, just tell her "Hey this is me, my life, and how I live it.  You love me you'll love ALL of me, even the stuff you don't understand." And she'll accept it, or you'll lose touch again, but seriously...when you were already out of touch with one another, did you die?  No.  You survived, and even found not one but TWO people to love you in spite of your mother not......so if you should lose touch with her again because of her narrow-mindedness or selfish version of "your" happiness (how hypocritical; be happy but only the way that I see fit?  NO WAY!), you will be sad but okay.  :)

Actually to the one poster it is only illegal if you are married legally to both.  If you are married to only one and the other is a mutual agreement between all of you, and you look at yourselves as being married that is different.

Now on to your question, first off is your mom open minded?  If not then I could only suggest that you would introduce your husband as such and that if you want to take your other friend along for the trip that is up to all of you but would suggest that you three keep it respectful in her home.  The reason being if she isn't that open minded, its better to pass him off as only a friend then another partner between the two of you.  I can understand not wanting to hurt Nick's feelings but if he is as understanding as he is with the relationship between you and your legal husband, then he should be understanding about the visit to your mother's home.

Personally it sounds like something I have heard about before with some friends and has worked very well between all of them.



Good luck to the three of you and have fun.

Wow, this is an unusual situation - but each to their own, and if you're all happy, then great!

Introduce her to Tony, and let her get used to him. Bring the other one along, Nick, and say he's a close friend that lives with you (not a lie). Don't elaborate on this any further, let her figure it out herself over time.



In a way, I kind of envy you, you have, to put it crudely, a spare! There are times when I want a little attention from my beloved, but he's busy, or I want a job done in the house that requires DIY skills, or the grass cut .... sometimes I think a third person in the relationship (and all the trust involved) would be very practical.

Help me decide my best option?



i am due to start university in january. i have just finished my year long course at college. i have a 2yr old daughter who will be 3 in april. when i was at college 4 days a week my mum and my babys dad would have her a day each and then she would go to a private nursery. this always caused complications as someone would occaisionally not be able to help out and i would miss college. i decided when i go uni that i will put her in full time nursery 3 days a week and my mum and her dad can have her a day each so she isnt in nursery all the time. as i am doing nursing the hours are unpredictable. last night my mum sed she thinks i am doing this all too soon and i should wait until my daughter is older as she needs me. her dad also sed the same thing. i am now unsure whether i should go to uni at all now because of this, i dont want to be a bad mother. i am on benefits at the moment and it is hard but when i go uni i will be paid and not have to get income support anymore. i will have more than double my monthly income if i go to uni and surely this is better for me and my daughter. is it bad if i go to uni all week?

Have you looked into taking online courses.  They can be a lifesaver in a case like this.

Sometimes as parents we have to do things that hurt us in the short term to help us in the long term.  Does that make sense?

I say go for it, as long as you still have time to spend with your daughter every day.  You may have to do your homework at night while she's sleeping, but in the long run  it will be worth it.

There is nothing wrong with getting an education to better yourself.



The child is two (almost three), and will thrive in daycare with other children.

A lot of parents have to work. It is a necessity these days.

The few hours that she spends in daycare will not effect her in a traumatic way.

Even though your mom and the child's father mean well, they are not the ones who are responsible with providing your child a healthy future. The father is obviously not a full time dad, and the grandma is a part-time helping hand. You are her sole provider.

These few years in school will better your life and the life of your child for many years to come.

Do not let them influence your decision. Everyone is allowed to have an opinion, but that does not mean it counts.

The child can be in daycare 5 days a week, and it will not harm her.

She will be fed, taken care of, surrounded by other children, and learning while you learn.

When you have your degree and look back on this, it will seem foolish.

Best wishes

Yes you are a mother but you are definitely doing the best thing for your daughter by making sure you're going to be able to provide her with a secure and happy future. Your University will probably have childcare facilities that they can offer you at a greatly reduced rate which would also mean that when you aren't on placement you could see her in your lecture breaks. Its definitely a big commitment to make but I have the greatest respect for you for wanting to better yourself. Don't be put off by what your mum and daughter's dad are saying. You should do this for yourself and your daughter.

Well done for continuing your education!  I know how hard it is, I am currently in my second year at uni and we have five children between us.  You go girl!

As far as I am aware, nursing is a very demanding course and more time consuming than most degrees, so you will need a good care structure in place for your child.

I see no reason why you cannot juggle your daughter and your studies.  Although at times it will be very difficult for you.



On the whole I have fund my lecturers extremely understanding when it comes to children.  At times I have even taken our 9 year old to lectures with me (she drew pictures for the lecturers - how cute is that).  If I have had difficulty getting to classes, so long as I let them know in advance, and I have made up the work there has been no problems at all.  They are educator, and are more than happy to go the extra mile for mature students because we are there to learn, unlike some of the younger students who are there to toss off three years.

As a parent, your daughter will always been your main priority, however, that does not mean you whole life should be suspended until she gets older.  Working hard for what you can achieve is a very important lesson that needs to be taught, far more important that teaching you child to be welfare dependant.

As for your mum, try explaining how important it is to you that you can provide for your child, not just financially, but the life lessons too, ask her for help and support, but make it clear that you want to set a few day in daycare up too, because it is important for your daughter to learn how to socialise.  Perhaps you could ask her to help you vet some daycare centres, get her involved so she feels needed?

Good luck with your studies!!

Carla si es niña y Miguel si es niño. Son bonitos nombres y suenan muy bien al oido de quienes los escuchan. Dentro de su sencillez son suaves y profundos. Dentro de la normalidad -lo cual los aleja de cualquier posible trauma- son hermosos nombres. Yo tengo una hija que se llama Carla y es inmensamente feliz con este nombre. Y tengo un sobrino llamado Miguel y está contentísimo de llamarse así. Son nombres, por otro lado, con personalidads propia y muy claros de pronunciar. No dan pie a burlas de ningún tipo y son muy apreciados por la sociedad. Así que voto por Carla y por Miguel.

My 8 year old Daughter told me that my 13 year Son and his Girlfriend want a Baby.?



My Son's Girlfriend has been living with us. She been sleeping in my Daughters room by the way.
This morning my 8 year old said that my Son and his Girlfriend want a Baby. I ask his Girlfriend if it was true and she just said it has nothing to do with me and all i get from my Son is to mind my own business and he starts going on about me getting pregnant at 13.
I tried to speak to my Son's Girlfriends Mum but all you get from her is that she don't care.

I don't know what to do



</question>



<additional details>



I don't let them do it in my house but i know they will just find somewhere to alce do it



He already knows i went through hell when i got pregnant at 13. I would send his girlfriend home but i know her Mum would start letting them have sex there. If there both under my roof i least i can keep an eye on them



My Hubby said we should send him to hir Dad's. Who lived about 6 hours away from us. But he not very good at been a Dad so i dont really like sending him there. Do you think this will be a good idear

I think that you should sit your son down and talk to him about the responsibility of having a child at the age of 13  as you are going to be speaking from experience. i also think that you should reconsider having his girlfriend live with you at that age. she has her family and he has his i think it is too soon for that seriousness in a relationship at that age.

oh god what i dilemma. if you got pregnant at 13 all you can do is explain to the girlfriend how hard it is. my friend had her daughter at 14, and has a bank account she puts money into. her daughter can have the money when she turns 21 provided she hasnt had a baby yet. if she does she wont see a penny of the money. maybe do something like that. kids are greedy, if theres a promise of a lump sum it might just work.
hope it works out for you all.

i have a 15 year old foster sister who wants a baby and i left my 9 week old daughter with her for 4 hours (my mum was around too) and now she has changed her mind, she was glad to give her back to me!!

well for a start why is she living with you? that would just give them the impression that they are being treated like adults so they would want to act like adults in a proper relationship, and most adults end up having kids. she should be living with her own family. you seriously need to sit them both down and give the a reallly big talk and help them to understand what it would do to there life! and teach them to understand when the best time would be to have a baby. x

Whilst the girl is under your roof it has everything to do with you.  If her mother isn't interested and she's managed to end up at yours, do social services know, if not they should.

you say your son mentions you getting pregnant at 13, if this is true you need to explain the circumstances of how this happened and explain why you don't want your son to go the same way, which I'm presuming you don't by asking this question.

Get them some help, either from school or your local free mental health clinic. They need to know the extent of the responsibility.  Whenever something comes up that they want to do, remind them that if they had a child they could either not afford it, or would have to find and pay for a sitter for the child before they could do anything.  Hints like that could help.  "Look at the price of milk. I shudder to think about what baby food must cost nowadays!!"

You need to take control this is a very serious issue! You know its being talked about if your 8 yr. old knows. You need to lay down the laws. Why is the girlfriend living with you? not trying to pass judgment just curious as to why your allowing it.  Your son is 13 that's it you and your husband have got to get control here or you will end up with a baby for sure. Although you did its not the ideal situation for anyone no matter the maturity level to have a baby in their teens. I know I did it at 15. I be damned if one of my kids threw that in my face for wanting one themselves. We need to stop the cycle and educate are children. I'm not sure of your situation with this young lady but my advice is to make her leave and come up with a plan to help your kid!  If it doesn't happen with her it could with someone else. He needs to fully understand the consequences to this action. See if there is a teen pregnancy place in your area like a parenting program that host classes. he needs educated.  Dont send your son to any dads house you can handle this! Best of luck.

They're having sex in your house. 
You can't watch them 24 hours a day, and if that's the way the conversation went, they ARE trying to have a baby already. 
Get her out of your house. If they get pregnant in her house b/c her mother doesn' tpay attention, then it's her fault. But you dont' want to be the one in trouble from them getting pregnant.

Well if their thinking or planning to have a baby then you should make them go through what its like to have a baby at a young age. Make them have a (fake)baby to practice with , tell them they need this amount of money in order to take care of one, make him go out looking for a job and a place to live, her too. Have someone come over to explain this to them if you dont want to do it, they need to be knocked upside their heads with reality. Go speak to their guidance counselors do something besides asking them if they are or arent, take action their underage and they need to realize reality.

I think that you should sit your son and daughter down, dont nag at them but tell them that it is an adult topic and you need to discuss it in an adult manner!
You shouldnt send your son away because at the end of the day, he is your child and you need to look out for his best interests! 
You have to tell your son he shouldnt be having sex at his age and if he is make sure he is using protection. 
Clarify to him that it was far from easy bringing up a child at that early age and make sure he knows that you will always be there for him when he needs to talk!
Good luck with this xxxx

Don't judge it just because it was on the lips.  Plenty of people do that.  You also have to think of how she kissed you on the lips. If it was quick and fast, then it probably was not sexual.  If it was held a little while, then I would wonder.Maybe she is lonely.  Lonely people do weird things.  Don't be too hard on her, but I understand if you want to keep your distance.  Maybe asking her about it and then telling her your boundaries would help restore things to some normal level.  I would ask her about it to see what her intentions were.  Then let her know it bothered you so she won't do it again.

It's complicated, but sometimes a parent can momentarily forget that a mature child is their child.  It seems to happen more often with mothers and teenage or young adult sons.  Normally, there is a mental block in place, called a bonding mechanism, that keeps them from feeling that way about their own kids (and vice versa), but if it doesn't work or misfires for a moment, then they can feel the same way they would about anyone else.

I worked with a woman (wife of a famous professional race car driver) who said she got up one night and caught a glance of her hunky 16 year old son in the kitchen in his underpants getting a drink of milk, and in the near dark she didn't recognize him at first and was totally turned on by him!  But as soon as she realized who he was, she went back to not being able to have any such thoughts.



And a girl I was in college with said she had the identical experience with her own younger brother when she went home for Winter Break and passed him in the hallway one night.



Alcohol, depression, and some medications can all temporarily interfere with the mechanism.  It's just biology, not morality.  Try not to dwell on the episode.  If it only happened the once, I doubt if it was deliberate.

My Dad and brother are planning to hurt my younger gay brother.?



My brother who is 19 came out as gay last year. He has a partner who he has been with since the age of 15 i.e 5 years. Anyway my family all disowned him, well except me and I excepted the fact they disowned him because they are catholics and they have strict morals. However I heard my Dad and oldest brother talking in the kitchen saying they were going to seriously hurt my brother and his boyfriend next sunday. From their conversation it seems they were planning to rally a group of their mates together and go after them. I'm really worried. What should I do?

You should call the police and warn your brother. That type of behavior has nothing to do with religion or God. People like that use religion as an excuse to be unloving and uncharitable towards those they don't like.



Your father should pray for your brother. He doesn't have to accept your brother's behavior, but as a Catholic he has to respect him and treat him with same dignity due all human beings.

Your poor gay brother! And thank god he has you to help protect him.  Where is your mum in all this?  If she is a proper Mum she should be there protecting your brother together with you. Tell her to stop being a coward and stand up against your horrid Dad and brother.

How dare your father and brother take the law into their own hands!



Catholics you say? I am a Catholic too and as far as I know the bible does not teach Catholics to beat another human being just because they are not like the rest of us.

Please you MUST AND URGENTLY tell your brother and his partner. Ask them to go away, contact the police so they could put a restraining order against your dad and brother for their threatening behaviour.

I wouldn't let your Dad or brother know you overheard.  If they are what you say they are, they might hurt you too.

Tread very carefully and I pray for your brother, his partner and your safety.

you need to warn your brother and his partner my cousin is gay and our family has excepted it there is nothing wrong with his sexuality there is nothing your brother can do to change that, you also need to go to the police and tell them, you are sort of stuck in the middle as if your brother finds out you knew and something did happen then he would feel betrayed as you didnt tell him.

do what your heart tells you!

tell your brother to stay away is the first thing.
some people are so caught up in religion that the edges of reasonable thought get blurred.
Another way would be to talk to your local priest the vatican although not condoning gay relationships has come along way and certainly would not agree with violence because of someones sexuality the priest would give some valuable imput on this

The first thing you need to do is contact your brother AND his partner. Tell them exactly what you heard so you wont be called a liar, once you told him he will be able to go and stay in a hotel or at a friends house that your dad and brother don't know. Once you have told them, ring the police to ask them what to do and to warn them that their might be an attack against your younger brother. If they ignore you and think your just being silly, keep ringing them until they get the picture (Do the same with your brother and his partner if they also think your being stupid.) Don't confront your dad and brother as they could turn against you, or they will deny it to you, and delay the attack for another day.



I really hope this helps! Please say what happens once you have taken any body answers/advice! I hope it all goes well!

Warn your brother first and foremost. Talk with him about how he wants to handle this, include the police if necessary. It doesnt matter that they are family, at this moment, they are not even acting like family, so you and your brother need to take steps to either stop them from going through with their plans, and if not, make a plan to protect your brother, such as moving him out from where he is, having them leave town for a few days or some such thing. At this moment, I think this is basically a crisis, it requires a quick action plan, you do not want this to happen, and neither would your brother, absolutely tell him what is going to happen so that he can protect both  himself and his partner, and do all that you can to help. I am honestly not sure of the best way to go about it, but I do think that you should not be afraid to talk to someone abotu what to do, talk to the police, even if they are unable to help, they may be able to connect you with some other services that can assist. Please, just take the first step and tell your brother so that he atleast has a chance to protec thimself.

Take every thing one at a time, otherwise it just seems insurmountable.
Cross off your list things that are out of your control - like your mum and dad's problems - I know they worry you, but you actually can't do anything for them except not cause them any extra stress.
Do easy tasks like filling out your personal details on your ucas form so at least you feel like you're achieving something.
Make a list every day of things you need to achieve and try and complete it instead of having it all going through your mind at the same time.

And make sure you take some time out for yourself - talk to a friend, get some exercise, get plenty of sleep etc

I know how you feel, but there is no one stop solution I'm afraid. Talk things over with someone who knows how to listen and not give advice. I.e. not a boyfriend but a girl. (sister or friend)

And things will get better, keep believing it. Don't focus on other people's problems, become a bit more selfish. Yeah I know shes your mom, but moms have ways of sorting things out. And whether you worry or not will not make any difference unless you get proactive, so you might as well not worry.

Talk to your boyfriend.  Get upset.  You need to get these feelings out, then they won't seem so bad.  You'll get a different perspective on them if you can talk about it with someone.  Life is full of hard knocks.  It's very rarely easy.  Whenever I feel like this I try and count my blessings: family, friends, home.  You're right, there are things that are out of our control and we can do nothing about, but you can complete your ucas application right?  Get it done, you'll feel better

What happens to old ladies who use stilts?



My 87 year old grandmother has just left on a trip round the UK on stilts. My family and I are incredibly worried as she has left without any money, cards, ID or phone. 
She simply said it was 'something she had to do'.
I am very worried at the moment, is there anything I can do to find her or just find out if she's safe? She's never used stilts before this.

No one should feel like this. I can't quite work out how you can kiss share a bed see each other and phone every Day, yet you say there is no relationship.
If this young lady is going places with her ex, I think you are in for a let down. Why not take a back seat, stop doing the running and leave it to her. Be careful, you don't want to be used as a stop gap.
Good Luck Poppet.
