<answer>



Try a fugue. Fugues are the most common contrapuntal technique used to help the voices or instruments compete independently in a musical way.

Start with the 1st violin with its theme for that fugue....then you can enter the other voices in a fair amount of ways......
1. Cello second, viola third, 2nd violin last
2. Viola second, 2nd vioiln third, cello last
3. 2nd violin second, cello third, viola last



If you don't want a fugue, try to do some homophony...that is, make the other voices have the same note.....but try to do it above or below the 1st violin. But don't do it too much.

The lower voices can act as something like a piano.....make a chord or chords or harmony with it...with the cello being the main "bass" of your quartet.

Also.......
Since the ensemble involves bowed strings, alternate "arco" and "pizzicato" passages for variety in timbre. Also alternate in the diminution and augmentation of notes, and also add variety in tempo.
(For example, Allegro in the first 20 measures, then Adagio in the next 20, and back to Allegro in the next 20, etc.).

You can use also a imitation technique or canon if a fugue is too difficult for you.

Finally, alternate between scale passages and broken arpeggio passges between each part.

Hope all of this helps.

well, I'm kinda in the same position as you, but i have an amazing viola part and crapppy everything else parts..

but my first string quartet (the one i've been working on for about  a year). is the main theme. with about 6 variations of the main theme circulating around the members...  then either a fading away finish or a big bang finish...



if you don't already have it (or one like it) I highly recommend Finale Notepad for composing.
its free, and its not a limited trial..
It works very well, especially for beginner composers..
and it lets you hear exactly what you've put down.
super easy to use..

String quartets are bit old fashioned, don't you think? How about writing for an electric guitar quartet: two guitars, bass and drums?

Anyway. A quartet is supposed to consist of four equal players. So you need to write all four parts at the same time. Giving the first violin the "tune" while all the others just accompany it is not a good way to proceed.

Music GSCE Performance Coursework Advice?



About 4 weeks ago, due to my school's early switch into year 10, I started my GSCE music. I am now aware that after the summer holidays I have to be ready to peform a piece of music for my coursework. I play guitar and I wanted somone's advice on a song I could learn to peform. I don't want something too hard, would be nice if there wasn't many barre chords. I'm cool with tapping, power chords and basic chords but I'm not that fast at picking. It also needs to have lots of different guitar sections as I don't want to be doing the same riff over and over. Any songs you can think of? Thanks :)

Let's be honest, GCSE music requires you to be grade 3 on an instrument, so nothing too strenuous! I would recommend playing classical guitar as opposed to rock (unless you only own an electric guitar obviously) because it provides a better display of your technique and is easier to mark from an examiners point of view. Perhaps you could learn something by Matteo Carcassi - his 25 Etudes Melodiques would be a good place to start.

Good luck for the performance. :)

You have to ask two questions

Do they charge money to be put on their books? If the answer is yes, walk away, no reputable agency charges. (They want £43 a year,!!!!)

Second question, who are on their books? If you don't recognise any names walk away.

NO! This is one of the most famous modelling scams around!

Steer clear - they will bombard you with emails saying they've 'chosen' you, and will be offering you a three year contract. Ignore it!



Just type 'models direct' into google, or 'models direct scam', and see the huge amount of rubbisht that comes up about them! Seriously, seriously, avoid it! They accept pretty much everyone who applies.



Go to the 'Alba' website - they have loads of information on what's a scam, and who the good agencies are.



Loads of luck - don't let yourself get taken in. And remember, anything asking for money up front is most definitely a scam.

What guitar shall i buy?



I'm looking to buy a new acoustic or electro acoustic guitar for around the £350-£500.
I'm not a beginner, but its been a while since i played properly, so i'm a bit out of touch with 'what's hot and whats not' etc..

I generally play mainly unplugged, and a bit of lead but want a nice deep strumming sound, and low action on the high fret without paying a fortune. Looking at Martin's and the cheaper takamines.

Any recommendations?

Taylor's are excellent guitars - but overpriced!

In the more reasonably-priced range try out some of the following:

Yamaha (always good)
Tanglewood (some good, some not so good)
Takamine (Japanese-made are best)
Epiphone (owned by Gibson - pretty good quality control)

Hofner are back making budget-priced acoustics but I haven't yet played one.

take yourself into one of the larger stores tell them what youre price range is and try out as many as possible.
talk to the sales assistant and tell them you do not want to commit youreself today and go back another day and try out some more.
they should be very obliging once you have laid out youre plans for a specific guitar

Top of the line strings need to be changed about every 200 hours of use. Sooner if they start stretching again.
Average strings need to be changed when they stretch while playing, when they discolor, frey or when they start breaking.
I likke to change the entire set. One string at a time. but all the same day.

when they break or sound poorly. Nylon strings will need to be changed more often than a steel set, but they are easier on your fingers if you're just starting out.

about every 6 months you should change them.

if they kind of look discolored, change the strings.

don't change the strings every time one of them break, but if the strings break too often, you should change all the strings.

if your guitar sounds worse than it did when you got it, change the strings.

I like GHS boomers, but you can use any string you like.



Acoustic strings should be a little thicker than electric ones.

I'm a student who's desparate for work and my dad - who was a film extra and has appeared in CatWeasel in his prime, apparently - said I ought to try it myself.
 However, the media is obsessed with showing 'the beautiful people', as it were.

Anyway I'm 5"2 with vital stats of 40-35-44, inside leg of 28". Obviously there are some roles where they might require bigger people, but could I get into generic extras-type work anyway?

there is plenty of work  for extras for all sorts of stuff, films,tv shows,adverts,educational dvds, etc, you just put your name down at your nearest agency (search google for extras agencies) they charge about £50-100 a year, they will take details of WHEN you're available,weekends? weekdays? just tuesdays? and they will keep you informed as to what work is available in your area.You just make sure you show up on time at the correct location. You may be on stand-by for a full 8 hour day and only film for 1/2 an hour, so either be sociable and befriend other extras, or take a book/gameboy/soduko/mp3 .Usually your meals are provided at an on site canteen. As to your looks, they are totally irrelevant, the media obsesses about 'beautiful people' but film makers are looking for DIVERSITY.In Britain you'll get payed £70-100 a day. Dont worry about your looks, join an agency, make friends, have fun!!!!

A lot of "character" actors are cast, esp as tramps, football fans, burger flippers etc.  (I was an extra for quite a while, and it was good money, but I got bored with the early mornings and sarcastic directors).  Lots of the better agencies (ie those who don't charge upfront - google Mad Dog, Ray Knight and Casting Collective) go for diversity; and also looks don't always matter, as often you are shot from behind or are put in a mask, as in V for Vendetta.  Also body doubles/stand ins are neded for the larger woman (ie Dawn French) so there is a chance of getting work that way too

I actually think you'll have a better chance than a lot of people will have! Think about it -  the industry is being saturated by people who look the same, because they think that's what works on film.



So, casting directors are having to look more and more for 'average' (sorry, not calling you average, hope you know what I mean!) or realistic people.



I think, as long as you find the right websites - 2020 casting is a good one, I think, then you'll have a really strong chance of getting work, and standing out from the crowd!

Best of luck!

not really. but most people i know who took it up have an easier time using tablature than trying to learn to read music. tablature is sort of like 'play by number' where you learn what chords actually look like rather than learning what each individual note means and how they work together. 
there are many books and online resources on guitar tablature. maybe get a book from the library and see how it suits you before you go out and buy a whole guitar.

Some people can pick it up like nothing and others have to work their butts off practicing. Some songs are simple and some get really intricate and complicated. Even if you're a natural though, practice can always make you better. There's always more you can learn. That's why so many people enjoy playing guitar. Your guitar playing is something that can grow and evolve with you.

Learning to play the guitar takes a lot of time and effort, but it is better to learn on acoustic. Then, once you get good at it, it makes playing electric much easier than it could have been (your fingers will have been made stronger because it typically takes more strength to hold down the strings, especially chords).

Depends how dedicated you are, if your only going to practice a little a day then it's going to be hard, but if your willing and dedicated to getting good then you will get better and find things easier.

My mate who plays guitar has got up to a grade 8 level in under a year and finds it rather easy, so just practice, practice, practice.

There are always new, harder things to learn anyway, like metal guitar playing totally differs from playing blues guitar.

it is depending on who you are.  i've been playing for a decade, and now when i pick up the guitar, i just play the notes naturally, like i never had an issue.  but it's like anything else you pick up for the first time- it's unnatural, you have to adjust your hands and body in positions you're not used to, and it's intimidating and yes, difficult.  it's tedious, you'll be loooking at things youve never seen before and you have to be patient with yourself.  if you want to learn to play, really want to learn, then the mistakes you make can be fun.  you have to train your hands, your ears, get away from directing yourself based on sight, etc.  it's a frustrating trip at first, but if it's something you really care to do, like i said, the whole thing will be fun.  start out slow, realize that you won't be playing van halen solos in a week, and its a blast.  electric guitar is easier to learn because of how the strings lie on the fretboard, they are thinner, and closer, so it requires less pressure, than an acoustic.  but it's always a positive to begin with an acoustic because mastering that helps you be that much better and faster when you move to electric.

My Time of Day is a male solo. It's slower and ballad-like, if that's what you're going for.

Luck be a Lady and Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat are faster. I wouldn't recommend Sit Down, however, because it's very wordy and doesn't show off as much vocal ability as Luck be a Lady.

Musical "Guys And Dolls" - Luck Be A Lady Lyrics
http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/bestofbro...

They call you Lady Luck.
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very unladylike way of running out
You're this a date with me
The pickings have been lush
And yet before this evening is over you might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay and So the best that I can to is pray.

Luck be a lady tonight
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight.

Luck let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
I've seen the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me.

A lady doesn't leave her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice.
So let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the fellow you came in with
Luck be a lady
Luck be a lady
Luck be a lady tonight.

Luck be a lady tonight.
Luck be a lady tonight.
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight.

Luck let a gentleman see
Luck let a gentleman see
How nice a dame you can be
How nice a dame you can be

I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck me a lady, a lady, be a lady with me.
Luck be a lady with me

A Lady wouldn't flirt with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul
A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me
When I've got my life on this roll.

Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, snake eyes
Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em!

So let's keep the party polite
Let's keep the party polite
Never get out of my sight

If you are looking for real easy drum beats to learn...try some Beatles or Rolling Stones songs to play drums to. Those are the easiest 4/4 time songs for beginners to learn on. Then, after you get the basic drum beats down...then you can go for more difficult songs later.



Also, I'd advise you buy a cheap Metronome too to help you learn your timing in drumming. They help you learn the BPMs ( Beats per Minute) in songs. Hope this helps

i think i've got what it takes to act professionally, (not famous, that's not really something that interests me to be honest, and i'm not aiming to be rich,,i just want to act!)since i've been 7 i've been doing shows , and in acting clubs, i'm in all the plays, do drama exams, do lamda exams, did gcse and am doing a-lelvel drama and love it! lots of people tell me i've got what it takes..etc etc. thing is i'm not much of a singer, which is ok because i'm more into screen acting , but i'd be willing to take lessons if it's strongly advised...thing is i took them before and i sucked! i got really embarrassed and left. but i was quite young then,,,

even tho you're not looking to be on film, one of the things that casting directors love is variety.
just like in hollywood now, you'll notice that all the stars are not double threat, not triple, but quadruple threats.
meaning, sing, dance, act, play instrument(s).
so if you can act, having another talent that will back you up and make you stand out more than other actors, then that's what's best if you want a part.

you can become both singer-actress. but if you don't feel like singing is right for you or stuff, then you can just be one awesome actress. There are a lot of actresses who don't sing, but they can still be awesome!

Honestly? I don't really like the colour of it. It's tipping on the "boring" side.
Instuments are almost NEVER about looks though.
Go to a music store and try it out. See if you like the sound.
If it sounds good, buy it and rock it out on stage.
Keep it cool!

Should I look into Harmonica Types...?



Ok, I'm kinda trying my hardest to learn harmonica, till I've discovered that there are many different kinds.

The kind of harmonica I was trying to use was a (presumably basic) Tobar Metal Harmonica, which I was given one christmas some years ago and never used it much, until I recently tried my hardest to learn it properly, but never got the hang of it. Though I'm not an expert at harmonica anatomy (but never had anyway, since I think the harmonica I used never had instructions), I reckoned either the air-holes felt kinda small to play single notes or the difficulty it is to do whatever it is to give a blues kind of sound. I think inhaling, from which I discovered myself, is a difficulty as well.

Is this normal? Am I using the right kind of Harmonica to start with, or should I try something that suits my needs? Any better suggestions?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Hi Wing

The diatonic harmonica is what they use mostly for blues etc... To get to blow one note requires the use of the tongue to block other notes so that only one note will play.

Then you have the chromatic harmonicas which has 4 notes per hole but contains the complete scale notes like a piano.

As far as I am concerned, the Blues harp made by Hohner is widely used. It comes in different keys.
As for the air holes, all the harmonicas are built the same way.

Hi Patrick, if I had a choice, without hesitation and having owned one prior to this question, the Hummingbird . Not that the D-28 is ot good . I also owned one.
But for the prestige and re-sale value, Gibson for sure. Even soundwise, that guitar alond with their model called The Dove are awesome in sound and durability.

This is a personal taste and I repeat, the D-28 is neck in neck to the Hummingbird.

I just went to Guitar center to try out them, and after playing both for probably 15 minutes each, I think I like the Hummingbird more. It's more mellow, beautiful, and soft, while the D-28 is more clear, cutting, and sharp. Thanks for the input to reinforce my opinion!

The Martin D-28 without question.  The D-28 is the workhorse of the industry used by countless professionals. The Hummingbird is a typical overbuilt Gibson acoustic with lousy tone.

Should I switch singing teachers?



I've always liked singing, especially musical songs. I had a trial singing lesson with a teacher I really liked, we did colours of the wind and he was really nice. He wanted to try and teach me "You've got a friend" from Toy Story and some musical numbers. My sister hated him and stormed out though. So we go to a new one now. But my sister's stopped having singing lessons.

My teacher I've had for about 6 months now is good and has taught me a lot, but now when I sing the songs she does with me I sound like a middle aged woman and my family agrees. All we do is classical and it's BORING. But she's taught me a lot and I've improved-in classical.

I have my singing lessons at school, and miss half of a different lesson each week, it's really convenient and doesn't use my spare time. The other teacher I can walk to from home.

I don't dislike my lessons at school, but I sing so differently with her to how I do naturally at home. My mum always says she prefers my natural singing to how I sing when I practise the songs we do. I always thought I had a deep singing voice, now she's told me I have a really high soprano voice and can hit high notes. I started flute lessons about 10 weeks ago and am taking my grade 3, so I'm ok with theory. I started the singing lessons so that I could take music GCSE. My sister got a C on her performances. I sang the ensemble piece with her and it terrified me, I had tonsillitis and could only squeak the high notes. I sang to my music teacher on my own to see if I could take the GCSE and use that as my performance and she said I could. But now I should reach grade 5 in time for it on flute

I just wondered, is it better to learn classically then move onto other styles of music? Or can I learn with more fun songs just as well? I want to keep singing, but don't know whether I should be taught by a classical teacher, or a fun teacher who asks which songs I'd like to do.

Stay with classical training!  It's healthier for your vocal chords in the long run, and will give you the ability to sing anything.  Classical technique teaches you how to use your voice in a healthy and pleasing manner.  People who sing popular music, and who have never trained, tend to destroy their voices in short order.  So learn to sing right, using the classics, and then branch out into other styles.

classical is not fun, but once you learn classical you can learn anything.  have you seen the movie school of rock?  they were originally classical and switched to rock.  singing jazz is okay fun, but singing swing(a type of jazz) is fun and fast and jumpy.  and fun songs arent always good for your learning.  have you played the recorder?  the first song you played was HOT CROSS BUNS and what if that was a fun song?  would you of played it then?  probably not because you know that you can not learn anything from that.  your teacher knows whats best for you, even though you may not like it, but once you get a little farther into classical singing, you may be ready to start singing different types of music.  good luck.

Is it ever too late to pick up an instrument?



Im only 18 years old, but when you here about all the great guitarists, or vocalists etc. they started when they were like 12. Now im not saying I expect to be in a famous rock and roll band, I look at it as a great hobbie. Im really interested in playing the drums, to get my feet wet, but ive also had a passion for them my entire life and possibly later on slowly learn guitar.

I wanna buy drums pretty soon, but im going to have to go electronic because im in a townhouse. Its hard to save up when I have other payments etc. Im trying to get them as soon as possible because for some reason I feel like im time limitied.

I dont know what kind of answer im looking for, maybe just some imput from other musicians and their opinions.

Thanks in advance!!!

One of my favorite folk musicians never picked up a guitar until he was 29, and he's now 50-something and has a solid career touring the South, the Midwest, and the UK. You could be 70, and it wouldn't be too late to pick up an instrument. It's never too late to do what you love.

I'm a lifelong musician, studying music myself and also a teacher.  It's never too late!  By the time you are 18, though, your reflexes, coordination, and learning curve is very different than when you were 8 or 9.  The older you get, the harder it is to train yourself at musical instruments in general.  I say in general because some people may not experience this, and it may not be true for all musical instruments.  However, this is usually the case.

In teaching adult beginners, I find that they understand everything conceptually, but often lack the patience and discipline necessary to realize their long-term goals. Little kids learn languages easily.  It's the same with music.  You may understand every concept immediately, but it will take real determination and focus to make an instrument truly natural to you.  On the other hand, BB King didn't pick up a guitar until he was like 40 or something, so you never know.

The most important thing I believe is to take things 1 step at a time.  Really master the 1 thing you're working on.  Give it the time it deserves.  Then move on to the next step.  The biggest mistake is trying to take on more than you can handle, and getting frustrated along the way.

A few lessons (or even regular lessons) with the right teacher would be wise, and will motivate you to practice as well.

Good luck to you!

hey, glad you're learning the guitar! truth is, learning an instrument like every other worthwhile and fulfilling thing requires determination and perseverance. yes, it may be easier to learn how to play an instrument when you're quite young because all children do learn faster and acquire and apply information more efficiently, but that shouldn't stop you at all.

true, some instruments are easier learned when young
a good example would be the violin, most pros started young because the form in playing the violin is quite important and the ear is easily trained at a young age.



but i stress, don't let this discourage you, it may be a little more difficult but if you really love your instrument, go play it! if you take the time to play your instrument everyday and make the effort of concentrating on making your licks and riffs cleaner, or staying on beat with your chords or staying in key during a solo, then i assure you, you will get better and better.

learning it and advancing to a higher level will be a testament of your love for your instrument and the culture of music in general,
playing and most of all, enjoying to play your instrument will prove that music for you is an out-of-this-world experience that is an essential part of life and i suppose that's what matters for all of us. all the best

You still have a lot of time to develope your acting skills, a lot of the teenage stars that you see just lose popularity by the time they're adults. You should wate until you are an adult before you really try to get involved with acting agencies. Try going to classes or a performing arts school.

Wow.

The first thing to understand is that the music industry is changing and will never be the same.  One of the things that's happening is that the 'big labels' are drying up and dying--deservedly so.

That's not to say that you can't get to be a producer--bands will still need people with musical taste, a sense of public expectations, and technical savvy.  But as we go further away from Sony-Warner-BMG-Atlantic-London, and more toward indie labels and pay-what-you-want downloads and I-tunes, those major labels are going to be less likely to employ house producers and more likely to enter into distribution deals with bands that self-produce.

So you're going to have to market yourself directly to bands, I think.

Add to that, the big producers more and more are also performers.  Who wouldn't want DangerMouse to take a break from Gnarls and captain their next studio effort?

So your best shot is this:

--Educate yourself thoroughly.  Learn as much as you can about studio production, sound board operation, technical stuff.

--Learn to play--particularly keyboards.  Danger and Visconti and Alan Parsons and all those guys were ready to lay down some keys for their artists if asked.

--Get involved in the live scene.  Run sound professionally.  Play in your own band.  Get computer software like Acid and self-produce your own indie albums.  Network with musicians--pop music after all is a 'people' business and the more people you know, the more gigs you get.

--Keep your pulse on the industry.  Whatever I'm writing today may be out of date next week.

Why should you pay school taxes if you do not have kids in school?  Why should you pay for the fire department, the police department, the Board of Health, community colleges, and numerous other things if you PERSONALLY do not partake of them?  Because you live in a civilized society wherein we value the contributions of others, and supports the necessities of those who have no other recourse.  Would you like to LIVE in a community without any or all of the above? I would not.  I want to know that I live somewhere that HAS a police force, fire department, etc. Some communities have you choose whether you want to take your own trash to the dump, or pay a private hauler.  We do not have to even get INTO health insurance as handled by different countries.

The arts are not FUNDED by taxpayers, but supported to a very limited extent.  Even ticket sales contribute only a small amount.  Most funding comes from patrons and donors who SEE the value of the arts in a developed society. Most other civilized nations do this to a FAR greater extent than the US.  We rank SEVENTEENTH in overall quality of life.  Many of us could surmise the first few that outrank us - but SIXTEEN ahead of us?  It is sobering.



You labeled your question "performing arts research" but gave us no further explanation - leaving us to assume that 1. you are seeking support for a debate topic. or 2. you are a "bomb-tosser" - coming into this forum just to annoy people who clearly DO support the arts. Please clarify your stance.

I've smoked and drunk enough to have paid enough tax for national health pain relief when I am dying, and hope the 'state' doesn't prolong my life unnecessarily.

Theatre, Opera and Dance expand thought - which is a damn good reason for 'taxpayer's money' to be used to fund them. That the money should partly be spent on ensuring that it is not 'few people' who see them is what has to be worked on.

Otherwise 'taxpayer's money' is being used to fund failing schemes for 'disenfranchised kids' which are much more expensive than putting on attractive, well publicised 'shows' with a (subsidised) low ticket price for people who would like to take their children for an exiting evening out, just for once.

This is never as easy as it might seem - when museum entrance fees were dropped the entrance numbers rose enormously, but it was mainly the same nursemaids in Kensington and Bloomsbury taking their charges into the Natural History Museum and the British Museum four times a week rather than once a week instead of new people visiting.

From lowest to highest -- the strings are G D A E.

And given your complete ignorance of music, I would STRONGLY urge you to get a teacher if you actually want to learn to play.

I have been playing violin for nearly 5 years and I strongly recomend you to get a teacher. It will be very hard to learn without one. If you absolutly cant, get some training videos and books at a local music store. Hope you learn!!! Its such a great hobby to pick up. :-)

How terrific that you were given a violin as a present! I hope you will give yourself a present, and arrange for lessons. Some instruments are easier to pick up than others; string instruments don't fall into that category.



The bowing is quite tricky. Then there's the fingering. To get them to happen properly at the same time is quite feat. Then there's tuning the strings. Beyond that, there's applying resin to the bow. How much? How often? What brand?



Please find a teacher. It will increase your pleasure with this instrument dramatically. If you were to teach yourself, you'd learn bad habits that you'd have to unlearn once you did start taking lessons.



Also - a teacher will help you over the rough spots that everyone runs into and help smooth them out so you won't get discouraged and stop playing. They will also suggest appropriate music for your level of ability and your interests, and tell you where to obtain it.

My tip is to firstly concentrate on playing music you enjoy listening to. Go to guitar shops and buy guitar tab of your favourite bands. Get Total Guitar magazine, which contains contemporary tab complete with a CD. Each song in the mag is on the CD with the guitar part, and without it just as a backing track.

Playing acoustic is in theory the same (same tuning) but is a little more demanding than a strat. The strat and other rock guitars have a very low string action, and a cut away body, making playing easier.

Acoustics have a harder string action requiring more accuracy, or bad playing sounds awful. I say get one.

Another good way - I sometimes turn up at the local folk club. They meet in various local pubs and people just bring any instrument and play what they like. As a folk club, most opt for folk songs, but some go for rock and pop music, or rocked up folk songs (eg Thin Lizzy Whiskey In The Jar)

I have a Fender Strat too!  Good choice.

You will find an acoustic a little more difficult to play because of slightly heavier strings, etc.

You need to start learning minor chords and the theory of how chords are formed, relative to their scales. Find some melodic progressions and tempos, e.g:

C / / / - / / / / - Am / / / - F / / / - D / / / - G7 / / / - C / / /

D isn't part of the C 'family' but it's common to include a major chord from a 'neighbouring' family in progressions.

One more - find the lyrics to some simple songs that you really like. By 'simple', I mean ones with not many complicated chord changes.

Then - but a Beatles song-book!

Learn Power Chords! You will have a lot of fun with them, but of course you should still continue to learn more open chords as well.

You will find information about Power Chords, as well as other info for beginners here: http://www.learnguitar.web.surftown.se/p...
Then practice on songs like Polly by Nirvana or practically any Green Day song using your Power Chords. Don't know if that is your type of music, but if it's not then practice on something else... :)

And regarding buying an acoustic... I have an acoustic as well as a Fender Stratocaster. I play the Fender Stratocaster 95 percent of the time...

get an acting teacher so that he/she gets you into plays.  go out for your school theater and that will start your student career.  if there are any movies or shows or films, go for them.  go for all of them.  if your good enough then you will be accepted into a college for the tallented or the acting or the performers ect.  but if your serious then you might want to get an agent.

No.



There are no "easy" instruments.  Its possible on most musical instruments to learn a few simple scales, or basic chords, and learn a couple of elementary tunes within a short period of time.  But that barely qualifies as being able to play.

If you actually want to learn to play the violin or any instrument at a relatively high level of proficiency, to be able to play either off of sheet music or by ear, any tune or piece you want to learn, and do so with good tone, good timing and rhythm and the ability to play well with other musicians, it will take YEARS of study and hard work.

It is NOT easy.

Hi Midg

You cannot do that with a capo because the top and lower E are tunes 1 tone tone. When you want a higher tuning, than the capo comes in handy.
Aside from that, you wll have to retune which should not be a problem. There are only 4 strings that are out of tune.

Best Ukulele for under £50?



I want to know what is the best ukulele for a budget of under £50 in the UK. I have recently took up the Ukulele, with a cheap Vintage Uku, and want something a bit more professional. Also I want to know the easiest way to ensure the cheap uku holds its tune for longer, any tips?

Thank you.

<answer>



Ross H,
Your budget is under $100 US dollars?  I'd check http://www.musiciansfriend.com/navigatio... and buy myself a Lanikai LU-21C.  There are many other ukulele's out there under the $100 price range but I think you'll be happy with this.  As a beginner, I encourage you to get a uke with geared tuners...like those on a guitar.  So much easier to tune.  A ukulele holding it's tune longer?  I don't know about that b/c there are so many different brands of strings.  I'd put Aquila Nylgut strings on it, regardless of what kind of strings it comes with.  These are great strings and make a less expensive uke soung really nice.  I have them on a LU-21C and it really gives it a rich sound.
Check http://ukulelehunt.com/ and see what other folks say on this matter.



Also check http://www.ukuleleclubs.com/ and see if there's a club in your area.  You'll gain knowledge along with lots of fun playing with others.

I'd most likely guess that you sort of lean over the snare drum while you play. You want to sit with your back completely vertical; it will give you a better view of everything and allow your hands to stretch out more.



But even keeping your back vertical will become tiring. I'd recommend exercise as it's probably just a general problem with your back. Weight training, stretching and aerobics can help with that. I read here that pull ups help? Try searching for back strengthening exercises.

Well, there could be a lot of reasons, you may have arthritis in your back. or you might be hunched over too far... or you should just get a chair that has a back on it and try to relax sometimes, When the Drummer in my rap group's back starts hurting he rests for 10-15mins and ices it... so just try some of the stuff i said, and see if it works

its probably posture, or your seat might be at the wrong hight. If you google drum ergonomics or drum seat height there are lots of good articles  on these two. Basically you should sitting up straight and be able to touch the centre of each drum without stretching, and the edge of each crash. And your thighs should be parallel to the floor or sloping down a little towards the bass drum.Tension can also cause back ache, but I know its hard to relax when you start off. Are you female??? If so , do you play cross handed. I think it was a man who put the high hat over on the left. You might want to try playing your high hats with your left hand,especially as you are new to drumming. If you find that easy it will make all sorts of drumming easier.

I'm assuming you know these things already, but I'm just listing them.

*It's a very dark set
*The lighting is done from the side
*The hydraulic lift won't go up unless the actress playing Elphaba has secured the bar around her waist
*The two towers move side to side
*Elphaba, Glinda, and the Ozians all have to be balanced at the end so no one is competing to be heard, but they all overlap smoothly.

I suggest you buy the Grimmerie, there is a large amount of detail set-wise in it.

You might not know...
*There is a separate room entirely for the percussion instruments



That's all I've got.

Stephen Schwartz's website would be helpful too.

Help with school show theme!? (music dance drama)?



the annual "performing arts" show is coming round fast, and all four school houses have been given the same theme to work with.
this theme is
"once apon a time.."
which as you can see is pretty broad.
basically we  (sixth form) have to come up with a 30-45 minute show including music, dance, drama (using some art aswell..e.g props etc.) which has to include students from every year (7-upper sixth)
any suggestions for plot outlines to get us going?
anything that come to mind to start us off..
many thanks.

Copy Disney. At Disney World there is a ride, about Carousel of Progress, it was originally opened at the 1964 worlds fair in NY. The set revolves and there are depictions of progress. Each generation is portrayed surrounded by new inventions.(you don't need to have a revolving stage) The amazing thing about it is that when you reach the last set it was designed to be the future (back in 1964) and is exactly where we are now, maybe slightly behind the times.



I hope you like my idea and find it useful.



The show's original theme song "There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow" and its newly-penned "Now is the Time" were both written by the Oscar®-winning Sherman Brothers.

Like, Cinderella and Prince Charming realising that they weren't right for eachother and getting a divorce?



Or Snow White and Whatshisface having 7 kids?



Or Sleeping Beauty and the Prince never being able to go anywhere or do anything because all she wants to do is sleep?

"The reason for playing softly" is not a motive. Motives are the building blocks for large forms composed during the common practice period and, for some, beyond. Composers who used motives would include Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Mendelssohn and Brahms.

What would be good background music for my investigative drama piece?



As part of my higher course i have to do an investigative drama piece. Our theme is rebellion and the general plot to the play is that this activist shoots a politition because he proposed a bill that she disagreed with. My scene in the play is about the flatmate having a flashback of her friend who killed the politition, rushing about the flat preparing to kill the politition. I kinda thought that maybe something like the music in the copyright advert "you wouldnt steal a car, blah de blah" something kind of beaty and tense like that, any ideas are welcome xD

In Musical Theatre Do They Use Their Head Voice Or Chest Voice? Or do they blend? 0.o?



I’ve been singing for about two years with a teacher (I’m 16) and I feel really confused about the whole head & chest voice. I really really REALLY love musical Theatre, and that’s what I want to do in the future but I’m starting to worry about my vocal range. My singing teacher has an amazing voice but it has an operatic sound to it, so when I’m learning and she’s teaching, I sing a lot in my head voice. When I listen to musical theatre tracks, all the singers have really belty chest voices with a really high range. I can barely reach an A above middle C in my chest voice, and that’s at a push. I read somewhere on the internet about having a good chest to head blend, is that what the singers on the musical tracks do? Do they just have really really strong head voices that sound practically the same as their chest voices? Or do they just use their chest voices for everything? Any type of answer would be really appreciated.

My answer to you is that a trained singer is a trained singer. Stick with your training.



Most very good music theatre performers sing in their mix. We all find a way to extend our mix to get an even sound. If you are singing in your head voice and then your chest voice there is a noticeable difference in the quality of your voice that we try to eliminate. Consistency is key and one of the ways to do that is to study what opera singers are doing and apply it to Music Theatre. You will never find anything more difficult that Opera in the theatre world therefore you will be equipped to handle anything thrown your way. So,  think of it this way, if you can sing opera, you can sing anything. The techniques are the same but learning to sing like an opera singer won't make you and opera singer unless that is what you pursue. You will not become and opera singer unless you want to, it will take much more time and effort and years of training.

Well I'm new to the whole musical theatre and singing, I started taking lessons a few months ago.

When you've had good training, you should really know when you need to sing head, chest or a mix. 
Mostly you should try and sing in mix. This takes practice, so try doing good warm ups to help you achieve this going up and down scales on the piano.



Hope this helps! You should really discuss with your teacher :)

depends on your voice type, if your an alto chances are you sing in your chest voice. but the softer soprano and mezzo parts (like ingenue roles) you will either sing exclusively in your head voice or you will do both. However, some roles require high belting (in other words a high chest voice), but a lot of roles(especially roles from older plays) don't. But your voice does need to be loud.

It really depends on what you are capable of playing on your guitar - but hell, the good old learner one - Pub with no beer has got to be worth considering becaue the words are so amusing.  If you think that your audience won't know the words, then type up sheets for them.

Celia - Paul Simon and then why not have a go at Bridge over Troubled Water - the singing will be awful - but if you are playing it right, that won't matter!

A couple of Beatles ones - She loves you and Eight days a week should do it.

Good luck and where are you playing - I'd love to come along!

I have an alto/ female tenor voice and finding songs that suit my voice are hard... but I find when auditioning female Jazz songs tend to work pretty well.. since they generally had that low sultry voice. I've used songs like Fever by Peggy Lee, My funny Valentine, and almost any song from Chicago... I like using When youre good to Mama.... use something that shows them you arent afraid to be bold and step out there.. if you are really daring there is a song in the musical Godspell called Prepare Yea, Listen to it and if you think you can hit that low C I think it is.. then try... Its beautiful and pretty good for showing what you can do with your voice. But... best of luck and I hope you get what you are looking for.

Ok no i dont really think i can make it that good. Also, Stevie Ray is my fav guitarist as well as Satch. But i really want to become a guitarist for a band or solo artist.

I am already quite good and am fifteen. but im not great. and no were near as good as anyone in a good band. (altho i cud kick those Jones Brothers butts...) Anyway... HELP!

If I wanted to become a great guitarist I would practice solos. Which means you'll need to learn chord progressions in order to know which notes you can play during a solo break.  And you'll need to learn them in all there various fingerings.

Listen to Clapton or Ray and you'll see they have complete command of the guitar fretboard -- they can go anywhere and jump from place to place during a song. .

But in a way it's easy -- listen to a song you like and play a solo along to that song -- you'll get practice in being able to maneuver and you'll learn the chord progressions.

But what really makes these guys famous is their emotion for the music -- so once you learn your instrument -- then practice the feeling.

practice what you love don't waste time on anything your not going to use. practice chords, chord changes, build your lick vocabulary, learn to play your licks over your chord progressions, work on your fills and your embelishments to your chords. study the artist that you admire, read their bio's for inspiration and tips on how they made it, the best place is wikipedia. check out http://www.justinguitar.com for any skills that you might need work on. if you love srv get your hands on every educational dvd, book, etc. that will help you learn his style. set personal goals for yourself such as I'm going to learn this one lick this week. I could go on but I think you get the picture. Email me if you need anything else.

In terms of barr chords you play or the actual amp sound?

If its barr chords you would need to play downstrokes or on the offbeat and throw in quite a few minor barr chords. If its actually the sound you want you need to turn up the reverb (or switch it on if you have a reverb pedal), make sure the bass isnt turned up to loud and the the treble should be about halfway. This combined with the offbeat barr chords should give you an authentic ska sound.

Hope that helps :)



Well all that above explains how to get that type of sound out of your amp. But it depends what amp you have, I have a peavey bandit special and it has a wicked spring reverb built in, if you amp doesnt have a reverb a boss reverb pedal is a good starting point (there about £60), a bit more upmarket would be Jim Dunlop pedals.



With Capdown being on the heavier side of ska punk distortion would be an advantage, again if your amp doesnt have distortion you could buy a pedal (I have a boss bluesbraker it is good for solos but breaks up when playing chords). Don't go too mad with the distortion but make sure theres a crunch to the sound. A clean guitar sound drenched in reverb gives a more classic ska sound. Hope this helps :)

You should check out Eric Friedlander if you are looking for a fresh cellist with new ideas and inspiring performances. I've added links to a great interiew with him and his personal website.

If you want a great "mainstream" cellist, you'll have to look long and hard to find better than Jacqueline du Pre and Yoyo Ma. Sadly, she passed away from MS in 1987, but her music lives on in recordings and some video. Check out the Youtube link below.

Yoyo Ma is alive and well. Just do a search for him on iTunes or Amazon. You'll find plenty of stuff to download. Be sure to get the recordings he did with Edgar Meyer, a great double bassist.

try picking up apaper like "the stage" or something similar (huge whsmiths and boarders tend to sell them) its a paper for people who work in acting and musicals and I would recon there would be some type of insurance brokers advertised in the classified section (at the back) or that paper.

My cousin auditioned there a couple of years back, she told me that not everyone performs in front of the celebrity judges, everyone performs to a judge, but not a celebrity.

If they are very bad, they go through to be on TV and perform in front of the judges, likewise, if they are good they go through.

les dawson and tommy cooper.



my dad went to a tommy cooper live show at blackpool and when it started he walked onto the stage and didnt say a word for the first 5 minutes but the audience couldnt stop laughing the entire time...he just stood at the microphone and just kinda looked around at the audience.
there isnt too many comedians who have that presence in which just a look can bring out laughter.

i think of all the modern day comedians jack dee and lee evans are the only ones close to being able to do that

Dear old Tommy Cooper.  My favourite joke of his was when he went to the doctor and said...Doctor, I keep thinking I'm a moth.  The Doctor said, you don't need to see me, you need a psychiatrist.  Tommy said, I know.  I was on my way there but your light was on!

A good beginners guitar that doesn't have flaws that will stunt your learning, will run you 150-200. I recommend a squier, they may not have the best tone, but they have the right intonation and you won't be frustrated with tuning problems.



Its not hard to learn, and i can't say if an acoustic or electric is better for you right now, you just have to play guitars yourself and find your taste.

A good storyteller is a person that gets the 'audience' (whoever that may be) so involved in the story that the lines between reality and the story become blurred - i.e. the people listening (or reading) almost believe it as a true fact. That was advice given to me by my good Texan friend who is Chairman of Theatre and Literature Arts at San Antonio university in the USA

Ok so what makes a good storyteller???

Well to me, it would be the following:
A good storyteller is someone who can think outside the box, get inside the characters mind, be the character, understand the emotions that go through their mind, and such like this.

Hope this helps some how. =P

A hook, you have to have a hook. You need to draw the listener in with a phrase, sound, expression. The anti-climax is important to a storyline and the climax has to be rewarding to the listener or reader.
Inflections in the voice heighten the curiosity of the listener as well.
Using descriptive adjectives, helps the listener envision what is being said and properly placed memorable phrases capture the audience.

A good story teller is well acquainted with the story he plans to read/tell; he knows how to build tension by using his voice: by  speaking with emphasis, nearly whispering or using other vocal effects to enhance his story. He will, from time to time, if he is reading the story, make eye contact with his listeners, particularly when something momentous is about to occur. A good story teller knows when to pause in telling the story to heighten the suspense. A good story teller who is telling,not reading, observes the rules above but he also uses a conversational intimate tone when recounting the story points that are not highly dramatic and he chooses language that is easily understood buy all his listeners.He also allows his eyes to reach those of each of his listeners at one point or another to establish a bond.

Could a bassoon reed or an oboe reed fit in my bombard?



Hi! :) I've just bought a breton bombard and it came with two double reeds, one plastic made and the other wood made... I've just imagined how would sound my bombard with an oboe or bassoon reed on it... I want to order some reeds... but... i'd don't like to lose money... Would the reeds fit on my bombard? would they make my bombard sound like a bassoon or an oboe alike?

Any ideas for an interesting drama piece?



With my drama devised piece coming up I started to think of topical issues that my group could portray. It has to be a current issue in today's news and my group and I decided we are going down the serious route. We are wanting to really make the audience think about the issue.
Any ideas would be really helpful.
If you came to see our play was issues would interest you?
Thanks, CA

How about doing a piece on what you're going to do when you graduate/finish your course.

Persuamably you all have different ideas. Uni/Work in the chippy/sell drugs on the street corner. It gives you the chance to be very diverse with the characters, and you can take the story in any direction you want. You can comment on the recession, the fact jobs are harder to get, or how people abuse social security systems. There's a real scope to talk about what young people are worried about today, and you have a great platform to do it.

Or you could do something on bunnies. They're always fun.

Why don't you do something about consumerism - along the lines of two groups - one could be a group of western teenagers all wanting the latest goods.. maybe someone getting bullied for not having the trendiest trainers etc or maybe a teenager being really horrible to their parent wanting a particular branded t-shirt etc - then cut to the parent working their fingers to the bone.. and struggling to pay the bills due to credit crunch - hikes in fuel/utility etc

On the flip side - then show the people who actually make the clothes/shoes - show children in sweatshops, under terrible conditions, malnourished, working long hours for a pittance a day etc etc



Word it in a such a way which makes the audience think about how stupid it is that a pair of trainers which cost £1 to make are sold for £80 and how sinster marketing means that they are deemed to offer the wearer higher social acceptance.. show the human cost - both for the workers, the parents of both sets of kids and also for the spoilt teenagers who may not think about the story behind the goods..

Maybe you could also add something at the end about fairtrade..

Good luck

How about setting it on the rise in knife/gun crime and set it around the people who are effected such as friends and family and even the attacker(s). You could probably change the knife theme into drink driving/speeding or anything else dangerous and still base it on those who are effected by those who commit these crimes.

I am doing my GCSE drama exam at the moment.



Look up 'Wings to fly'

An amazing and moving 45 minute script about how easily drugs creep onto the drug scene and how it can change your life or end it forever, very moving and written really well



good luck

When I did mine (it was a few years ago now) we chose to focus on dreams. We looked at ours for the future, losing your dreams, other peoples dreams, and how other peoples dreams can be your own nightmare. Our piece ended up looking at how the search for Utopia and the perfect dream society led to Hitler and the Nazis ruling Germany. A little cliched, but it worked for us.



For inspiration why dont you pick something as a starting point. When I used to teach Drama, I used to give my students a song, or a poem, or a picture, or sometimes just an object like a scarf and get them to start thinking about what it means to them, how they feel, interact, react to it. Get everyone in your group to bring something in, and then take it from there. You might be surprised what develops.

Good Luck with it all, and just remember that in devised pieces, the process is just as important as the end performance!!!!
