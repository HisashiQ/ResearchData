Your best bet is loperamide (found in immodium).  However if you have a stomach bug it's probably best that you let the bug out and don't keep it in with stopping the diarrhoea.

Immodium is good for that but if you have a stomach bug you should let the diarrhoea run its course.  Your body is trying to purge itself of something so best to just keep yourself hydrated while it does so.

Be on the B.R.A.T. Diet  =  Bananas ,Rice,Applesauce and Toast.



First day mostly liquid diet - keep drinking something or the other everytime - recommended is mineral water  - after every motion - u may also drink apple juice .



Sip lemon tea - it will soothe n relax your tummy and help in reducing ur motions n tummy pain.



when u have to eat anything - dont forget the brat diet - it will get u thru it - avoid dairy products - although yogurt is believed to have the good bacteria to help fight a stomach infection n soothe ur tummy.



go easy on ur food - also include jello in ur diet - it definitely helps



hope u get better very very soon!

I am breaking out in mouth ulcers?? Any reason why?



I have a pretty good (I think) dental hygiene routine, I brush; floss; mouth rinse twice a day as it is.
I have become a vegetarian in the past month which is when they started but I can only think MAYBE that is because I am eating more citrus fruits?
I don't have herpes simplex (cold sores, kissing disease), or ANY other STI's I've been checked for it.
I am also very healthy over all with no other signs of sickness.
So any ideas what could be causing it?
Thanks

Probably not the thing you wanted to hear but I think you're suffering from a lack of vitamins and minerals.



If you're going to become a vegetarian there are tons of vitamins and minerals you get from meat that you need to really supplement by eating WAY more vegetables for.  Take something like a multivitamin for the next 4-5 days and you'll probably see an improvement.



Do some more research and make sure you're getting your RDA of vitamins and minerals through your new vegetarian diet.

I have struggled with sleep issues most of my life. I think times of the day and depending on if you are a morning, evening or nocturnal plays into it. I am a morning person.



I suggest good sleep leading up to the days you will stay up late. Exercise to exhaust yourself days before and this will help with the pre sleep leading up to the late nights you need to stay awake.



Ice water seems to help. If you are driving have the temperature cold in the car. I will pull over, stop the car and run around the car once to wake myself up. Anything that adds a level of discomfort, thinking or annoyance to keep your brain alert. I hope this helps! Good luck!

Geez. Roy there is at least one exact answer to your question, and that is sleep apnea. While you are sleeping and going through your bio rythmns, your heart slows way down and momentarily stops several times during the night. When you get older and your system starts to age, it can forget or "misfire" during these periods and fail to restart the heart. This is sleep apnea. And the person dies. It is not a heart attack, although I suppose that this could occur. It is called sleep apnea and people die from it all the time.

Before deciding to use this or ANY drug recreationally, whether your own script or over the counter, make sure you research it!!! I can't emphasize responsible use and harm reduction enough here. Telling someone not to do it is pretty pointless if they already have their mind made up, so its best to educate.



Anyways, Triple C's are Psuedoephedrine, and falling into the Ephedrine family, they have stimulant properties that are similar to but weaker then amphetamines.



The normal dosage is 60mgs or 2 tripple Cs. A safe recreational dosing would be 120 mgs or 4 tripples Cs (since this much comes in a slow release formula). Using high doses can cause hallucinations, sleeplessness, irritability, irregular heartbeat, dehydration, and physcosis, so be careful.  In extremely high doses, death has resulted.

Inheritance of blood type can be complicated. You may have group "A" blood, but have genes for both groups "A" and "O." Because "A" group is stronger or dominant, your blood will be group "A." However, you can give your children genetic material for either group "A" or "O." The same is true of "B" group. If both "A" and "B" genetic material is given to your child, the child will have group "AB" blood. A child with genes for "O" from both parents will be group "O." The chart on the following page shows this pattern.



Father's blood group  &



Mother's blood group  =  Child's blood group



O  & A



= O OR A
O  & B



= O OR B
O & AB  = A OR B
B & A



= O OR A OR AB



AB & A  = A OR B OR AB
B & B



= O OR AB
A & A



= O OR B



O & O  = O

Did you pull a muscle?  Try a hot bath.



It might be costochondritis.  Look that up, there's not much you can do for it.  I've provided you with a basic link to get you started....



Excerpt:



Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects a rib to the breastbone (sternum). It causes sharp pain in the costosternal joint — where your ribs and breastbone are joined by rubbery cartilage. Pain caused by costochondritis may mimic that of a heart attack or other heart conditions.



Your doctor might refer to costochondritis by other names, including chest wall pain, costosternal syndrome and costosternal chondrodynia. When the pain of costochondritis is accompanied by swelling, it's referred to as Tietze syndrome.



Most cases of costochondritis have no apparent cause. In these cases, treatment focuses on easing your pain while you wait for costochondritis to resolve on its own.

If you stop breathing, does the pain stop?



I sometimes get that, but only at a CERTAIN point in inhaling (about 3/4 of an inhale).
What i do is, breathe short/shallow, so it doesn't get to that painful point in the breath. it passes quickly.



If it's that, don't worry. It'll pass, and it's just your intercostal muscles (muscles between your ribs) freaking out. :) , which is nothing.

I hope you believe in GOD.  When you let go whatever you thinking on
so hard, and let him take over your life you will realize how it's the small stuff your holding on to.  Pray that he will take the depression
away so you can start living again. Leave the liquor alone that's making
it worst. When your two beautiful little ones see you like this, they think it's alright to act depress as well.

I am assuming you are female. Is it at at a particular point  in the month when you feel low? if so it could be hormonal. otherwise i think you are probably just very stressed about things which you have on your mind. talking to your gp wouldn't halm but be very careful as they tend to dish out anti depressants when they aren't needed. Anti depressants can also make you feel sad. Maybe councilling would help or chat to your partner about how you feel. Hope you feel happier soon.

Depakote is a drug for the treatment of  manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for epilepsy, chronic pain associated with neuropathy and migraine headaches. Below are excerpts from Wikipedia:



"Valproate semisodium (INN) or divalproex sodium (USAN) consists of a compound of sodium valproate and valproic acid in a 1:1 molar relationship in an enteric coated form. It is used in the UK and U.S. for the treatment of the manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and increasingly taken long-term for prevention of both manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder, especially the rapid-cycling variant. It is also used in the US for the treatment of epilepsy, chronic pain associated with neuropathy, and migraine headaches. Its chemical name is sodium hydrogen bis(2-propylpentanoate). The extended release formulation allows for a single daily dose.



In the UK semisodium valproate has been sold for a few years as the proprietary drug Depakote and marketed for psychiatric conditions only. It is about five times the price of sodium valproate, which has been marketed for around 30 years as Epilim by the same company for epilepsy and is also available from other manufacturers as a generic product."



My friend who has diabetic neuropathy had taken it and said that he encountered a mild case of vomiting, loss of appetite and a dark urine. But he had to discontinue upon doctor's advice.



Good luck to you.

Bits floating in my urine?



I had a urethritis a few months ago from ureaplasma. It was supposed to be cleared up with antibiotics, but it came back again, not sure why.



Anyway, my doc said that it has cleared up again. He said that my urine test was negative and I had no bacteria, but I'm not sure.



When I piss into two glasses (for first stream and mid-stream) the first stream glass always has small bits floating around in it. Even if I go only an hour or so later it still has bits floating in it.



Is this normal?

Try stretching more before and after your class.  It sounds like your muscles are tight after being worked.  This happens a lot to body builders after a leg workout.



Also, try eating a banana after your class.  The potassium will help with the cramping.

There are lots of possible reasons for this.



You hurt your thigh while exercising, maybe before you had properly warmed up, usually you don't feel that pain until the next day.



You slept ackwardly and so your thigh was in a bad position.



Maybe you had a cramp while sleeping, but it didn't wake you up.



Finally you may have done something, maybe jumping or turning, that just pushed that muscle too far, and you don't even remember doing it.



Just stretch your thighs, add some heat rub to the sore one and it should get better in a few days.

There are several things that I do and either do one or all of them depending on how I feel.  A cup of hot milk or hot cocoa made with milk.  That's a natural remedy.  If you exercise a good amount during the day it helps to get to sleep.  A hot bath will also relax you.  I wake up several times a nite and can't get back to sleep, so I always have a book handy right beside the bed.  Usually I can read anywhere from 1 to 4 chapters before I start to feel sleepy again.  Also, having a cool dark room is great.  Hope that helps.

Maybe do some gym earlier on in the evening. That nice refreshing feeling you get after gym always feels good and sets a good mood.



Really, just do something you like. Read fan fiction or online comics or stories maybe, like I'm doing now. Fun little things that wind you down and don't take much exertion.

Stay away from caffeinated beverages (coffee, sodas, teas) or foods (like chocolate or energy bars) after 6PM.  Don't exercise less than 2 hours before you'd be going to sleep.  In the hour or so before you want to go to sleep, just relax in a room that's warm, calm and the not too brightly lit.  Some suggestions for relaxing are to read, listen to mellow music, watch tv or movies, or meditate.



You can also try to play mellow calming music, or use one of those nature sound machines very lightly in the background as you try to go to sleep.  Also, we all have biorhythms that regulate our sleeping patterns and everyone's is different.  I find that if I go to bed too early that I will lay wide awake in bed for a longtime, whereas if I wait until 11:30 (or whatever time works for you) I can fall asleep within 10-15 minutes.



When I have a really bad bout of insomnia that lasts for a few days, I'll try and exercise a lot during the day so that I'll be tired when it's bedtime.  Something to consider is whether your insomnia occurs for more than 2 nights at a time.  Could there be things on your mind that keep you up?

there is no such serious risks as the whole procedure is done under aseptic technique and its very brief and minor. nothing to worry much infact you doing the most humanitarian act i believe. your doctor prior to donation shall explain the minor complications like infection or bleeding and the way to prevent them. otherwise its totally safe and quite helpful act. Bless you.

No, you are not risking your life. However, if you are matched and chosen as a donor, the process of removing your bone marrow is a little painful. The will stick a coring needle into (usually) your hip bone to remove the marrow. It hurts but it is worth it! You will probably take ibuprofen for 2-3 days afterwards.

Any clue what's wrong with me?



Sunday night, I began to get the chills. My bones ached, and i started to feel dizzy as well. I went to sleep with many blankets and layers, and took a tylenol for the pain. I figured I'd get over it soon enough. The next day, my dizziness was very strong. When I moved my eyes back and forth there was a great deal of pain. My bones still ached, and this time they even hurt when I would lay down. Only this time, I would feel hot and then cold, then hot and cold. I stuck it out one more night.



Around 2 or 3 AM, I woke up 3 different times drenched in sweat, shivering because it was so cold. The temperature in my room was average, there was no reason to be sweating. My dad told me it was because I broke my fever. So I didn't worry.



We're on to Tuesday (yesterday). ALL my symptoms were gone, besides the fact that now I'm just barely dizzy (only when I make sudden movements) and my throat hurts to swallow. This is not the kind of pain as in a sore, scratchy throat. This feels more like a pain in the far back roof of my mouth where I begin to swallow. Someone told me they had all these same symptoms, and after a day of the painful throat, they got better.



But how come it is Wednesday now, and I have awoken 4 times just this morning drenched in sweat? My throat doesn't feel better either.

You need to go see a doctor. You could have strep throat and the only cure for that is antibiotics. Its also very important to treat strep throat and take all of your antibiotics. Go call the doctor.

Could really be anything, possible just another variation on the flu, you are getting better so I would think the problem has passed.



I would suggest going to a doctor, they would do a blood test and give you antibiotics while you wait for the results.

Could be the flu or strepthroat.  Possibility tonsilitis.  Have you been taking your temperature.  You need to do that a couple times of day.  The sweating is a good sign that you have a fever and it breaks but then comes back.  However, you can get chills and sweats but still have a normal temperature, this is why you need to take your temperature to make sure.  Regardless, a fever for a few days is not good.



Say, "Ahhhh," and have someone check your throat for white splotches in the back (Strep) or inflamed tonsils.  If your throat is just red then it's more likely that you have the flu with a sore throat.  However, sometimes a really bad cold can simulate flu-like symptoms.



Either way, you should see a doctor to determine if you might have a viral or bacterial infection, which is treated differently.
---------------------
STREP
Sore throat that comes on rapidly.
Difficulty swallowing.
Headaches.
Fever, sometimes greater than 102° F.
A raw, red appearance to the back of the throat.
White pus on tonsils.
Tender, high lymph nodes in neck.
Rash.
Absence of a cough, stuffy nose, or other upper-respiratory symptoms.

Bits floating in my urine?



I had a urethritis a few months ago from ureaplasma. It was supposed to be cleared up with antibiotics, but it came back again, not sure why.



Anyway, my doc said that it has cleared up again. He said that my urine test was negative and I had no bacteria, but I'm not sure.



When I piss into two glasses (for first stream and mid-stream) the first stream glass always has small bits floating around in it. Even if I go only an hour or so later it still has bits floating in it.



Is this normal?

Lately I have been getting bronchitis every couple of months. Doctor cannot find out why. Any advice?



I used to not get bronchitis up until a few months ago. I will get it and it will go away after treatment. Then a month will go by and I will get it again. This is now the 3rd time of getting this with in a few short months. I have taken x-rays of my lungs which show up with nothing wrong. the doctors also did a bunch of blood work which didn't show up with anything serious. I am tired of this because it is affecting my work life etc. Does anyone have any other advice??? I would appreciate it.

</answer from>



<answer>



Perhaps you have a low immune system which is making you prone to infections like bronchitis. Perhaps a blood test could determine if you are deficient in anything, and eating a balanced diet and taking multi-vitamins could help.

Slowly sipping a glass of cold water or sucking an ice cube can sometimes stop a bout of hiccups.A variation is to bend your head forwards over a glass of water and slowly sip from the other side of the rim.These remedies may work,probably because most people breathe relatively little as they sip,thereby increasing their body's carbon dioxide level.The rhythmic contractions of the oesophagus induced by slow sipping and swallowing also overrride the spasms of the diaphragm.

How would you stay awake during a college lecture without the use of caffeine?



Okay, so I've had a short, night filled with paper writing, and the following morning I haul myself out of bed with the gusto a large cinder block.



I know for a fact that lecture today is going to be more dull than usual. So, how do I go about staying alert during class without coffee, energy drinks and the like, as they give me a bad case of the jitters?



Thank you for your time!

B 12 can help mental function and clarity.  Some B 12 drinks give an energy kick similar to caffeine but without the jitters and the crash afterward.



Two that I use are Awake and Mocha Tonics.  They are both available on this web site:  http://www.free2bme.ws

1. Eat a healthy breakfast. If you actually take the time to eat a healthy breakfast than you will definitely have the energy that you need to make it through the day. Many people unfortunately choose to skip breakfast and just figure they will make up for it by eating a large lunch. Remember also that you burn the largest amount of calories in the morning so there is nothing wrong with eating a full breakfast.



2. Try exercising during the day. A lot of people choose to use their lunch hour as a great time to eat light and go for a walk. This will also help to wake you up, if you begin to feel drowsy throughout the course of the day. Many people, who work at a desk, say that they usually start feeling a little sleepy a little more toward the afternoon.



3. Chew gum instead. One thing that many have tried is chewing gum. You may think that it sounds a little silly and are probably saying that this is something that will never work, but you should just give it a try.

Does exposure to gas affect my health?



I live in rural ireland and my boyfriend's uncle who is 80 and lives with us keeps leaving the gas cooker on at all times of the day with just the gas running.  Most of the time, we notice pretty quick and get the windows opened etc.  The uncle is 80 with alzheimers and is waking up at all hours of the morning.  He has been leaving it on while we we've been sleeping. Luckily, each time, since I'm a light sleeper catch it most times. Yesterday, I was really tired and my boyfriend and I were sleeping. I woke up to the smell of gas, and we turned off the gas.  A little while later I was throwing up, had a huge headaches and my stomach was sore.  Today, I had to take the day off sick. This happens all the time.  There is also the range which the use here in rural ireland that gives off smoke that makes me sick as well when they are burning the turf in the range.  The symptoms go away after a few days but is my health with continual exposure to gas and smoke going to be affected in the long term. My boyfriend tells me to chill out everytime the house is filled with smoke and when his uncle leaves the gas on even though I tell him, if he leaves it on while we're all asleep we called all die from it.  He refuses to get help (nurse etc or put his uncle in a home-my bf is his uncle's carer and he lives with us). He says I'm overacting and refused to take me to the docs after I was throwing up all last night. How will constant exposure to gas and smoke affect my health in the long wrong?  Help.

How to Stop Worrying
Self-Help Strategies for Anxiety Relief



Worrying can be helpful when it spurs you to take action and solve a problem. But if you’re preoccupied with “what ifs” and worst-case scenarios, worry becomes a problem of its own. Unrelenting doubts and fears are paralyzing, not motivating or productive. They sap your emotional energy, send your anxiety levels soaring, and interfere with your day-to-day life–all this with no positive payoff! The good news is that chronic worrying is a mental habit you can learn how to break. You can train your brain to stay calm and collected and to look at life from a more positive perspective.

Why is it so hard to stop worrying?
Why You Keep Worrying
You have mixed feelings about your worries. On one hand, your worries are bothering you - you can't sleep, and you can't get these pessimistic thoughts out of your head. But there is a way that these worries make sense to you. For example, you think:



Maybe I'll find a solution.



I don't want to overlook anything.



If I keep thinking a little longer, maybe I'll figure it out.



I don't want to be surprised.



I want to be responsible.



You have a hard time giving up on your worries because, in a sense, your worries have been working for you.



Source: The Worry Cure: Seven Steps to Stop Worry from Stopping You, Robert L. Leahy, Ph.D.
Constant worrying takes a heavy toll. It keeps you up at night and makes you tense and edgy during the day. You hate feeling like a nervous wreck. So why is it so difficult to stop worrying?



For most chronic worriers, the anxious thoughts are fueled by the beliefs–both negative and positive–they hold about worrying.



On the negative side, you may believe that your constant worrying is harmful, that it’s going to drive you crazy or affect your physical health. Or you may worry that you’re going to lose all control over your worrying–that it will take over and never stop.



On the positive side, you may believe that your worrying helps you avoid bad things, prevents problems, prepares you for the worst, or leads to solutions.



Negative beliefs, or worrying about worrying, add to your anxiety and keep worry going. But positive beliefs about worrying can be even more damaging. It’s tough to break the worry habit if you believe that your worrying protects you. In order to stop worry and anxiety for good, you must give up your belief that worrying serves a positive purpose. Once you realize that worrying is the problem, not the solution, you can regain control of your worried mind.



Worry and anxiety self-help tip #1: Accept uncertainty
The inability to tolerate uncertainty plays a huge role in anxiety and worry. Chronic worriers can’t stand doubt or unpredictability. They need to know with 100 percent certainty what’s going to happen. Worrying is seen as a way to predict what the future has in store, a way to prevent unpleasant surprises and control the outcome. The problem is, it doesn’t work.



Thinking about all the things that could go wrong doesn’t make life any more predictable. You may feel safer when you’re worrying, but it’s just an illusion. Focusing on worst-case scenarios won’t keep bad things from happening. It will only keep you from enjoying the good things you have in the present. So if you want to stop worrying, start by tackling your need for certainty and immediate answers.



Challenging intolerance of uncertainty: The key to anxiety relief
Ask yourself the following questions and write down your responses. See if you can come to an understanding of the disadvantages and problems of being intolerant of uncertainty.



Is it possible to be certain about everything in life?



What are the advantages of requiring certainty, versus the disadvantages? Or, how is needing certainty in life helpful and unhelpful?



Do you tend to predict bad things will happen just because they are uncertain? Is this a reasonable thing to do? What is the likelihood of positive or neutral outcomes?



Is it possible to live with the small chance that something negative may happen, given its likelihood is very low?



Adapted from Accepting Uncertainty, Centre for Clinical Interventions



Worry and anxiety self-help tip #2: Create a worry period
It’s tough to be productive in your daily life when anxiety and worry are dominating your thoughts. Trying to stop worrying doesn’t work - at least not for long. You can distract yourself for a moment, but you can’t banish your anxious thoughts for good. Trying to do so often makes them stronger. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do to control your worry. You just need to try a different approach. Rather than trying to totally suppress an anxious thought, develop the habit of postponing worrying.

Yoga is actually one of the best stress busters and it can really help you control your emotions and your life. It can be practiced by anyone. It can improve your mental and physical abilities. It can give you great power, confidence, flexibility, great health and shape. Meditation calms you down and helps you free your mind.But don't try the asanas by yourself by looking at pictures. You need to have a good tutor by your side. I tried Yoga myself and I'm very happy right now. So go for it.

Aww, i hate being sick! always really sucky! I hope you'll feel better really soon.
Try having something like tea, or i think its like warm water or milk or something and honey, that might sooth ur throught. Drink lots of liquid, eat lots of vitamin c (oranges stuff like that), Dont have lots of milk. And just rest a lot i guess. I know having to miss school might suck, but make it fun and relaxing, and just let urself get better. Do stuff like colour, or do wordsearches or other stuff like that that you havent done for a while. Watch ur fave movie, write something, have a long warm relaxing bath. Make it something you will like, and that will make u feel better.

Okay, if it's that bad, you should be going to a doctor, you could have an ear infection, or it can turn into something worse.



But if you can't get to one, drink lots of fluids, even though it might hurt your throat, eat a lot of soup with nutrients in it, and take vitamins. Get plenty of sleep, and stop staring at the computer screen! :) Perhaps putting on some soothing music would be good too. Make sure to keep warm as well.

Sorry to hear that you are not sleeping well - sadly either being unable to get off to sleep and/or waking up early can be part of depression.  I have had times of depression in my life, also am on the menopause now, so know all about bad sleep!



Maybe you could go and have a word with the doctor who prescribed those tablets, telling him/her that you still cannot sleep on them.  It may be that you could take a different tablet or take it at a different time of day.  I know that antidepressants like Prozac or Seroxat can cause sleeplessness if taken later in the day....I was on Amitryptilline (?spelling) when I had a bad time of depression, and that really helped me sleep if I took it before bed.



(That is a different and older sort of antidepressant than Prozac etc.)



One tablet that is available over the counter and should be safe for most people, is an antihistamine called Phenergan in the UK - it is cheap and if you take 25mg or so an hour before bed, it can help knock you out!  Nytol is similar, but costs more.  Ask at your local pharmacy, but mention what other tablets you are taking, just to be on the safe side.



My family doctor said it was good to have a regular bedtime routine, trying not to do anything too demanding (ie not chat online or do Yahoo answers!) for a couple of hours before bed, not too much caffeine late in the day, listen to music/watch TV/read before bed.....praying works for me!

I remember an exercise I was recommended back when i used to have the sleep issues.  Hope this would help you..



This would take you hardly 15- 20 minutes.  Before going to sleep, lie down on leveled surface without a pillow.  With eyes closed, try to get all of the worrying thoughts out of your mind.  Stretch your toes (not to the point that it causes discomfort for you), keep it so for a count of 10 or so, then relax the toes for another 2 minutes.



Next, do it with your calf muscles, tightening it and then relaxing the same way as above with counts.



Then your thighs and abdomen.



With chest, inhale in as much as air as you can and pause for a second and then exhale very slowly.  Do it for 2-3 times.



Next, lift up your head slight to a comforable level and then the counts as before.  Then, slowly relax it back.



Once you finish, try to loosen all your body muscles with eyes closed.  By now, you would feel a bit tired and a strong need to relax.  Lie down and relax for at least 10 minutes.  Leave all your worries and troubles out of your mind, imagine  a beautiful scenary or a natural place you would love to be at.  When you feel comfortable, slowly open your eyes.  I felt personally good after doing so for 2 weeks.



Hope this was of some help to you...



PS:  Please note that every time you do with each muscle, try to concentrate on that particular part of your muscle and forget about the sarrounding noises.

Toddler- weird symptoms, what could it be?



I take care of a 2 1/2 year old and I'm concerned about her health. She has had diarahra for going on two weeks. For months she has had very poor looking toenails, there was a couple times the toe nail just split at the bottom and fell off! Also her legs look puffy to me and have for months. I've let her mom know of my concerns and she has not taken them seriously. Could these symptoms be correlated to a disease or deficency of some sort?
Oh yes- another thing, she does eat non food items such as dirt, paper, anything she can get her hands on. I don't think its the extremity of pica but still odd.

Yes, all tests will show this light use, urine test will show it about a month from last use. Hair test will show it for about 3 months.  Most non governmental job testing is by urine, it is cheaper and faster.

Marijuana stays in your system for anywhere from a week to a month. There are certain ways to get the thc out of you though. But there's also a lot of stupid things that don't work, like drinking vinegar...



Best way to not have marijuana show up on a drug test is not to smoke 20-30 days before. But if your in dire need, drink a lot of water, and go running! The best way to get marijuana out of your system is threw sweat and piss. So drink a ton of water, and go running a lot in really hot clothes, a trash bag will also make you sweet a ton.

Yes. Stop smoking pot. Find a hobby that does not involve drugs. Try running, weightlifting(wanna rush... work up to a lot of weight and then realize no body is gonna mess with you.

Usually where the staples or stitches are, hair won't grow back. But the hair around it should grow normally and cover up the bald spots where the stitches were. But they are stitches so it shouldn't be much of a bald spot. That's all I know.



I hope your surgery went well!

you grow your hair back the same way you do after a hair cut, you wait.  If you have patches that were damaged by the surgery, then it is likely it will never grow back there, just grow the hair around it longer to cover that patch.

As long as it is not a hard workout you should have no problems. I give blood on a regular basis. I ride my bike to and from the lab. It is 8 miles away.  I do avoid things like weight lifting on donor days. Normal soccer should not be a problem.



You appear to be female, you may have a slight tiredness problem because of your iron levels.  The iron level test given before you give blood checks the level for safety to you but not to an athlete.  If you take any multi with iron on a regular basis you should have no iron problem.
Be sure to drink a lot of replacement fluids well before your game and of course while playing.

Look out of your window and out of your head. Focus on a tree, then a bush, then a blade of grass, then a flower and keep doing that for a few minutes. If it is going to help then it will help very soon. Maybe go for a walk afterwards. If that doesnt help then try caffiene (coffee mixed with milk on a 3 parts coffee and 1 part milk and sugar to taste) and you may want a nap, a cool cloth, an ice pack, a warm pack or whatever helps. Headaches are no fun and I dont envy you. But I really honestly hope this helps. Sophia

if u dont have anything you can take at your house, theres a few different possibilities. headaches can be caused by being dehydrated or hungry so think about how much u eat/water u drink. to get rid of it, i have heard that the smell of oranges stimulates something in your brain and gets rid of them. also u might wanna sit in a quiet place and jus relax and think about other things to get your mind off of it for like a half hour; maybe take a nap. i heard this weird theory too that if u keep squeezing the skin above ur lip under ur nose it goes away. noo idea if its true, never really wanted to try it. hope u feel better.

Depends on what's causing it.  Ginger tea is supposed to be good.  Lots of people use 7up or sprite- but don't drink it unless it's lost some of its carbonation otherwise you could wind up vomiting.  Pepto Bismal is a good all around cure but if you have food poisoning- not much will help- just needs to run its course.  Mint can also help.

Drink 2 glasses of water back to back. This dilutes the stomach acid and will help get that unruly thing back under control. If it doesnt help in about 20 to 30 minutes try and OTC remedy. I know water tastes yukky but it does work. If it is really nasty put ice in it. Sophia

My son gets this weird smell to his breath sometime and i don't know what it is from, usually he gets symptoms of a cold or he gets diarriah, but he never acts sick or anything... anyone know what could cause this? he is 19months old its not just a morning breath thing either because he has it all day long even after eating and brushing his teeth, and it only last for a few days or so.

Could be something as simple as a lymph node or a cebacious cyst. Provided they don't grow quickly or cause a lot of discomfort, I wouldn't worry about them too much. You can have your doctor look at them the next time that you are in.

If someone sleeps more than 8 hours per day do you consider them to be lazy?



Let's assume we're talking about a normal adult. What if the person who likes to sleep cuts down on other activities, such as watching TV or playing games, to make up the time, are they still lazy?
What if someone is more productive when they get more sleep?

Some people just naturally need more or less sleep than others. If they are sleeping excessively though there are concerns about depression or other medical conditions being at cause. As well oversleeping can actually make you more tired. But if it's something regular - like say they need 9-10 hours and are productive while awake...don't worry on it.

Most people can manage with 8 hours, but some need more,especially teenagers.



The determinant of whether or not a person is lazy is not when or how much they sleep, but what they accomplish when they're awake.



Sleeping less should allow you to accomplish more, but if you can't function without the sleep, then get more sleep.



Needing more than 9 or 10 hours, however, indicates a problem.

Everyone's circadian (sleep-wake cycle) clock is different.  Some people have distrupted sleep cycles so at face value it appears they sleep more than average when in fact they stop & restart the REM stage several times in a night.  That's my long answer for no as long as they aren't couch potatoes or are unproductive.

I consider it unhealthy, not lazy - there have been recent studies done that show that people who get 7-8 hours of sleep a night (not more, not less) have much better habits - like they smoke less, drink less, use drugs less, exercise more, eat healthier, etc.  I think there is a correlation there, personally.

There are many reasons for having to sleep longer than 8 hours per night.



Some of the reasons for sleeping longer are given by others.  It is true that we are all different and all need varying amounts of sleep.  Of course, many of us wish we could sleep much less and there are a some folks who can do so.



There are also people who may have sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Most often, this will be obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The ineffective sleep causes one to continue to be tired.  This can be fixed by a sleep study to determine if one has SDB.  The sleep study will then tell what treatment will help, if any is required.  In a case such as this, one couldn't be called lazy for sleeping more than usual.  One's body is simply requiring longer sleep to make up for a lack of quality sleep.



Sleep deprivation is serious.  Those who are sleep deprived drive a vehicle equivalently to one who is drunk, so there is no doubt that the lack of quality sleep is a great problem in this world.  Those who are heavier tend to have more SDB, so as our country becomes more obese, the sleep disorders become more common.



I used to sleep 12-14 hours, and then had a sleep study.  Now, I have a continuous positive airway pressure machine and a mask that I wear at night.  I now sleep about 8-9 hours a night, and I like sleeping less than half of my life away.  It has made a difference, and I no longer snore.  That is a plus!

i only social smoke.



why dont we just stay in all the time then.  seriously smoking now will effect your health in the future but if you stop smoking now your body has a good chance of healing itself.  smoking at a young age too can also affect your growing organs.



quit now, chew nicorette gum when you go out or buy some herbal ciggies, i tried them once and smelt rank.

Tell yourself " omg. look what im doing to myself, this is horrible" , thats what makes me stop doing anything i want to stop like "you know that you dont want to do it, so why are you". :D And whoever is offering you cigarettes, knowing your trying to let go, are obviously not "friends." Cigarettes are filled with tar. Doesn't that make your stomach churn :| like getting down and licking the road...i  think you should just try and stop youself, without using any patches/gum, whats the point in putting nicotine into your body in other ways if you trying to stop putting it in through smoking. I hope this helps :) Good luck in the future and i hope you stop &lt;3.

If you only smoke socially then just tell your friends not to offer you any.
If you have given it up before it should also be easier and at 18 you will soon be at no greater risk than if you'd never smoked.
If you need incentives other than your health here are some worth remembering when temptation strikes. Smoking costs thousands of pounds and at today's prices you are literally burning £35 a week or £1,820 a year with a 20-a-day habit.  It makes your clothes and hair smell unpleasant. It ages your skin and makes you look a lot older which no amount of anti-aging creams will help!
Those warnings on the packets aren't lying! Those harmless little sticks will kill you!
I've been a smoker for 40 years so think of what that has cost me financially and health wise! I'm now on tablets for heart disease and look nearer 70 than the 57 I am! I'm trying very hard to give up even though the damage has already been done!
Give up while you can and don't let others tell you it's OK to have even an occasional one. They are highly addictive and soon the one leads to 'just another' and you end up like me! Regretting it!
Good luck and stay strong.

It should be easier for you now with the current laws & all the health warnings on smoking!, so it's not as taboo to say sorry but I don't smoke and not to feel like a goody goody or whatever. When I was a teenager smoking was Still being advertised on the billboards. So I think it's just your will power that you'll have to rely on, don't smoke if you don't really feel the need it'll save you the trouble years later having the problem of trying to quit & you wont have the help of your friends with it either. Stand your ground, be your own person & don't follow others (if it's negative).

Does this sound like an eating disorder?



In the last year or so I dropped two stone. Now loosing weight is all I can think about. I'm honestly not an unhealthy weight at the moment. But I'm a perfectionist, my hands are always cold, and I hate eating around people. In fact, I don't eat at all until I come home from school, no breakfast or lunch. I hate eating dinner because I'm scared it'll make me fat.



Is there something the matter with me?



I'm 5"3 and weigh around 128 pounds (it varies, I bloat up whenever I eat). That's a little over nine stone for all in Europe.

depends on where the actual cannbis came from and what the strength is. A strong one probably 3-4 hours and but normally about an hour or so.
I hadn't smoked any in such a long time and was given some really strong weed & i was out of it for about 5 hours!

There's no strict answer as it depends largely on your body volume, potency of the cannabis used and how regularly you've taken it. Effects can vary but usually the slight high passes after 1-2 hours.



As for how long the cannabis remains in your system however, a general rule of thumb with light or one-time users is up to a week before it's no longer present in your system. With regular frequent users, around 6-8 weeks.

Forever. Just like anything and everything, for example carbon-14 and measuring our age, or fluoride in your toothpaste, or alcohol creating a nice black hole in your brain, it is possible to measure an effect and in this case the diffusion and equilibration, not only on you, but on the worlds environment. In fact, the drug found in cannabis even stays in your hair from the body's excretions. From a dinosaurs fart 200000 years ago, we are somehow breathing and effected by the diffusion and in the end that effect you and everyone.

Lip retainer bar a tad small..?



the lip retainer bar is 8mm, it goes in does up fine but its abit small cos it like put a circle ring round the hole where its pushing on my lip, and i know this means its too small.. it really annoys me cause at school i have to have a retainer and when i first put the retainer on (yesterday) i cant get the ring to be as tight as it used to be.. i keep thinking the retainer ball will fall off when i sleep so im sleeping in the ring :)



I know ive only had my piercing for 2 weeks 4 weeks and i know me switching fro the ring to a retainer will put stress on the piercing prolonging healing time.
:]
Is that true?

it is very possible.  Just choose the correct exercises to achieve the change you want.  The thing that makes you bottom heavy is the way your body distributes fat. Work out your lower body on a regular basis and build up your leg and thigh muscles. This will eliminate body fat and change your body dramatically.

Wow, yeah time to stop taking them and let your brain rest.



MDMA produces intense feelings of pleasure, empathy, warmth, and happiness. It also increases sensitivity to music, makes people more emotionally open, and has a stimulating, speedy physical effect.



When ecstasy is swallowed, the full effect is usually felt within one hour. It starts with tingling and little rushes of exhilaration. Some people may experience nausea or dizziness while coming up but it quickly passes.



The effect builds quickly, coming on in waves within the first two hours, strengthening with each pass. A lightness of mood and relaxation gives way to waves of physical pleasure, euphoria, openness and empathy to others around you. The awareness of touch is strongly heightened. The muscles relax.



The peak arrives and then the effects last 4-6 hours, with a gradual tapering come-down in the last two.



Jaw clenching and "clamping" is a common side-effect of E and many people get relief by chewing on dummies or gum, smoking cigarettes or sucking lollies.



top



in the brain
E causes serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and dopamine to flood the brain. Both are neurotransmitters which influence the flow of information throughout the brain. Changing the balance between the two changes your mood. E gives you a glow of well-being, happiness, empathy, euphoria, increases your sensitivity to rhythmic music, and makes you want to dance.



The latest studies show that Ecstasy use can impair the serotonin system and memory performance. Please see our guide - Can Ecstasy Impair Your Memory? - plus safe dancing tips on how to protect yourself.



top



comedown



On come-down, you may feel physically and emotionally drained. Without the artificial stimulation of E, the body and mind can suffer from exhaustion and anxiety.



It's very important to have somewhere warm and comfortable to go back to, preferably stocked with refreshments, and gentle 'chill' music. General health and regularity of use play a very large part in the harshness of the after-effects.



Ecstasy is rapidly broken down by the liver but about 60% enters the urine unchanged. The urine could be drunk to recycle it, in the same way that Siberian tribesmen drink each other's urine after eating magic mushrooms. This is known in most circles as 'desperate'.



top



days after



The first day or two after taking E, senses are a little blunted, but a general sense of contentment can result in 'Happy Mondays.' E temporarily depletes serotonin for several days, which can prompt mood swings or mild depression.



Wednesday is usually the bleakest day before moods stabilise again. Often, weekly users do not regain neurochemical balance before they dose again. Permanently fluctuating moods can be a symptom of over-use.



Some users take the food supplement 5-HTP, a chemical precursor of serotonin (available from most health food shops), during, and after an E experience. It can help rebalance moods, as can tryptophyan-heavy foods such as bananas, milk, apples, turkey, chicken, yoghurt and chocolate.

This may be something that you will not like hearing. But it sounds like an addiction. People who addicted to pills and drugs feel down and depressed when they aren't high. Sometimes people even feel desperate when they can't find the drug of their choice. My best advice is to go into detox. Stop taking the beans. This isn't a road you want to go down. Go to NA meetings as well. Even if you feel you aren't addicted see what this drug has done to other people and get advice from an addict. Good luck and be careful.

One other side effect that the others haven't covered is the possibility of something called Malignant Hyperthermia. It is a side effect of Ecstasy use and is lethal.  Not common but definitely an issue.  You need help to stop this and the depression won't lift until your depleted stores of seretonin return to normal.  Stop now. Seriously STOP.

SCHOOLBOY, 13, DIES AS MEASLES
MAKES A COMEBACK



The Sunday Times (London) April 2 2006



Brian Deer



A 13-YEAR-OLD boy has become the first person in Britain for 14 years to die of measles in a sign that the disease, once a common killer, is resurfacing.



The boy’s death is the first since the scare over the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine caused a drop in immunisation rates.



The first death from acute measles infection since 2006 has been reported. A 17 year old with underlying congenital immunodeficiency was admitted to hospital with respiratory distress and pneumonia on 20 April following contact with a case of measles. The patient deteriorated and was transferred to ITU a week later with respiratory failure, but subsequently died (five weeks later). Serum samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates taken at various times have confirmed that the patient had infection with a strain identical to the measles strain (MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07 genotype D4) that has now been circulating in the UK for over a year.



Due to almost 10 years of sub-optimal MMR vaccination



There were 61 infant deaths from measles 1905-1908. ..... compare the death rate for measles with other areas of the UK because the birth rate had ...

Many of the once almost eradicated childhood diseases had a mortality due to the rarer complications. Both the diseases and the risk of this were reducing even before immunisation came in due to general increases in fitness and a waning of disease potency.



However the statistics that predicted in advance that a reduction in immunisation would reduce 'herd immunity' levels proved correct. The diseases began to appear in epidemic once more. Lack of early exposure tends to mean that when they do strike, they can be both more severe and have a higher risk of complications.



Potentially fatal complications of measles include pneumonia, meningitis and encephalitis and a death rate of as many as 1 in 2,500 cases of infection!



Mumps complications include, orchitis or oophoritis ( inflammation of the testicles or ovaries,) which can produce sterility. Also meningitis and encephalitis and pericarditis, all of which can be fatal.



Complications of Rubella include fits, pneumonia and encephalitis as well as the well known risks to the foetus in pregnant women who become infected.



Overall this of course reinforces the fact that the risks of the diseases always overwhelmed and small risks that the vaccines might pose.

And the sub-optimal uptake of the MMR vaccine is mainly due to over acceptance of ONE single, discredited piece of research claiming to link MMR to autism.



All 3 viruses covered by MMR can have a devastating impact. Measles kills, mumps causes male infertility and rubella causes terrible birth defects. Anyone considering refusing the MMR on behalf of their child should consider this. But maybe the NHS could meet such parents half way and offer them individual vaccines rather than the 3-in-1.

I think you mean there were 61 infant deaths from measles between 2005 - 2008. The death rate a hundred years ago would have been much greater.



In the US, measles was a leading cause of childhood death until about 1950, and even until the development of the vaccine. My career in pediatrics began before the availability of the measles vaccine, and I can tell you from personal experience that practically all of the affected children I saw with measles were quite ill with high fevers and coughs. Secondary pneumonia was a common complication.



Most fatalities occur in children under age two, especially those whose parents are below the poverty line. Vitamin A deficiency may be a contributing factor in these children.

I'm thinking  you're probably not really choking since you had the peace of mind to type this question, but just in case you are CALL 911 and try to give yourself the Heimlich maneuver over the back of a chair.

If there is someone there with you then get them to give you several hard pats on the back to dislodge what is causing the problem. They could also try the Heimlech Manuever. If you are by yourself or it's really serious get an ambulance!

You should go to the doctor.  Swollen lymph nodes could indicate that you have an infection of some kind and the lymph nodes are catching the infection and keeping it from going to your brain.  If it gets to your brain you could have a serious problem.  You should probably be taking some antibiotics.

How come I keep on having to poop after I drink bleach?



I had a little stomach indigestion and my cousin told me to drink a little bit of Clorox bleach, he said that it would make my stomach pains go away. So a couple of days ago I had been drinking a little bit of Clorox on a daily basis (ugh, that stuff smells so bad! I don't recommend drinking it unless your stomach pains are REALLY bad) when my stomach started hurting A LOT, like REALLY REALLY bad, so I figured maybe if i drank some more of it it'd make the pain go away. But it didn't. The only thing it did was make me have to poop a lot. And now I'm confused. Why won't my stomach pains go away and how can I make my body stop pooping? It's getting a little embarrassing.



PLEASE HELP!

Your cousin is an idiot and you are too for listening to him!  Bleach is for laundrey, not for stomach pains, if any it'll make your pains even worse. You better go to the ER IMMEDIATELY. Do you not realize that your life is on the line because you drank bleach? You could die. If your having stomach pains, go see a doctor. As for your "pooping" problem, you should talk to a professional because  you need real advice for something as dumb as you did. Not yahoo.

Did you suffer any possible trauma to that area?



Maybe an infection? Is there any liquid coming out?

When should a person consider shoulder surgery?



I have an unstable shoulder, dislocated about 15-20 times in the past 8 yrs.  Normally when playing sports or doing some sort of swimming type movement.



So far, it doesn't really effect my day to day activities or weight lifting, but I have dislocated it while sleeping and also falling down stairs.



I've read that surgery should be reserved for when it interferes with your daily activities, which for the most part it does not...yet.



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry, left of some details...i got PT when it first happened, but I rushed back to trying to be active and probably didn't let it heal fully...got rehab again after the 3rd or 4th time.  Have seen a couple doctors and I have a torn labrum, but since it doesn't affect me day to day it makes me a little hesitant to get surgery...

First you should consider doing something like physiotherapy and see if that problem would be able to help and assist you with your problem first. If this problem doesn't get better from doing some physiotherapy, then you should consider talking with an orthopedic surgeon about your case.

Just remember that each time you dislocate your shoulder, it will dislocate the next time in an easier fashion. Surgery is at your discretion. It will be expensive, keep that in mind, but doctors can work miracles now-a-days.

Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.



Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.
But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.



The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction... There are several other techniques to help cope them!

Benedryl for anxiety? Or Tylenol PM?



I need an OTC remedy for anxiety. Would Benedryl (or something similar) or Tylenol PM (or something similar) work? Not as a long term thing, just for one or two evenings? Thanks.

Benedryl and Tylenol use the same antihistamine to generate a drowsy state, and a relaxed mood.  Be prepared to be drowsy.

That is ridiculous! I hope you live close to the US like in Vancouver, BC so you can drive down here and see a doctor ASAP.  No matter what, even if you have to fly, set up an appointment with a dermatologist and come down here.  Don't try to remove it yourself.



I'm really shocked at the health situation in Canada!  Where do you live?  I repeat, ridiculous!

well just take deep breaths slow and steady, think, calm yourself down, think of something besides whats bothering you. if you still cant calm down go and sit in a nice warm bath tub filled with bubble.:]
or a shower if you don't have a tub they can be just as relaxing.
and also sometimes what i will do is listen to some music of mine that i love and i zone the rest of the world out and just dance and focus on the music.



hope i helped hugs n kisses:]

Blood Typing Kit pricking finger?



I just bought a blood typing kit but I'm too much of a baby to prick my own finger with the lancet. Why can't I just wait till I cut myself shaving or something and use that blood?



The directions say take a sample from a finger tip or the ear lobe.. isn't blood from anywhere in your body going to be the same?

You could get blood from other places, but a fingertip or earlobe will give enough blood for the test with a pin prick, and will heal quickly.

No.  O negative blood can be given to any blood type and is considered the universal blood donor.  AB blood is considered the universal recipient as they can receive any type of blood.

Hey girl,



Don't worry, you're not the only one out there that has problems with that. I have the exact same problem, and it's horrible and embarassing. When you can't wear a tank top or a thick hoodie, put on your deodroent at night. You can try that secret stuff, or any other clinical stregth stuff, but it probably won't work, it didn't for me. But i suggest not thinking about it also, and while your sitting at school, don't put your arms to the sides. Put the arms out so you can "air out." I hope I can help!

Having an overactive thyroid generally means your metabolism is increased and this can be dangerous with certain medications.  Medicines are made to metabolize at a certain rate, when conditions exist that effect the rate, problems could arise.  Glad you are going to your doctor

HI and I  have thyroid disease too. The reason that they tell you to check with your doctor is that your endocrine system is not to be messed with. It could do real damage to your health and well being to add something into your system without first talking to your doctor. I am very careful about using anything that is not prescribed for me due to the hurt that could occur to my body. Be very careful using any medicine that has not been approved. I wish you the best of luck and I won't say it but you know...LOL!

With hyperthyroidism, your body metabolises certain products very quickly, certain medicines are designed to be released into the blood over a period of time, quicker metabolism could lead to a localised overdose, with exceptionally quick metabolisms, even normal doses of painkillers can cause acute liver failure
Im assuming you're medicated for your hyperthyroidism?

because some otc's can change the effect of other meds that you are taking. for instance, some otc cold meds shouldn't be taken if you have hbp because it could cause the bp to go up. so,  if you are taking any thyroid meds, certain otc meds could screw up the effect of the thyroid med.

Looks like it says:



- CBC (complete blood count)



- LFT (liver function test) maybe, hard to tell



- looks like either CBC again, or IBC (iron binding capacity).  They wouldn't do two CBC's, possibly just that the doctor was writing fast and wrote it twice.



- Iron, Ferritin, IBC (iron binding capacity)



- Vitamin B12



- TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)



Hope that helps you!

It does make the red go a little.. but if we're talking about home remedies... calamine lotion work wonders.



I used toothpaste one time on a pimple, and it seemed to make it worse. I find every now and then when I get a blemish, calamine lotion zaps it. I put it on at night (just on the blemish with a q-tip) and in the AM I wash it off. Calamine lotion is just the pink stuff people use on fly bites. It's easily found in your local drugstore, and it's cheap!



Aloe vera works wonders though... so if you can't get your hands on the lotion, try and find aloe cream. It's clear... and THAT should be easily found too!

I't doesnt really get rid of your spots but it will dry them out and make them appear less red. Don't rub the toothpaste onto your spot just dab it and then leave it till you wake up (If your putting it on at night). It is a pain to wash off so just go lightly because you dont want to scratch the spot causing the redness to come back!

when i started wellbutrin-I took one pill to start (at a low dose) for i believe a week...things felt good, then I up the dose to two pills a day as my Dr had instructed--this was too much for me. I was having strange scary dreams, my heart was pounding, I felt very jittery. Since then I have decided it was best that I stick to only one pill a day, I take it in the morning so that it doesn't keep me awake at night (you should take it before 5pm--if you are only taking one pill a day) Everyone is different so you'll have to base whats best for you on your reaction to the meds. This is just how it effected me. I've been on them for maybe 3 years...and I haven't had any issues since. I think they are great pills and I think the lowest dose is just the right dose for me. So just keep an eye on symptoms you get, write things down in a notebook if you must--but do keep track of everything you feel (both physically and mentally) Make notes of weird feelings and mention them to your dr.

I have taken Wellbutrin and had no side effects at all.  I slept better and felt good.  Things didn't bother me as much.



You may sleep better and not need to stay in bed as long because you are more rested.  I hope you have as good results as I did.



Don't expect it to work after just one day.  It may take a couple of days to get good results.

Do you have a little bit of something stuck between tooth and gum?  This can cause swelling.

In situations like this, it is always best to consult a dentist. There are many reasons for swollen gums, but the main cause would be infection. Your gums could have been infected (by bacteria, etc.) that's why it's swollen. While you say that it doesn't hurt and it is not bleeding, but if you don't do anything about it, then soon it will hurt and will be bleeding. As you said, you are a little run down and have a few mouth ulcers. For infection, you can always take a broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the best action would be to consult a dentist before the situation gets worse.



Good luck to you.

Can I sue my nurse or ask for compensation?



I got a blood work done and nurse drew blood on my arms but due to her carelessness I have a huge swell that looks like a tumor and it hurts and the doctor says it wont go aways for many many weeks. All they did was brought the nurse in and explain and apologize. I was ok at first but I am very furious now as the bump is really ugly and hurting me and I am afraid it might not go away without a surgery. Can I seek for your legal advice? (not medical thanks)

What was the explanation?  Some people are prone to bruising and swelling especially when it comes to blood draws.  The same type of thing has happened to me and I wouldn't think of suing.  It will take time for this to heal, but you have not been permanently damaged, just inconvenienced.  Don't be one of the crowd that sues for every little thing.

What carelessness do you attribute this to?  In order to sue, there has to be proof that the hematoma (I assume it is a hematoma?) was the result of improper technique on the part of the nurse. Was there an admission of wrongdoing?  Was a complaint filed or an incident report?

Drinking water with salt to calm yourself down?



Tonight my daughter fell down a flight of stairs at her great grandmother's house.  My daughter was fine but of course shaken up. Her great grandmother got her to drink a little bit of warm water mixed with some table salt.  She said this was supposed to help calm my daughter/her body/her nerves or something.  Anyways, she said it is supposed to help when someone is shaken up.  Has anyone else heard of this or have an answer for why this is?

Worried about taking Zoloft?



I am going to start taking 50mgs of Zoloft. I was on prozac twice, but each time my anxiety was so bad I had to stop taking it, as I was always on the verge of panic attacks, and then my depression would plummet so badly. I also took celexa, but slept about 17 hours daily so my doctor took me off of that. Also took wellbutrin, but I got shaky and panicky with that also.



I want to hear stories about those of you who have taken zoloft for anxiety/depression, and how it made you feel. I want to make sure I'm making the right choice.

Can the smell of weed affect me?



I live in Seattle and I have a roommate that smokes and smokes weed.  He's really nice, but I realized that during the past few months up until now, I am getting tired of him smoking weed every late night when I'm about to go to bed or every morning when I wake up.  I live in a room with 1 bedroom, so we both have our own space (him having the bedroom with his own door and me having the huge space beside the kitchen).



What should I do about this?  Could this somehow affect me??

depending on how old you are, and how severe your memory loss is,



You could have a very rare short term memory loss problem.



You could also have the beginning signs of alzhiemers. But I think you are much too young for that.



Do you smoke marijuana?



Habitual use can cause rediculous memory loss.

Have you been tested for epilepsy?



There is a kind of seizure called an "absence seizure" which does the things you say has been happening to you ie black-outs, forgetting things etc.



With an absence seizure, you don't have any convulsions or any noticeable movements, but you can blank out for periods of 10 to 30 seconds and still appear to be conscious and aware of everything that is happening around you.



Being on the computer all the time, watching too much TV or playing too many Playstation, Nintendo, X-Box games etc can also cause seizures because of the constant flickering of the screen.



I would go to the doctor, explain your symptoms and asked to be checked thoroughly.

i suggest sleep starting from 8 pm. yes its early but its when most bodily processes start. when sleeping.
try praying first or meditating before you sleep. dont let the sun go down on your wrath. dont be stressed. chill out.



btw, dont use the computer when theres no need to.

Am I experiencing a common cold or the flu?



I had a sore throat yesterday. Today, I woke up and my throat was still sore until an hour later, it went away.



Now, instead of a sore throat, I have a stuffy nose!



Then, later on today, my head started to get hot and "sting" (probably fever).



Finally, I am aching all over, especially in the hips.



</question>



<additional details>



My nose is very sensitive, also. I will blow it, and it will become breathable but painful. Like my nose is so clear that the air stings it.



Then, it will be stuffy again 2 minutes later. Blow nose, repeat lol.

Based on the possibility of a fever, I would guess flu.  Most people don't have a fever with a cold.  And the flu is an upper respiratory illness, so that would account for the stuffy nose.

most flu bugs occur a day after a jet flies over the town.
Depleted Uranium is what they have in these chem trails.
Don't take Flu shots, they have chemicals that destroy your immune system so you will get sick and get cancer easier.
I don't let them give me or my kids he flu shot because I don't like what they put into them.

What is this madness?



This question is for males only. When you were in high school, were you in a group of seven people including yourself of the same gender where you were the fourth in age? Do you know of any body who is or has been in this position? Does any body else worry about being fourth of seven all in the same gender? If I know there are people out there that have been or still are in a fourth of seven position (must be all male) it will help me to relax.(When I say seven people, I mean seven people all of the same gender: Seven males. I need to know that a person can live a decent, prosperous life despite this stupid number obsession. Remember, you have to be, (or have been in the past) the fourth of seven friends (As in a group, as long as you have been outside (in an open space) at one time together, and again, you must all be of the same gender.) I know this sounds absolutely mad, but its not a joke, and you can help me very much by telling me about other people that have been or still are in this position. Read this again slowly if you have to. This crazy number business has to stop, and the only way it can stop is if I know other people who have been in the specified position. Yes, it DOES matter. No, I'm not insane. Thanks.

yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.



Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.
Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.



• Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines make a person appear thinner,
and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.



Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.



To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:
1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose
2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body
3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth



It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.



During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.



Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.
Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.
Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.
Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.
Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.
Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.
Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.
Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.
Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.



Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.
After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.



Carrots Fish Liver
Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat
Milk Cheese Apples
Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts
Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas
Peanuts Chicken Beans
Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day



If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.
What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.



Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.org or http://www.super-growth.com with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.
I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow

It is possible that you are deficient in Zinc ....... deficiencies in Zinc can cause taste abnormalities ........ the most common deficiency symptoms include dry and rough skin, dull looking hair, brittle finger nails, white spots on nails, reduced taste and smell, loss of appetite, mood swings, reduced adaptation to darkness, frequent infections, delayed wound healing, dermatitis and acne.......... eat more foods rich in zinc ie ~ lean red meats, seafood (especially oysters), wheat germ, brewer's yeast, pumpkin seeds, eggs and ground mustard.



Phytates, compounds found in grains and legumes, bind with zinc so that it cannot be absorbed.



Things that will deplete your zinc supplies are alcohol, caffeine, antacids like mylanta, corticosteroids, diuretics and ulcer medications.



Perhaps this link will help you ~

1. Signs of pregnancy are metallic taste in the mouth.
2. Smokers who give up do experience metallic taste.
3. Elevated levels of Mercury in the body.
4. Never heard that deficiencies of Zinc are causing metallic taste. Everything else Minx did put down is right, but not the taste of metal (except the Zink tester).
5. Elevated thallium.
6. Elevated Selene or Tellurium - also shows as a garlic breath.

Read your contract, if you have one.  Many of them do not allow fellow workers to call in for another.  If you don't have a contract you have to follow the rules of the company. If the rules do not allow it, you can't do it.

Low body temperature, feeling sick, tired... sound familiar?



I always feel completely fatigued and sick. I actually feel like I'm falling apart... there are a few very distinct and different things wrong with me right now(i.e. wisdom teeth excruciating, toe probably broken from 6 weeks ago still in horrible pain, BAD internal and external hemorrhoids from childbirth over three months ago, etc) , but I just have an overall sick and yucky feeling on top of them. I've been taking my temperature, and it's usually very low- around 96 degrees F. I get really hot and then chills regularly. Doctor isn't an option for me unless it's dire because I have no insurance, so i'm really just curious for now if it's something that you may have heard of before. i eat relatively well, get a decent amount of sleep usually, and am in okay shape and take pretty good care of myself overall. any of this sound familiar?

Feeling down from time to time is a normal part of life. But when sadness takes hold and won't go away, it may be depression. More than just the temporary "blues," the lows of depression make it tough to function and enjoy life like you once did. A person with severe depression has little or no interest in work or hobbies, and may even have trouble getting out of bed.  With treatment and help, you can feel better. Learning how to understand depression – including its signs, symptoms, and causes – is the first step to overcoming the problem.



If you identify with several of the following signs and symptoms, and they just won’t go away, you may be suffering from clinical depression.



you can’t sleep enough or you sleep too much



you can’t concentrate or find that previously easy tasks are now difficult



you feel worthless and hopeless



you can’t control your negative thoughts, no matter how much you try



you have lost your appetite or you can’t stop eating



you are constantly irritated or become enraged even at small things – and this is new for you



you have thoughts that life is not worth living, or have a plan for how you would end it (Seek help immediately if this is the case)



Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness



A bleak outlook—nothing will ever get better and there’s nothing you can do to improve your situation.



Loss of interest in dailly activities



No interest in or ability to enjoy former hobbies, pastimes, social activities, or sex.



Appetite or weight changes



Significant weight loss or weight gain—a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month.



Sleep changes



Either insomnia, especially waking in the early hours of the morning, or oversleeping (also known as hypersomnia).



Psychomotor agitation or retardation



Either feeling “keyed up” and restless or sluggish and physically slowed down.



Loss of energy



Feeling fatigued and physically drained. Even small tasks are exhausting or take longer.



Self-loathing



Strong feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Harsh criticism of perceived faults and mistakes.



Concentration problems



Trouble focusing, making decisions, or remembering things.



The Many Faces of Depression
Depression comes in many shapes and forms.  In some, depression can persist at a low level for months and even years. In others, the symptoms are so strong that life grinds to a halt and suicide can be a real concern. Depression can be triggered or aggravated by personal and interpersonal events, hormonal changes (like after childbirth), and can even be triggered by lack of sunlight.



Clinical (Major) Depression



Major depression is characterized by the inability to enjoy life and experience pleasure. Lack of interest in outside activities, strong feelings of worthlessness or guilt, thoughts that life isn’t worth living, weight gain or loss, sleep troubles- all of these are signs of major depression. These feelings normally must persist for at least two weeks in order to be considered a major depressive episode. The symptoms can range from mild, when you can function in life with extra effort, to severe, where you can no longer complete daily activities.



Dysthymia (recurrent, mild depression)



If you have dysthymia, you may feel like you’ve always been depressed. In dysthymia, the depressive symptoms are not as strong as in a major depressive episode, but they last a long time, at least two years. More days than not, you feel mildly or moderately depressed, although you may have some temporary mood lifts. These chronic symptoms make it very difficult to enjoy life or to remember better times.



Postpartum Depression
Strong emotions after giving birth, “the baby blues”, are normal. New mothers are recovering from birth, are most likely sleep deprived, and are adjusting to the responsibilities of parenthood. Postpartum depression, however, is a longer lasting and more serious.  What can be especially terrifying to mothers suffering from postpartum depression are feelings of wanting to avoid or even harm the baby. Postpartum depression doesn’t have to occur right after delivery. It can occur up to a year after childbirth.

The wrist cutting concerns me but I am not so sure you are clinically depressed. You may just not be dealing with your relationship that seems to not be going well and also may be suffering from a mental illness other than depression (many Americans are) it would be adviceable for you see a doctor and explain to him/her how you feel and whats going on in your life. Its very possible that through therapy and mabey light medication(if even necessary) you can feel yourself again

I am not a doctor; I don't even play one on TV. You sound depressed to me. There are are self-tests available on the Internet. The diagnosis is important, but getting treatment is the best way out of this. As I understand it, the combination of medication and talk therapy is the best help that you can get.



I don't know what your insurance situation is, but at a minimum, there are clinics available with income-adjusted fee scales.



If you do not have a local crisis intervention line, there is always 1-800-Suicide. They can give you immediate help and possibly direct you to assistance in your area.

I have suffered from depression for most of my life and you certainly seem to have a lot of the symptoms. It's common for people to feel down often but if it is getting to the stage where you are hurting yourself then you need to do something about it before it gets worse. From experience I know that it is a big step but you need to discuss this with someone you know and trust. You should consult your doctor and discuss options but I wouldn't recommend this without the support of someone as it can be really hard. I wouldn't be overly concerned about you and your boyfriend it is likely that your bad patch is largely coming from your problems with depression putting a strain on your relationship. The most important thing is to please tell someone, pills counseling or just talking to someone can all help but every individual is different, discuss with someone what is best for you.

Why did I suddently feel all shakey like I was going to faint or have a heart attack?



I'm a 35 year old woman in decent health except I smoke.  I've always had a very high metabolism but it's slowed down now that I'm older.  I was super skinny as a kid but now I'm 5'7 and 140 lbs. which is average.  I walk an hour a day.  I didn't eat at all today except for one egg roll 5 hours ago.  I also suffer from bad anxiety but I wasn't in a situation that would cause anxiety.  I still feel very trembly and short of breath.  It was just very scary.  My hands are still shaking really bad.  Was this an anxiety attack or something related to not eating enough today or what?



</question>



<additional details>



My chest feels really tight too and my breathing is shallow.  I feel better than I did 20 minutes ago when this first happened.  I just ate a stuffed green pepper and had some donut holes for the sugar.



I do smoke 2 packs a day, take Methadone for opiate addiction, and take 2 mg. of Xanax  a day for severe anxiety.

It may have just been an anxiety attack, or lack of sugar. Have you ever taken your blood drawn and checked your iron levels? You could be anemic--which could cause fainting/dizzy spells. You could also just be tired, if you haven't been getting enough rest lately.

I do that when my blood sugar drops. The best thing for that situation is to eat protien. I usually eat peanutbutter, it will help stabilize the blood sugar. If you eat sugar to bring it up, a lot of times it will drop out worse than it was. Eating regualrly will keep this from happening.

Many people who suffer panic attacks state they are the most frightening experiences of their lives. Sufferers of panic attacks report a fear or sense of dying, "going crazy", or experiencing a heart attack or "flashing vision", feeling faint or nauseous, or losing control of themselves. These feelings may provoke a strong urge to escape or flee the place where the attack began (a consequence of the sympathetic "fight or flight" response) and Heavy breathing.



Symptoms: Heart palpitations, Diaphoresis or perspiration, Trembling or tremors, Dyspnea, Hyperventilation, Chills, Hot flashes, Nausea, Abdominal pain or abdominal cramping, Chest pain, Headache, Dizziness, Lightheadedness, Faintness, Tightness in throat, Tunnel vision, Trouble swallowing, A sense of impending death, Feeling like one is experiencing a myocardial infarction (heart attack)

All persons experiencing persistent and frequent panic attacks should consult their physicians. However, many experienced sufferers treat panic attacks with some the following methods and techniques:



Some treatments include:



Diaphragmatic Breathing or Abdominal Breathing — Breathing slowly through the nose using the diaphragm and abdomen. Do not breathe through the mouth. Focus on exhaling very slowly. This will correct or prevent an imbalance of oxygen to carbon dioxide in the blood stream.



Coping Statements — repeated as part of an internal monologue such as ""No one has ever died from an anxiety attack."  or "I am frightened of being frightened, therefore if I stop worrying about being frightened, then I have nothing to be scared of."



Talking with a supportive person; someone who has experienced true panic attacks personally; someone who is highly trained in treating panic attacks; loved ones who can offer support and comfort.



Note that all medical professionals advise that if you're not sure what's happening you should seek medical attention immediately.



While it may be embarrassing to find out there's nothing wrong except being anxious its better to get checked out.

Acupuncture in experienced hands is safe and effective.  Recently a UK surgeon performed an operation using acupuncture as opposed to traditional anaesthesia.

The jury is out re homeopathy but thousands swear by it.

Have you never heard of the placebo effect?  In drug trials some volunteers are given the drug being tested,  others are given an identical  looking pill containing no drug.  Often the non-drug people show a positive response.  Even those actually conducting the trials don't know which is which.

Mind over matter?  If you believe it is it true?  Worth a try, harmless anyhow.

depends on what size. and everybody's body is different.

i have a 9/16ths (basically half inch) and if i were to take mine out, it would close up in a day, but someone else could only have a double zero, and wont close. so it really depends on your body's ability to heal. not the size.

of course a smaller size would have a better chance of closing up.

good luck.

You need to do one of the followings:
- Face the matter: recognize the reason behind the stress and get red of it if you can
- Stress related to a problem you faced: talk to the friends about it
- if it permanent: 
1. Write thoughts, dreams or any thing elss away from it



2. Draw of you could or color done drawing 
3. Go to a space and shout, scream to express your hard feelings
4. Cry if it works with you
5. Do boxing to a soft billows with no harm to your self

Hi



For me I find long brisk walks and excercising in the form of an hour a day run does the trick for me.



Also eating fruit and veg rich in iron to release endorphins



Still have a once a week treat !

But keep your mind busy and positive so destress and please don't comfort eat and dont excercise its why i put on so much weight last year

IBS has no cure, but you can do things to relieve symptoms. Treatment may involve: diet changes, medicine and stress relief .

You may have to try a few things to see what works best for you. Your doctor can help you find the right treatment plan.

Some foods and drinks make IBS worse.

Foods and drinks that may cause or worsen symptoms include: fatty foods like french fries, milk products like cheese or ice cream, chocolate (unfortunately), alcohol, caffeinated drinks like coffee and some sodas, carbonated drinks like soda.

To find out which foods are a problem, keep a diary that tracks

what you eat during the day 
what symptoms you have 
when symptoms occur 
what foods always make you feel sick



Take your notes to the doctor to see if certain foods trigger your symptoms or make them worse. If so, you should avoid eating these foods or eat less of them.

Some foods make IBS better.

Fiber may reduce the constipation associated with IBS. However, some people with IBS who have more sensitive nerves may feel a bit more abdominal discomfort after adding more fiber to their diet. Fiber is found in foods such as breads, cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables.

Add foods with fiber to your diet a little at a time to let your body get used to them. Too much fiber at once can cause gas, which can trigger symptoms in a person with IBS.

Your doctor may ask you to add more fiber to your diet by taking a fiber pill or drinking water mixed with a special high-fiber powder.

Large meals can cause cramping and diarrhea in people with IBS. If this happens to you, try eating four or five small meals a day instead of less-frequent big meals.

My boyfriend has this problem, aside from medication make sure to stay away from carbonated beverages, make sure you give yourself 2 hours of digestion before lying down, eat lots of fiber and maybe take a supplement such as Metamucil to help keep things regular.
Pay attention to your gut after eating, if you find something that triggers discomfort take it out of your diet.

Make sure your diet is well balanced and full of fresh fruits and vegetables. Also, lean protein, like poultry and fish, is very good. Whole grains are important, so if you are sensitive to wheat, try oats, brown rice, and other grains.

Despite the fact that it seems counter-intuititive, a diet high in fiber keeps the bowel full and functioning better. You can add other fiber like psyllium (Metamucil) or chia or flax seeds to your diet for added fiber, too.



Avoiding very spicy foods is probably a good idea, because they can irritate the bowl. I have IBS and if I cut out chilis and hot pepper, I am much more comfortable.

Definitely, a sign that this person uses it to snort cocaine or, a way to test the purity of it ( a sample taste ). The long fingernail is handy ( no pun intended), if there is no spoon handy or, no short straw, or a rolled dollar bill, the fingernail is used.

You have to (1) shampoo with a lice killing shampoo, and (2) comb out the eggs with a special comb and also (3) destroy any nits and eggs in the house:

"Combing is a very important but also tedious step in the process.
A good lice comb and an aid, such as a comb-out gel can significantly reduce combing time as well as avoid excessive pulling or tearing of the child's hair. While often underestimated, combing time can range between 1 and 8 hours, depending on length of hair. 
Carefully inspect your child daily for 2 weeks after treatment. If you see eggs or nits, repeat Step 2."

Home Lice Control Spray 
-Kills lice & their eggs on bedding, furniture, car
-interiors and other non-washable items



To make it somewhat easier, you might want to cut your daughter's hair to a shorter length more manageable length.

I had the same problem with my daughter. She was a magnet for the stuff. What I would do with her is to cover her hair in Olive oil (cheapest is ok just make sure it is OLIVE oil) Cover with a shower cap or plastic bag tightly clipped so it won't get everywhere. Leave about 8 hours or overnight.Wash hair with dawn dish detergent to get the oil out. Spray with Avon skin so soft bath spray. THe oil will kill any live bugs and the skin so soft will help loosen the eggs. You will need a metal lice comb. The plastic ones will not work. Take her in the sun and comb and pick. Also make sure that you pack up any stuffed animals that can't be washed for at least 14 days. Wash everything else and run through the dryer. The dryer will kill everything. Make sure to spray beds, couches, car seats with lice spray. I hope this helps and good luck. (oh you may have to do this again in 10 days if you don't get all the nits out.)

CHIRIL, What do you mean when you say, It is not the Lice concerned you, it is the EGGS, then where the EGGS comes from?. Can you have the EGGS without the Lice???. My dear you have to think when you speak OK.
Now when I was much younger one of our mate caught crab, and we found out & as BOYS all over when we finished laughing we suggested that he go to a drug store & tell the dug store man, he went and the man sold him some thing to put there & he said he had used
it twice & all his crab was GONE, so you should do the same thing, go to the drug store and explained to the man r woman & get some thing to help your Daughter's Lice OK??
It seems as if Lice & Bed Bugs are gently coming back in exansent so do not be a shame, go & see about your Daughter OK??.

You could do, but it isn't really recommended. Swallowing tablets with water or another liquid helps the tablet to go down easily and reduces the risk of the tablet getting stuck, which could be quite dangerous and could cause problems such as the tablet scratching the throat on the way down (which would be very uncomfortable) and if the tablet got stuck due to the throat being dry it could cause you to choke and if nobody is there to help you, or you haven't got any water with you it could be very dangerous. Also, without a drink to swallow the tablet down with you are likely to gag because you will probably be able to taste the tablet because it will leave a white coating on your tongue which will taste awful. When taking tablets be careful to read the directions carefully because some tablets require you to drink a certain amount of water in order for the tablet to be absorbed into the body and so it can dissolve in your stomach. A tablet which i take requires 120ml of water on an empty stomach and if i don't do this it can cause the tablet to damage my oesophagus which can lead to more complications with my stomach etc. So be very careful.
Hope i helped :D

Ok well there are a few reasons why it's recommended to take it with water:

It's more comfortable, and easier to swallow. And water is a good medium for pills to dissolve in safely (but you probably got loads of water already in your stomach lol).

There is a small chance of this happening but your throat is very moist and has a fair amount of fluid lined along its inner walls. If the pill get stuck it can dissolve there and you will gag and it will taste like **** too :D

Yes, you can swallow pills without water put you risk getting choked since the pill may get stuck on your throat.  So, to be on the safe side you should take your pills with liquids.

Uhh you can do lots of things. I like to write when I'm upset just write EVERYTHING that is bothering you. It really does help. If you don't want to do that then you can do some crunches or some exersises or anything. don't cut yourself. I don't know what's bothering you but it's not worth the pain. Tomorrow it will probably be better. 
Good luck :)

write down how you feel
that always stopped me
just keep writing until you have nothing left to think ar cry
then write some more
apparently going for a run is the most tension relieving thing
 make a list of the most beautiful things in your life right now
simple and pointless things
but preventative
ring someone really close to you and talk to them about it
they might just be able to help you

You don't. The really powerful ones like benzo's are 1000 times worse than cigarettes to get off once you're hooked. Just let your body adjust itself with good food and plenty of exercise.
Mild ones would be things like beta blockers. They are ok to come off.

Go to the doctors they will sort you out.The best way to stop smoking is very,very slowly,so as to trick the body into thinking it is still getting the same amount of nicotine.
If you smoke 20 per day than take 2 months to go to zero.(20 ciggies at 60 days) so you are only reducing by one cigarrette every 3 days.The body will not go into withdrawl symptoms as it's too subtle for it to notice

You don't understand why you feel so badd?  You have been taking these drug cocktails and its wreaking havoc on your body.  Thats why - your body is not able to cope with the abuse you are inflicting on you and its telling you to stop.  Please stop this crazy behaviour.

EDITED to add: The people that voted me thumbs-down are clealry also dependent on drugs and not in a fit state to answer this.  They also dont have your best interests at heart.

Mate, the quickest road to recovery is lots of sleep. I was a huge user of everything you name here and more until a few years back. I would advise taking 5-10 mg valium and getting your head down. You'll feel much better in the morning. Eat something before you sleep as your stomach is suffering from ingesting coke - it makes your nose bleed and believe me it makes your stomach bleed. The combination of alcohol and coke is bad, the 2 drugs combined produce a third- cocaethanol, which is more dangerous than the others on thier own. Drink plenty of fluids, not more booze though. You will be ok but take this a warning. Friends of mine ended up in A&E with respiratory failure bought on by coke K and booze OD. As you get older your tollerance for this lifestyle will diminish and it will take longer to recover, it could be as simple as that. You may not consider you have a drug problem, I never did, but even so you are doing dreadful damage to your body and you need to learn to have fun without artificial enhancement. Sleep well and I hope you feel better soon.

Ace bandage makes a pretty good ankle wrap, however the problem is they get dirty and look really really bad, no matter how much you wash them.
Go to a sporting goods store. They have them in colors, and within your price range

Does anyone ever experience sounds suddenly become harsh or faster?



I've always experienced sounds, particularly music, suddenly sounding faster and harsher to me. It happens randomly and lasts a few minutes.
It sounds as if the sounds are galloping or taunting, that sort of pace and speed.
It's very strange and I hate it.
I think it might be an inner ear problem or something.

Not suggesting that you have epilepsy at all, but if it's as unpleasant as you say it should be checked out.

A bruise is also called a contusion (say: kun-too-zhun), and it forms because the soft tissues of your body have been bumped. Some people bruise easily, whereas others may have tougher skin tissue.

When these soft tissues are injured, small veins and capillaries (the tiniest blood vessels) under the skin sometimes break. Red blood cells leak out of these blood vessels. These red blood cells that collect under your skin cause that bluish, purplish, reddish, or blackish mark. That's where black-and-blue marks get their name - from their color under the skin.

Bruises go through colorful changes as the body begins to heal itself. The color changes mean that your body is metabolizing (say: muh-tab-o-lyze-ing), or breaking down, the blood cells in the skin. This is the process that your body goes through to repair itself.

Imagine a baseball hits you in the leg. Ouch! Your body will go through the following phases:

First, you'll probably have a bump that will look red or purplish and tender. The bump might swell from the blood collecting under the tissue. 
After a couple of days, the bruise will look blue or even blackish. 
After 5 to 10 days, it may look greenish or even yellow. 
After 10 to 14 days, the bruise will most likely be a light brown, then get lighter and lighter as it fades away. 
Most bruises will disappear after 2 weeks, and some go away even sooner. However, if a bruise does not go away after 2 weeks, let your parent know.

To help reduce swelling or the amount of bruising after an injury, apply a cold compress to the bruise for at least 10 minutes. And be sure to wear a helmet and protective pads to avoid bruises altogether!

You have three different types of blood vessels: arteries,viens, adn cappilaries. Cappilaries are the thinnest. When you bang them hard enough they break causing the blood to escape. Don't worry, they soon repair themselves and soak up blood and it goes back through the cleansing system ( learn more about the cardiovascular system online).

Normally a high fever can be brought down by a cool bath/shower, then wrap up the patient and put back to bed, with plenty of blankets/liquids and keep them warm in bed.



But in your husbands case, and if he's on medication, I would give him plenty of liquids, keep the room warm and of a constant temperature, and let him sleep. Eventually his temperature will break and he should be feeling better in a couple of days, contact your G.P if this is not the case, or take him to the Emergency Outpatients Dept if he gets any worse.

it could be your spleen which is located below your left breast maybe it swollen due to an infection and inhaling would cause your lungs to expand and put pessure on your spleen which is basically base if your body is infected. i dont think its a pulled muscle as the chest muscles are large and pain would only be localised if you recieved a blow to your chest which would explain everything but as you didnt mention it i doubt thats the case unless you are a deep sleeper in which you case you could have hurt yourself when you were asleep, i know it sounds implausible but it happens regularly.

It depends upon your weight.  However, if thats the only thing you drank (with alcohol in it), and your above about 100 or so pounds, you should be fine.

Mouth wash (for the most part) is mostly alcohol and flourine.  Flourine poisioning has been more apparent in people who ingest massive ammounts of toothpaste rather than mouthwash.

In short with that little ammount or even more, you should just be slightly "drunk".  Nothing to worry about.

You will probably peak at 5'9 at the age of 18.

Plenty of protein, calcium (milk) and zinc will help your destined normal growth and a deficiency can stunt it.

Tell her to be more careful with what ever she is using, (hand weights) or hiting the bars or slipping on stationary bikes and bouncing off the handle bars...

Seriously, she should see a Doctor about this as its not normal, and it maybe that she is experiencing something other than this, that isnt detectable yet and could be fatal...

Heart making squelching noise?



When I exercise and my heart rate increases I sometimes hear my heart (or I think it's my heart as it goes to the beat) making this squelching noise, but I can only hear it when I hold in a breath. If I breath out and hold it there I can't hear the noise.

Can anyone shed any light on this?

When I do that, I push my sleep time forward until I catch up to my past sleep time. For example, I stayed up till 6-8 am 4 days in a row, then the next day stay up until 10 am then the next day 12 pm, next day, 2 pm .... until I get back on track. That is the only way that works for me, but I also think that I have delayed sleep phase syndrome and may never stay on the average persons sleep schedule.

I don't think they can test for things such as panic or anxiety disorders by looking at the brain.  Panic disorders are relatively easy to diagnose, I'm pretty sure it just depends on how many panic attacks you usually have.  You should see a therapist though, they are the only ones who can actually make a diagnosis on that.

They won't need to send you to hospital or give you a scan, they can diagnose you by taking a history of your symptoms. But have a think about what you'd like the doctor to do for you. They'll probably not give you drugs, due to your age. They might suggest therapy, which may help you.
You might feel better if you spend some time talking to a friend about how you're feeling, or writing your feelings down. Relaxation techniques might help, and a yoga or tai chi class might help you too. Hot baths, deep breathing and so on may be the best treatment for you! Good luck.

Hi Wensday!
I am prone to panic attacks myself AND I also work in a hospital in the same department where they do brain scans, lol, and I think I can safely say you will not need a brain scan (CAT or MRI scan)

First I'd like to ask you what is making you believe that you have a panic disorder? Do you have any of the following symptoms?



Symptoms of a panic attack, which often last about 10 minutes, include:

Difficulty breathing. 
Pounding heart or chest pain. 
Intense feeling of terror. 
Sensation of choking or smothering. 
Dizziness or feeling faint. 
Trembling or shaking. 
Sweating 
Nausea or stomachache. 
Tingling or numbness in the fingers and toes. 
Chills or hot flashes. 
A fear that you are losing control or are about to die.

If you think you may have a panic disorder, call your family doctor to set up an appt.  If your doctor also feels you might have a problem with anxiety, he will likely refer you to a counselor or psychologist who would do further assessment of you through talking with you about what you're experiencing and asking questions.



Depending on what they come up with, the solution may be as simple as prescribing a medication to calm you down when you feel a panic attack coming on.  That's what I have, just a pill that I put under my tongue that dissolves in minutes, and within 5 mins I feel much better, but it can make you sleepy.

So don't worry, no brain scans involved!

Good luck to you

What you need to know will depend on what you'll be doing. You will pick up on the terminology pretty fast, but it wouldn't hurt to take a look at some of the medical sites and get familiar with the major muscles, ligaments, and bones involved in the knees and ankles to start with - that's where you'll find a lot of injuries coming in.



You'll get a load of things like "torn ACL" (anterior cruciate ligament - it's behind the knee joint) that you'll pick up quickly. Go look up the difference between a "hairline" and types of major fracture (not "break", it's a "fracture").

You'll find out that a torn muscle = sprain, an overly-stretched one = strain. You'll also find out that one of the most common shoulder problems deals with the "rotator cuff" - look it up, it's in the joint itself. It can be strained, partially or completely torn loose, or have a "tag".

But start with knees & ankles - injuries there are the most common, especially to amateur jocks.

I forget what it's called exactly. We all have certain hours of the day we're at our best. Yours is at night.

When I was in Graphic Design, my best work and grades were when I worked on them in the late night hours.

Try to get a job that gives you those hours. Or, you CAN eventually train your inner clock to the time you want it to be. Just keep at it. See if your doc will give you a mild aid to sleep at night hours. There are also mild ones over the counter. Wall Mart has a blue colored one by Equate that helps me sleep without feeling groggy in the AM. You get a good 6-7 hours.

Everyone has different times that they are their best, and you are a night person. That's fine, you're like me. If you have to be at work during the day then I would suggest getting a good night's sleep by exercising daily. You can also do some things to get your energy up in the morning. An apple is known to be an energy giving food. Cinnamon is also energizing. Try taking a walk in the morning and eat breakfast to give you energy. Hope this helps. Good luck!

Become a bartender, or a shooter girl at a club.  Sounds perfect for you!  Your energy levels are higher at night, that's all.  If you get a night job, you will be able to sleep during the day!! Just buy dark shades, and maybe have a fan going to muffle daytime sounds.  If it really bothers you, and you'd like to change, try staying up for a day so that you are tired enough to sleep at night.  Try working our during the day also, so that your energy starts to peak during the afternoon instead of at night.

your body clock is opposite of most people.
I personally am the same. Before I retired being a nurse I worked the pm shift 3-11pm.
 I would of been better working  9-3am

You need to very gradually change your body clock. Not by hours but by 15 minutes incriments. It is important to keep your schedual on your days off. When you first get up go outside immediatly for a few minutes so that your skin has the sun on it. That sun will help set your body clock. If you have a window with sun siit by that while you eat your breakfast.

Have a bedtime routien that will tell your body that it is time to slow down and get some rest.

I sorta consider myself a night owl especially since I have retired from my day job. Even then I found myself doing some of my best original work in the evening. Due to neccesity I try to be up by 8:00a.m., but these early birds that call me bug the heck out of me.I had one friend that liked to tease me. I told her she could have all the worms out there.

When you are thirsty, do you find you are drinking pints and pints of liquid, and however much you drink, your thirst is never quenched? Believe me, diabetic thirst is demanding, and it rules your life.
If your are diabetic, there will be other symptoms. You will probably be very tired all the time, which will not ease, however much sleep you get. At your age, if you are diabetic, it would probably be type 1, and you would be losing a lot of weight. Type 2 usually affects older people, and comes with weight problems. You may also get infections which won't heal, say on your chest, or around your teeth.
There are other conditions which can make you thirsty. Can you discuss this with your Mum or Dad? You may need to see your Doctor. When I was diagnosed with diabetes ten years ago, it was like a body blow. But it hasn't been so bad. Medications are very good these days. All the Doctors and nurses I have seen have been very kind. I have to inject 4 times a day, but the needle is very small, and you get used to it. Good luck.

Sugar and salt both cause water inside your cells to go outside your cells and then your cells signal your brain that that they need fluid and cause you to feel thirsty.  You are okay as this is normal for the body to do.  just drink water, not milk or soda....plain ol' water.  Based on what you have said, I do not feel you have diabetes.

If you are wondering if you have diabetes, you might have, have your parents get you to a doctor and get a blood sugar test.  If you are positive, the sooner you start treatment the better off you will be later in life

Being thirsty is the result of a number of things: The body is made up of a large % of water, so when the body needs to be replenished it lets you know by making you thirsty. If you are into cross country, you need to keep your fluids up. A good coach or trainer can help you on this one. What you eat (salty or sweet) plus certain herbs and spices can make you really thirsty. That being said, if diabetes runs in your family, it's not too early to be tested. It's just a simple blood test that is relatively painless. Your doctor can order this test for you. In the meantime, cut back on the sweets and other carbs...(cut back, not totally out) keep getting that exercise, and put your mind to rest by getting the test done. If your body isn't handling the sugar as best as it should, your doctor can advise you what to do. It's not a death sentence if you have diabetes...you just have to learn how to take care of yourself inthe most healthy way.

Fed up and bored with life, just read and see...?



Hi all,

I am so bored and fed up and have lost drive to do things. I have a boyfriend I love, a family that care and a job (doing graphic design but stuck in a company with low pay and not much potential to expand) I amuse myself with things like going to gigs or for a meal but the rest of the time feels empty sometimes. I love my boyfriend but hes unemployed at the minute so we are stuck in a lot.  My boyfriend likes to socialise with his mates in the pub whereas I find this boring. Don't get me wrong, I do go out now and then but sometimes don't enjoy it and would rather be home. Sometimes I wish we could just leave the UK and start a fresh in Australia or someplace. Somewhere beautiful and wild but also close to a city but a different place to Sheffield in the UK! I don't think he would leave though because he loves being with his friends and family. Me on the other hand doesn't have many friends and may only see them a couple of times a month at the most. I seem to be constantly looking for a new thing to buy or new activity to take up but still I get fed up. I was on anti-depressants for over a year but they didn't do anything and I saw a councilor once but that was on one of my good highs that I sometimes get where I stick to my diets and exercise. I'm going through a fed up, tired, eating all the time stage and I ve put over half a stone back on since my good time about 6 weeks ago. Why can;t I stay motivated. I'm just so fed up of this constant battle with myself. And that's what it feels like.



</question>



<additional details>



I know I should go to the gym and socialise but I just don't have the energy, find it boring and just can;'t be bothered. I know this is the wrong attitude but that's how I feel.

In regards of the friends thing, I don't think it's because I'm shy or anything but because I find it hard to relate to people. I like computer games and hate girly things like pink poodles and chick flicks. I would rather watch Kill Bill or something. Plus my music tatse is predominatly metal and most girls I meet in normal social situations have absolutley nothing in common with me.

When you're in a bit of a whole it can seem really tough to find your way out of it.

There's no quick fix to instantly help your mood but you say you don't have many friends and you sometimes get good highs when you stick to diet or exercise?  How about joining a local gym and signing up for exercise classes?  That way there'll be a group of you in the same class with the same goals and aims, if you start chatting to them, they'll chat back and before long you'll have a small group of people you'll be looking forward to seeing each week - you'll be happier in yourself and looking better too!

This in turn will have a knock-on effect with your outlook on work, homelife and so on.  I know I sound like a right hippy-dippy saying this, but sometimes improving just one thing in our lives makes everything else kind of click into place so everything no longer seems as grey.



*edit*
I'm with you on the anti-girlie thing and yes, I'd rather watch Kill Bill (although Deathproof is pretty cool too!) than some chick-flick!!



Sometimes I have zero motivation for things but I know if I don't I'll just be sitting at home and end up snorting a jumbo bag of Maltesers, so I literally drag myself to the gym and afterwards feel miles better.  I'm not incredibly shy but I'm not an in-your-face chatty type either (I only have one person I count as a true friend) so at times I probably feel just as lonely as you.

There is a flap of skin that is right in  front of your stomach that attracts high caloried food and settles there. It is called the omentum. The more high calorie foods you eat, the bigger it gets. Thus the big belly.

A whole year of suffering? Oh my, you must be so suffering, not just from the constant bathroom visits but you probably aren't getting proper nutrion from your food so your bound to be feeling dire.

I'd throw a guess at IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome).  There are 'trigger foods' which can set this off, I suffered several years ago and for me, my triggers were tomatoes, beef, lamb and white bread.  It could be worth going right back to basics with your food and writing everything you eat, then writing how you feel 10mins, one hour afterwards.  You need to stick to eating a plate of one item as it's easier to see if "Carrots" make you dash to the bathroom rather than "Vegetable and meat stew".

A girl where I work suffers awfully with Chrons Disease, I've provided a link for you to check out their site as it may offer more advice.

If the pain gets really bad take yourself to Accident and Emergency, just don't go on a Friday / Saturday night!

No. Your symptoms are probably related to the vaccine. In many cases patients can develop a low grade fever and a headache (ranging in severity) from the vaccine which will persist for a day or so.

Can you get sick after getting shots?



I know this is probably common sense and I might sound stupid but...
About 30 minutes ago I got my TDAP shot, a meningitis shot and a flu nasal spray thing (a live flu virus sprayed into my nose) I was wondering if they could get me sick, like the spray being a live virus, could I get the flu? And can the other shots get me sick too?
Thanks!



</question>



<additional details>



No, the nurse told me it was a live flu virus, given through the nose to go into the lungs. She said they use a live virus for this so it will take effect sooner.

Why does my 2-yr-old granddaughter have such a stinky butt?



This isn't a joke question.  Even when freshly bathed she stinks.  I've never seen this in another child, ever.  I'm guessing it has something to do with putrid feces in her rectum but she has regular, normal bowel movements.  Any ideas?

I agree that it could be her diet, if she is intolerant or unable to digest certain types of food, then those foods would only be broken down in the digestive process and not actually digested - hence it will stink like something is rotting ...



egg, dairy, and wheat gluten are very common culprits ...



she could also have a cavity or sinus problems, or some other health problem ...



check with her doctor ...

Can you diagnose my urethra related pain?



Ever since I was about 14, I have been reoccuringly getting this terrible burning feeling after i pee (but it only comes up every 3-4 months and never two times in a row). It's not an STD and I doubt it's a urinary infection (since it doesn't happen twice in a row).



I will feel as if i still have to urinate even if there's no more fluids to let out. I will run to the bathroom as if i have to go really bad, but just to just let a little more urine out. It is VERY painful and when I force a little more urine out my body shakes and trembles in pain.



I have no idea why this happens and how to prevent it. If anything I suspect dehydration, kidney stones, and diet habits as a cause.



Any ideas?



</question>



<additional details>



As an added note, I once visited a doctor about this at age 17. They found nothing and since it doesn't happen often they just said it's not to worry about. But every 3-4 months it will happen again. Any it is very painful.



So, can you diagnose it?

Please go to the doctor. You could have recurrent UTI's and that could lead to permanent damage in your urethra. Our bodies are great at dealing with infection, and it is possible for your body to heal a UTI on its own without antibiotics. It is also possible to have a UTI with little or no symptoms. Maybe you have had one for years and it flares up every now and again. I think you should consult your physician. Do you have nay behaviors or physical reasons that would make you more susceptible to UTI's? These are things a doctor can help you identify and you can learn to better prevent them.

Hey there:
I know from experience that this sort of thing can be hard to discuss. I have no idea for sure, but maybe this is related to some kind of prostate issue? One thing for sure, is that you should go in to see a urologist to find out why this keeps happening. A few years ago I had some problems with that area as well, and some really aching constant pain. It turned out to be a urinary infection type of thing. With specific antibiotics, it was better in a few days. Again, it can be embarrassing to discuss this sort of thing with a doctor, but remember that a specialist sees things like this every day, and will be the only one who can REALLY diagnose it and be sure that it isn't something more serious. Hope this helps a little. Good luck!

How come I can't do headstands anymore?



I used to be in professional gymnastics when I was age 6-10, then I eventually stopped. I still practice some of the things like back walk overs, the splits etc. Now I'm 17, and I've tried to see if I can still master headstands, and I notice that each time I try, I get a maaaajor blood rush! It feels as though my brain is going to explode, so I have to stop. I wanted to know, how come all of a sudden, I can no longer do headstands? THe head rushes never happened to me before..

Smelling burnt plastic/rubber is it bad for you?



About a week a go my rubber/plastic fish for my kitchen sink holder stuff someone threw it in there the dish washer to wash it and it fell to the bottom and landed on a heating coil and it stunk up the house and all the dishes but it was so bad that we couldn't even breath and had to open the doors and windows for hours just to get the smell out. Well today a long rubber/plastic spoon fell on the heating coil and did the same thing. Breathing in those fumes is it bad for you in the long run??? Will it cause any problems later in our bodies????

Is it cheaper to pay for prescriptions using the pharmacy of your HMO provider or elsewhere?



I have Kaiser HMO and I've always used their pharmacy to get prescription medicine from the doctors (it's convenient since the pharmacy is right there in the medical center, but I'm wondering if everyone is just getting overcharged for that convenience on top of already expensive hospital bills).  I was kind of curious if the offers from other prescription centers like Walgreens, etc. might offer better or competitive rates for the same quality of ingredients.  Does anybody know?

Depression is common after quitting a drug habit. The drugs have been so used to fitting the different receptors within your brain, and now that the brain is not being fed by the drugs, depression sets in, because those receptors are not being used anymore currently. I would go to your doctor, and ask them to assist you. There are also some support groups out there that would be able to help you with this problem as well.  Good luck!

well all i can say is if you can not see it than that dont mean it is not there. for instants if a baby was to fall off the couch or something and it is fine you cant see anything wrong with him or her than that dont mean there is nothing wrong. majority of things that go on in people is where they cant see anything it is all internal so i would say after a accident i would be seen asap. It is always better to be safe than sorry.

Depends on the type of injury.If it is a cut and you need stitches, you need to go ASAP and not after 24 hrs. If so, nothing can be done. A broken bone,well some times even the Doctor has to wait for any swelling to go down before he can really do anything. Ice ( on for 20 min off for an hour) and 800 mg of Ibuprofen.Give it a few days and if not better,go see the doctor

<question>



Should I go back to the doctor?



I have been sick for over a month now. I went to the doctor about 3 weeks ago, and he said I had walking pneumonia, a bronchial infection and an inner ear infection in my right ear. He prescribed me a z pac, some perscription cough meds, and an inhaler.



I took the correct doses of the z pac, which I thought was supposed to clear up any infection. I also finished up the bottle of cough meds last week. I am still using the inhaler.



I have been coughing continuously, but it did get a little better the week after I stopped the zpac. Now it is back and worse than ever, you can hear me wheezing when I breathe, and my right tonsil is so swollen it is touching my uvula.



I don't have health insurance, so the doc visit would have to be paid out of pocket.



I am just wondering if anyone else has had something similar to this, and if you think it may just go away over time....thanks!

Severe Parnaoia - Suicidal - Please Help...?



(yes i asked this before but i was practially ignored)



Hi, I suffer from Paranoia. It is making going to school unbearable. I take panic attacks, get distracted and am starting to lose all my friends. I think everyone is out to get me and am afraid to go. I am on new medication to try and help me but it takes 3 months to start to have an effect and I dont think I can go through going to school for this long. I want to stay off school but my mum wont let me because she says this will make it worse, but I really can't go in, it makes me suicidal but she doesnt understand. So what I am asking is there anyway I could get an illness or something that would make me be of school for 'til after Christmas.

Honestly it shoulds like you already have one.  You need to be straight up with your mum or tell her you need to see your doctor.  They can refer you to a psychiatrist and you can talk with them.  After opening up to them I believe they will give you the help you need and explain to your mum.  Don't try to handle this alone.  Many people have panic attacks, etc. and can live with it after the proper medication and treatment.  Please talk to your mum.

Do you have a therapist that you talk too and what kind of medication are you on that takes 3 months to start to have an effect?  The reason I ask is I work at a vocational program with persons who are mentally ill or developmentally ill and the medications they take show results in a fairly reasonable amount of time and if they are not working, the guardians work closely with the doctors and therapist to set up a medication treatment that would work.



If you are not seeing a therapist, I suggest that be your first step.  Suicidal thoughts should be taken seriously and if you are on medication, I don't know why your mom is not taking this seriously.  Doesn't sound like you are in college because you could just drop your classes.  I can't think of any illness that would keep you out of school until after Christmas and besides, I don't think this will alleviate your problem.  If you have a therapist, it could be diagnosed by him that it would be best for you to stay out of school until your paranoia is more manageable and you could do your school work at home.  I hope I helped some sweetie and good luck!

Please go and see your doctor and take your mum with you so that he can explain directly to your mum. The worse thing anybody can tell a person who isn't feeling well is 'Pull yourself together', Your mum has to know how to deal with this and the only person who she'll listen to will be the doctor. After the visit, then perhaps you and your mum can sit down together and talk about it. Also, the doctor may be able to help you get your school work sent home to you so that you don't fall behind with your work. And then when you are better (which will happen) you won't have lost out.

hello i was the same way when i was about 13 until i was 17 i am now 23. I would get meds that the doctor would prescribe to me and i would not take them cause i did not think that they was going to help me.my mom would put me in the sch unit all the time and i did not like that. they diagnosed me with paranoid scho lol but i was the same way as you and than i would get hard headed and into the i dont care mood and just stayed in that mood and i am still in that mood and i am just like i dont care what other people think. I dont live my life for them. And if you think about it you only live once so dont waist years on being scared of what other people think. Just get into the i dont care mode and i think you will be ok..

First off, I don't know if you have God in your life but that is the first place to start. Prayer is sometimes the last and only thing we have left in life, So if you don't have God in your life then start with learning about Jesus Christ. This is not a religous message but it all starts and ends with God.



Secondly, if you have insurance then you should seek counseling with a Therapist to go along with the medication you are taking. Both go hand in hand.



Thirdly, if you don't see a Therapist then you need  to talk to someone about your feelings. That usually helps when coming to grips with whatever yor're facing. Let it all out and cry if you have to. Crying is a great cleanser.



Finally, no one is after you, you are a speacial person no matter what hard things we go through, and your mon does not want you to give up becasue you will slip into a deep depression that's hard to get out of. Life is tough and suicide is the worst thing you can do to yourself. Life is not all about you so you don't have the right to  kill yourself. Suicide also effects those who love you. And you are loved. That's why I go back to talk about God. If you don't know him then what I'm saying does not make much sense and you are probably tired of readinbg what I'm writing. If you don't start with God then you will never have the peace you are looking for. You want inner peace and not the peace the world gives.



Anyway, I hope you face these issuse and feelings head on because that is how you get through them. Don't take drugs, alcohol, sex, food, or anything else that you think is going to help you put these feelings behind you becuase you will only make matters worse.



If you want more info on learning about Jesus Christ, write back and let me know. Take care and God Bless.

Anger is like a bomb the bigger the bomb the longer the string i have a very long string and its nearly ended?



usually i'm a passive, friendly who cares what u think about me i'm happy anyway type of person. but every year in summer time i snap. in grade 1 i got angry at mum cause she wouldn't give me some sweets and so when mum and my brother went out i unscrewed all the door handles so no1 could get in or out, i hid the door handles so no1 could let them in either. i superglued the windows shut as well and mum had to call the police to get in.



in grade 6 i was getting bullied all year round by grade 7 kids usually i ignored them but i was walking to the oval to hide and they found me. when they called me a name i grabbed one of them who was massive compared to me and i grabbed his shoulder, dug my nails in and removed the skin down to his wrist then i held on to his wrist put it behind him and bent his elbow the wrong way till he screamed. thats the sort of thing i don't want happening again no matter wat they do to me. if u have experience with this sort of thing could u tell me how to avoid it. i also have heat strokes and am used to the cold more thats why i think i happens in summer- 2day it was 30 degrees celcius and it will get hotter. i hate losing control of myself and i'm already showing signs of coming to the end of my string

I feel sick every morning?



Every single morning I feel sick to my stomach, I Absolutely can't eat for a couple of hours.  Even thinking of food makes me want to vomit.  After a few hours I feel a little better so I make myself eat something, I still feel sick while I am eating and for about a half hour after, but then I feel better.
This has been going on for about 2 weeks, otherwise I am completely healthy and have no problems.  I eat healthy, and take care of myself.



Any ideas on what the heck is wrong with me?

Of course the first thing that comes to most people's minds is that you're knocked up.  If you rule that out completely, then I ask if you have any neck or back problems.  Many times if something is out of place it will make you feel sick off and on.



You should visit your doctor to find out the true reason.  We're all just guessing and not really the best choice for diagnosing you.



You should still take a pregnancy test first, though.

I was just wondering if staples would like conduct infection and like germs and bacteria. the material its made out of.



and how long does it take for the piercing to take effect EG i can take out the staple and put in a small regular ear ring?

How can I tell the difference between a corn and a plantar's wart?



On the plantar region of my foot (beneath pinky toe on the bottom, specifically), there's a painful round "thing". I can actually see the yellow gel-like (it looks like) "kernel" lodged in the center, and it presses on nerves. No black spots. A little dryness around it, but not always. It's not all that patchy looking as some of the pictures on Google Images for a plantar's wart...
Also, I've heard that a plantar's wart shouldn't have any lines from your foot running through it, if that makes sense, but mine does...



Which could it be?

Levoxyl (hypothyroidism) Question : HELP?



Hi! I started taking Levoxyl about two weeks ago, as of now I take 25 MCG. Within the first few days I felt SO DIFFERENT mentally, in a good way. For the first time in a while I wanted to go out, and I wasnt constantly thinking of stuff that was bothering me, befor this I use to cry at least 3Xs a day for NO REASON AT ALL. I feel great mentally! My metabolism deffintaly seems to have gotten a bit of a boost also! Will this help me loose weight if i eat correctly? befor I could diet for years and it wouldnt work. As for side effects, I have the occasional bad headache, a tiny bit of joint pain, some cramps some times, and dry skin, but the weather is also changing. so who knows if thats from the levoxyl. The only thing bothering me is my heart. some times it feels like its going to beat out of my chest. What I would imagine it feels like to get those paddels shock you at the hospital (except with out the pain). Its scary, it always happens when Im trying to fall asleep and someitmes randomly throughout the day. Anyone know what that is, if i can stop it?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



STROKE?? Do NOT listen to the previous answer - it's completely wrong.



The uncontrollable shaking and cold feeling is from fever - your body is fighting an infection and you've developed an elevated temperature in the night.  Take your temperature orally with a thermometer ASAP.  If the number is 99-100, you have a low grade fever and need to keep an eye on it.  If it's 101-103 you have a moderate fever and need to see a doctor in the morning, if its higher than 103.5, you should consider a trip to the ER or a phone call to a nurse on call for your regular physician.  Taking your temperature will give you a clearer picture of what's going on, and help your doctor treat you, which is why it is so important to take it sooner rather than later.  Make sure not to drink anything before taking an oral temperature, as it will throw off the reading.



After determining the fever level, you need to take two Advil or Tylenol to reduce it, then crawl right back in bed and go back to sleep.  Drink plenty of fluids, and rest!



I can tell you what I believe is going on, but you'll need to see a doctor in the morning for sure, particularly if the fever persists or gets worse.



I believe you have a likely UTI (urinary tract infection).  This is usually accompanied by fever, and sometimes also by nausea, cold-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue.  The number one symptom - and the red flag in your cause - is pain or burning with urination.  Your doctor will run tests tomorrow to diagnose for sure, but a UTI or maybe bladder infection are the leading probable causes here.  Both need antibiotics to resolve, so see your physician ASAP!



Feel better, and make that appointment!

Can anyone help me find a used rigid frame wheelchair?



Here is my dilemma, I am a very active disabled person who is well for lack of better words Fricking hard on chairs because I am so active. Now the chair that I have now is falling apart, and of course Medicare will not help me purchase another. Recently the back axcel on my chair has broken, and caused some injuries to my kidney, chest and wrist. Heres the kicker, instead of paying for a new or even fixing the old medicare straight up told me they would rather pay for the Doctor visits (which by the way add up to the cost of 2 new chairs) then help fix or replace the current chair. Being that my wheelchair is falling apart I am unable to work do to the fear of being hurt at work. So I am unable to afford any other insurance. Any advise would be great! Thank You. I do apologize for my horrible spelling I was only able to use one hand.

Yes, that's very possible. If you've had a stressful day or even some underlying stress that has made it's way into your subconscious, it can wake you up. Shortness of breath is generally a sign of a panic attack. You might want to start to keep track of how long your shortness of breath lasts or if it intensifies and then subsides. Check different sources for signs of panic attacks, and anxiety, etc. There are many medications that can help from short term medications like xanax to longer lasting ones, such as prozac.



Hope this helps :-)

Well from my opinion.
Try and restrict yourself from eating these stuffs.
Maybe try and eat once a week or something.



It will cause some teeth problems I think.
And yea it's bad for your health. Don't eat too much sweet stuffs.

one of the side effects is slight pain at the injection site. try taking ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily.(MAKE SURE YOU EAT WHEN TAKING IT) as it could cause an upset stomach.
i work for a doctor and this is what he recommends.

Depends on what you read.  Most drug companies claim there are no side effects other than inflammation at the injection site.  Course, if you are allergic to eggs there would be profound side effects to the flu shot as that is the medium in which the virus' are grown.  Pneumonia shot is to be administered every 10 yrs for compromised individuals so there really aren't any side effects other than at the injection site.  I personally have mixed feelings about the annual flu shots.

Cutting may not seem like a serious problem to you, but it really is. While some people may be able to handle this on their own and make themself stop cutting, most times, people need professional help. Firstly, talk to your parent or guardian if you are comfortable talking to them. If you feel like you can't talk to them, talk to a guidance counselor in school or even a friend and let them know you want to stop. If you don't speak up, no one will know.



There are many reasons that people cut, some people like how it feel, some people just want to feel something, anything. Whatever your reasons are, I'm glad that you're trying to stop, it shows how mature you are.



The first step is always to tell someone who you trust, then seek professional help in your school or somewhere near by.



You seem like a very strong person that just needs some guidance, good luck and keep your head up =)

You can try to stop without telling anyone but what might work better is to actually tell someone.  In telling someone, you are actually admitting to yourself that you would like some help, and freeing yourself from the burden of carrying around this secret that must be just overwhelming.



Can even tell a school counselor if telling a parent is out of the question at this time.  But in keeping this to yourself, it can only get worse.  You've taken a first step in at least mentioning it here....good job!

This is difficult to answer because all cutters do not cut for the same reason.  You are going to have to get to the root of WHY you are cutting before you can stop, and you may need professional help for that.  Many people who stop cutting on their own just end up switching to another self-destructive behavior.  I'm going to advise that you do tell someone, so that you can get the appropriate help.  WHO you tell is entirely up to you.
For now, here is a resource that you may find very helpful - there is a lot of information and they may be able to guide you to someone in your area that you can speak to.

Dont listen to all these idiots!



Suicide is not an option you seem really cute.
Cutting yourself seems like a good idea when your hurting yourself it feels good because your taking your anger out on yourself rather than other people there is no explanation why people do this,



You really have to think to yourself is it really worth it?
you will regret it one day when you have all these scars?
From the age of 14 i cut myself, and i felt like it was a good idea at the time now i look back and think this is stupid,



Wether your problem is depression or just curiosity, I would really see a doctor if it is depression as sometimes they can prescribe something to you to get your brain to think hmm this really isnt that bad?
Maybe you should think about talking to someone annonomously over the phone or online this will help!! As your getting a second opinion and someone can then help you to sort out your problems, and you will really see that cutting yourself isnt the answer



If you really need someone to talk to i am definatly here,



if you feel like you cant tell parents talk to SOMEONE



You dont need to go into great detail but just talking to someone will really help lighten your spirits



Good luck kiddo let me know if you need anything :):)

What is the reason for your cutting? oftentimes it is deepseated urge for something a person lacks....if you can fix the root problem, you can stop the cutting....of course, easier said than done, and that usually calls for professional assistance from a person you can trust.



On the other hand, at your age, your hormones can have a tremendous effect on you. Sometimes you'll get agitated and moody for no reason. Hence, cutting sort of "releases" your stress and pressures from school or at home. Cutting can give a sense of control over your emotions, when you cut, it masks your emotions and makes you feel better, or sometimes stronger.



Keep a diary and jot down your feelings and anything at the end of the day. Whenever you have the urge, jot down reasons why you feel the way you do. If you can't seem to find a reason, it could be "that time of the month" or physical changes you have no control of--once you recognize the root cause of your urges, you can tell yourself, "oh, i know why I'm feeling this way, I don't have to do this"....



Right now, you are young, having your problems growing up, having your insecurities, entering high-school....it can be tough. But trust me, everything you make a big deal out of in your teens you will soon realize they aren't a big deal after all. This is why, at your age, you may feel cutting is bearable, but when you have to carry the scars in your young adult life in college or at work, it can cause severe regret, embarrassment...and you have to fix THAT as well. Better to stop now than later...when you reach 19 or 20, your skin will be more prone to scarring.



Good luck, and be smart in your decision. Cos honestly, cutting is stupid, no matter what reason you may have... and that is from my personal experience.

Stomach bugs/viruses are common. They can take up to two weeks to clear up.



I'm not sure why your doctor told you to watch television all day, but it sounds odd to me.



Are you female? There could be an obvious reason to your stomach pain.



Also, if all else fails, try warming a water bottle and placing it on your tummy. Take advil or nurofen. Try to avoid dairy products.



Good luck, I can understand how it can really ruin your day.

Oh, that's right!  Take the advice of the doctor and rest and let that bug eat the food it needs so it can grow up and have a lot of babies and maybe some of those will move out of you and go to somebody else where they can feed and reproduce and go on down the line and every body will have so much fun.  If your stomach hurts, it is probably something you ate is stuck in there and it's trying to come out but it can't because you're so worried about being sick and you're stopping yourself up.  Relax!

My 16month old daughter has a very red rash.?



My daughter has a very red rash, No fever and is acting completely normal (if not more hyped up). This rash has been showing up around her mouth on and off for a while. it comes up a few hours later it is gone. Tonight however it is ALL over. On her legs, arms, mouth cheeks and a little on her tummy.



I'm worried but not paniced because I'm thinking more slight allergy over major health issue.



We did have a frozen Pizza as it is Fast food night. Usually we have Home made fish & chips or home made burgers (we don't actually buy fast food). Then yesterday when it started on her face (just on chin and cheeks) she had weat bix and 1 tea spoon of sugar.

hey hun it sounds like an allergic reaction. My daughter went to a party and had face paint on. When we took it off her face was covered in a bright red rash it looked like someone had slapped her cheeks. The next day it was hardly there when i got her from school she was covered from head to toe, i took her to docs to get it checked out she was fine it was a reaction to something. Make sure the rash disappears when u press on it or press a glass on it if it doesnt blanch when pressed get her straight to a an e. We found out my daughters reaction was a grass allergy. hope she is ok. xx

It isn't a bad thing. You're only 14, you still have time to grow out of it. Your leg muscles usually develop better over time. If you cannot wait and it is affecting your lifestyle, you can consider surgery, but that is typically an absolute last resort.



Braces or shoe modifications won't typically help. In a few children with a very strong inward twist of the thigh bone, an operation is possible to cut this bone and twist it outward, so the feet will point straight ahead. Surgery is only considered in very severe cases.



Good luck, and don't worry too much.

Just concentrate on the way you walk and don't chew any gum at the same time.  It is not something that needs to be cured.  It is relative.  Your parents gave it to you so you would concentrate on the way you walk and try to fix it yourself.  If you have surgery, that is going to cause so many other problems.  And don't worry about what other people think about your walking, you can outsmart them!

Should I take my daughter to a orthopedic doctor and/or demand an MRI?



Two months ago my six year old daughter was diagnosed with juvenile scoliosis. she recently went back to her pediatrician and they said there was rapid growth and her spine progressed from a 2 the a five in only two months. the pediatrician said that he would refer her to a ortho dr if depending on her x-ray. she got a X-ray the next day and it turns out she is at 14 degrees. her pediatrician says to bring her back in three months to see if she is still progressing. now every thing I read on the internet says any child under 10 yrs and with a 10 degree or more should have a MRI. What should I do?

If it were my child, I'd take her to a scoliosis specialist. Her back will probably need monitoring and treatment. There's no way to predict how fast her curve will increase or by how much,



An x-ray may be good enough for the specialist. If that's true, you won't need the MRI. If an MRI is needed, the specialist will tell you.



Source(s):



I had my scoliosis detected in 7th grade and wore a Milwaukee brace from 8th grade until my freshman year in college. I was borderline on whether to have surgery or not so it was decided not to do it. Over the years, my curve increased so I had my spine fused at age 39.

Did you drink last night? Or eat something that may have made you sick... It's very possible (esp. around this time of the year) that you are getting sick... That's usually how you feel when you're getting sick. You didn't feel like that before you went to bed though? Just call the doctor.

It sounds as though you maybe experiencing some sinus troubles or it is very possible you have awoken to a migraine. There is a possibility that this is due to the onset of illness. If these symptoms persist or you develop a fever I would suggest making an appointment with your doctor.

How do you calm yourself if you have anxiety? ?



I think that I have really bad anxiety and stress. I feel lightheaded and spacey all of the time. I get paranoid very easily, and it just feels like I am out of this world! ???? I try not to think about it so much, so I won't freak out. It also gets worse at night, and when I am on the computer (which is really bad bc I am a graphic artist). Help! What should I do?!

Hi...suffered this for many,many years and only recently got a grip of it...the first thing to do is try and identify when one moments are about to ake place...when you find the point where you can tell you are about to have a moment stop what you are doing and sit down...breathe in your nose and as you do count up to six...then exhale,again counting to six...keep doing this...deep breathing is one of the best ways to combat this...breathing into a brown paper bag also helps if things are really bad...the brown paper allows some of the carbon dioxide out but keeps a lot in the bag...you need to breath this to drop the adrenaline which is flowing through you...again take deep breaths and breathe slowly...you sound like your close to having a full blown panic attack and you really want to try and avoid this as they are horrible and distressing things...relax as often as you can which i know is hard in this world today...hope this help...take care

Low white blood count cells?



For years, I've had my repetitive white blood count cells checked becasue there has been a pattern that it is below an average person.
I've had a bone marrow biopsy, and a test for sinuses. But everything came back as normal.
I do get horrible headaches every day which the medication is not working. My headaches are always on the one side and my face is hot to the touch. A cold shower to cool my body off helps SOMETIMES, it's like the cold releases pressures on my head.



Can anyone tell me anything useful about the blood count and these headaches?

Did the doctor told you about low white count cells?  You could have anemia.  The headaches could be migraine headache, which it's start that way and even the pill doesn't help.  The only thing that could help you is to put a bag of ice and try to avoid the light, go and laid down.  They have a special pill for migrane headache called something like fiorinal.  You should go back and seek a second opinion since your white blood cell are too low you maybe your are anemic, you need a lot of iron, like raisin, water crest are very high in iron.  I hope you feel better.  I herd that the migrane is caused by stress, the vein in the head get shrink and is hard for the blood to pass by, but the cold water it help.

Thx for answer but anemia is caused by a loss of RED blood cells. I'll have to go back to the clinic again and get a different kind of medication.

Its was indicated aa a result from taking steriods to control a disesase called addisons syndrome. Thats when the fluid retion begun after steriod therapy.!

Sometimes swelling in the ankles and feet can be indicative of an underlying health problem such as diabetes or even congestive heart failure.  You really need to take him to have a check up by a doctor to rule that out. If it is just extra fluid there are very inexpensive prescription medications the doctor can prescribe to aleviate the edema.  Good luck!

You have an oxygen center in your brain that registers how mow much oxygen you have in your body.  You fainted because of lack of oxygen; that's what happens when you lack oxygen, you faint.  When you hold your breath, your body loses the ability to create energy and your muscles give out.  It was induced hypoxia.

Bad blood circulation in feet and hands?



My feet are always cold, even if my body isn't, my hands aren't quite as bad but my feet are painful to walk on if im out and there slightly cold. They go purple and my hands go very pale sometimes, like a pale purply colour. My feet often feel icey cold and hands quite stiff. Even if im warm and say i get into a bath as soon as my feet touch the water it sends pins and needles up my whole legs, but my feet sometimes even if i am not cold, like now for instance have pins and needles, what could be wrong and do i need to see a someone, or is it just bad blood circulation?

you should see a doctor to see how bad it is ...  there is a medication you can take if you have it to a certain severity ...



"The phenomenon is more common in women than men, with the Framingham Study finding that 5.8% of men and 9.6% of women suffered from it.



Raynaud's phenomenon, in medicine, is a vasospastic disorder causing discoloration of the fingers, toes, and occasionally other extremities. This condition can also cause nails to become brittle with longitudinal ridges. Named for French physician Maurice Raynaud (1834 - 1881), the cause of the phenomenon is believed to be the result of vasospasms that decrease blood supply to the respective regions. Emotional stress and cold are classic triggers of the phenomenon, and the discoloration follows a characteristic pattern in time: white, blue and red.



It comprises both Raynaud's disease (primary Raynaud's), where the phenomenon is idiopathic,[1] and Raynaud's syndrome (secondary Raynaud's), where it is caused by some other instigating factor. Measurement of hand-temperature gradients is one tool used to distinguish between the primary and secondary forms.[2]



It is possible for the primary form to progress to the secondary form."

<answer>



it's spelled RAYNAUD'S...



Raynaud's disease is a condition that causes some areas of your body — such as your fingers, toes, tip of your nose and your ears — to feel numb and cool in response to cold temperatures or stress. In Raynaud's disease, arteries that supply blood to your skin narrow, limiting blood circulation to affected areas.



Women are more likely to have Raynaud's disease. It's also more common in people who live in colder climates.



Treatment of Raynaud's disease depends on its severity and the presence of associated conditions. For most people, Raynaud's disease is more a nuisance than a disability.



Signs and symptoms include:



Sequence of color changes in your skin in response to cold or stress



Numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or relief of stress



During an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of your skin usually turn white at first. Then, the areas often turn blue and feel cold and numb, and your sensory perception is dulled. As circulation improves, the affected areas may turn red, throb, tingle or swell. The order of the changes of color isn't the same for all people, and not everyone experiences all three colors.



Occasionally, an attack affects just one or two fingers or toes. Attacks don't necessarily always affect the same digits. Although Raynaud's most commonly affects your fingers and toes, the condition can also affect other areas of your body, such as your nose, lips, ears and even nipples. An attack may last less than a minute to several hours.



People who have Raynaud's accompanied by another disease will likely also have signs and symptoms related to their underlying condition.



Doctors don't completely understand the cause of Raynaud's attacks, but blood vessels in the hands and feet appear to overreact to cold temperatures or stress:



Cold temperatures. When your body is exposed to cold temperatures, your extremities lose heat. Your body slows down blood supply to your fingers and toes to preserve your body's core temperature. Your body specifically reduces blood flow by narrowing the small arteries under the skin of your extremities. In people with Raynaud's, this normal response is exaggerated.



Stress. Stress causes a similar reaction to cold in the body, and likewise the body's response may be exaggerated in people with Raynaud's.



Blood vessels in spasm. With Raynaud's, arteries to your fingers and toes go into what's called vasospasm. This constricts the vessels dramatically and temporarily limits blood supply. Over time, these same small arteries may also thicken slightly, further limiting blood flow. The result is that affected skin turns a pale and dusky color due to the lack of blood flow to the area. Once the spasms subside and blood returns to the area, the tissue may turn red before returning to a normal color.



Cold temperatures are most likely to provoke an attack. Exposure to cold can be as simple as putting your hands under a faucet of running cold water, taking something out of the freezer or exposure to cold air. For some people, exposure to cold temperatures isn't necessary. Emotional stress alone can cause an episode of Raynaud's.



Some researchers are studying whether Raynaud's may be partly an inherited disorder.



Primary vs. secondary Raynaud's



Raynaud's occurs in two main types:



Primary Raynaud's. This is Raynaud's without an underlying disease or associated medical problem that could provoke vasospasm. Also called Raynaud's disease, it's the most common form of the disorder.



Secondary Raynaud's. Also called Raynaud's phenomenon, this form is caused by an underlying problem. Although secondary Raynaud's is less common than the primary form, it tends to be a more serious disorder. Signs and symptoms of secondary Raynaud's usually first appear at later ages — around 40 — than they do for people with the primary form of Raynaud's.



Causes of secondary Raynaud's include:



Scleroderma
Lupus



Rheumatoid arthritis



Sjogren's syndrome



Diseases of the arteries



Carpal tunnel syndrome



Repetitive trauma



Smoking



Prior Injuries to the hands or feet



Certain medications
Chemical exposure
Thyroid gland disorders

My daughter is 12 months old and has a break out on her back?



My daughter just got her 12 months shots which included the chicken pox, measles, mumps, and rubella. She also got her flu shot. When i was changing her diaper I notice a 2 bumps on her lower belly where her diaper had covered and in the center was a white dot. Almost looking like a very small pimple. I thought nothing of it until she rolled over and i seen more going up her spine and across her lower back right above her diaper. I'm curious to know if any one might have an idea as to what it might be. I am thinking an allergic reaction. But i tried to look up pictures to see what it should look like and it looks nothing like the pictures. Thank you for all your answers!

Sounds like it may be an ingrown hair, which is pretty common and further irritated by the application of antiperspirant which frequently will sort of plug the pores.



Can try applying a hot wash cloth that has been zapped in the microwave for about 15 seconds (can put it in a plastic bag to retain heat but don't burn yourself).  Zap it again when it cools off for a total of about 15 minutes of application.

What is in strawberries that stops my chronic leg cramps almost instantly?



I suffer from chronic leg cramps and restless leg syndrome. One afternoon when my legs were being particularly painful, a friend brought me a basket of big perfect strawberries. After eating two (BIG) berries, I noticed my legs started tingling a bit in a good way, like when they get massaged and are relaxing. Within another 10 or 15 minutes, the pain had abated and they were not cramping any more. Since then, I have used strawberries to relieve my legs several more times and they worked although not as dramatically. What vitamin, nutrient or other molecule do they contain that could be so immediately helpful in such a way?

Leg cramps are often caused by a shortage in potassium. If the strawberries are working then a banana will work even better. A serving of strawberries has 233 mg of potassium. One banana has 422 mg of potassium.



A strawberry is a superstar when it comes to anti-oxidant power, says Dr. Barry Sears in his book The Top 100 Zone Foods. In addition, 1 cup of strawberries gives you a whopping 140 percent of your recommended daily allowance of vitamin C. Strawberries are also packed with flavonoids, two in particular, called quercetin and kaempferol. Research shows that these two flavonoids help keep “bad” (LDL) cholesterol from oxidizing and damaging artery walls.



Strawberries also contain ellargic acid — also found in raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, grapes, cherries, walnuts, pecans and Brazil nuts — which acts as a scavenger to “bind” cancer-causing chemicals, making them inactive. It inhibits the ability of other chemicals to cause mutations in bacteria. In addition, it prevents binding of carcinogens to DNA and reduces the incidence of cancer in cultured human cells exposed to carcinogens.

Nicotine is one of the most addictive things in the world. cocaine is scientifically proven to be easier to quite than cigarettes.. its obvious because you still crave them, 1 year on and you crave them.. i suggest that you get nicotine patches.. you wont get the badness of the cigarettes and it will calm you down..

I suggest that you stay away from cigarette and from people that smoke in front of you, smoking is way more harmful than you may think.
If you care about your baby, which i m sure you do, avoid any contact with cigarette.
Good luck

You are thinking like an addict.  You are rationalizing and making excuses.  Smoking is deadly.  You owe it to your baby and to yourself to be the healthiest person you can be.  When you get stressed go for a jog around the block or have as bath and read a book.... anything that quiets you down.  Smoking is for idiots.  You are stronger than you think.

This is a slippery slope.  Right now you don't smoke.  Start with one a day, then two a day, then only a pack a day.



Hang tight and stay off the weed.



According to a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 20% of male and female adults in the U.S. smoke cigarettes, while more than 80% of them light up a cigarette every day. The reason why smoking has become such an issue is because the addictive effects of nicotine lead to various types of cancers, strokes, and heart attacks. As such, everyday is the RIGHT TIME to quit smoking.

No, smoking is never okay to do.. especially when you have a baby. Are you breastfeeding? If so, then you DEFINITELY shouldn't smoke. If you're not breastfeeding, then I would think about doing it because it's a lot healthier for your baby. Whether you breastfeed or not, the smoke still stays on you even if you smoke outside.
It's never easy to quit... especially after you have quit before. I would stay away from cigarettes and not even smoke ONE. If you smoke one, then you'll end up smoking two.. then three.. etc. Think about the health for you and your baby.

Do not smoke period.  There is always this temptation.  Once you pick up a cigarette you will be hooked and I guarantee you will not be able to smoke only a few.  I smoked for 35 years and quite several times, always went back and when I went back it was for years at a time. until I made up my mind to quite for good.  You have to accept the fact that smoking is a deadly addiction, just the same as alcohol.  Hang in there.  Replace the bad smoking habit with a good one.  Go our for a walk, chew a stick of gum, or call someone to help you through the temptation.  Cause that is wat it is.  It will go away for good if you wait long enough and constantly say no to the cigarette.  Do you rule your life or does that cigarette rule you.  It can be done cause I smoked 3 packs a day for 30 5 years and it did take a toll on my health.  You be wiser.

If you have not smoked for a year then please don't start again. I gave up 5 years ago. The first few weeks are bad but once you are beyond those then the physical craving goes away. Now its only a feeling of getting a taste of old times etc. Don't start. You can chew gum or do something else like draw pics or read more newspapers etc. Believe me it does not help. A cig goes off in 5 to 7 minutes and what do you do after that.



If you smoke one or two cigs per day then the craving will be even worse.

Well smoking is never ok. My mom has been smoking all my life she smoked in the house for quite awhile but then I convinced her to smoke outside. Though I suggest you don't pick up the bad habit no matter how much you think you need it. Mentally you should try to convince your self that you don't need it and put some exercise in there maybe you wont need to smoke. Just try and when your body can't handle it anymore you can go back but just realize its going to cause more problems and you need to be there for you baby in the future. Also your husband would sure be proud of you that you also made some sacrifice. Wish you the best of luck.

If you start smoking again then it will be three things that will have to get back to the way they were.  And believe me, when that old smoking addiction kick in, there will come a time when it will not matter to you whether you smoke around the baby or not.



Smoking is not the solution even if you light up 1 cig a day or every 2 days.  Smoking is just a temporary fix to calm you.  What you need to do is "take the bull by the horns".  Try identifying why you are experiencing these emotional episodes and get help to resolve them.



Finally, watch your diet and pray.



Yes, when you feel to smoke . . . pray to God.



When you feel the baby blues . . . pray to God.



Also develop the habit of reading the Bible.  Start with the gospel of John - the fourth book in the New Testament, as well as the Psalms.



Nothing calms the nerves and mind better than the word of God.

Definitely not, have patience with yourself, this may be a difficult time for you, therefore think of your baby, this little child has only you now that Dad is in basic training. This little one needs you more than you need to have cigarette, her very life depends on you. Spend your time loving and caring for this child. Sing songs to the baby , play some music for the Baby and for yourself, good music like classics are excellent therapy for the Post natal "blues" Keep your hand and your mid busy with positive thoughts of healing, and do get some exercise, like walking, and going for fresh air when  that is possible. You have been free of an addiction now for a while, and stay that way. Think of all the good things in your life, and write down 5 of them when you get up, and 5 more before going to bed. No 1 is I am free from the tobacco and nicotine addiction No 2 I have this Beautiful and healthy baby to care for , now you add more,  is there a husband to pray for and write to and visit maybe . You will find more as you go along

If you start smoking again, you will have a very hard time quitting,also you have to always be thinking about your baby now and what is best for it. I'm sure your breast feeding still and the nicotine will be passed to your baby threw your milk, which then effects them. I'm in the military and my wife used to smoke and she has told me over and over again how she is so glad you quit, she doesn't get cold or flu as often and she feels a lot better over all, I hope i have been some help. Good luck Jeremiah

Start by becoming a volunteer of a blood donation organisation. Tell them they need to provide you with doctors and stuff. Go to a local college give them a written application on the letter head of the blood donation org. and fix up a date with the principal. Put up a notice on the notice board and you are in business. Make sure lots of boys and girls know.
Once you have learned the ropes from them then you can start your own thing and have it even in your own grandfathers name or whatever.

You need Medical treatment. ER's have programs that are called



Charitable Care. In other words, they pay the bill. Or, they can put you on a payment plan. ER's cannot deny you medical care, a Federal Law.



Please go to the ER and get treated.

as a last resort, there is always an er, they will not turn down a sick patient.
You should call the health department or dhhr and figure out how to get your son on health insurance, just tell them your situation and they will help you. WV is good for help when you need it.

No, you are not crazy ! Your question still requires further Information.
Any fever, chills, or sweats ?? Any nausea ?? Dizziness ?? Headaches ?? Any diarrhea or feeling of constipation ??? Are drinking enough fluids, especially water ??  What was your last meal ?? Chicken or foods made with Mayo or eggs ??



I apologize for the questions but, my intent is to get you to think if you have such symptoms.
It has only been 24 hours.
You may have a 24 hour stomach bug or it could be something else.
If it persists or worsen, go to your Doc.

Can stress really cause your eyelids and face to twitch?



It started about a month or so ago, my upper left eyelid started twitching, and now the right lower area of my eye is twitching. It is driving me crazy, the only factor I can pinpoint would be stress, my job is very demanding. The funny thing is I know I'm stressed, but don't feel like I should have such physical effects. What should I do?

Try taking a quick minute or two to breath/relax when you feel yourself getting stressed. If you aren't in a meeting/with a client, close your eyes for just a minute or two and slowly breath in and out.  Stress can have many physical manifestations, including twitching. You should probably go to a doctor because it may be other things like sensitivity to light or a pollutant in your environment.

My eyes do the same thing, only it's my left, and the corners of my mouth twitches as well. It doesn't matter if we know we are stressed. Our physical bodies can handle only so much stress before it begins to react. It doesn't matter how much we can take psychologically. Try taking a min. to breathe, take a walk, even if it's just down the hall. Get plenty of rest, eat right, and try to exercise. If it's really bothersome go and see your doctor. It could be something else. Good Luck!!!

What could have caused my Dad's death?



My step Dad was diagnosed with Lung Cancer on March 11th 2008. He was given chemo and radiation and went into remission. Every check showed him to be in radical remission. Sept 11, he had a massive heart attack, he had 2 stents put in and was doing really well. After a month, he went to have a full check up and was given a clean bill of health. The next day he felt fine all day, then started coughing up large amounts of blood. He died. He couldn't breath. Any suggestions on what could have caused this? No autopsy was done. My mom couldn't stand the thought of that. It is killing me wondering what happend. I believe in God..and that it was his time...I just wonder what happend...wouldn't you?

He may not have had any obvious cancerous growths, which to a doctor spells "remission." since they cannot find any gross or "proximate" cause for cancer, and at the time showed no active malignant growths.
But here you may want to borrow an anatomy text to find out the structures of the lungs and how they work, plus the organs that border and depend on. The one thing that will stand out is the fragility of lung tissue--it must be very thin so that cells bringing oxygen can travel through their walls one way  while cells bearing CO2 travel the other way. The alveoli, or air sacs, are thinner than tissue paper but must be full of blood cells. Furthermore, the lungs are fed oxygen from the pulmonary arteries, which generate substantial , both from the heart and from their own surrounding  muscle tissue.



So when the lungs are thinned out, the body's own natural processes can overwhelm their tissues, and blood starts leaking. Naturally, the body orders coughing to relieve the organs of unwanted water, and sooner or later parts of the lungs just give way.



I don't mean to belittle the terrible ordeal he and his loved ones went through, but sometimes knowledge can help--and with this info you can go to your pulmonary and cardiac specialists with "how" and use it as a door to "why."

The right side of the body is controlled by the left side of the brain. Humans are very left-brain oriented. Even those supposedly "right-brained" people still use their left side of the brain way more than most other animals. I'd say the only truly right-brained people are like autistic savants. The right side focuses on the details while the left is focuses on the big picture.

Waking up problem in morning?



Hi,
I am unable to control the sleep/drowsiness in the morning.
I sleep at 11 to 12 o clock in night and try to wake up at 6:30 or 7 in  morning with alarm. But stop the watch and again slip into sleep.
I tried to control it by sitting on bed but the pull-in is so strong that I fall asleep in that position also and when legs start paining due to clogging then only I wake up.
Please suggest how to control this and become normal.

How can I tell the difference between a corn and a plantar's wart?



On the plantar region of my foot (beneath pinky toe on the bottom, specifically), there's a painful round "thing". I can actually see the yellow gel-like (it looks like) "kernel" lodged in the center, and it presses on nerves. No black spots. A little dryness around it, but not always. It's not all that patchy looking as some of the pictures on Google Images for a plantar's wart...
Also, I've heard that a plantar's wart shouldn't have any lines from your foot running through it, if that makes sense, but mine does...



Which could it be?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A planter's wart is named such because it was common with farmer's or Planter's...It's a normal wart but because planter were constantly walking in the field...the pressure of walking drives the wart into the skin...Warts are viruses...

You got your biological all messed up. What is a biological clock? It is usually the system that your body uses and its set to when you wake and sleep. Youve set your biological clock to 3 am or 508 am and thats the problem. Try to gradually make your sleeping time earlier and earlier. Let's say tonight make it. 2am. try it for maybe a couple of days? then After that sleep in 1am. try and try and try until youve set your sleeping time more earlier.



PS: Don't think about anything else if you're gonna sleep. Stare at the ceiling wall for about 10 mins and clear your mind about anything so that you wont have problem in shutting those eyes to sleep. / Hope this helps

hi, i have the same problem tonight.



try reading something really boring. don't let yourself worry, or think of unpleasant things. you could always try counting sheep or just counting backwards from 100.



try having some hot soup or warm milk or tea. don't stay in bed if you can't sleep, get up and read or have some tea. if you stay in bed you'll just stress about needed to get to sleep... which will prevent you from falling asleep.



ah, i hope you have a good night.

You have a throat infection.
Throat infections normally pass on to ear infections.
So go to the doctor and he will most likely give you medication for your ear which also helps your throat.



Eat plenty of fruit and drink loads of cold water.
Do not breath in your babies face as it is easily spread.



Go to the pharmacy and they can give you sucky sweets which helps relieve pain.



It is sore i know.



Hope you get better soon.

Seems like the flu! or maybe your just going through a negative stage in your life, remember the sore throat, ear ache and headache are all related.



I can tell you how to cure them!



first its a good sign that you keep falling asleep so don't stop yourself from doing so.
Headache:- take pain killers
Sore throat:- tea, mints, gargle mouthwash, coff medicine or rub vapour rub around your neck!
Ear ache:- you can buy ear candles o hear they are good. or ear drops and antibiotics

A seasonal malady - colds do not only effect the nose you can get sore throats ear ache other aches and pains. Hot lemon drink laced with a teaspoonful of honey.



As far as babs is concerned he/she ought to still have a certain amount of natural immunity so try not to worry too much there is very little you can do to prevent air born germs but layoff the kissing babs until you think your cold has cleared up. Keep you and babs warm wrap up warmly and eat well and you will be fine. Your probably a little run down so Kiwi fruits will help to built up your immunity,

I would say that you possibly have a sinus infection. One does not have to have a stuffy nose to have a sinus infection. The infection comes from bacteria that causes the sinus cavities, which are located in the face and head to become blocked causing a headache. This can also drip in the throat to cause a sore throat and ear infection. Anyone that has had an anatomy class would know that the ear, nose and throat are all connected that's why we have ear, nose and throat doctors. You are falling asleep because your body is probably trying to get rest to fight the infection that is in your body. I would recommend you see your doctor or go to an Urgent care to receive antibiotics for your illness.

Weed's just as bad for you and it doesn't make it good for you if its for social reasons! (Most heavy weed smokers end up anti-social anyway) Depression, mental health problems, breathing problems.... need i go on.



please don't start! i started smoking cigarettes at 15 and 10 years later i still can't kick the habit. i also have friends who started as social joint smokers and they are now dependant on it and have no end of health problems. its not big, clever or social anymore.

You don't want to do something just for social reasons because there is no telling what these friends will convince you to do next while you are high.  Even though most kids think marijuana is harmless you can still get hurt.  Your cognitive abilities won't be at their best and your reflexes definitely aren't.  Also marijuana IS addictive! Just make your own decisions.

I'm not going to get preachy on you. Just give you the facts. At that age your emotional and physical states are still developing. Using any kind of drug or alcohol effects the development of your physical and psychological well being. Also your hormones are already out of wack at that age, so adding any mind altering chemicals can alter your actual perception and the perceptions of doctors as to whether or not you are developing properly. It can also lead to misdiagnosis of serious medical issues. And of course it is the "gateway drug" so starting at a young age will most like lead quickly to other drugs and could seriously effect your quality of life as you get older.Best bet: stay away until you are older if at all.

At 13, a person has not fully developed the awareness of consequence (not an opinion, that's a psychology study).  You can talk all about the effects of narcotics on the body, but it doesn't seem to resonate.



When we are that young, we have a tendency to do stupid things just because someone suggests it... or we think it sounds cool.  We don't think "hmm, how will this affect me a few years down the road.  How will it affect others if it kills me or makes me a quadriplegic, or fries my brain so I have no sense of reality."



By asking the question, you obviously know there is something wrong with it,  because you wouldn't be asking if you didn't care.  The problem is consequence.  It is a "gateway" drug.  It is addicting.  Some people say it isn't, but ask anyone who is addicted to it, or has recovered from the addiction and they will tell you otherwise.  "Social" drug use leads to more social drug use, which leads to addiction.



Oh, and for all you know, the joints could be laced with Meth.  There have been a lot of cases of that around here.  High School kids drug tested who readily admitted to smoking weed, but had not used meth, tested positive for meth.  The joints were laced without their knowledge.  Great way for the meth sellers to get people addicted.



If you have the "not me" mentality... stop it.  Yes, you.  You can become addicted.



If you have the "I can stop any time I want, I just don't want to" mentality... stop it.  You're already addicted. Own up to it.  You don't want to stop because you're addicted, duh.



If you tried it once and that was it... ok, fine.  We all do stupid things.  We try things we shouldn't even though people from experience will tell us how stupid it is.  Don't do it again.  Learn from other people's mistakes as much as you can instead of learning the hard way.

The Lunesta label recommends that you take right before bed and make sure that at least 8 hours are given to sleep because this product can cause hallucinations or sleep walking. Since you are watching television while effected by this medication, hallucinations began to occur while you are watching television because the product is attempting to cause your brain to fall into sleep mode. You are capable of seeing just about anything if you are watching television while under the influence of a hypnotic medication.

Yes it could make you hungrier with the fact that when your body is fighting an infection, the metabolism is working overtime to fight the infection.  Any process like this takes energy, and that is what makes you feel hungry.

Of course it will lead to infection. However, if you change the staple to a regular surgical metal earring, (sterilized), then you will be fine.



If you do not treat your ear (the cheapest way is to use ear buds with methylated spirits or try a sugar-free listerine), you can end up with swelling, pain and infection.



You can attempt taking the staple out now, but you are told by professional piercer to wait 6 weeks.



Use a sleeper to begin with. Studs collect bacteria around the back.



Good luck and don't be so silly next time. Use a sterilized safety pin! You can quickly sterile with alcohol or an open flame.
Never keep the staple/pin in your ear lobe, change it right away.

I don't know if that's a question or a suggestion, but being a dog lover (and a doctor), i think that is a wrong notion.



Whenever any1 is having a fit, human or animal, nothing should be fed to them. They can aspirate it into their lungs and die of suffocation. Fits will not kill themselves.



Try to insert a small folded piece of cloth between the teeth so that it does not bite its tongue. Take the dog to the vet, who will administer injection of anti-seizure medication.



But the golden rule is not to feed anything and turn the dog to its sides so that saliva is drained out. Make sure its mouth is clean, take out any food or bone that may be inside the mouth, this can suffocate and kill the animal.

Don't put anything in their mouths! They can choke and/or stop breathing.



And Jordina, anyone that has a seizure passes out. They are unconscious to begin with.



Support their head, and DO NOT restrict their body movements.



If the seizure lasts longer than 10-15 minutes I would advise calling a vet. They can get brain damage.

When you have Strept throat, you usually will have clusters of white pus bumps in your throat. But not always. Id say give it a week and if it doesnt go away, then go to the doctor and he can tell you whats up and give you some anti-biotics to make it go away.

You may have it or a nasty virus. They don't give antibiotics for viruses, as it doesn't help. Strep is a bacteria though, so they can give antibiotics. It can also travel to your heart and cause problems if you don't address it, and is VERY contagious. The only way to tell too is a germ screening at the Dr. with a live culture because they can't just look at it and tell you it's strep. It is very painful though, white bumps, swollen tonsils, possible headache and nausea too. The saltwater advice is great and the throat numbing sprays along with pain medication. Good Luck!

Can anyone help me find a used rigid frame wheelchair?



Here is my dilemma, I am a very active disabled person who is well for lack of better words Fricking hard on chairs because I am so active. Now the chair that I have now is falling apart, and of course Medicare will not help me purchase another. Recently the back axcel on my chair has broken, and caused some injuries to my kidney, chest and wrist. Heres the kicker, instead of paying for a new or even fixing the old medicare straight up told me they would rather pay for the Doctor visits (which by the way add up to the cost of 2 new chairs) then help fix or replace the current chair. Being that my wheelchair is falling apart I am unable to work do to the fear of being hurt at work. So I am unable to afford any other insurance. Any advise would be great! Thank You. I do apologize for my horrible spelling I was only able to use one hand.

There is a method by using your birth height and doing a calculation using both parents height - I don't remember it but I'm sure its on plenty of parent/baby websites. Also, if you eat healthily you are guaranteed to be at least as tall as your father. Also, at adulthood your foot will be the same length as the distance between your wrist and elbow - so if you already have pretty big feet you will grow into them.

If the bar is too short, it's probably from the bit of swelling that a new piercing gets--you're piercer probably misjudged. This, too, won't help it heal-up. So yes, you should get this changed-out for a different piece, but NO you should not do it yourself.



It won't instantly close if you take it out but give it a short amount of time and it'll be very difficult (not to mention painful) to get another piece of jewelry in there.



Take it to a piercer, even another piercer, and have them give you a bigger barbell (or bananabell as the curved ones are called more often).



The problem with doing it yourself is definitely infection but even with the cleanest hands and if you cleaned the area first, AND cleaned the new jewelry, it might still get an infection because of the type of metal you'd be putting in it. Some metals "approved" as body jewelry are really only safe for piercings that are healed, as opposed to other types of metal jewelry that are more hypo-allergenic in general.

Definitely do not put in a new ring yet. Sorry to say but you must suffer for a bit longer! I changed mine almost a month after I got it done and it got wicked infected, which is probably ten times as painful as the ball sticking into your skin. I'd say to be safe wait 6 weeks. Good luck!

if you enjoy infections and squeezing out puss..watching the hydrogen peroxide bubbles...then go for it..otherwise show a little patience..just think, last year you were more than 365 days away from your perfect belly-button ring, now you are just a few days..unless you infect it and horribly disfigure your mid-section forever!

It's not a good idea to change it yourself, but if you go back to the place where you got it done they should put a new one in for you, if it's possible.

HELP! am i gonna die in my sleep tonight?



I am so GOOFY...at least once a week at work i am getting up from a squatting position and hitting my head hard on metal rods. now my husband is telling me i can die from this. Today, i accidentally hit my head after getting up from bending down to pick something up, i bumped above my forehead on a metal rod HARD. it hurt but i didnt black out. now it is still sore, a small bump, but no dizziness, no nausea, just sore. Can i really die from this, or is he overreacting. He said he had seen on TV that an old man hit his head in a car accident and walked out of it thinking he was fine but went home and died a few hours later from a blood clot that had pressed against his brain or something. please help me assure my husband that i am not gonna die...

Mumbai is a cosmopolitan mega city. One cannot stop peoples comming here. However, this city's resources are not increasing at the ration of its influx of population. In sixties it was south indians, now it is north indians mainly from U.P. and Bihar. The route cause of such an influx seems to be the backwardness of those states. So, the remedy is also on those lines. For the present situation, all concerned should sit together and discuss the whole issue and find an amicable solution. Show of  strength by each and every section through violent methods will only complicate the matter.

If your "hot" date is all that "hot" she will understand when you tell her you are sick and ask for a rain check. Take some Aspirin ( if you can take it without complications) and drink lots of fluids, hot drinks, like lemon tea or hot lemonade.  don't take a cold shower, unless you want to get really sick. the Aspirin should bring your temperature down within an hour. if you are old enough to drink, before you go to bed heat some whiskey up and sip it before going to sleep. you will sweat the cold out of you are sleep well and should feel better tomorrow.

Not at all!  In fact, you could increase to 10 a day if you wanted to.  You could become like the Cookie Monster, you know; but maybe Chocolate Chip.  Well, that wouldn't be quite as good, though.  Try to make your candies dark chocolate, but watch the fat content.  You could become 2 of those 23 people in the study from the link below.

Hey, i'm a high school senior. In all other 3 years of high school I was able to stay awake till the wee hours of the morning take a 3 hour nap then bounce back the next day, unaffected. But now, I can't bring myself to stay up past 9 and I start feeling tried around 6. What happened to me, why can't I pull all nighters anymore.

Your body can only do so much if you don't give it the materials it needs to do what you want it to do.  That's why somebody decided that high school is only 3 years.  Your all pumped up with hormones when you start high school and when you finish, your body has to rest because the opposite is happening; it is not testosterone so much, it is serotonin.  Also, what you are eating could have high levels of estrogen, such as chicken or other farm raised meat.  But, get some vitamins like B-Complex to help you.

Do you like to smell your farts?



Please don't laugh, but I have a weird obsession. When no one is around, I fart these horrendous farts and just sit there and sniff them. I'm very petite and a girly girl, so no one would ever guess I do this...but it's kind of like my secret fetish. Can you get brain damage from doing this? Does anyone else do this? I enjoy the smell of them SOOOOO much..esp. after I drink milk. Serious comments. Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



Honestly..I just had a box of prunes and I'm sitting here going at it. I like the smell of my stool when you eat prunes (TRULY) b/c it literally smells sweet! Not gross like a normal stool.



I knew I wasn't the only one that liked to waif in my gas!



The only thing that concerns me is that a few times I have had this happen to me. I will be farting those really smooth farts and then all of a sudden my underwear get warm. Then I run into the restroom and it looks like I have peanut butter in my panties! What did I eat wrong?! What did I do?! How can I stop this? I don't have enough money to keep buying new Victoria Secret's thongs. Plus sometimes it gets on the outside on my cheeks and I don't want it to ge ton my pants!



Let me know if this has ever happened to you and what you did. Thanks a lot!

As for the people who say you can not get brain damage Im not so sure I agree Your farts release methane which if any of you studied chemistry  methane is a potent green house gas. So It would take a lot of sniffing to cause any kind of brain damage it is possible.

Hey, i'm a high school senior. In all other 3 years of high school I was able to stay awake till the wee hours of the morning take a 3 hour nap then bounce back the next day, unaffected. But now, I can't bring myself to stay up past 9 and I start feeling tried around 6. What happened to me, why can't I pull all nighters anymore.

Your body can only do so much if you don't give it the materials it needs to do what you want it to do.  That's why somebody decided that high school is only 3 years.  Your all pumped up with hormones when you start high school and when you finish, your body has to rest because the opposite is happening; it is not testosterone so much, it is serotonin.  But, your body does not make the serotonin, you have to be putting that in somehow by what you are eating.  Also, what you are eating could have high levels of estrogen, such as chicken or other farm raised meat.  But, get some vitamins like B-Complex to help you.

Try a warm cup of chocolate milk to start with.  I'm trying to think of what you could have around the house that would help besides the chocolate that you might be using to bake.  The heat from the oven will help.  Make sure you drink a cup of water every so often and keep the bady hydrated, in other words, keep the system running.  Get that bug out.  If your using any kind of oil in your baking, you could drink some of that too, it wouldn't hurt.  If you have time to go to a store; a grocery store or health food store and if you can find it, get some senna or psyllium or both.  But, most of all get both of your systems moving and move the bug out.

You can't increase the amount of blood in your body unless you've donated/had blood removed, or are having blood intravenously added to your blood stream.. Regardless of which - your body will balance it back out to a few litres anyway.

Blood is produced by the bone marrow.  Now your question should be what increases the bone marrow?  Outside of bone marrow transplant, that apple suggestion sounded good.  But, no that just decreases the level of bad things in your blood and I do not think you can increase the level of blood that you produce.

2-3 weeks depending on your body's metabolism.  It is possible to be clear of it with 72 hours with a proper flush (dangerous if done without professional).



That being said, Zoloft is one of those drugs you want to be weaned off slowly.  To rapidly stop taking it can cause many unpleasant effects which can include deep depression, suicide, seizures, heart problems, and death.  If you want to get off it, do so with the help of a professional.  They should know your history and medical condition and be able to help you do it in the shortest amount of time.

You should never just stop taking any medicine cold turkey.  Your body is used to having it every day you should wean yourself off slowly and under a doctors care.  There are certain antidepressant's that if you stop cold turkey you are at risk for a seizure or just feeling nauseous or getting headaches. I am not saying that zoloft is necessarily one of them or that this will happen but don't take the chance.



As you wean down less will stay in your system and when you finally do get off of it completely it will be out of your system within a couple of weeks.

There's a stone in his NECK!?



My friend's father (I think he's in his early 50's) was in a bad rear end accident about 5 wks ago and it tore muscles in his back and that's all. He had some surgery for this and all was getting better. Last week he noticed a large (golf ball sized) lump under his chin on this throat. He immediately went to the DR. Today they told him it is NOT cancer...(Idk if this is related to the car accident or not, probably not but I thought I'd mention it) THEY TOLD HIM THERE IS A STONE IN HIS NECK! A STONE!?!?!?! Idk how the stone got in there, no one does! He hasn't had a surgery in that area. It's in his neck, under his tongue. They are doing surgery first thing tomorrow and are taking out a gland...they said they couldn't get to the stone b/c of how delicate the area is but they're going to help the bump, etc. Has anyone EVER heard of anything like this? Serious answers only!!!!

The stones are in his salivary glands, they develop over time. My girlfriend had them and because they block saliva they can be painfull and they can cause infections. You can develop stones in your body and they need to be removed because they cause obstructions.

It is bad that marijuana is so readily available and they end up testing your for it.  Your job is just your livelihood, that's all.  It's not like you're going to die tomorrow by smoking pot.  You take those other drugs to keep you alive.  I mean, what is their problem?  I wonder how many of the CEOs take Paxil or Benicar?  That should be the key to keeping your job right there!



Seriously, go to an herb shop and get some Vitamin B-complex and if they have it, get some Golden Seal Powder and drinking water just cleans out the pipes but it will dilute the system and they also look for that.  That'll also cause you to fail.  But, good luck!

Pop goes the knee joint! (insted of the weasel)?



When i do squats my knees crack. Im only 11 years old, its not arthiritis. Some people assure me its just air getting forced out of the joints...when i do a few squats (maybe 3) it cracks then there are no cracks anymore.....



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Its probably nothing to worry about. My joints tend to crack often, and since a young age too. Have you broken any bones? Is the weather cold? These can contribute too.



Do some exercise, keep up your calcium and you won't have to worry about arthritis for 40 years to come.



Ask your parents for some more support?
Good luck.

You can have a variety of thing. Some of which include a collapsed lung, Athsma or Food Allergies! These are very severe. Itcould be Atsma if your under stress (like you said you are) if you are running or working out alot, or if you are depressed. You'll know if you have food allergies if you have eaten something such as peanuts nuts, milk, egs, or fruit in the past 10 hours. I advise you to ask someone if you have a family history.
Lastly, You need to visit your doctor.



Good luck and feel better!

Yeah this one time I when I was sleeping during night I felt like a bug or spider was crawling in my ear. I didn't bother checking it because I was tired and thought it was nothing. I just wanted to sleep.



The next day I woke and during school when I was in the bathroom by left or was it my right ear felt like it had a lot of wax in it. When I came home from school that day I cleaned my ear and realized it wasn't wax it was the remains of a dead spider. Lol I knew something crawled in my ear that night.

Stop picking your ear with your finger and don't use Q-tips like crazy... Try a little bit of rubbing alcohol to kill off any fungus you have allowed to grow since you've damaged the natural follicles and have kept the inside of the warm dark ear nice and dank...



You might want to see a doctor to scrape out the problem you caused...
