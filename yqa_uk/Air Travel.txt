You cannot view flights more than 330 days in advance for any airline put there.  It's a pain, I know, I'm going to Floriday next August and I can't see the price of the flights yet.

Hope this helps! and make sure to check back when it's 330 days in advance or less!

Unfortunately all the advice to stop smoking will just fall on deaf ears. You are determined to smoke despite the health warnings. You are addicted to the habit and until you show you want to stop, you will not.

The answer to your question is that they cannot take the cigs away if you carry up to the legal limit, which is 200. But how you obtain them in the first place is another question. Any adult buying them for you is not doing you any favours, and you and the seller can be arrested if you attempt to buy them yourself.

I suggest that you quit smoking. You will not be allowed to smoke in the airport terminals, or on the aircraft.



I quit cold turkey after 40+ years on a trip to Salt Lake City 8 years ago and have not smoked since. Smoking is unhealthy and very expensive.



Good luck.

there is a substantial bus network and the main airport is really close

but if you are arriving at the treviso airport its a little further out, but you can still get a bus.

once you get to venice there are water busses that go round in circles, you can buy a daily or weekly ticket and they are really cheap, i would definately buy a weekly as you can go everywhere on them,  hop on, hop off.

taxis are a bit on the expensive side as are the water taxis when you get there. ask at the airport and they will tell you which bus to get on.

are you staying on the islands or on the mainland? if you are on the mainland, you can get a bus all the way to Venice Island by bus which costs 1€, you can then travel by water bus to visit the other islands.

Mention it to the flight assistants, and they will take good care of you. There's at least one on here, so hopefully they can re-assure you.

It's very common, so they are used to helping out nervous fliers.

Just think that it's very safe, and 1000s of safe flights happen every day.

Planes only rarely crash on take off. They tend to plummet from the skies at about 35000 ft usually takes about two minutes. Landing can also be a problem... Please also note that contrary to what the stewardess's tell you a plane cannot land on the sea, rather they tend to turn into a million bit's of scrap metal... Hope this has been of help.

dont worry! the flight will be fine!
the take off is like a little hill on a rollercoaster
i think if you look out the window during the takeoff, rather than not, it will be better for you, because you see whats happening.  If you dont look out the window i think it would be more frightening & it would probably make you nautious.  In the air you might have some turbulance, but thats nothinng.  Your just going through a cloud! :)
Bring  a book with you to keep you occupied.  Also, if your plane has tv's thats even better.
Just try to stay as calm as you can, and before you know it, you'll be landing!

Do not be afraid of flying, it is extremely safe, it is crashing you really need to be worried about.
Make sure you sit at the very back of the plane for safety, I mean you've never heard of a plane backing into a mountain.

get some bachs rescue remedy, it is a plant based natural product and can calm and soothe you, you take some before boarding and some as you are taxiing down the runway - my husband used to get valium from the doc but says this works better, it is natural so you can have a drink on the plane if you wish and won't interfere if you are on other medication. Ask at your pharmacy for it, it is also in a really small bottle so you can carry it in your handluggage.. They use it on the X factor and other reality shows when they have live performaces by 'ordinary' people to help them conquer stage and camera fright. good luck

I suffer from those same problems and flew for the very first time in June.  The take off felt exactly like a really fast roller coaster.  I felt kind of light headed during the flight and even a bit dizzy but I was with my boyfriend so it wasn't an awful experience.  I would suggest that you travel with someone you're comfortable with until it gets easier, and DON'T focus on the anxiety!  Bring something to keep you occupied such as an i-pod, book/magazine, or try to close your eyes and just relax.

I hate flying too, so i know how you feel, but after going on 12 flights this year, i got over it slightly. You will be fine without the drugs, and more often than not, it's the night before or 2 hours at the airport that people are scared of, not the actual plane journey. I still refuse to go on a plane journey that is over 6 hours, so I know how you feel. I never eat before i go on a plane, and I'm fine once i'm on it. I'm sure you will be the same. I hope you can conquer your fear though, because there is so many nice places in the world, that you can't get to by boat!

Here are some tips i picked up off Flight Assitants and my mum who's a nervous flyer.

1. Sit next to the window, so you always know whats going on
2. Remember, about 50 % of the flight will be nervous flyers.
3. Sit near the front, or not on the wing, because you will hear the engine's more, and this can be REALLY annoying!
4. If you are terrified of the thought of being in the air and coming down, 1000's of planes take off and land safelty everyday.
5. Turbulance CANNOT bring the plane down. Have you ever heard of wind that pushes you down?

You *can* take liquid makeup if it's in a container that's 3 fluid ounces or smaller...most liquid makeup items are that size or smaller (i.e. foundation, mascara) and can go in the quart-sized plastic baggie for your liquids ( http://www.tsa.dhs.gov/311/index.shtm ). All other non-liquid makeup items are allowed.

Yes, and you can also take liquids.  Liquids in your carry-on need to be 3 oz or less and placed in one 1 qt. size zip lock bag.  Larger liquids need to be in checked luggage.  Dry makeup can be in either.  See site below for all regs.

Okay I'm gonna assume you're flying from Belfast to Montreal.. Flying to Quebec City would be similar anyway.

Okay to go from Belfast to Montreal there are a few options. The cheapest option of all is to go with Continental Airlines, but there's a downfall to this. You'd pay about $1070CAD (roughly £540) for the roundtrip ticket, but you would have to make a connection in Newark, New Jersey (USA) and I strongly advise against this. Not only is it a hassle to go through immigration in 2 different countries in one day, Newark is pretty much universally known over here as THE airport to avoid in North America. Like half of all luggage that goes to that airport gets lots, avoid it at all costs. On the other hand both British Airways and Air Canada fly to Montreal with a stop in London. You'd pay about $1200CAD (£610) .. its better if you pay the little bit more to make  your travel less stressful. I also highly recomment British and Air Canada over Continental.

Have an awesome trip, you're gonna love it over here in Canada!!

UK cheap airlines are they modern day dick turpins?



They reel you in with £0.01p fights. Then shaft you for checked baggage, over weight baggage, priority seating (lol), tax, poor food on the aircraft which is over priced. Lottery tickets! what next bingo?

In the event of cabin pressure loss a mask will drop from the panel above. Fit the mask over your face and insert £10 into the slot......

Is'nt it about time British Airways got its act together and sorted out the not so cheap competition?

I bet it's folk like you we see on the Airline telly program complaining when they've turned up an hour late to the wrong airport with half a ton of luggage!

Where are you from, the 0.01p flights were made illegal to advertise about 3 months ago. Easyjet don't charge for one bag, tax has nothing to do with the budget airlines (blame the government), the food onthe flights is over priced yes but so is everthing at the airport.

Sorry to ask but what is your point?

so true! you get ripped off left right and centre!!

i went thomson fly a few weeks ago, and okay its not quite the cheepest of the cheep such as easy jet ect, but it isnt exactly BA. It was alright, i was supprised to see they had moved the magazine rack from the bottom of the seat infont to behind your food tray in order to gain and extra inch or so of legrooom (lol!! skanks!) now i'm nearly 6 foot and i have to say, in an emergancy there is no way i could possiably get in the brace position!!

my friend went thomos cook and paid for a seat next to her mum, well she got a seat next to her, if you count an aisle in between........ lmao

on my flight the food was good though and the service was pretty good, the plane did have burn marks and oil all over the outside of it.......... :-|

i almost didnt get on lol

Can i make a claim against the airline?



In late June I was due to leave from a UK airport with Monarch to fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport my flight had been delayed by an hour. As the new time approched it was again delayed by an hour, then again by another hour, then by 40 mins. By the time the flight was called it was close to if not exceeding a 4 hour delay.

The flight was ment to be straight through but problems obtaining a replacement plane for our original one that had become 'unavailable' resulted in them having to use a smaller plane and so a stop off in Cannad to refuel was required. They claimed this would take approximatly 45 mins.

After landing in Cannada we were kept on the plane while they refueled which took close to 2 hours before being flown on to Florida.

Under the various EU acts can i make a claim against the airline in these circumstances?

Id actually make a claim on your travel insurance, they do this by tracking down every hour you were delayed on your flight, however to do this you will need to get a letter from your flight company detailing the delay details.

I very much doubt the airline will give any compensation - this is not normally given for delays.

As the previous respondent says, this is normally covered by your travel insurance.  However, most travel insurance policies do not pay out unless the delay is more than 12 hours and that is just the delay for the original take-off, not for further delays on the way.  Check your insurance policy wording, but i don't think you have a case here unfortunately.

Maybe. If you complain directly to the airline, no. BUT, you might be able to take them to small claims court and sue them for the value of the baggage. but you will never see the bag again. :(

Hi there I work for BA in check in, if the delay was down to the airline which it was then any delay from 0-3hrs 59Min's all the airline has to provide you with is a meal voucher to get food and drink, after 4 hours the airline should offer you a refund of your ticket if you no longer wish to travel or part refund if you have already used part of your ticket, or re-booking to the same destination or alternative destination, if overnight stay is required then the airline is responsible to provide you with accommodation. However the airlines obligation is to get you from A to B not necessarily on the same flight and they can do an aircraft change at any given time wither it be a larger aircraft or smaller one. In this case the airline has got you to your final destination and you have agreed to take the flight that they have provided for you. You could go through your travel insurance but you probably wont really get anything from them nor will you get anything by claiming from the EU regulations. Ask the airline for a notification of rights letter they are obliged to give you one upon request and read it thoroughly as there is allot of things in there that people by pass.
hope this helps

Other than BMI the only other no non-stop scheduled commercial service between Las Vegas and the UK is Virgin Atlantic out of Gatwick (LGW).  Delta has seasonal flights, #65 from Manchester to Las Vegas and #64 on the return and flight #37 LGW to LAS and #36 return, which will look like a non-stop flight in the booking engines because it has the same flight number all the way but actually makes a stop with an equipment change in Atlanta.

**Of course a BMI employee is not going to tell you about Virgin Atlantic!**

Let's see....... im not sure wat DL is, but in the 2nd column, thats the flight number so 65t 977T thats all the tail number on the airplane. obviously the next column is the date. MO is the state i believe. the next i believe coulddd be the flight city from and to. ATL is Atlanta i believe? No idea wat Mk1 is, but the time for each flight is in the next column. 1110 is 11:10 am, 1735 is 5 35 pm, 1800 is 6 pm, 2050 is 8 50. that should be depature and the next is arrival. thats about all i can decipher!

wait i think i got it, DL might be Delta airlines. not sure

ok No's 1-4 are the flights in order.
DL would be the Airline you are flighing with.
Digits after this would be the flight numbers, then the date your are flighing.  MO means the day youare flying - So Monday.
Column 6 is the abbreviated airports your flighing to:

Outbound Flights
1: MAN (Manchester, UK ) to ATL (Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta  International)
2: ATL - MCO (Orlando International)

Inbound Flights are reverse of outbound flights.  Not sure what MK1 means and then you have flight times shown in 24 hour clock and i'm sure that the letters at the end have something to do with dates or days or something like that.

Hope that helps

This is a four segment itinerary. The segments are as follows:

Delta 65 from Manchester (UK) to Atlanta on October 20. It departs at 11:10am and arrives at 3:20pm.



Delta 977 from Atlanta to Orlando on October 20. It departs at 5:35pm and arrives at 7:08pm.



Delta 976 from Orlando to Atlanta on November 3. It departs at 6:00pm and arrives at 7:37pm.

Delta 64 from Atlanta to Manchester on November 3. It departs at 8:50pm and arrives at 9:55am the following day.



The letter "T" after the flight number is economy class and refers to the type of fare. T is a restricted discount fare. This is not actually part of the flight number and will not appear on airport monitors.

MK1 means that the reservation is for one seat.

Your question is somewhat confusing.

The title makes the statement that you always make sure that there is cover when you go on holiday, BUT in the text you appear to be saying that your employer is implementing this because it IS NOT in place.

Please explain your enquiry so that we can understand what you want to know.

There is no reason why your employer can not bring in this sensible policy.  It is a very common policy in the UK.  Remember you are all paid to provide some service / tasks....your customers (whether internal or external) won't be impressed with "sorry, you can't get x 'cos the whole team is on holiday"

Any already approved holidays would have to be honoured without threat of losing jobs, but any new holidays can be expected to follow the new policy.

You can do it, but I do not recommend it.

First, the website does not really sell tickets out of the UK in dollars. All fares originating in the UK are in pounds. The website simply converts the pounds into dollars because it is an American website. In reality, lots of websites do this conversion.

Second, it will be a nightmare if you need help from customer service. Unless they offer a toll-free number from the UK, which is doubtful, you will have to call transatlantic to get help. This could get very expensive, especially if they put you on hold. You may be able to get help through e-mail, but e-mail does not always help with complex problems.

Some US websites also will not accept foreign credit cards.

I formerly worked for a major US travel website. We periodically had bookings from customers in England and it was a big hassle for them to call the US. We always suggested that they use our British website for their next trip. I suggest that you also use a British website. There are no advantages for you to use an American website and there are a lot of potential disadvantages.

Im 15, going on an airplane by myself.?



Okay, so I've done this before but only 2, thirty minute flights. And i flew from small airports to bigger ones, so i did not worry about not being able to find my flight. But this situation is different, i have to fly from a larger airport to a smaller one. And i have to find my gate and everything, not to mention the three hour flight. I really don't know why i am so nervous because i know the airport well, i have been there on several occasions and is not complicated. Any Advice?

if you need help  just ask someone. people there are usually nice enough to help you. finding a gate is rather easy. there are arrows that tell you which section is which way. if you are/ aren't religious. just pray/hope that  you get to your destination safely with no hurt, harm, or danger. As for the ride there. what i did was take my mp3 player, a book, a puzzle, and a pillow, and my safety bear. he makes me safe. and I have ADD and i do one thing too long, so i switch it out. or just go to sleep. and if you feel turbulence, it's ok. it's just wind. don't let anyone scare you.

Airline upgrade - how??



My two friends are quite often offered an upgrade from economy on long haul flights, and they have even been upgraded to first class a couple of times.  They say they don't know why they are chosen and why they have been so lucky.  I am travelling on my own to the US next February - on Economy.  Does anyone have any tips on the best way to "sway" the airline to upgrade me?  Should I just ask, or is that being too pushy?  Please help!!

Airlines use upgrades primarily for their best, most profitable customers - usually high mileage frequent fliers, VIPs from major corporate accounts, and people who pay full, non-discounted fares. The airlines want these travelers' loyalty because that's where they make money.

Upgrades are valuable, so they don't just give them away for no reason to people who fly once a year on a nonrefundable ticket. They're losing money on these passengers anyway.



If you're a high mileage frequent flier, or you're flying on an expensive ticket, check the airline's website to see if they confirm upgrades in advance. Also, ask at the check-in counter or gate. If you rarely fly and you're on a nonrefundable ticket, then don't waste your time.

Hi there I work for BA in check in the best way is don't ask, you have to imagine our job on a day to day basis and generally its the first thing that comes out of peoples mouths before they even acknowledge you existence on a desk, also the amount of times a day we get asked. I could retire a rich person if i charged for every time I get asked the question. However if the airline needs to do upgrades to fill the aircraft we generally look at our most valued customers and top frequent flyer's. then if the check in agent thinks you are a perfect candidate then you may be lucky in getting one. Whatever you do don't be pushy and keep on at the agent, don't use the i suffer from any illnesses, bad backs bad legs I'm pregnant we have heard all the usual excuses and stories we know all the text book ones. Just be yourself be well dressed, you don't have to be suited and booted just smart enough to be recognised that you may be a perfect candidate for upgrade and you never know it could be you sitting in the nice seat.
Best of luck and hope you get it

Booking flight tickets - sooner or later? ?



I'm planning on travelling in November & need to book my plane tickets for a specific date. Thing is, I'm not sure whether I should leave actually booking it until last minute (incase the price goes down...& I've saved up a bit more money) or book it now (incase the seats get taken). I'm taking a connecting flight - the first flight has many seats left but the second only has 6 seats left. Should I chance it & wait a little while before I book or book sooner rather than later? If I book later I would be booking around early-mid October.



Thanks.

Your better off to book now.. a lot of airlines are taking planes out of their inventory.. so that means fewer seats in general.  almost all of the flights that are going on now are full or over booked due to the fewer plans flying.. the cost of fuel is making the cost go up as well. so I can pretty much say that the seats won't go down in price.. just UP! and those 6 seats left on the connection will be gone soon.. so if you don't want to get stuck in an airport in between cities..I would suggest booking now.. also.. how are you booking your seats... direct thru the airlines website.. or are you using something like expeida, orbitz or one of the many other sites????  Also depends on where your flying from and to... if you want you can email me and I will help you get the best rate for your flight..

I would book it now rather than later because you require the specific date.  You'll only get a cheap flight if your flexible with the dates and you also run the risk of a flight not being available.

my opinion would be to book it early, because if you dont get the seat you dont get the holliday on the date you wanted it on,Also you only get a lower price if you go last minute, and that is only on some holidays.
I hope this helps.

Since you need specific dates and times i'd book now. In theory you might get last minute deals, but i think that only works if you can be flexible.

It's better to book a flight sooner rather than later, because the closer it is to flight time, the higher the price. Trust me, I've been on TONS of flights.

Be sure you contact the airline to see if any preventative cancellations have occurred.  Normally they will contact you but in the event of a large storm and many possible cancellations it might take some time for them to reach you.  Most airlines have already issued statements about allowing changes to your scheduled flights free of charge.  If your schedule allows you might want to consider flying on another day. In any event, call the airline before you leave for the airport to confirm your flight is on-time.  Oh, and bring a good book with you.  It might be a long day.  Good luck.

Mineral Water. ChapStick (I use burts bee's). Lotion, face & hands/body.  REPEAT, throughout the flight.

My bf, put on a moisturing mask before the flight takes off and leaves it on.  She always glows after a flight.

Don't wear eye makeup on an airplane, you won't look fresh.



Rest, wear sunglass or a sleep eye mask.



Scarf, pull hair back, kept neatly in a bun, take down before you land for a cute curl.



Stay away from coffee, soda.

EXERCISE....during your flight...
1. Roll your shoulders forward and back.



2. Roll your neck from side to side.
3. Point & Flex your feet, as if you are driving, gas then brake
4. Knee to Chest Lifts, seated, bring knee up then back down, 20 times each leg
5. Spine stretch, make a 'C' with your upper body and then straighten back up.  Sort of like a cat would do.

Good Luck!

I really really need help :/



So I'm going to hawaii in two days with my friend, her dad, her brother and sister. But the problem is I don't have a picture ID, my mom's known I needed one but she kept telling me I only need a school ID, she told me she looked it up. Then I find out (today) that it said "picture ID". So I need to get a state ID, but you don't get those in the same day. I'm 15, do I need an ID to get on a plane if I'm with an adult(not my parent though).
And can you bring more than one carry on bag?

Have no fear.  You do not need a government-issued photo ID if you are under the age of 18.

http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/a...

As for the carry-on limitations, you generally are only allowed one carry-on bag, such as a small roll-on suitcase or a backpack, as well as a personal item, such as a purse.  Often times the airline gate agents will not care enough to make an issue out of it if you have more than the limit.  But to be on the safe side, I would recommend sticking to the limit.

Hope this helps!  As a resident of Hawaii, I can tell you that you will love it out here!

I saw a cat on a plane, they had to crate it and put it in the back though. So maybe. I'm pretty sure you have to tell the airline. I would call the airline before you buy the bunny to make sure.

Take the Piccadilly line (tube) to London and take either the DLR (Docklands Light railway) or a Bus. Do not take a taxi, unless its a minicab, as Black Taxis Charge A Fortune.
Go to www.yell.com and search for Minicabs in Heathrow, and book a Cab to take you to London City Airport, will cost around £60 ($120) - The Tube will cost a mere £7.20 for a daily pass.

Enjoy your time here....

Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to Green Park
Change to the Jubilee Line and go to Canning Town.
At Canning Town there is a connecting bus to London City Airport.

This will take about two hours and the cost depends on the time of day because it affects the types of ticket available. You're looking around the £6-7 area.

Alternatively, you can get the Heathrow Express to Paddington; change to the Circle Line and go to Tower Hill; walk to Tower Gateway (about 5 minutes) and get the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) to Canning Town (for the bus). This will be about 30 min faster but the Heathrow Express is £15 and then you have to buy your tube ticket.

Don't use a black cab. These will charge you a fortune. Don't use any other taxi from the airport either because it is illegal for them to ply for hire there and many so-called mini-cabs are unroadworthy and use illegal drivers.

You can also go by bus, which would be the cheapest option. But that would be the most complex route and take you about four hours if you were lucky.

from LAX is about 13/14hrs
Just depends which airline you will use.
The least amount of time is with Swiss International Airlines. Fly non-stop from LAX to Zurich and change plane there. (Leave LAX at 7:15PM and arrive in GVA at 5:40PM the next day (local time)
The next is with Continental from LAX to EWR (non-stop) and change plane and go non-stop to GVA (leave LAX at  8:30AM and arrive the following day at 7:45AM (local time)
They are 9hrs ahead from California.

There are three, Thai Airways, Eva Air, and Emerates, all going from Heathrow. Prices vary from time to time but usualy the cheapest and best is Emerates, but it does stop in Dubai which I prefer because it breaks up the journey, ie two six hour flights instead of one long haul of 11.5 hours. Emerates have the best on board entertainment, more films and more music, and they also have the most leg room, two inches more than British Airways. Eva air is very good for a straight through flight and is usualy cheaper than Thai. The cheapest time of the year to go is August. Log on to ebookers.com or better still log onto westeast travel. They have special deals at the moment for Eva Air costing only three hundred and nine pounds. When you are on the site make sure you phone their number for the best deal because you will get cheaper than what it shows on line.

Is it true that I can claim back fuel surcharges from British Airways? If so how do I claim the monies back?



I have been travelling with British Airways on long haul flights for approximately four years.



I have kept my boarding passes.
I still have flight numbers from previous flights.
Is there a website for customers to claim?

BA and Virgin Atlantic were found guilty of conspiring to fix fuel surcharges and are required to give refunds to passengers who flew between August, 20004 and March, 2006, this website explains how to get your refund or try contacting BA, good luck:

Sounds kind of strange to me, are you sure it is not an urban legend or something like that?
The airline I work for had to implement a fuel surcharge last year and they had to contact every single customer, who had purchased a transatlantic ticket to ask them for the additional money...

Last minute the best thing to do is turn up to the airport and see if you can get on standby. you mightn't get on the day you want but if you've got a few days to spare it is the cheapest last minute option.

I personally like to get to the airport with plenty of time in case of anything that could possibly go wrong. Security takes a long time, and baggage, and you have to factor in all of that type of stuff. Depending on how far away your house is to the airport, I always arrive no later than 2 hours before my plan leaves. I normally leave out of Newark or Philadelphia which are about an hour from where I live. If I had a 6:50am flight, I would leave my house no later than 3:30-3:45. you really don't want to miss your plan in case something goes wrong, I always say it's a lot better to be way too early, to be 1 second late.

Hope this helps & good luck! (:

I'd try to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure, add perhaps another 30 minutes for check-in and the security check (which shouldn't be so bad that early in the morning, although a Friday is more crowded... perhaps figure in a bit more time), so you should be at the airport at least an hour before the flight departs. Now you just need to know how long your commute to the airport will take. Remember that you may have to park your car somewhere and get from the parking lot to the airport.

It depends if you are doing domestic or international flight.  For domestic flights, most say that you want to check-in 1 hour before departure, so that means you need to be at the airport check in desk no later that 6 a.m. You didn't say how long it will take you to get to the airport from your departure place.  If you know it will take you 1 hour to drive to the airport, figure you must leave your departure place by 5 a.m. so allow how every long it takes you to get ready in the morning and that will tell you what time you need to get up and get out the door, I would allow at least 15 minutes to get out the door.  So figure you must leave no later that 5 a.m. but say instead I must leave at 4:45 a.m.  Hope this helps.

if you fly a lot i would say only give yourself about an hour. so saying that you live about 2 seconds away from the airport, you should leave at 5:50am. but it takes a while to check in, and go through security, and get to the gate. but with it being so early not too many people should be there. and you might want breakfast or you might want to shop around, either way, i'd leave and give yourself enough time to have an hour in the airport.

Brook, it depends on what airport you are leaving from and how long it takes to get there from your house. Many airports, both large and small, are extremely busy for the first flights out in the day. So, plan on arriving at the airport AT LEAST 1 hour prior to departure of your flight, which would be 5:50AM and allow an extra 15 minutes to drive to the airport over your normal driving time. Keep in mind that if you miss your flight, it will probably cost you at least $100, so get there early and relax at the boarding area.

Regards,
Dan

Taking my family abroad from Edinburgh Airport in October. Anyone any suggestions for destinations?



I'm open to suggestions. The places we can go to from Edinburgh are limited, i.e. Marseille via Easyjet for example, and as I don't know any of the places on the Easyjet website,  I hoped someone could help me out. 
Family are two grown ups a 15 y.o 10 yo and 8 yo.
We enjoy foodie stuff, the beach, cooking and wandering around beautiful scenery. Don't really go for crowds. 
Would probably go self catering, and prefer a certain amount of seclusion so we can de-stress and "go into the world when we feel like it." Our usual holiday is somewhere remote with fishing in Scotland, so this will be a change for us.
Leaving October 4th from Edinburgh. Need to be back by October 19th at the latest. 
Hope someone can help me out.

Easyjet don’t fly from Edinburgh to Marseille.

You would be much better flying from Glasgow. Edinburgh has 30 international destinations, Glasgow has 162 worldwide destinations.

I think you need to be at least 5'7'' and really smart.  Good with people and hard working.  And of course willing to travel all over the world, and be away from home for days at a time.
Try looking on websites for airlines that fly from your local airport and they will tell you.
I think you also have to do a college course.

Few points of the top of my head;

Lets assume you are of good health, about 160-170cm high (for reaching up for those overhead lockers)

* Communication skills A MUST HAVE
* Patience in dealing with some of the most weird requests of passengers
* Another language (or two) would help
* First-aid certificate / qualification (eg., what do you do at 30,000 ft if some 60yr old is choking on one of those fabulous peanuts they give you)
* Well read on geography, travel, social custom, legal customs in your destination countries (if you are thinking international)

You may want to start of smaller regional airlines or budget carriers, or even as ground support crew (doubtful you will start out serving fine wines in business class on a transatlantic flight)

Also, if you have it, check out those documentaries like "Airport" on TV, they will also give you a good reality check (eg., dealing with people who are late, drunk, stupid, forgot their passports)

Good luck!

The best way to answer this is to try several travel search engines. I'd open several windows, so you don't lose any - prices can change by the minute! Try companies like Expedia.co.uk and Lastminute.com as well as individual airlines like Virgin and Continental. A search for "cheap air fares" should throw up more of these search engines. Make sure that you book with one that is ABTA registered.

What's allowed to be brought on the plane?



I'm flying with my 9 yo grandson on Tuesday.  SeaTac to Salt Lake City, Utah then 2 hour layover then SLC to SLO, Cali.  I'm mostly worried about the layover.  Any suggestions on what to bring.  Oh, he's a calm, quiet child at least! :-)  Will I need his birth certificate?  If so, would a photocopy be okay or do I have to have a copy from City Records?  What about a permission slip from his legal guardian?  He's living with his mom now, but his Great-Grandma on his mom's side actually is his legal guardian, so would it be okay just from his mom?  Or do I have to have a permission signed by both?  Since he's only 9, he doesn't have any legal id, that's why I'm asking about his birth certificate.  I'm hoping that will be considered legal id.



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks!  Glad to know I don't need a permission slip or legal id for him, that's a big help.  Also thanks to the person who talked about the bag for food/drinks.  One more question, he's a big water drinker, do they sell bottled water on the planes?  It's Delta Airlines if that matters.

Children do not need I.D. to fly within the U.S. and you do not need a letter of permission for  your grandson to travel with you.  Those are needed only for international travel.  See site below to see that only people 18 and over must show I.D.

Call the airline and see what you need to be sure you have what you need!

You can't take any liquids or gels over 3 ounces, There are limits and exceptions (like baby food and formula). I go flying without any of that kind of stuff though to avoid the hassle. Books and electronic devices are fine. The liquids need to be placed in a clear plastic bag. I believe you are allowed one 1 litre bag.

You don't need his Birth Certificate, or a permission slip. That'll be fine. They might ask if you look too old to be his mom. So you might want to bring the stuff. He could bring an ipod, Nintendo DS, a coloring book, anything quiet really. You might want to have about $5 on hand, because some airlines are now charging for snacks.

Yes, airlines do get it wrong sometimes but dates and times of flights booked online are not one of them, most people are in such a hurry that they don't check, they just hit confirm.
In the old days, bookings were made and read back to customers, don't think there were so many date errors then.

Are there rules about what foodstuffs you can take on a plane?



I'm off to Canada in a month, for a month, and was wondering if i'd be allowed to bring Marmite, Cadburys chocolate & Pop rocks on the plane? (a request from someone over in Canada)

Or will the Marmite be restricted (the 100ml or whatever you're allowed on board)

Wasn't sure if the liquid restrictions were just on hand luggage.

Also what about cosmetics?



</question>

Ok, thanks =)
Yeah, it'll all be going in my main luggage, not hand luggage, so should be fine then?

I went to Oz last yr and took food stuff over as requested pot noodles they were going in the hold but i had to fill a form in to say i had them but they were passed through ok think it was because it was dried food i did send some over from the uk but they were missing when they got to oz with a note saying not allowed!! Think they ate them!! i also took loads of haribo sweets they were also fine,
liquid restrictions are just for hand luggage so the 100ml will be ok if going in the hold chocolates a bit dodgy it will melt, but i know why they want it if the chocolate in canada is like it is in Australia i don't blame them for wanting it. Just make sure your cosmetics are all in clear bags my mum had all hers taken off her even tho they were only 50ml

We do that because the first night of vacation after travel/airports we just like to relax w/a bottle of wine (we buy there or @) airport) on balcony while unpacking. Hotel /resort stores too pricey or they don't hv & I refuse to go grocery store while on vacation!!!  Marmite shld be ok but not sure

Baggage transfers with different airlines



Im flying from Durham Tees Valley airport with BMI Baby to London Heathrow, and then im getting on a Qantas flight to Melbourne. I booked the flights at different times using different websites so ive got two e-tickets, one for the internal flight one for the international flight.

My question is, when i book in at Durham Tees Valley for my BMI Flight, can i get them to check my bags onto the Qantas flight to Melbourne as well? 
So can i just check my bags in at Durham and then not have to collect them and re-check them in at Heathrow for the Melbourne flight and have them transfered automatically for me?

Normally, when you purchase separate tickets, you need to collect your luggage and check in again.



If you buy tickets for the entire trip, the airlines will check your baggage all the way through to your final destination.

You can ask the airline when you check in, if they can check it all the way through.  You can also call in advance to see if they would be willing to do it.

Be prepared to collect your luggage, though and check it in again, if they say no.

Firstly, your bmi baby flight is operated by parent airline bmi. This means, unless you have blue plus, silver or gold diamond club status you get no food on board. On an economy saver ticket you can't choose your seats.

This is a one-class service.

BUT on bmi you get 32" legroom, MUCH MORE than bmibaby.

Regrettably, from bmi to Qantas no baggage transit is available. Try to choose British Airways to Qantas or Oneworld partners or bmi to Star Alliance partners e.g. Air New Zealand.

So sadly not. You need to get your bags from baggage reclaim at T1 then go to T4  Heathrow Connect for free then check into Qantas.

Note that a very friendly check-in agent may waive the rules. But most probably not.

If you are a nervous flyer it really does not matter how long you are in the air. It is not BEING in the air that freaks you. You are freaking at just  going into an airport and onto an aeroplane. You then wind yourself up as the plane takes off because you are not in control. This apprehension is totally natural but very unfortunate as it is spoiling your life.



What EXACTLY are you afraid of? Try to analyse your fears because they ARE irrational and you really don't want them in your life.

Are you feared of buses and trains and tubes/metros? Cars? Taxis?



The flying time from Manchester direct to Azores is about four hours and The Azores is to die for but sorry you will NOT die on the plane! Go on! Go for it! Enjoy and thank the Lord for such a kindly Dad.

Bus passes are not accepted as ID. Check with your airline.

Ryanair: All passengers must present valid photo identification at check-in for all flights. The only acceptable forms of photo-ID on Ryanair flights are:



A valid driving licence with photo is acceptable photo ID for travel on domestic flights within the UK and domestic flights within the Republic of Ireland.

Easyjet:Passengers are required to provide photographic ID at check-in on all flights including domestic services.
If you are unsure what constitutes a valid ID we recommend you contact our customer service department on 0871 244 2366 (calls cost 10p per minute; calls from mobiles and other networks may cost more) for further information.

You know it takes quite a while to obtain a passport so you should plan accordingly.  She will need official material in order to get a passport such as naturalization papers.

If you are travelling from the UK to the Uk you never used to need a passport, just i.d. I believe that is still the case but another question similar to this one recently put me in doubt.
Just phone the air line or travel company you booked through.

You dont have to have a passport for Scotland unless travelling from outside the UK , if they just want to see who she is yes, a bus pass photo would do ,I havent travelled on Planes since security was tightened ,so I dident know they wanted ID

if you are on an internal flight within the UK I would of thought her Bus Pass would do all the Airline needs is photo I D to prove she is who she says she is but if you are flying from outside the UK i.e. international then of course she will need a passport this business about needing a passport as I D for internal flights I never use my passport when flying internal it is either my works I D or my driving licence
