Path Smartlink Card ?



Hello All,



I bought a Path Smart link UNLIMITED (30-day) card last month. I went to refill it this morning but for some odd reason, the damn machines couldn't read my credit card and said that they weren't able to process it. Therefore, I had no choice but to refill my card on the Smart link card website. However, I found out that it'll take up to 48 hours for the refill to process and for me to use the card again... *sigh*



My question to those of you who can relate - Have you ever signed up for the automatic refills via their website? If so, did it work? Is it secure? Please let me know.



Thanks!

Why are new yorkers so sensitive?



you would think that new york people will be used to hard knocks, negative feed back and i would expect that this would all be taken with a pinch of salt, but it seems some get very upset over their city and even use foul abusive words to tourists like me and my family and dogs when standing on the pavement for pics, it seems we have to say new york is perfect or else,,,well it leaves a lot to desire and is not a city for outatowners is it, who are not welcomed
what a shame, but i be back

well i have never been to new york, but here are some thoughts.



a LOT of people go to new york for vacations, weekend trips, etc. maybe those people who actually live their don't really like it that half of their city is just people from out of town. maybe they love nyc's atmosphere and all of the places to go, but they wish that is was more of a small town place.



just a thought. but they still shouldn't be rude to the people who do visit.  :-|

That's becaue your'e acting like a tourist. Have you ever heard of a "New York Minute"? We're always in a rush to get to where we need to go. This is a very fast-paced city. Sorry to read about your bad experiences in NYC. Here's some advice - Get out of our way if you're standing in the middle of the street because you "have" to take a picture of everything you see within 2 blocks and you won't get cussed at.

We love our city, and most of use are very nice. However, people not from here tend to stop at every block and stand in the middle of the block to take a photo at a building. It's like...I would be walking down the street and some guy just stops dead in front of me and is like "wow look at that"! I understand that some of these people live in tiny towns or where ever, but you guys just have to stand on the side when taking pics or checking something out.

We are not sensitive at all, we actually just tell it like it is.  This is a huge city and you are likely to run into more creeps and crazies just because of the sheer numbers so we develop a tough skin and don't hesitate to say exactly what comes to mind, even if it is foul language.  That is probably the most irritating thing a tourist can do, is to stop in the middle of the sidewalk for a pic.  You need to be aware of whats going on around you and move to the side, get out of the way.  People are not gonna stop for your photo op.  Sorry, you had a bad experience, but you definitely make a point to be aware of your surroundings in a big city like New York and be sure to use common sense...(i.e. Don't stand still in the middle of a busy sidewalk especially not during rush hours)

lol, well, what i am going to say cannot be same for ALL new yorkers. well, i'm a native new yorker, and i am VERY proud of my city. it's my first month as freshman in syracuse university, and i already feel a strong longing to go back, like that fish with the scar in Finding Nemo (sorry if you havnt seen it, but thats the best description i could think of) in other words, i feel very homesick. :(



i don't shout abuses or curses at tourist, but... ehh, i do have something against them. no offense, but i don't like them. i see them riding on that tourist bus, and i feel like an animal in the zoo or safari theme park. well, the city is like a jungle in some ways. hey, i dont hate all of them. tourist can be irritating too, and if theyre cool or nice, i have nothing against them.
i do know some people that doesnt mind tourists. they are the rare breeds... i think. but yeah, i know lots of nice people, so there has to be new yorkers that feels indifferent about tourists. and believe it or not, there are new yorkers that are sick of this city! *gasp!* its a good thing i dont know them... or else...
yeah, so, come back all you want! this city's ecomony has been crappy, so we need all the tourists we can get. and come back with a car so you can pay in the toll booth. lol, just kidding.
haha, ladybug has better answer then i do.
and dont stand in the middle of the street or side walk or when the lights turns to walk. thats a warning. really. almost every one of us say that, cause it's true.

In that area, food (lunch and dinner) will be about $10 - $15 for each meal. More if you're going someplace fancy.



As far as Public Transportation goes, get a weekly (or monthly if you're staying longer than a week) metrocard. You can use it as many times as you want per day and it won't expire until 7 days (or 30 days if you get a monthly) after the day you first used it.

Why do some people say there is absaloutely no place like New York?



I'm hearing this all the time on yahoo and I'm getting pretty sick of it.
Indeed New York IS a super, marvellous place to be but no other place will EVER be as good as New York and will never compare? How arrogant!
Seriously I know they love New York but it sounds like they obviously haven't gone abroad. I live in London and I think London is truly fantastic like New York but I don't say "There will NEVER be a place as good as London!" That's just plain ignorance. I can understand people are extremely proud of New York as I am extremely proud of London and so are other people but other places in the world are very vibrant and cultural and filled with excitement like Paris, Sydney, Rome, Madrid, Toronto, Auckland, Berlin, Amsterdam, Fiji, Tokyo etc. I love all those places and they require luxury and history and their culture is fascinating. Why compare all those with one place which may actually be one of the capitals but it's just the way citizens express themeselves as if saying it's the centre of the universe and the only one and I just find that so conceited.
Basically they shouldn't show too much  pride otherwise people will turn against them and say they are bring judgemetal which they are.
I love New York so much but I think the peope who say those comments about New York are comparing with other cities as if saying they are rubbish and that's not right. Every place is unique in it's own way.
It's like when the cliche is written for Disneyland "The Happiest Place on Earth" I know that's just a puff but some people will disagree and think it's very stressful. I love Disneyland so no problem with me!
What is your say?



P.S I asked this question before but I deleted it because I was so fed up with the insolent answers coming from some people. They did not answer my question or they did not guess the reason, they did the exact opposite. They said "New York is the best! There's no place like it at all! Everywhere else in the world is rubbish and a hell-hole!" I got really cross and told them they were being ignorant and judgemental but they seemed to think that I had no sense of fun and I was the one who was genralising. There are so many idiots on yahoo.



</question>



<additional details>



I don't want more silly answers. Just give me a proper answer and a real reason.
Or just guess why.



If every place is unique, then why do they say that there is no place like New York? That's what I'm saying.



There isn't a "best" city or "worst" city. They all have their advantages and disadvantages.



No silly answers please.

Because they`ve never been to Tokyo!



Lol....
(I live in Tokyo :)



I guess it`s because we  Americans tend to be way too patriotic....



lol...but why get mad at us for it?
It`s not really arrogance-just pride, I guess.
Kinda like saying "There`s no one that can make a better apple pie than my mother" lol.
You might say it`s arrogant, or untrue, but.... I`m so proud of my mother that I wouldn`t say a top chef`s tastes better! Of course I`d be interested exotic pies, or "vibrant and cultural" pastries lol.... but I have a sentimental connection with my mother`s ....if that makes any sense...



It`s all just the way we think.
Many foreigners interpret it as arrogance or limited experience or whatever...but it`s all just part of our culture...



But I must say I think TOKYO IS THE BEST CITY IN THE WORLD!

WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING THE SAME QUESTION?!



I was born and raised in NYC and have visited many cities in my life and no other place can compare to NYC. It's convenient, it's fun, it's unique, it's exciting, it's historical, it's beautiful, it's noisey, etc.



If it wasn't all of these wonderful things, why would the rents be so outrageously high? Everyone wants to be a part of the "Big Apple".



There really is no place like NYC!

As an NYC resident and a traveler I can understand why some think that NYC is the best.  There are other places that are nice and worth living in or traveling to but here is a list of my reasons of why I would never really leave NYC. And mind you that I am from another country so it is NOT my "America's the best" attitude here.



1) It literally is the city that never sleeps. There are things to see and do in any hour of the day.  If you feel like a falafel or slice of pizza you will find it here.  I have been to many large cities on this great planet of ours but never I have been able to get a falafel at 5 am.



2) It is a 'melting pot'. There are so many cultures and ethnic groups living in NYC.  You can meet people from various walks of life and get to know their story and culture.  It also adds to the fact that you can get Moroccan, Indian, Ethiopian, Chinese, Thai etc and it is good food. (My family in London always complains about lousy food and they pig out in NYC).



3) Fast paced and no nonsense type of environment.



Yes there are other beautiful places that may have some of these same elements but I have not had the fortune of experiencing them. Maybe you could point some out.

Queens is the biggest melting pot in the US and probably even the world,
you cant get that anywhere else.



Yes its true New York is magnificent but people are just stereotyping on what they here, that doesnt mean you have to get all worked up about it.



"I can understand people are extremely proud of New York as I am extremely proud of London and so are other people but other places in the world are very vibrant and cultural and filled with excitement like Paris, Sydney, Rome, Madrid, Toronto, Auckland, Berlin, Amsterdam, Fiji, Tokyo etc. I love all those places and they require luxury and history and their culture is fascinating"



Thats the exact same idea of how new yorkers are proud of their state, and right when you say "there are very virbant and cultural and filled excitement like ---"



You're also stereotyping their country saying its so much better



Honestly, The only possible way you can say something true about a place, is if you've seen all its perks.



Like another said, people are entitled to their own opinions and Obviously if you put this in a NEW YORK CITY Catagory, people are GOING to bash you.



You cant expect mumbo jumbo answers that agree with you if you ask questions where most , if not half of the answerers are of that part of the world?

my friend you are the one sitting on a fence and not sure of which way to fall... I have traveled the world and there is no place like NYC in my eyes and as an individual I am entitled to my beliefs despite your pouting.  London is my sister city in heart.  NYC has the best and worst of everything.  She is loud and brash, soft and demure, has the face of every country and ethnicity on this beautiful planet.  She has the most intense of love and the ugliest of hate.



The promise of every possibility and the utter, degradation of absolutely nothing.  Every city has dichotomies but no other city has it and owns it like the people of this great New York City.

It varies depending on the season and the size of the family and how long you're home. Heat is free (included in the rent) in almost every building in NYC. I'll tell you what my sister spends on average for electricity since I no longer live in NYC and she has a family.



My sister spends about -



Summer - $75-$85
Winter - $50 - $60

Moths usually generate 6.3 Joules of heat per wing flap. Their flapping wings help produce wind, which in turn, turns turbines to genertate electricity. My family uses not just "one" moth, but many. We keep them in our basment and they prodcue our electricity for free! I some times wonder if the moths will grow weary of their daily labor and revolt against my family. See, you got to have cats to keep those damn moths in their place.

I'm not sure what a UN Hostel is as opposed to a "regular" hostel.  I've stayed in two different hostels in NYC - one was... iffy - low quality, bad neighborhood, kinda dirty, and the other one (up on Amsterdam? - dunno, ~10yrs ago) was fine.

Hi there.
My friend who has been several times sent the following -
"Places to visit in New York



Empire State Building is a must – no trip can be made without going to the top then buying a tacky gift in the souvenir shop



Use the Statton Island ferry to see the Statue of Liberty – it free and takes 20 mins to get across & if on a nice day will give a nice view of the skyline on the way back.



Ground Zero – this has placards of how they are re-building the site and details of the new construction – you can’t see much of the base as the building work is being done.



Tiffany’s – I had to go there just to see the 4 floors and dream!!



There is a bus tour that has a number of different routes that can be used – either uptown or downtown & you can hop on & hop off all the way around and will save your legs from getting too tired.



Especially if a nice day have a look out for some of the helicopter rides, I went on one that was for 20 mins and the views were really good & have got some decent photo’s



You can go ice skating in either Central Park or on the Rockerfella Centre depending on the time of the year?  Also the Rockerfella Centre has some spectacular views – it looks good both during the day or night.



Grand central station has an amazing market that leads you up to the station – which is quite picturesque – also downstairs is the shrimp bar, which at 11am becomes packed with people ordering food – it isn’t cheap but the fish is said to be the best served anywhere.



FAO Swartz has the original piano that was used in the movie Big with Tom Hanks – as it is a toy store.



Shopping



Bergdorf Goodman’s is the equivalent of Harrods



Bloomingdales is OK but I wasn’t all that fussed



Macy’s I enjoyed as it has history and the store is nice



Century 21 – this is like a TKMAX but has a lot of exclusive designers



I thought that Banana Republic was good and there are definitely lots of them



Places to eat include



·



Deli’s are everywhere and so easy to find



·



Greenwich village is worth a taxi ride out to and so is Little Italy as there are a number of restaurants to visit



·



There are quite a few other named places such as TGI’s and Beef steakhouse places which are also reasonable in price.



Don't forget a stroll in Central Park (Daytime!)."



Good luck, Steve.

I have 24 hours in NYC...I need ideas of things to do?



On December 10 I will arrive in NYC around 11:30 AM. I will be leaving on December 11 at 2:00 PM. I have slightly longer than 24 hours and would like to do and see as much as possible in 24 hours (no sleep necessary). I've been to NYC a few times before, so this time I'm looking for stuff to do that's a little under the radar (no Empire State Building). I ESPECIALLY need ideas for things to do at night and through the wee hours of the morning (anything with 80's night, drinking, bars, 24 movie theater showing old movies, etc..)
Please help with your suggestions.

No



Many of the people who work in the city are, in fact, from the suburbs. If it wasnt for them, the city would not be running right now. On 9/11, the neighborhood that lost the most people was a neighborhood on Long Island, not any of the 5 boroughs. Many of our cops and firemen are people from westchester, staten island, and long island. there are more Jersey plates in the financial district than there are New York plates. They watch the same news as us, they drink the same water, they breathe the same air, and read the same papers. We might not always get along, but I, as a Queens resident, have more in common with someone from Brooklyn or Long Island than i do with someone from Minessota who moved to SoHo to be cool.



Also, if you wanna be technical, MOST of the people living in Long Island and Westchester ARE originally from the city. I live in queens but i went to a catholic school on Long Island, and about 75% of the students were born and raised in the boroughs before the moved out to the island. If you wanna hear a classic New York accent, you're more likely to hear one on Long Island, Staten Island or Westchester than you are to hear one in Manhattan. Most people living in Manhattan arent even FROM new york, theyre from outta state and just as much tourists as people from minessota. Most long islanders and westchester people have families that live in the 5 boroughs, or grew up there themselves. I'm from the Bronx, but I've been pushed out to basically the edge of Queens....the subway doesnt even run here in Whitestone. My high school teachers were all from Queens and Brooklyn, and they were pushed out onto Long Island, and many of the peopel in Westchester were former Bronxites. They left the boroughs for various reasons (crime, schools, gentrification, etc) but they're still new yorkers, not tourists (except for the guys in Jersey and Connecticut)

Anyone who stops to take pictures or doesn't seem to know where they are going(stops in the middle of the sidewalk) or walks slow (not old or disabled) is considered a tourist by most New Yorkers.  Cause that usually signals to us that you have no clue about the flow of things. We like to move fast, we are always in a hurry and that kinda stuff messes up the flow and makes most New Yorkers frustrated, if not angry.

Well geographically they aren't. They share the greater New York area and many LIers are former residents of the five boroughs who've moved out to suburbia.



In a way, being a tourist is more about how you act rather than where you are from. If you are in a place and act like you don't belong, you'll come across as a tourist. Of course in NY, acting like you don't belong means walking slow, stopping or slowing the flow of foot traffic, standing to the left on an escalator, walking onto a subway before letting the others off, stepping onto a subway and not moving in or right or left etc.



To many Manhattanites, even people from the other four boroughs are referred to as Bridge and Tunnel People, a deragatory term not unlike "tourist".



To many New Yorkers, it's people from Jersey and LI that are the most annoying, because they live just close enough to have a sense of entitlement but in reality aren't even close to understanding the day to day rhythym of NYC.



To many New Yorkers, it's the people that come from the midwest that are the most annoying, because they bring with them their slower, simpler lifestyle.



To me, I find that anyone who comes here and doesn't show respect for the people and the way of life here should be given the deragatory term of "tourist". The true definition of "tourist" is "a person who is travelling, specifically for pleasure". So technically, anyone visits a place for fun is a tourist. But I think the idea, especially in NYC, is to not ACT like a toursit, even if you are one.

Tourist is defined as anyone who is slower, unfamiliar or ignorant of common NYC native etiquette.  E.g. waiting at a crosswalk to cross a street even if the cars are gridlocked.  Or walking really slowly holding your two kids hands on the sidewalk of Madison Ave during rush hour.



Many Long Islanders, and NJ'ers are worse than tourist as they only come into NYC for concerts, parades and are afraid of the city.  The pace is too fast and too many people.  They hate taking the subway and constantly have fear as if they are living a real life "Warriors".  Maybe you fit into this category and maybe you don't.  I'd ignore the comment unless you fall into one of the above descriptions.

Well, lets put it this way. I was born and lived in NYC for 22 years. I haven't lived there for the last 24 years (lived on LI and NJ during that time), but I am in Manhattan at least once a week and I consider myself a "tourist" when I'm there.

THat depends on construction work on weekend.
Most easiest way will be:
Take Brooklyn-bound N from Canal St to Coney Island via 4th Av Brooklyn express/Sea Beach Line local. You may also take (Q) train to Coney via Brighton Beach Local.



There is another way and walk to Grand St-Christie Sts, then take Brooklyn-bound (D) via West End Line local to Coney Island.
However, beware of construction work.
Sometimes when that happens, it require Brooklyn-bound N/Q to run local via Lower Manhattan or Manhattan-bound N runs on West Line (D) from Stillwell to 36th.

The easiest way I can tell you to do this is to take the "J" train at Bowery Street in Manhattan to Canal Street and then transfer there for the "N" train all the way to Coney Island (last stop). There may be a way that can take this trip less time but I thought this was the simplest way.

The people who are saying 1 mile couldn't be more wrong. They are looking at Google maps and measuring it by driving distance which is inaccurate because you would have to make extra turns while driving because of one way streets. Just goes to show that google maps and GPS' are virtually useless on the streets of Manhattan.



To walk from Penn Station to Times Square is about half a mile in a straight line, which is exactly how you'll walk it, right up Seventh Ave.



If you'd rather take the subway, take an uptown 1,2 or 3 train from Penn Station one stop (or two stops in the case of the 1) to Times Square.

You have to take it from Times Square, but you don't have to leave Port Authority. You can walk to the Times Square station from Port Authority via the underground passageway.



While in the bus terminal, follow signs to the subway. From there, follow signs to the N,R,W,Q trains and it'll put you on the passageway.

I have been to New York City a billion times and usually just walking around and shopping is enough for me. But we go to this one really good restaurant if its not to busy called Carmines. I don't know exactly what street its on though. I would also recommend that if it is your first time going to take the ferry that goes to The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island if there is good wheather.

It's generally expected of you when asking for a beer, to pour the contents onto the floor, and then lap it up of the floor. This should be met with nods of approval.



Actually no, I'm thinking of my own local. Sorry. (I'm Scottish)

No it is not. But the best was is to ask the bartender or server what is on tap. That way you are assured of getting a pint in a glass not bottle.

No, most places serve bottled beer along with frosted mugs/ glasses. You can always get a pint instead of a bottle too.
And if you do get a bottle and they don't give you a mug, just ask for it, nobody will think u are weird.

well i just turned 14 and i was very mature when i was twelve, i can cook spagetti, noodles are easy to boil and you can buy sauce in a container thingy lol. ummm also tacos are extreamly easy if she can fry hamburger meat. if you have a pizza kit thing she can make pizza. quesidillas are yummy. you could have a mexican dinner just buy her some cheese dip you warm up, salsa, re-fried beans, and some tortilla chips.  and then have quesidillas or tacos as the main thing.

dont let her fry anything like with grease like french fries chicken things like that because thats dangerous if she spills any on the eye it will cause a fire.

Where do I go in the Bay Area, Cali?!?!?



I am going to the Bay area (San Fransisco, Oakland, San Jose) in California for this upcoming Labor Day weekend (Aug.29th-Sept.1st). I'm visiting a friend and he literally just moved to the area recently and we are both clueless as to where to go to have a good time. I am from Chicago, so I am looking for great nightlife venues to top what we have here. Any good clubs, bars, events, and/or places to eat anyone know about or recommend? Also please describe the crowd at the places. I really appreciate some help! Oh btw if it helps by giving age, I'm 21 n he's 23. Thanks!

Well anywhere in SF is a blast, though slightly pricey depending on which place you go to. I used to live in San Jose, and while there is some nightlife, SF is better. And Oakland, well, Oakland is like the Compton of the Bay Area.  I wouldnt recommend going anywhere in Oakland at night. Maybe Jack London's Square, which is pretty mellow place, in uptown Oakland. It's by a dock, so it's picturesque. All in all, I recommend SF for nightlife; there are numerous concerts, great restaurants, clubs, and there's always strolling down the Golden Gate Bridge if you want. But, if youre up for a drive, you should go to Monterey, where there are beaches and great places to visit.
As for the people, the Bay Area is VERY diverse, culturally and otherwise, so I cant really give a general description of the crowd. But people are pretty friendly, until you give them a reason not to, like most places.
hope I helped :)

1. The nights get cool, bring that winter "hawk" buster. We get "FOG"
2. The City is nothing like downtown Chicago. 
3. Have your friend buy a Sunday Chronicle and scan the pinky. He will find something.

Yoshi's is the biggest
Ruby Sky is close to downtown.
The Fillmore (of 60's fame) still gets some big names.
Boz Scaggs is involved with Slim's. When he is there some of his old 60 buddies come around sometimes for late night jams. He was in the Steve Miller Band "somebody get me a cheeseburger" 
If you want an interesting meal try the Supper Club. You lounge on pillows and they do a laid back trapeze show overhead while you have dinner. It ain't cheap and you need to make a reservation.

I don't think that I have enough room to describe the club scene. not to mention the places to eat in San Francisco. I would go to this web site yelp.com and choose San Francisco. This way you have more opinions about a club or establishment (ratings).Places to go and upcoming events while your in the city.

Unfortunately, smoking bans aren't very common yet - and even if they are law - rude smokers do not follow them.  For example, smokers are supposed to be at least 100 feet away from doors to buildings so that people don't have to walk through their smoke (to go in the building), but they usually are within 10-20 feet of the door.



I hope the I will see smoking become illegal in my lifetime.

There is a smoking ban in San Francisco in all bars & restaurants. Thank goodness. I'm pretty sure that in Vegas you can smoke in the clubs. Not sure about the eating establishments. In some parks also in the SF area smoking is not permitted.

In San Fransisco the Smoking ban is live and well and more Vegas establishments are opting for smoke free as well. To make your visit to either place as clear of smoke as possible be sure to book a non-smoking room and ask the concierge for smoke free restaurants and casino options. The Hilton LV is a good site for smoke free and on my last visit to the Paris the air was much  clearer as well. I have noticed that smoking areas are clearly marked and are well ventilated to clear the smoke out fast. Have fun!

Vegas passed a smoking ban in restaurants and in bars that serve food.  No smoking at all in any restuarants, and no smoking allowed where food is served.  Bars have to take out their food, or else put up a wall between the dining area and bar area.

There is no smoking in restaurants in Las Vegas or generally any place that serves food. There are still many bar & grill type places that do allow smoking in the bar areas, but not in the eating areas, and these are supposed to have separate entrances from the bar area or have separating walls from the smoking/bar area. If you stay in the restaurant area, and are seated far enough away from the bar, you shouldn't have any problems with smoke.

Many of the smaller bars closed their kitchens when this ban went into effect because their money came primarily from the drinking/gambling/smoking patrons rather than diners.

All of the casinos offer smoke-free cafes, buffets and restaurants, although you often have to walk through casino areas to get to many of these establishments. Most of the newer places are larger and have better air handling equipment, so a short walk through one of these places shouldn't bother you. Be careful though, if you go to an older place or a "locals" place, because those are often smokier than a newer or larger place.

No solely, Big Kahuna Burger is a franchise on the island of Maui in Hawaii, USA. Over the last 20 years, Big Kahuna Burger has built a reputation as Maui´s premier burger joint, and is known as the place to go for big, juicy, delicious charbroiled burgers.

Also, if you are wondering about the definition of the word and its meaning, here you go:
Kahuna is a Hawaiian word, defined in the Pukui & Elbert Dictionary as "Priest, sorcerer, magician, wizard, minister, expert in any profession."
In the case of the 'BIG KAHUNA BURGER', these people must have the expertise is producing 'ONE TASTY BURGER'.

Follow the Big Kahuna Burger link for my evidence.

What nightlife spots in SF do non-racist young professionals hang out?  I'm a cute, educated Asian girl.?



I'm not into the snobby white elitist type, but I do appreciate a well-educated man with class and good taste.  I'm looking for a bar, club, or lounge where the men are relatively successful and have manners, but are not narrow-minded and only looking for white blond girls.  I'm 23, pretty and did some modeling while in college, but I think I must be hanging out in the wrong places since a lot of white guys seem to only be looking for a specific (color and) type.

I'm looking for a place with a good racial mix and open-mindedness, as well as classy and well-mannered people.  Med students/doctor hang-outs are a plus since I'm entering med school in the fall and we'd have a lot to talk about.

If you can help, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you!

Also, if you could tell me what places to avoid based on my guidelines, that would be great too.

We went from the UK to Orlando last June and saw the shuttle launch from very close. Driving in the US is much easier than here in the UK, most cars are automatic and if you hire satnav you should have no problems. As shuttle launches are often delayed through the weather you would be wise to hire a car and not be restricted by having taken a bus. The shuttle launch was spectacular and so much better than I ever thought, my kids still talk about it now! Good luck.

I know exactly what you mean. I was petrified when we first went a few years ago. However, I now think it is much easier to drive in the US than here in the UK. Apart from around the parks in Orlando, the roads are bigger and quieter. Hiring a car means it is already geared up for the US roads. Most of them are automatic (altho I am used to manual) and you have to specifically ask for manual if you want one (I did not bother). I find it a joy to drive there and it is so relaxing. Just do a bit of research about traffic signals (eg you can unless specifically prohibited turn left at a red traffic light!). The cars are easy to drive. The drive out to Canaveral is lovely and easy - highway all the way. It is well-signposted. Cocoa Beach nearby is also worth a trip - we went body surfing (get a polystyrene board from Walmart - it is cheaper than hiring one from the beach) and had to be dragged out of the water to see a rocket launch. In fact, it is almost as near on Cocoa Beach as official trips will take you to the launch site, but much cooler in the water and more fun! Lol! Ron Johns surf shop is just in front of where we parked for the beach. Go on, give it a go. Cars can be hired to pick up from the airport - just take care coming out as it is a bit confusing around the airport- worth hiring one with a Satnav. We always get lost and yet have been every year for the last 4! Good luck anyway and hope you enjoy yourselves.

You wont get very close. We saw a launch of a Delta 3 rocket and were advised by the tourist info to go to the jetty at Port Canaveral for the best view. Dont rely on there being a launch as a load of them are cancelled at the last minute so check before you leave. I phoned the USAF for info and they were most helpful. Also weigh up if that is really what you want to do. Its about a 110 mile round trip from Orlando to a good viewing area for about 10-15 seconds of woosh from over 5miles away from the pad. As for driving its easy and as much fun as the day you first passed your test. Besides 90% of the other drivers on the road with you will be British.

I would recommend Bellagio Buffet.  It's the only thing I enjoy the most in Vegas beside Seafood buffet at Rio. (was it Rio or somewhere else).



Anyway, if you want to save money then go check out the hour when lunch ends. You go in right before they close for lunch to get ready for dinner, so you will end off only paying for lunch price, yet getting to eat both lunch and dinner.



Don't come for lunch too early and sit there waiting for dinner, just go in 20-30 min. before they close for dinner.  Last time, I saw a family was asked to leave because they stayed too long.

After you eat Bellagio, you will not like any other buffet in vegas since nowhere else can beat its quality.

My favorite is dinner desserts and smoke salmon and their pastas.

Don't eat too fast at lunch save some space for dinner too.

The Bellagio is much better than Rio or Aladdin.  Go for it.  They got king crab claws and legs on the menu and that says something!!  Most places have that sorry snow crab that is tasteless.  Also on the menu there is smoked salmon. MMMmmm.

The Wynn is number 2 on this list, and it's pricier than the Bellagio. It features veal short ribs, pork chops, lamb T-bone, tandoori chicken, hummus jumbo grilled asparagus and basmati rice with sliced almonds and golden raisins ,black mussels, herb-crusted seared salmon with wilted spinach and seared red snapper with lime vinaigrette at the seafood station, and the pasta tossed to order and lamb osso buco at the Italian counter.  Lots of variety for a vegetarian.

My third choice is Cravings at the Mirage.  The food is excellent and it's recently remodeled.  They left off the word "buffet" when remodeled because the restaurant has more of an intimate feel like a sit down restaurant, howver, patrons couldn't find it because they were looking for the "buffet" so they decided reluctantly to put the word "buffet" into the name.

Buffets don't charge for non-alcoholic drinks and you don't need to tip quite as much as you would in a sit down restuarant.

Have fun in Vegas!

well, since I just called my girlfriend's parent's house who commutes out of Vegas to pay rent and dress herself, you've asked the right person.She likes seafood dieting, she sees food she eats it,I'm particular and always make the money to pay gigantic food bills for both of us when and if it's possible.The common denominator is the Mexican restaurant Candy's named after a mexican from El Paso texas believe it or not and everything we order is bon appetite.The prices are reasonable until Kelly startrs drinking.She tells a few funny jokes but usually forgets to ordere dessert and won't complain about it later.I recommend it and don't you forget it!

You should try the Bellagio buffet.  Lots less expensive than a sit down dinner but the food is probably better than most.  It even has King crab legs and claws on the menu.  That's pretty awesome as King crab is the best.

My favorite restaurant in All of Vegas is Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris hotel. It sits right on the strip so you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains and for people watching. It's really nice and upscale, without having to pay the upscale prices! We visit Vegas every few months and it is the one place i HAVE to go to!

Donald Trump's new place has a very nice restaurant.  He had hired a 5 star chef and had a very inspired menu.  Due to the ecomony he's changed the whole thing.  He decided against the chef and stripped down his menu and the most expensive thing on his menu is now a $39 T Bone steak.

That's just one example.  Things are looking down in Vegas

Honestly I know nothing about the restaurants in Vegas.

I've heard that due to the staggering economy, a lot of people are eating out less than before.  Also, they're cutting back on what they spend by how much they order at the restaurants.  For example, people may no longer purchase appetizers or desserts.  These really hurt restaurants, because they're the big money makers, not the main entrees.  Restaurants that have a full-service bar or offer mixed cocktails are taking a hit as well.  People aren't buying as many cocktails or alcoholic beverages.

Servers are taking a hit due to people cutting back on tipping.  Usually a customer might tip 15 to 20%, but in some cases they may have to cut back on that as well.  Due to low sales, restaurants are having to reduce the staff in one of two ways:  either cut back everyone's hours, or else lay off several employees.

I'm with SpiritSF on this one Tadich Grill, eat at the counter.

Counters or bars are the best place to eat solo.  You have the bartender and other patrons to talk to.  Here are someplaces with single diner options that won't kill your budget. 
Scala’s Bistro – In the Sir Francis Drake Hotel on Powell at Sutter – Creative upscale Italian food served in a bustling, warm environment.



Don Ramons 11th at Harrison.  This places has been around over 35 years, a 3rd generation family restaurant.  Traditional, stick to the ribs, Mexican Food, top shelf margaritas.



Izzys on Steiner at Lombard: - This SF institution is known for steaks, seafood and stiff drinks. Eclectic historical pics decorate this dark wood paneled favorite. Don’t miss the creamed spinach, Popeye would give up the canned stuff in a minute for theirs.
Hays Street Grill 320 Hayes at Gough. Fresh fish shines at this neighborhood favorite. They specialize in grilling fish and then serving it with your choice of sauces that only enhance the taste of the fish and shellfish.
Clement Street Bar & Grill -Clement at 8th Ave. A neighborhood favorite with something for everyone, pasta, burgers, seafood. Baseball Mary and Paula the bartender make everybody feel welcome.



And if you really want to spluge!
Farallon at 450 Post is a great seafood restaurant that is like eating in an undersea garden.
Cortez – in the Adagio hotel 550 Geary – creative California small plates

You don't need that much money because with modern technology, your British bank cards will work in the US. You will be able to pay for any large purchases with your UK credit cards and debit cards. Equally, you can draw cash from cash machines. I'd initially take £200 in dollars and $500 in Amex traveller's cheques.

Why are you going to New York? Emigration or (relatively) short-term job posting? Or are you going to marry an American? I presume that whichever of these, you'll get an American bank account and either rent or buy a house or flat (apartment). Don't get rid of your British bank account or credit cards until you know you've got American equivalents and you know that you're not going to return to the UK. Also, make sure your UK bank account is set up for Internet banking.

Next your cat. You may not plan to return to the UK but things may not work out. Plan for that eventuality. Get your cat a "pet passport". To enter the  US the cat will have to be vaccinated against rabies.

I'm British but my father was posted to New York from 1974-82. My family mainly lived in the suburbs but during 1980 we lived in Manhattan on E72nd. It was a fantastic place for me at the age of 16!

It would be hard to find people of simular age if you forget to put what age you are. I don't do bars or clubs so I can't help you there. But I do love to go down to Dana Point and sit at the harbor outside the ocean institute and stare into the ocean and watch it crash on the rocks.

Yes there are lots. Dana Point is a locals type bar scene. You will see the same faces all the time. San Clemente is the same way. Both small cities with lots of bars. Laguna Beach is full of gays from Laguna and LA.



People are a bit older than 18-24 though. No college close by so the people are a little older.

Emerils or Bobby Flays. 
They are both trendy, good, hot, fresh. Not TOO bad on the pocket book if you compare to other higher end restaurants. 
Some of the sushi places are good as well but leave a MAJOR dent in your credit limit.

My husbands naughty b-day in san fransisco,strip clubs,hotels?



my husbands bday is coming up on august 21st and i want to take him to san fran and to a nice hotel and strip club.im not familiar with that area but i thoughtm it would be fun.im bi-sexual so it gives me a excuse to see some hotties like myself naked.any reccomendations of strip clubs in san fran?ive looked online but theres so many i want the best one,also i was thinking of taking him to a nice hotel where they have a jacuzzi and bar,do they have many like that in sf?hmmm or maybe ill even get a escort later on that evening to play with him while i watch,anyone know of any good escort agencies up there?if u do let me know,it would be much appreciated.his bday is on thursday so i gotta get it together lol.

Find an escort on Craigslist.org and hire her for the night.  Have her show you around town, and then bring her to the hotel with you.  Set this all up at least a week in advance.

My favorite San Francisco restaurant is Zan Kazam, in the Haight Ashbury part of town. It's entertaining for several reasons. You get to hang out in the Haight before you eat, which is historic, and entertaining, even if you're not a hippie. Then, you go inside and it is a fun atmosphere, with low tables and pillows to sit on. There are belly dancers, music, and the famous HOOKA pipes. It is fun to have a drink and watch the people smoking the hookas.  I have not been in a few years, but when I went, I had really great food. Hummus, pitas, and great Moussaka. They have a veggie and a meat version - the veggie Moussaka was amazing.

Ok first off lets address a couple of the other answers:
Candylover - Life is too short to eat in Chain restaurants, especially in San Francisco, the restaurant/gourmet capital of the world.
Mamacita - sadly Julie's Supper Club is closed.

For something completely different try AsiaSF - Howard at 9th -good chinese/thai/fusion food served in a cool club room with regular performances by gender illusionist.  No chowmein but lots of hot peppers!

Theatro Zinanni - Dinner Theatre in a tent on the Embaracdero.  Not cheap but definately fun!

Farallon - Post at Powell- Expensive but great food served in an amazing room like eating dinner in underwater garden

Marrakesh Moroccan Restaurant near Union Square! Moroccan food is wonderful, the place is dimly lit with lanterns, you sit on cushions on the floor and eat with your hands, listen to Arabic dance music, and they have a belly dancer shakin her stuff on weekends. It's really a fun time! 
P.S. don't be in a hurry, though. The full "experience" will take about 2 hours.
P.S. for the women reading this: most of the waiters are pretty hot!

Go to the Wynn!  You can only see the Lake of Dream from several restaurants at Wynn, this is a very exclusive and beautiful experience. I would say SW steakhouse outdoor seating :)  And remember, most of the fine dining restaurants do need reservation, preferably 3 days in advance for dinner on the weekend.

Hugo's at the 4 Queens. The place to be...not all the hype of the larger strip hotels...class act all the way. Start with the Crab stuffed portabello mushroom...try the walnut dressing on the salad made at table side...my wife loved the beef Wellington, don't get the large cut of prime rib unless you have a trailer to carry out what you can't eat. About $150.00 for two including tip.

The first place that comes to mind is Bix - 50 Gold Alley between Jackson & Washington [N/S] and Montomery & Sansome [E/W].  Good food, cool jazz and you are close to North Beach to continue the festivities.
Yoshi's at Fillmore just south of Geary.  Jazz and inovative Japanese food.
Bruno's Mission and 20th in the Mission.

Which month to go to Maui?



I am booking a suprise Hawaii trip for my husband for our annivresary. I know nothing about Hawaii, but do know that Maui and Oahu are the two places to go, I guess. We are going to want to snorkel, whale watch, ect... Plus we love nature, so we want to see lots of beautiful scenery. My question, as far a weather, do I go in late December or early January...or late January. I understand there is a rainy season there and I would like to avoid that.

December or January are both theoretically in the rainy season (some are more rainy than others), but that doesn't necessarily mean  vacation plans in any month are likely to be at all affected by rain. It basically means that there's a small possibility a kona storm could bring moist air up from the tropics and dump rain all over the island for a few days. Otherwise, there is usually a rainy side of the island (Hana, Kaneohe) and a dry side (Kihei, Honolulu).

Last year was a wet December on Maui. There were flash floods Upcountry, and it snowed on top of Haleakala. Kihei got more than 8 inches of rain that month, but in an average December, Kihei only gets about 2.4 inches of rain. On the other hand, January was very dry for Kihei. The January average is 4.1", but this January, Kihei got just over one-tenth of an inch the whole month.



What I wanted you to see is that a lot of rain for Kihei is really not that much rain, and that there's no predicting which month is actually going to be more rainy.

Both months are great for whale watching. Humpback whales prefer to hang out in the shallow waters among the islands of Maui County (Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe).

How much should I charge a square foot for building a Commerical Office in Washington State?



I'm a commercial contractor, almost always building steel warehouses and have an opportunity to build a conjoining office... I was wondering what the going rate per square foot for commercial office space was... the foundation pad is already poured...

How is the singles scene in Tampa, Florida (for a 22-year-old guy)? Is it easy to find single girls?



I saw online that it was ranked last place out of the 40 biggest U.S. cities in number of singles, does that mean that it's family-oriented and not a good place for younger people around college age and that it's hard to pick up/find singles at clubs, parties, events, etc?

I've lived in the Bay area my whole life. I'm 20 and there are loads of single girls that are your age. I promise you they aren't hard to find. All you'd really have to do is take a trip down to one of the colleges and you'd be sure to find many single girls. Or go to Ybor and hit the clubs!

How about "Clothes Call"?

That name does three things.  It puts "clothes" as the first word (which may make it easier to find in the phone book or Web listings).  Second, not only is it a pun (which will make it easier to remember), it is an *edgy* pun, so it gives some idea of the funky/urban nature of your line.  And third, the word "call" gives a hint that you have customized clothing (made to your call).



I wish you very good luck in your business!!

We enjoyed the boat trips that were fun as well as offering sightseeing from the water.  Buy yourselves a lei--they are so beautiful and fun as you would not do that anywhere else unless you went to Luau at home.  Or, go to a lei making class for an hr or 2.  Visit the Arizona memorial which honors our servicemen.  Visit the Maui Divers jewelers and buy yourselves coral rings before coral is on the endangered list.  I bought a "gold" coral ring and when I return they clean and polish it for me as long as they exist (it is now on the endangered list so more valuable than when I bought it.)  Do not go to one of the big Luaus.

When might power come back to the Houston area?



I'm in the northern Houston area.. around Spring.

The power's been out since 3 AM Saturday.. 
My stepdad drove to his office and a man there outside told him the power wouldn't be restored at the building for two or three weeks.
I'm scared that may be the case with all the homes in my area too, but I'm just hoping it isn't.

I haven't been able to call Centerpoint nor has anyboddy in my family been able to, has anybody called that is in Spring or The Woodlands and has gonna some sort of information about this? I'm in Austin right now and I know school won't go on until at least Wednesday but I'm figuring school won't open until there is power so it could be a long time..eh. I'm just worried, man.

char hung sut in chinatown. a pretty crude and small shop but have the BEST steamed manapua and dumplings in hawaii. its fun to watch them make the shu mai. affordable prices too...i think $1.15 for a manapua. they were voted best manapua in the honolulu advertiser!

in chinatown there is also royal kitchen, which has delicious baked manapua with a soft, slightly sweet taste and chinese takeout.



and of course, there is Panda express which has the best orange chicken... it's in waikiki and all over the island.



and well there is pf changs's bistro in waikiki, some hotels give coupons for it, and many dim sum places in chinatown. "Good Luck Dim Sum" is my favorite--your average dim sum experience.

kit'n kitchen is "where east meets west" and has some pretty unusual but delicious american-asian dishes. not too high prices.

Little village noodle house in chinatown has really good noodles... try the chow fun with the little flat white mochi (REALLY GOOD!) or the steamed vegetable pancake.



and pahke's chinese restaurant in kaneohe across the new walgreens' is really good too.  casual dining. the crispy won ton, sweet/sour pork, seafood noodles, ginger chicken and peking duck with buns are SUPER good.  i recommend pahke's.



have fun dining... :)

NOW! The summer time is over and students are going back to school so those that had jobs during their summer breaks had to leave them to return to school.

You can find some place to hire you.  Try for the highest end that will hire with no experience.  If you look really presentable and can show from other jobs, references, etc, that you learn really fast and have what it takes, you may be able to talk a nicer place into hiring you.  Work really hard to learn the best customer service.



Show up on time, stay late, don't miss days unless dying, be helpful to other servers, and ask to take on more work.  Keep moving up to nicer restaurants.  Eventually you'll get the kind of job you want.

At 18 with no experience, to get a waiter job in Manhattan is highly unlikely.  The majority of waiters in Manhattan are unionized and easily make 6-figures a year.

If you really want to pursue this, you would have to work your way up. Apply for a busser position, as that is the best way to learn the trade. If you are presentable and energetic with a willingness to learn, most places will take you as a busser.

Maui.



its extra beautiful (anywhere in the islands for that matter ) in February with the humpback whales in for their calving.  You see them breech from the beaches or from the water if you take a day trip out.  Weathers great.



We had a  chance to visit almost all the islands now and Maui is a great mix of great beaches, lots of things to do and tourist friendly.  As far as hotels; you cant miss anywhere in the kannapalli Beach area. Thats on Maui's west side, the side with the best beach weather.



If you can, definately rent a car for the week as it will allow you the freedom to explore on your own much better.
Take the road to Hana if you get a chance but its a days journey down there.



The volcano visit a must.  Different world entirely. We drove the north shore of maui as well but Its a bit of a knuckleballer in some spots and one way bridges like is the road to hana but north shore road a lot narrower in spots.  If you didnt like Hana dont do the north shore.  (wife hated it petrified and that of course was not so fun)



Snorkel a day at Molokini (a small volcano tip off Maui).. lots of companies there offering that day trip from Maui itself..



Go to the market in Lanai.  Thats were the whalers used to put in. 
Got to go to a  lauau (sorry blond moment on the spelling)... the one at Kannapali Beach resort is good but there is another at the Four Seasons (I think) further down mid-island way.



Better book your tickets for the good ones now as some of the waiting lists are a year!



Do some on-line searching and reserve.

Big island is less touristy more workaday although the volcano there is still active and more dramatic.  Oahu is really developed commercially and residentially if you want to see buildings and palm trees go to LA.??
\.  Some of the other smaller islands, frankly some  arent even particularly fond of tourists hoping to maintain some of the hawaiian culture land and place.



Wife and I had a great time on all the islands over 25 years everytime but for starters; I'd recommend Maui.

No...no responsible, reputable doctor ever makes a patient be entirely naked for a physical exam.  If it is a thorough exam, different body areas will  need to be exposed briefly for exam, but the patient will always be mostly covered.  I am a nurse and have assisted with many physical exams.  Doctors and nurses always do their best to be respectful and protect the patent's modesty.  What kind of visa are you talking about?  If it is a tourist visa, there is no physical exam required.

htere is really no such thing as "coffee shops" in nyc, you have to go to the local diner, where you get to hang around with the locals,



in the outer bourghs,



no such thing as "readings"  you go to the local diner,wherever it is and you hangout, you drink five cups of coffee,



in nyc the bar is the place, like that television series "Friends" or "Cheers" or whatever it was called, where the locals meet for relaxition and have a few,



go to Jersey for coffee shops



or Cn or Ma
