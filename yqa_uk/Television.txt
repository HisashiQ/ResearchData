I have been disappointed each week due to her song choices, and i blame Dannii - they really have been cr4p



Danni wont be coming back next year - get Gary Barlow in as the fourth judge (I can feel a Poll question coming on)!!!

The wrong person was sent home.



So ok, i don't think Austin was going to win but how many chances does this girl get?
Simon has said three weeks out of the previous four that she got it wrong, the song, the performance, etc, the other night her timing and tuning was shocking.



When she's got it right she's really good but 1 good week out of 5 isn't good enough, who the hell is keeping her in?



I also don't buy this 'bad girl made good' story, it's a complete crock and as soon as she gets the money and fame she'll be back to her old tricks.
As far as i'm concerned, an ex drug dealer shouldn't have even been given the chance, how many lives has she destroyed by selling those drugs?



A good voice in the body of a clearly awful person with a terrible personality, a massive chip on her shoulder and my god, her skin is so bad you could grate cheese on it.



He constantly hear they're looking for the 'complete package' and she's no where near it.



I'm not sure why Louis kept her in, maybe she's part Irish.

Rachel is a horrible arrogant person with little talent. Yes she deserved to be in the bottom 2 and she should have gone last week, I couldn't believe it when Louis chose Austen to go.It was just to spite Simon. I think if it had been down to the public it would have been a different result.
I live in hope that she'll go this week.

I can't believe Rocco what's-his-name got more votes that Kim.  But I'm sure she doesn't have a big female fan base, and I don't think a lot of guys vote or watch.  To me, she's a Paris Hilton - not sure why she's famous except for maybe her father.  And she's pretty boring when she's talking.



Cloris probably has some die hard older women fans, from back when she was so funny on Mary Tyler Moore.  And she's a lot more interesting than Kim.  Wonder how she'll do is she has to dance a faster dance - she's gonna break a hip or something!

It's all about the fans.  People seem to love Cloris and are voting for her.  You never know what kind of stunt she's going to pull (like bribing the judges) or what is going to come out of her mouth.



I was surprised that Kim got voted off because I thought she'd have a bigger fan base.  She wasn't the strongest dancer at all, but she also wasn't the worst dancer left.  Maybe people thought the same way I did that someone else would vote for her and used their votes to save someone else (like Rocco) who they thought needed fan support.



As long as the viewers have a choice in the matter then there will always be controversy.  I compare it a bit to American Idol.  There is still debate over whether the right David won last season.  But that's the beauty of a show where the fans have a voice.  As long as you like someone you can vote for them and save them.

No...Kim didn't perform as well as she could have this week, but Cloris isn't even in the same league as the other contestants.  She needs to leave before she breaks something.



But, if you didn't vote (I don't know about you, but I didn't), then I guess you can't really complain.

Who thinks Warren Sapp and his partner should win Dancing with the stars?



His Dance partner is the most Natural beauty I have seen in years. I just go ga ga when I see her. I think I may have a major crush on her.



</question>



<additional details>



I want to know why Cloris Leachman is still there. Okay, it's cute that an 82 year old woman can walk let alone dance but she does next to nothing and remains in the competition.



I already commented on Kim, I think she is pretty but too stiff. She needs to go too.



Yes Warren and his partner are VERY good. He is a natural at this.

I agree that Warren and Kym should win, he is pretty light on his feet for a big guy. Cloris needs to go, I'm afraid she is going to break a hip or something, plus her antics were old the first day. Kim has to go as well, her performance lacked energy and excitment......she sucks.

If Warren continues to dance as well as he has so far, I think he has a chance at it. Brooke and Derek are also very good. Derek is one of the better instructors and the judges have stated that Brooke has a natural dancing ability. Warren's footwork is amazing, especially considering his size. At this point he is my favorite, He is an excellent dancer and he has a wonderful personality

I heard one update which was pretty sad. One of the boys in the family died and he was foaming at the mouth, this was just 2 weeks later after the show has been made. I don't think it was aired.

So far it has been rumored that - Robert Kilroy Silk, Sham 69 Singer Jimmy pursey (I've never heard of that group!!!), Peter Stringfellow, Simon Webb (From Blue), Esther Rantzen, Peter Duncan (No idead who???) Chris Eubank and Georgina Bailey.



The worst line up since the series has started in my opinion. They are scraping the bottom of the barrell with this lot.

I think she'd be more popular if she was a little more humble. She seems to swan around as if she's won already. Just imagine what kind of horrible diva she'd turn into if she actually did.
She's just too ignorant, and little too ghetto for my liking.

Russell Brand is an odious little cretin, I cannot stand his sick sense of humour, he was on a TV show a while back and was making jokes about abused children, this is just never funny and not something that anyone should be laughing at.  Making fun of people at their expense is not big or clever, I hope his career takes a nose dive and we never hear of him again, disgusting little man.  Prank calls are not funny, they can damage people, and hurt them and cause distress, nothing is worth that.

There is a conspirisy theory about this: It is along the lines that the ruling elite broadcasts mindless, brain numbing material to the masses in order to dumb them down. They don't want a well informed populous when they are destroying civil liberties and moving towards a totalitarian regime.

Upon seeing Annie and Ethan kissing, Naomi decides to take matters into her own hands to get back at Annie for her deceit. The students are in shock about the news that Ryan hooked up with one of the students, Kimberly, and that he has taken a leave of absence. Kelly returns from her trip to visit Dylan and confronts Ryan about the allegations. Harry and Debbie throw a party for Annie's sixteenth birthday, and everyone except Naomi is surprised when someone from Annie's past shows up. (im thinking her ex boyfriend?) Annie and Naomi get into a screaming argument about their alleged backstabbing. After having dinner with Navid and his family, Adrianna learns that Navid is a virgin.

Well being that someone from my town was recently on a reality show I would say no. This guy Mikey P who I went to high school with was on From G to Gents I couldn't stop laughing simply because this guy is in NO way a G even though they proved that right on the show they also had false info saying he was from Trenton when in reality he is from a small town. I think they need to do a little more of a background check for some of these people. Besides the fact that once they get on the show they change I guess the camara are to much.

She could take up a new job in the soap as a dominatrix, dressed in lots of lovely, shiny black PVC (long gloves, thigh boots, basque etc). I for one, would find the programme unmissable if the writers were to make this one crucial change!

So far it has been rumored that - Robert Kilroy Silk, Sham 69 Singer Jimmy pursey (I've never heard of that group!!!), Peter Stringfellow, Simon Webb (From Blue), Esther Rantzen, Peter Duncan (No idead who???) Chris Eubank and Georgina Bailey.



The worst line up since the series has started in my opinion. They are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this lot.

Did you watch "Paris Hilton's My New BFF" tonight? ?



I just can't wait till next week's challenge.  That's going to be crazy, lol!  Inviting a bunch of strange hot guys to go back to Cali with you to party!  Some lucky guys, huh? I wasn't sad to see Kiki go!  I was surprised to see Kaylee win the challenge because she looked like a C-O-W!  I guess Paris wants to make sure she looks a lot hotter than her BFF, right?  Kaylee is also too wild.  I think Vanessa may be next go to.  She seems fake like the innocent girl (what's her name) from Texas said.  Or Kaylee.  She may be too wild!  It's too hard to tell.  I'd pick Corrie right now.  She's pretty!  Do you think she has butt implants?

It depends if you consider them to be typical representatives. They seem to be carefully selected to me. After all, a show with articulate, well balanced people having a civilised discussion and politely agreeing to differ would not make good TV, according to current programing standards!

I have no idea who J K is and I am guessing most of us working mothers from council estates with estranged partners are too busy working and looking after the children I don't think previous comments on your question are an entirely accurate portrayal of the modern age unmarried mother on a council estate as most of the council houses have been bought which really annoys me as there are too many homeless family's living in hostels. But I would like to know when this show is on?

What is worse than the people on the show is the host.



Fair enough the people who turn up are not the best that Britain has to offer but it seems that they are all poor, badly educated and not too clever. A lot of them seem to be bordering on having mental health problems ( although I'm sure Jezza would say that they are all vetted to remove such cases) and come on the show at really bad times in an awful life.
The worst example is Jezza who just sits in sanctimonious judgement over these people whose lives and hardships he could not begin to imagine and makes a fat pile of cash out of these poor unfortunates.
It's a bit like charging money to go and look at the loonies in an asylum.
When Jezza asks what these people are doing for a living he would do well to evaluate the real worth of what he is doing. He might realise that he is a jumped up, smug, sanctimonious, unctuous, creepy little bully who is making a good living off the hardship and misfortune of others.
The people on his shows are sad cases who obviously could have made better choices in life and done better but they are very much the bottom of society with all the disadvantage generations of that brings.
Jezza is just a greedy c#nt. What's his excuse?

You see people like this everyday and you can't help but think WHY. "I have a husband that beats me - well leave him then", "I don't know who the father of my child is? - well don't sleep around then." it's easy isn't it, we could do Jeremy Kyle's job and get paid thousands a week for it.People don't respect each other and unfortunately they don't respect themselves. They have no common sense and it grates me to listen to Jeremy Kyle because of his sheer arrogance, i don't know who he thinks he is sometimes.

Yeah he does have allot of people on the Show who possibly reflect England in a bad light,....and then he shouts at them as the Host of the Show as if he's better than his guests!



I bet if they had someone on there who could give him a taste of his own medicine and shout back at him,...he would change the way he talks to everybody on there sharpish!



They should do a Celeb version of the Show and have people on there like Kerry Katona,Jade Goody,Kym Marsh,etc etc ,...there lives are already public property,...thy might as well go on his Show also! ;)

What is the name of this reality TV show?



Can anyone tell me what is the name of this reality TV show? In the show, contestants are question a few question about themselves. Mostly are embarrassing matter (such as are you paid for sex before)



A polygraph checker is used to check whether contestant tell the truth. They are paid for each question depending on the polygraph results.

So far it has been rumored that - Robert Kilroy Silk, Sham 69 Singer Jimmy pursey (I've never heard of that group!!!), Peter Stringfellow, Simon Webb (From Blue), Esther Rantzen, Peter Duncan (no idea who) Chris Eubank and Georgina Bailey.



The worst line up since the series has started in my opinion. They are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this lot.

What is up with her? On the Road Rules/Real World Challenge Reunion she was all over the place. It seemed like she was on something. "I fu///c....k my friends too." What the hell? And she's dating Wes? Wow.

She was acting psycho! I sort of liked her during the challenge, but now I totally can't stand her.  She was all over the place, but you could tell that she had a lot of pent up anger from watching the show and she just didn't know how to handle or express herself maturely.
I can't believe she is dating Wes either!  I hope Ryan is wrong and she is not doing it just to get at Johanna because that would be low!
And she was obviously implying Johanna and Kenny are in a relationship by stating "I **** my friends too" b/c Johanna and Kenny keep stating they are friends--- but I don't see how it is any of Kelly-Anne's business who Johanna dates or sleeps with.  Ryan was right, she is definately jealous of a lot of the females!



But I'm really proud of how Evelyn handled herself on the reunion.  She was mature and handled the criticism very well.

Yeah, what the heck was going on with her?  She did come off as a complete crazy woman.  Anyone who dates Wes would have to be.



But, maybe she was caught off guard by all of the crap that Kenny said about her and she had no idea that Kenny was talking behind her back.  At least with Johnny he said crap to her face so watching the show didn't bother her as much, but if she thought that Kenny was always nice to her and she thought of him as a friend adn then saw him trash talking her, maybe it was enough to make her crazy.  And Kelly Anne was one of the few people who actually earned their keys and Ryan just took it back from her because of pressure from Kenny and Johnny.



It sounded like it was pretty crazy on that island and that the alliance completely bullied everyone and it must have really gotten to Kelly Anne.  But she certainly didn't do herself any service by acting like that and doing all of those hand gestures.  I thought she was from the south...

Sorry I didn't catch his last name.



But my thoughts on the show:
Kelly Anne was acting crazy! She really needed to calm down and act a little more mature.  I can't believe Kelly Anne is dating Wes... but I wonder if Ryan was right in saying she is only dating him to piss off Johanna-- I hope not because that would be real low!



I really liked the way Evelyn conducted herself, and Derrick and Johanna were calm and collected.  Everyone else was rather immature annoying.

I think his brain is damaged (not being funny)  He was in a really bad accident where his head was open.  But he has always been a little nutty.  He said a while ago that he played Buddy Holly in the Buddy Holly story he felt the spirit of Buddy Holly enter him and that was why he could play the role so well.  I think he was also on an episode of Fear and he acted wierd then too.  Maybe he really is a little bit nutty or his age catching up with him

Did you hear this too about Deanna and Jesse (bachelorette)?



I heard this morning on the radio on my way to school that they called off the wedding that they are no longer in love. Did you guys hear this as well, although I thought it was a mistake choosing jesse over jason.

I knew it would happen - Jesse was so nasty, I couldn't believe she picked him.  She should have stuck it out with Jason - he was a doll!!!

Is sheree  really as innocent as she acts? why did kim think she could make a record, and lisa's husband looks?



good in a speedo. sheree is being very nice to kim and a better freind than nene was, but is it real? and even tho nene was wrong for the song and the way she talked about kim, she does have a point kim cant sing and kim herself said big papa knew dallas austin, and thats how she got connected with him.nene may be mean but she is tellint he truth and whats up with lisa talkin to sheree about the song?
what did you think of this weeks episode?



</question>



<additional details>



but nene did sh!t all over kim's songs when kim was try9ing to share something important to her with her friend. she could have said the songs were bad without completely trashing them and making a fool of herself. so i understand why kim is mad, but kim is playing both sides.

Sharee' is being sneaky as all get up
Kim and NeNe have been friends for 3 yrs, and know Kim is all up Sharee's butt, constantly calling her beautiful and complimenting everything she does, and calling NeNe a hater and not having all she say she does is childish.



NeNe should have told Kim up front she couldn't sing but it would not have done any good, Kim wants to be a singer and Sharee' is gassing her up for some drama and she is falling right into her web



Deshawn tried to get them all together and swash all the drama maybe it will happen.



Even Anderson Copper watches the show, its fabulous :}

I agree with Christine, the poster above.  Sheree's friendship with Kim reeks of phoniness.  She seems to be manipulative, petty and plain old full of herself.  Her acting skills are awful and any one with a brain can see that she is extremely unauthentic and lacks genuineness.



However, I'm not condoning Nene's behavior, she was wrong to publicly criticize Kim who was her alleged friend, but I understand why Nene was upset with Kim and feeling a little betrayed.  It's understandable that she had some pent up frustrations with Kim that came out when she was drunk in the limo.



But Kim seems like she was intentionally trying to ditch Nene for Sheree prior to this, especially when she would choose to hang out with Sheree and praise her on her beauty and impliedly put down Nene.



Kim always talks about how beautiful she is and how talented she is in addition to Sheree...but who is she trying to convince by repeatedly stating that?  herself?



I totally agree that Nene sounded 100x better than Kim while she was intoxicated and not trying in the limo.

<answer>



Sheree is definitely not as innocent as she tries to portray.  Sheree will never put anyone else's needs above her own and I think she is a complete fair weather friend.  The reason she is even pursuing the whole relationship with Kim is to thwart Nene, otherwise she wouldn't have needed to go and tell Kim about the Nene song.  I thought of Nene as a good friend to Kim and Kim is just being two faced with the whole Sheree drama.  The crap in the limo I thought was rather funny.  I think Kim should be more upset about the fact that Nene outed her for being 29 (yeah, right) and that Nene has a better voice without even trying.  And if Kim is 29, she's saying that she's been smoking for 15 years...she started when she was 14?



Kim certainly cannot sing, but for the same reason that people try out for American Idol and are shocked when they are told they can't sing, people have no ideea what they sound like.  They are delusional.  Anyone who wants to be a serious singer wouldn't continue smoking.  She wouldn't even take the advice of a professional and thinks that just because she says she's a singer that it makes her one.



There was some show on a few years back about a princess who was living here and trying to be a country singer, and she was much better than Kim (not that that's too difficult to accomplish) but she went to Nashville and they told her she was no where near ready and needed a lot of work.  She had a song called 'when the rubber hits the road' which was something about hopping in the car and getting out of a situation; which was just a riot!



My point is people have no clue how bad they can sound.



The only reason we hear these people is because they have money.



And on another note - what kind of a person sits in the car drinking while the car is running and then drives off?  She talks about how she doesn't wear panties?  Her kids are going to be so proud.



Finally, how do you spell cat?  Kat?  OMG!

A question about Kate from Jon & Kate Plus 8?



Does anyone think Kate made up her PCOS because she WANTED to have HOM so she could get all of the free stuff she knew she'd get?



There are lots of perfectly healthy women out there who want to have multiples.  They ask their doctors and the doctors for the meds and the doctors [usually] say no so they go online and buy the fertility drugs with out an Rx from places in India and proceed to take double doses to produce more eggs.



I didn't believe it was possible till I googled it and found a forum where admittedly healthy women were asking each other for advice on how to conceive multiples with Clomid.



</question>



<additional details>



Actually, if  you visit here:



http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://sixgosselins.com



And click through the links to see the changes that were made to their site from BEFORE the tups were born, you'll see that they've been getting loads of freebies from WAAAY back.  Like free clothes, thousands of $$ in free groceries, free cribs, car seats ...



The link didn't work... But if you copy and paste that into your browser you'll get the site.  It's pretty interesting...



Sorry if I offended anyone with PCOS.  That was NOT my intention.  My sister has PCOS and she's been trying forever to have a baby with NO success.  I happen to think Kate gives women with PCOS a bad name (if she does in fact have PCOS).



Kate is a nurse.  Therefore she went to nursing school.  It's possible that she studied up on PCOS in effort to be able to properly deceive an already unscrupulous doctor into giving her fertility treatments when she didn't need them.

You can't "make up" a medical diagnosis, so no. And those treatments are not something you'd go through to get "free stuff."



What I do wonder is when she will stop treating her poor husband like crap and admit she needs some Prozac.

I dunno.  I'm still skeptical.  But I agree with what you said about Jon and her needing meds.  Though I was thinking more along the lines of a tranquilizer dart.  :-)

absolutely not. i dont believe she wanted multiples, either. she had fertility treatments because she was unable to conceive on her own. and i dont believe she expected free stuff because of the number of children... it just so happened 6 gorgeous perfectly healthy babies is rather rare, and the people at TLC say they wanted to show real people and their situations in effort to help others in similar situations.

Kate did not want multiplies they actually were contemplating on terminating the pregnancy when they found out it was sextuplets. She also was approached about the show ( they did not go and find someone to do the show on them) there for she did not know about all the 'free' stuff she would receive. Kate is like millions of other women out there suffering from PCOS. Myself is one of them! Do you think by choice we want to spend 20 grand a session on the POSSIBILITY of conceiving .. for shits and giggles?! If by chance we get more then bargained for its ok! Yes some women want more then one at once. However PCOS is devastating and I think you should get your facts straight before you start insulting women who can not conceive!

Just watched last weeks Project Runway, how the fukc did Kenley not get eliminated?



i watched the eppisode when it first came out, but i didn't bother watching to see who got eliminated, kenley's was so god awful compared to the rest i didn't think i even needed to bother.



then i was watching a reair of it today, and she's like "sued, your out" and i was so shocked.



sure, sueds, wasn't real innovative, but it wasn't bad, and come on, kenley's pants looked like something from the 80's, and not the good part of the 80's.



obviously, they based it upon who they thought had more talent over all and not that specific challenge that week, but then, what's the point of having weekly themed challenges and things like that to begin with? if it's going to be based off potential they should be able to design whatever they like, blah, /end rant.



but was anyone else kinda surprised too?

Honestly I think she was kept on for entertainment value.  If you watch the very end of the credits on the show it says that elimination decisions are made by the judges AND production staff.  Suede was fun but didn't have anything about him that stirred the pot or caused controversy.  The past few challenges Kenley has been getting more and more mouthy - she mouthed off to Tim that day, and even before that in her interviews she was getting more and more cocky.  I guess that makes for better TV.



I don't think she's going to make it to Bryant Park.  In the past it's always been the better designers who go there and not the personalities - even Santino in season 2 who provided the most drama was a really good designer - so we'll see LeAnne, Korto and Jerrell in the finale (I HOPE!!!!!).

Does Amazing Race 13 have a reality tv expert and what is realityminute.com? I think it's a site, but I think it may be the best one I've seen and so explosive, but I am not sure if http://www.realityminute.com is the right site, but I must say Jonathan Baker is really getting up there as far as reality tv expert.

Jonathan Baker is the reality tv expert as far as CBS boards proclaim, so he will broadcast a show called Reality Minute on reality tv shows at http://www.realityminute.com which is a good site and is listed all over the net, in many reality tv sites. So I guess Jonathan Baker is the true #1 reality TV expert!

I love reality televsion and love a good site that has all the right answers and realityminute.com seems okay. There are a lot reality tv sites but I truly believe Jonathan Baker has the corner market on reality tv and what's moving and shaking, being a mover and a shaker himself!

I am not a big fan of reality TV but it is so pervasive and when I've needed to get the pulse, I go to Baker's Amazing Race website because it is very informative and done in a very professional way.

Cloris maybe based on her low scores, but she seems to be an audience favorite.  I'd guess maybe Rocco or Maurice.  Kim will be around for awhile, I think.  Tom Bergeron said that her Mambo video was one of the most watched videos on the internet last week.

Sara was wearing a T shirt with a love heart on it pierced with an arrow.  The arrow was positioned in such a way that it just happened to be pointing downwards.  They were larking about and Darnell said,  " Do you need some loving down where the arrow is pointing?", or something very similar.  She made a huge thing about what he had said, blowing it totally out of proportion and embarrassing poor Darnell in the process.  She knew exactly what she was doing and wouldn't let it drop, to the point where Darnell tried to escape into Hell.  She is a stirrer.........

BB9UK: So what about BB10?



I know it's early but still...
We all know that each of them all are getting weirder every year, or well all have like disabilities etc.
We have the albino and the blind this year
So...what lengths will they go to next year, what type of people do you think we will get?



</question>



<additional details>



I know it's not worth my time, I hardly ever watch it, it's just because I'm off school and t night there is nothing to do.

I doubt there will be a BB10 either, but just how despeate do you think the people would be?
I mean we haven't had a diabetic or someone with aids yet, but how many more can you think of



TD are not from me people!

A lot of people give me flak for watching big brother but most of them watch sport s and all kind of pointless cr@p so while it might not be the best use of time, but it's not the mind numbing dumbness of watching people run around with or hit a ball of some description.

It's people interacting and as a person who is interested in people I find it sometimes fascinating, sometimes excruciating and yes at times it can be boring too. It's great see the shallowness, selfishness and stupidity of some people, their small mindedness before going in  and the way others cope with them. Much more interesting than x factor or I'm a celeb.



As for having disabled people and people who look different on, I think it's a good thing to expose people to others that they might not come into contact with on a regular or personal basis in real life.

Whether or not that is what they intend by doing it I don't care but I hope they do continue to make it and get unusual people to go on it.

I'd like to see one where everyone is reasonably intelligent, opinionated and self righteous but with very different opinions and from very different walks of life just to see them have some wild conversations.



Maybe people who need to have their opinions challenged like racists, bigots, homophobes, religious people and the like put in and made to see the stupidity of their ways and the humanity of the people they are prejudice against. - that would be interesting.

No way Mrs G. (Welcome back).
 She is a delicate bush flower remember. I'm sure that Aussie blokes are sensitive and subtle suitors, and doubtless she has led a chaste almost cloistered existence whilst travelling. Working for MTV in London ( Soho offices) must be very dull, no gig tickets, media event parties, or other perks, all rock and roll but no sex or drugs for her.
The poor lass must have been most started to find the charming gentleman she has been exchanging pleasantries with all week,  make so bold. His lewd and lascivious remark was most shamefull.
She's not some slaggy trollop making a fuss over a bit of flirty banter with a guy she has been coming on to like a light bulb all week now is she?

Oh god yes, Sara was milking it for all it was worth and it was something out of nothing!

She fooled around with him! 
He's a guy whose been in the the house for nearly nine weeks without anykind of "sexual" relief, and he said something he probably would never say normally in a million years!

Not a fan of Darnell, but felt for him this one time!

I'm sorry if this is rude, but most guys would have "taken care of themselves" at least once in 9 weeks, and they can't.

I had started to quite like her Mrs. G but she is leading Darnell on all the time, then gets in bed with Stu after pretending to be offended by what he said - yea right- and then goes out to him in the lounge and grabs his hands like she is all over him.  What the f*ck is the girl playing at?  My opinion has gone back to what I originally thought - slapper!

A Tru calling question



I have recently been watching it on Sky Three and the last episode I watched was the on with the Bride that was shot by her ex-(cop)boyfriend's girlfriend. At the very end it is apparent that Tru's sister is getting back into drugs and just before Tru gets the call from her sister she was talking to her friend that works in the Morge, and he says 'This is the second time someone has saved my life'.

What did he mean by that?
AND
Is her sister into drugs again, is that why she got slapped by that hobo-esque guy?

Thankyou xx

Davis was once rescued by Tru's mother, who also had the "gift".  Years ago, Tru's mother tried to warn him of the car accident that was about to happen. He didn't heed the warning, but Tru's mother flattened his car's tires, thus saving his life, but unable to save his spouse.

As for Tru's sister, her character was "pushed into the background" when Jason Priestly joined the cast.  She hardly appeared at all during the second season.  Her drug storyline was never resolved one way or the other.

My favourite episode is the one where Sideshow Bob ran for mayor of Springfield.  They make fun of the election process, people's attitude's towards voting, and they make fun of Rush Limbaugh which is great.  The episode makes alot of good points about today's society.

All the Sideshow Bob episodes are great.  I also like the one where Bob's brother, Cecil, is the villain and tries to kill Bart and Bob turns out to be the hero, but is sent back to jail anyways.

The one where Homer becomes a Union leader is also great.  It makes some great points about the plight of the working class.

Why would people go through and give thumbs down to peoples opinions?

It was something and nothing really...they were wrestling on the floor mucking about, then he ended up on top of her, and she said something like "I love this t-shirt because it has a heart on it"..the heart points to her crotch area and he said "why, is that where you need loving?" and she made it into a big hooha but to be honest I felt it was an off the cuff comment from someone who has been trapped in a house for a fairly long time, and not really a big deal lol...

I just watched it. Basically Sara was wearing a tshirt with a heart on it and I think she asked do you like my tshirt. He replied Yeah Is is pointing where you need some loving! It was pointing towards her crotch. Then he climbed into bed with her and she jumped into Stu's bed. And asked Stu if he thinks Darnell fancies her.

Darnell meanwhile had left the bedroom and was in the living room with rex and nicole. He was telling them the story when Sara came in and asked what was wrong. He said nothing then admited it was because he was embarassed.



Later on he jumped the divide into hell but BB made him go back!

In Wikipedia they said Hana Kimi will be airing on August 6th.
But it is not Hana Kimi 2, but rather a special.
I have just checked now on wikipedia, but they have taken off the link for Hana Kimi SP
Keep Checking on Crunchyroll for Hana Kimi SP!!

Because it shows they actually are 100 percent comfortable with themselves and that they don't give a crap what people say about them because they are comfortable enough with themself. I like that about him. Whereas Dale was desperatley trying to hide himself with his hat because he didn't want anyone to see him crying, thats a turn-off.

He was crying about the daughter he has abandoned to sit around all day wearing make up and nail varnish in a fake house on TV, nobody has forced him to go there, if he misses her that much then he should walk out, so yes as you so rightly put it he is vomit inducing.

BB9. do you still think rachael is not genuine??



i thought what she did tonight was lovely, and if she was trying to win brownie points then she would have told them what she had sacrificed. she did not even think about her decision she automatically said give them their letters. it was heartbreaking to see her crying like that. i think the HMs are unfair when they call her boring, she is a genuinely nice person.

Oh I was in tears tonight!  Especially when Stu got the letter from his little girl!

As for Rachel, yes I agree, that was a very selfless thing she did and I must admit, it made me think better of her.  I think she is a genuinely caring person, as not even being an actress, could she put it on 24/7 for all those weeks.



I'll be very disappointed if BB doesn't reward her, by giving her the letter from her family.

I like rachel but i just dont think she is being herself for some reason! i think when she is around kat she will come out of her shell because she can trust kat but when other housemates come in she just curls up into a ball! but lately i have noticed she is started to become more interesting she isnt afraid to speak her mind anymore. i think its mean when people call her boring just because they dont do or like most of the stuff that she likes!

I've never liked her BUT..............



She didn't make a big deal to the other HM's about giving up her message from home, even though shes scared that her BF will have moved on, she could have read her message and never told the Housemates but she didn't!

She's the first true Head of House that put the others before any agenda she may or maynot have!

Never been keen on her but after tonight, she has my respect!

I find Rachel boring, but I also think she's a really nice person.  What she did regarding the letters from home, was a great act of self sacrifice.  Only real good hearted people would do something like that, and she proved herself worthy of that title. Good Hearted.



I hope BB show the other housemates that tape.

I've always thought she was genuine Doobie and just don't understand why people think she is not.  Maybe because really nice people are hard to find these days.  What she did was magnanimous and she wouldn't say she had sacrificed her own because she didn't want them to feel bad about it.  A truly lovely girl.

hi all, i'm back from my summer hols, just about caught back up with big brother (although i was trying to watch it i also set my V+ box to tape it all how sad am i!!) what is going on with YA, i'm being told that i have made spelling mistakes and using "a lot of punctuation" lol

anyways, i have never thought she was not genuine, a bit boring at times, but she was so sweet last night she really made me cry, bless her, even when darnell was questioning her about choosing hells letters over her own she still denied it,

although i would like to think i would, i can't say in the same position i would have done the same as her



i hope BB give her the letter though

I like Rachel and have never found her boring.  I think , as she says, she's just found it hard to express herself when there are other stronger characters in the house.  I think she's totally genuine.  I think as the house gets smaller we will see a more confident, outgoing side to her.

Current its Nicole and Rex

She is a neurotic. wimpering drama queen and not very smart.  She was complaining that she is high-maintenance and so that is why she needed her suitcase.  But if you are high-maintenance, why go into BB???  Hasnt she watched the show with people living on one bowl of lentils a day, swimming in fish guts and the like??  Stupid.

ANd Rex - i always thought he was an a*se anyway, he has been vile to everyone, but he keeps pandering to the stupid girlfriend, calling her his "princess" and claiming she is drop dead gorgeous - which is just feeding her propensity for being a moany, spoilt brat.

They're all a heck of a lot better than that rubbish "comedy" they put on TV now with reliance of crudity and swearing and violence to get viewings and laughter.

I think it because young people have taken over. T.V is for the young, its sad.
Its like if your over 40 theres not much aimed at you. Thats why the world is in a mess.
I grew up in the 80s and watched these comedys with my dad, he laughed at them and so did I, hes nearly 40 years older than me. 
But now theres too much choice for young people and not for older people, its sad.

One of my favourite quotes from the classic series is from 'The Visitation' when the Doctor is trying to get Tegan back to her own time but misses it by about three centuries.  Tegan turns around and yells at the Doctor: "Call yourself a Time Lord? A broken clock keeps better time than you! At least it's accurate twice a day which is more than you ever are!"

From the new series I can't decide between:
"Goodness me, I'm a man. Yum! So many parts! And hardly used. Oh! Ah! Two hearts! Oh, baby, I'm beating out a samba!" (The Doctor, 'New Earth')

and

"So, physics! Physics, eh? Physics! Phyyyysics! Physics, Physics, Physics, Physics, Physics Physics, Physics, Physics, Physics... I hope you're getting all this down!" (The Doctor, 'School Reunion')

And I loved this quote from 'Blink' so much, I've got a T-Shirt with it printed on it:
"People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly.... timey-wimey.... stuff."  ; )

Oh, all good quotes so far!

Wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey has to be one of the best ever.  And also from "Blink" is "The angels have the phone box."

Another favorite, from "Girl in the Fireplace":
Rose:  You're not keeping the horse!
Doctor:  I let you keep Mickey!

And from "School Reunion":
Mickey: Oh God, I'm the tin dog.

Series 4, "The Unicorn and the Wasp":
Donna:  Agatha Christie, in a murder mystery?  That's like meeting Charles Dickens, at Christmas, surrounded by ghosts!
(one of my favorite quotes because "The Unquiet Dead" was the first episode of Doctor Who that I ever saw)

Series one, most episodes, "Fantastic!"  I loved hearing Christopher Eccleston say that.

Just like in series 2, 3, and 4, the way David Tennant says "What? What?!?!  WHAT??"

OH!  And another absolute favorite that we hear in "Utopia," "The Sound of Drums," "Last of the Time Lords," and "Stolen Earth" (and I hope we'll get to hear the Doctor say when Captain Jack and Jenny cross paths for the first time):  Jack!  STOP IT.



EDIT:  Oh gosh, one more that just hit my brain.  Series 3, "Utopia."  Jack is dead on the ground, Martha is attempting to give him CPR when the Doctor tells her to move away.  Jack gasps back to life and says:
"Was somebody kissing me?"

they usually do a shorter series in summer then a longer series over autum / winter

6 episodes this time which did seem short but should be a 12 week run later in the year

its constantly on dave as well so you can watch all year round if you want. the older episodes still make me laugh :-)

What is this song I heard on Roswell, episode 14: 'Blind Date'?



When Isabel and Micheal are talking in her room?

I have managed to get the lyrics 'I know, wake me up, I'm sat at home'

This is probably wrong but that it what I made out

It is on here at 11:53 when the blond girl (Isabel) is lying on her bed reading a magazine

http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/-c2kL...

Just skip through to 11 minutes (which is around half way) and wait for it to load a bit

Thank you!

Also, at the start of the episode called 'The Convention', what is the song?

The lyrics are 'I was invented by someone else, I'm not well connected you may find yourself confused by me, if you open me up you will/ would see I'm not human, no I'm not...'

That is all that was played

It is at the start here at around 38 seconds:

I don't know if that's such a good idea. Soap Operas serve a purpose and entertain a pretty big selection of people. Daytime soaps in particular are very well loved by many people. The elderly, stay at home parents, and a lot of women of all ages adore the drama and are very hooked to their characters. Frankly, all the talk shows and reality crap on television all looks the same. In fact, it's getting trashier as the years go by. Soaps provide great storytelling full of romance, adventure, fantasy, drama, and even humour; you really can't get this anywhere else on TV.

That said, the ratings are dwindling each year. It is also pretty cost prohibitive - meaning it's a very expensive medium to keep going.

it 's more a question of would what they replaced them with be considerably better , and how/ in what ways(s)?
And even if (some/ "all" ) broadcasters dropped soaps, there are so many new channels on cable that a new 'soaps only' channel would be bound to sprout up!
All those unemployed crews, staff and casts would have to find new work and no doubt they'd band together to produce new work somehow ..

I love soaps, but it would probably be a cost saving thing.  Daytime chat shows and game shows are much cheaper to produce... but I really think that network loyalty branches from soaps, so it makes sense to keep them on (as long as people are watching) so that there wouldn't be outcries from angry viewers towards the networks.

i think they did i think bb thought that she would confront rex over the allegations and they would be a big row but then why have they told her not to say anything about the outside world because she has tried to hint at it but she cant actually say it.



what i think bb should do is give rex and nicole a task in which she can only say some of the rumours she has heard about rex so it can give her a chance to confront him and him to answer that would be soo good thats the only way in my opinion.

I think it did
They thought she was just another stereotypical blonde, ditzy, goldigging, big mouthed blonde
Turns out BB was wrong
She's just a blonde, ditzy, goldigging, secretive blonde

Wish they did confront each other, I hop he goes power crazy and she can't handle it and just shouts it right in his face
Maybe if she's up for nomination (and she SHOULD be) she will get so annoyed that she won't care cause she knows she will leave she will just tell them

If madjamfree is that desperate for two points that she is in the RTV section when she doesn't watch BB, then obviously she needs a life herself

Old Days of our Lives?



Hello, I was wondering if anybody would be able to help with this...

Right well when Days of our Lives was cancelled in the UK, we where up to the storyline which showed the Woman in White or The White Woman... She looked as though she had a net curtain over her.



The only thing is, is that when it came back on we were past that storyline by a fair few years lol...

Would anybody be able to tell me who the woman in white was and what happened with the storyline because me and my mother would love to know...  The storyline was in the late 1990's i believe.. though i am not 100% sure! haha

Thank You Very Much...

It is along story but her name was Rachel Blake: the mother of Peter & Kristen Blake. After Stefano killed her husband in a jealous rage he imprisoned Rachel somewhere in Aremid (Dimera backwards) & he adopted Kristen & Peter & raised him as his own.

Jennifer was marrying Peter in Aremid: his hometown & that's when we first saw "The lady in White". I think Kristen or Jennifer convinced her to come to Salem. Then she moved into the DiMera mansion. Later Kristen noticed something "familiar" about her. Then everyone simply asked if she was Rachel Blake & she said yes. She had a confrontation with Stefano in a cave in Paris. She shot @ him & there was a huge explosion caused by a gas leak I think. She is now "presumed dead". I hope she comes back & teams up with Marlena once she's all better & destroy him FOR GOOD!

A weakest link episode?



There was this episode of the weakest link that was broadcast on BBC1, on 14/5/08. I only got to see the first round on youtube, and because I live in Australia, I haven't seen it on UKTV yet, and I really want to see it. How far behind are we with our episodes of the weakest link? I understand were up to Series 9 set 4 ep 4, but I'm not sure when it is going to air.



Can someone please help me out with this?

Depends where you're from , all episodes are on the official South park website for free, but if you're from certain countries EG UK, you can't view them. Otherwise there are no legal options.

I'm not really a fan of the show but I saw this and it brought back tearful memories of my Dog's passing.
I was surprised that Eastenders had brought me right to the edge of shedding a tear. There was moisture but not enough for it to run.  :' (

It was one of the best eastenders episodes in ages apart from ronnie and roxy the funny parts were when the shirt at the laundrette got stained with ice lolly juice and the indian lady came running and shouting through the letterbox . 
Wellards passing was sad  a real tearjerker for anyone whos lost a pet brings back many sad memorys , im not a bianca and ricky fan or the family but they were all great tonight.

It struck a chord with so many of us viewers ; we've nearly all  'been there' in one way or another. and Wellard has been a top canine actor for years. He should SO get an award at the next ceremony, and when they show his stunning 'exit' scene to the audience, let's hope all the ladies are wearing waterproof mascara!

You did better than me then, I was crying my eyes out! Mostly because I'm so close to my own pets and love them so much.
I think it's nice that 'enders touched on this subject. It shows that pets are something people care about too.

I don't never get emotional when watching, sad films, tv programs.  But I actually had a sob, tears rolling down my face.  I just couldn't hold it back, no matter how much I tried.  Like you it reminded me of when my dog Jake, (the same breed) was put down.  What made it worse is wellards eyes were watering, as if he were crying.
But that dog much be so old, I am sure I remember that dog being around when my dog was a pup, and he died 5 years ago or more.

haha ohhhhh i recorded it. ah well that's that surprise out the window :P

and i'll probably be upset. not because i particularly liked the dog just because i'm easily emotionally influenced by sad tv/film moments.

i think its really good that eastenders did this storyline..
I didnt think i would cry..
but me and my family were on holiday..and we decided to watch it before going to the evening entertainment..
and we were all watching it..and i looked at my stepmum, dad and stepbrothers who are 11 and 15..they didnt look bothered by it..
But then the Song Started in the background and you saw bianca and the kids in the kitchen and the needle go into wellard..and i had tears pouring down my cheeks...and i thought i got away with it and my family hadnt noticed but i suddenly went " Huh-uhhhh!" like you do when you cry and accidently do that funny breathing thing real loud and they all looked at me like. what the hell??
I had to go re-domy eyemakeup before going out again lol! it was very well acted by all x

My sister always liked teletubbies when I was a little older. I always thought that one was a little strange - you know, telepathic televisions?

Hated her since day one, she's shallow, selfish and thinks shes better than everyone else.

No I don't agree that she gives women in general a bad name, as she's NOT one yet.  She's just a young girl.

But yes, she is VERY petty, very selfish and fairly rude and her and Rex make a perfect pair.  I don't think she's very good looking as all she seems to do is frown and scowl at everyone or give nasty looks of disgust, while drawing her eyes off everyone.  She's just a spoilt little posh brat (as Rex is), she's had everything her own way for too long and they both need a good kick up the backsides - preferably out of the BB house!



I wonder if they will keep a copy of the VT from their time in the house, review it in 20 years time and be ashamed of how they behaved?  We can but hope!

What is with him?

Haha, its so funny how Mohammed goes into the diary room or winks at her every now and then making it seem as if he knows she fancies him when she probably only stays around him for as long as she does because she wants some of his fags. I feel sorry for him though, he obviously thinks he's so fit just because he's kissed 3 girls in the house - like wow shocker - it was a dare for heavens sake Moh, get over it - they don't actually find you attractive in any way.

Rex is an insecure control freak and his hair makes him look like a gorilla. I would not personally date someone so dysfunctional but for the purposes of answering this question I'll imagine I would. He'd only try and tell me once what to do/wear. My knickers are my choice and no-one makes my decisions for me.  :0)

I love Hollyoaks at the moment. 
As much as it is a joke to some as most of the cast are pretty, it, in my own has acted alot of other soap actors off the stage. The schizophrenia storyline has been done perfectly and raised such awareness for a subject that is still taboo. The same can be said about the gay storyline between Craig and John Paul. It has been written so beautifully that the issue isn't the sexuality of the characters, more the love story between them.

I love Hollyoaks and it is at the moment beating any other soap for me :D

My Family is aimed at "the whole family" the slight sexual innuendos go over the heads of the kids but will give the parents a laugh and the general comedy will make kids laugh.

On the other hand The Young Ones is aimed at a mature audience, its also "alternative comedy" which basically means it doesnt appeal to general audiences.

I haven't really watched the young ones much, once or twice and wasn't impressed, but am and will always be a lover of My Family.  As far as target audience I would say it's not really for young kids, nor an adult comedy, uses adult themes as most of the jokes come from or around the parents.  A lot of sexual innuendos that would go over the head of kids.  Personally I think it's one of the funnier Brit coms ever made, and has incredible stars.  Zoe Wannamaker iis a star of top quality having been nominated for a tony and lost only because Judy Dench was also up.  Robert Lindsey did a wonderful series playing a detective, so far from the part he is playing in My Family.
It appeals to it's audience by having good writers and good actors and plots.  Also, as far as I'm concered, by being so close to life, but just a litte off, you can believe it can happen, but pray it never does.

BB9UK: Do you think Mo is pregnant?



I mean, its just cause he is very hormonal and with the mood swings, one minute he loves people next minute he hates them, next minute he wants to go, next minute he doesn't. I mean he is just so indecisive, I know I want him out
And he seems to be inflating everyday

So, do you think he is pregnant?
And if so is it a boy girl or twins



</question>

Oh I think it is more than 6 months, he could be pulled out this week on maternity leave, fingers crossed!

I absolutely loved the English Version and even though I was sad when it ended, it was the perfect time to do it.

So I realllly loved the American version at first, because it sort of carried on with my fave TV show as at first they were quite similiar.



However I have to say I prefer the American version now!  Its just so much more funnier!  Feel terrible saying that....but Steve Carrell is great.  As there are more episodes there has been more time to develop all the minor characters too, which is great!

I thought, originally, that the English version was great. But after watching the American: The Office for the last few seasons, I've come to really love it. The characters are better defined, the storylines are very funny, and all the characters, original and new, are great.

At first, I thought the Americans couldn't do a better job, but I stand corrected. I think they have been able to take a great formula and made it even better.

He's horrible, isn't he. 
He won't go if Nicole goes but she would go if he went- he would make her and she wouldn't trust him on the outside after his previous infidelities.
He was talking like that because Monday is nominations day and he was just 'planting a seed' - almost daring the others to vote for Nicole - because 'it's difficult for her being in the house'

I think nothing would pry him out of the big brother house, he is far to competitive. It is a very unhealthy relationship, with him needing so much attention, and also him telling her what to wear and such like, fighting so openly, and she is very spoiled, and I wish she would comb that hair, it is very ratty now. I think it was a mistake for her to go in, Rex is an egotistical bully but I kind of like him, at least he stirs things up a bit. The only reason I can see him leaving before eviction is so he won't have to face being voted out, but as he has a guaranteed seat into the final, I just can't see that happening.

There is no way he'll walk.  NO way!  Not with the finale just a few weeks away.  He's just saying that to try to save her.  If she doesn't get nominated and voted out this week, I will be shocked.

but when nicole first came on...he diddnt actually want her on there, so i doubt he would leave when she goes and yeah hes too competative. But the reason he didnt want her there was coz of him having relationships with the other housemates but whether or not his relationships have already been ruined by nicole. . . he still wants to win

OK.. I don't get this.. and it's about the soap section questions I answer?



I am aware that a "thumb down" doesn't cause you to loose points . Now here is my issue....I can answer a soap question like I did last night saying all the right things the "asker" is asking in their question. I watch soap's daily (well sometimes I may sleep through one) But I am accurate and polite and very informative with my answers. I can look back on that answer I gave to that person and there will be 5-15 people who have gave me a thumbs down and not even that many answered the question. I poll and survey every day and NEVER get that much attention. If I have offended someone PLEASE forgive me. Now I know someone is gonna consider this chatting but at least I may get a few responses first.Thank you all and have a great MONDAY

I dont think you have offended anyone, this happens to me a lot too. People just want to be rude and mean, I guess. I always try to give a good answer and make sure my info is acurate but still it happens. Either people just don't like me, although I don't believe that I have ever given anyone a reason to dislike me. Or, they hate my avatar and that is just immature. I like my avatar, it is a favorite couple from one of my favorite soaps so whatever, people will always do what they will! Don't let it get you down or drive you out of this category just because a few people are spiteful.

Maybe what happens is that when someone sees they got thumbs down they probably just go and give everyone else thumbs down. Also you know there are bound to be haters. Don't let it bother you, some people are just idle and l guess doing those things make their day better! Good Monday to you too.

Welcome to the club!
This happens to a lot of us.
It's just that some people on here seem to think that if they disagree with the opinion that is given in an answer, they have to give them a thumbs down.
It makes them feel superior, I guess!

There are also it least two individuals on here that must be very sensitive to the way people answer their own questions.
I know Debbie R. was, and still maybe getting a lot of thumbs down because one individual that is on the soap section a lot thought Debbie was being mean to her in the comments Debbie made in a question this individual asked, and even called her on it on here.
I think that individual must have had a bad day or something, because from the answers I've seen Debbie give, I don't think she would purposely pick on someone like that.

Whatever the reason some people insist on giving a thumbs down is, it's nothing to loose any sleep over so I just keep on ignoring the thumbs down I get and move on to the next question!

I get thumbs down all the time. So I don't think you have offended anyone. I know  you have not offended me. I hope a lot of people see your Q and maybe the TD will slack up. I spend most of my time in another section because some the people are just plain cruel. Like if you ask a Q and you have somthing wrong --like someone's name or maybe for a second you were thinking of one show and you typed in another--THEY REALLY LET YOU HAVE IT THEN. I guess some people think they are perfect or else they just get off too others minor mistakes. ITS SO SAD!!! and PATHETIC!!

It happens all the time, especially if you have a top contributor badge.
There are trolls probably in every section that have nothing better to do than give a thumbs down.
In Rock and Pop, they are notorious for thumbing down even if you're the only one with the correct answer.
Before answering this question, I noticed everyone had a thumbs down so I gave them a thumbs up.
Don't take anything on Y!A personally.
Have a great week yourself!

Don't take it personally, I get them too, and I am new to this section  only because we watch them with nana (grandma) who is a bit senile and remembers Days of Our Lives from 30 years ago, but can't remember what happened yesterday.  So I ask questions so I can answer her, and I get the big thumbs down lots of times.  I just thought it was because I wasn't a regular, I don't know.

Ukbb9 head of house fix?



Did anyone else notice the blatent bb fix to let rex win the HOH  statue task???
After nicole was eliminated rex was still sitting in the kissing pose.....after 20 minutes his chin had dropped to his chest!!!, his head must have moved 4/6 inches, i watched this live on e4 and you could clearly see his head drooping down until his chin rested on his chest,  as soon as mo quivered he got eliminated, this clearly shows bb's favourtism towards rex.

i didn't watch it, but looking at the pictures of the task, i understand what you mean, because nicole moved, surely rex must of moved because of the pose they were doing, but even if he does reach the final, theirs a chance he won't win, because of the voting public, unless channel 4, mysteriously lose some votes for the other housemates

I don't even need to see it to know that they fixed it to keep Rex in.... they are getting desperate.. the show is fcuking boring now

They made sure to judge him and nicole seperatley for this exact reason... they knew she would flop easily.



dR bad
bet they are hoping Nicole gets some guts soon.. and confronts him... that will get a spike of interest.

ABOUT THE SHOW "THE HILLS"...?



Has anyone else wondered why Lauren doesn't have any friends who aren't Caucasian?  What's up with that?  I heard MTV actually searches for people to cast as Lauren's friends (Audrina admitted that she was cast to play the "friend" roll" and was discovered while sitting at a pool).  LA is so ethnically diverse and it's a shame that MTV chooses to keep "The Hills" all "white".  What do you think?



</question>



<additional details>



Oh and let's not forget that there aren't any overweight people on the show either !  So unrealistic !



It's a known fact that the hills is scripted and fake.  Even Lauren admitted that they sometimes have to re-do scenes.  It is a known fact that Audrina was "discovered" while sitting along side a pool and asked if she wanted to be on a show called "the hills".



Well I do wonder why their places of employment are all "caucasian" too and when they go out to eat the other people eatting in the restaurant are all caucasian and when they go shopping everyone in the store who is shopping is caucasian too.  Just a coincidence?  Yeah right.

To Amy L: A lot of reality shows are staged (for plot purposes).  However, there are genuine stuff that happens in terms of relationships/interactions with people.  Especially for those long/dating shows, they were all casted /chosen, usually, they know each other, etc.  (a customer of mine was casted a few years back and told me all about it)

So in this case, Audrina could have been casted off to be Heidi's friend.  Get the drift?  Or if given the benefit of the doubt, she happens to be Heidi's first LA friend right off the first episode ;)  I still like The Hills though, but I don't take it seriously.  LOL.

So you can't take "reality television" very seriously.  Because honestly, if they did actually have a genuine "reality show", it would be boring.  The demand for reality TV is so high that they have to make "themes" for certain episodes, etc.  For example, Run's House (and for every other show), they have themes (hence its staged for storyline purposes) but they are genuine in terms of how they react and personal issues are true too.

cause i dont think thats possible..
she wasnt friends with lauren off the bat
they met through heidi and spencer who've been friends for a long time before lauren came in.

and maybe its cause lauren is just surrounded by white people
i mean i never really see any asians working around at teen vogue or ..peoples generation?. so work place could of contributed to that diversity thing.

Animal cruelty or art?



What was your reaction to reading the news that the crew at Eastenders had to put down a healthy dog recently to film the 'Wellard death' scene? The Daily Mail seemed to take the view that this was a necessary act to get the mood right for the scene, both for the viewer and also so the child actors crying was realistic. I disagree however and take the view that this was an appalling act of animal cruelty.

If the children are professional actors, they should be able to cry on cue. You are taught in theater class to think of your saddest memory and you can usually cry right on cue.

Killing a healthy dog is totally unnecessary.

How is killing a living thing art? It's animal abuse. The dog did not have a choice I'm sure it wanted to live. That person should be in jail. I'm sure they could have taught the dog to play dead. My cat plays dead all the time. Next time they should use their head before taking a live. It's not just an animal it has a family and feelings too.

Have they buried Bernie Mac yet?



I wish they would get to it, so we could find something else to read about. I like the guy and thought he was a great comic, but he's been in the news for 2 weeks. Carlin was much better and only in the news for a couple of days.

carla conner who was married to liam conners bro but he died in accident on the show but she's in love with Liam even though he's married Maria. They had a fling. Rosie took a pict of them 2 whilst he was still meant to be with Maria. I think the truth will eventually come out if Carla doesn't sort out Rosie's family problemos coz  Tony's ruined it all for them financially.

Well I used to deal in clearance dvds so perhaps I can give a fair estimate. Friends are published by Warner Bros who nearly always over manufacture. This will be a huge seller. However by next year every Friends fan will have bought it, so then you are trying to sell it to people who just want a bargain and are more price concious. If i had to make a guess my estimate would be £50 in the shops next year, possibly £25-£30 on Amazon, Play etc. £20 second hand on Ebay. Certainly don't buy it as an investment

It was a curate's egg - good in parts!
Davis crammed too much in. He tried to pull together everything from all his earlier series and the result was a mess. Too many characters having too little time - The whole Rose thing could have been so much better handled.
And the plot itself was just silly
But it had it's moments. The confrontation between Davros and the Dr was excellent. And the fate of Donna was heart-wrenching.
Dr Who fans owe thanks to R T Davis for getting the timelord back on the telly, but it is perhaps a good thing that he is handing over to Moffat, who has written some of the best episodes so far.

NOTE: ****SOME "JOUNEY'S END" SPOILERS!!!*** BELOW!

RTD has never once claimed to be doing Doctor Who for the fans.
It was all about what he thought the Doctor would be like at this point in time, under these circumstances. 
I personally agreed with him that the Doctor should be: 
1. Intimidating (hello -- TIME LORD!)
2. Frightening and Menacing (genocidal/race-ending TIME LORD.)
3. Angry and Bitter (look out enemies of Earth and the Universe!)
4. Alone (Last of his kind. Period.)
It's true he needs individuals; admirers and companions to help and support him, otherwise how could we even hope to relate to the Doctor except through them?



***But, yah... I was disappointed mostly. Donna's loss was just heartbreaking. It somehow made me feel horrible. I didn't mind the Regeneration - thought it was rather innovative.



HOWEVER, then the Doctor goes and gives Rose the Regen10 version of himself. I mean, it made sense... gah!!  I'll reconcile myself someday that it was a good idea - but it still bugs me!***

Everything just felt forced and compressed to me (oh no, feel an analogy coming on...) it was like I was being chased by that snowball rolling down the mountain getting bigger and bigger, crushing everything in its wake... I eventually just jumped out of the way and let it roll past to crash to the bottom, destroying the ski lodge and exploding when it hit the village.

(Some of the members of our DW group are still depressed despite going to ComicCon and listening to Steven Moffatt's DW panel.) It's all about "change", apparently.

You can actually view full episodes of Passions at http://s9.zetaboards.com/CraneEstate/ind... I don't recall how far back they are posted however, I can tell you for sure the last few weeks are definitely there.

But if you would like to know how it ended I'll give the Reader's Digest Version. Tabitha sacrificed her powers to save the residents of Harmony after they were poisoned by Vincent & Vicky. Four weddings took place over the course of the last 2 weeks as Mount Harmony started to erupt. Gwen & Rebbecca were finally exposed for everything they did to Ethan. Theresa revealed Little Ethan's true paternity. Antonio came back from the dead. Then to save Harmony from the volcano Tabitha had to be baptized. The show ended with one final wedding... Ethan & Theresa.

Um actually Passions was the lowest rated soap opera. It was very popular among teenagers but of course school was a top priority among other things so the ratings were always low during the school year and even the summer they didn't bother catching up. with so much drama involved within the soap operas if it still interested them. Why it was pulled the plug is way beyond your power. It's an NBC thing. It had a LONG time coming. Just ask all the other NBC soap operas that was on during the 70s, 80s and 90s other than Days of our Lives but even that will soon be given the boot. I'm not surprised because all of their storylines were so wacky...mermaids and witchcraft come on. It can't get any better than this.

"Passions" was the lowest rated soap opera on TV, but I don't know the real reason why NBC pulled the plug and moved it to DirecTV despite establishing a cult following among younger viewers. In the finale, Tabitha was baptized in a volcano. Theresa learns Ethan is Little Ethan's real father. Antonio returns from the dead. Theresa and Ethan finally tied the knot. And everyone lives happily ever after.

BB nicole may not be up this wk?



Does anyone want nicole to be up?

Rex is sleeping in bblock with kat, darnell, mo and rach and is trying to influence them in not nominating nicole. he is using emotional blackmail saying he she goes I go, knowing very well that kat adores him.



when has rex ever had time for them isn't it a coincidence that it is nomnation day tomorrow mmmmm

he also said that nicole doesn't want to be evicted on her own as she is scared. he said that nicole will like to be in hte final with him and dont mind going out on her own then.



he is also influecing them to nominate lisa and sara

will the plan work? ( i hope not)

i hope darnell doesnt fall into the trap because he always said that he wouldn't sacrifice the originals over the newbies.

I'm watching it right now too. I think Rex is influencing them into doing it without knowing that he's doing it. Rex isn't really that sneaky so i doubt he'd do it on purpose. I'm not sure about Rex, i hate him when he's with Nicole but away from her he's alright. I just hate Nicole.

Anyway, Darnell to win!!

rex doesnt even care about nicole lol hes such a pig.. i can bet ANYTHING that if she got evicted, he would stay in the house. If it was the other way round though she would probably leave because shes such a wuss =P  I didnt see BB tonight but i can totally believe that Rex would try and influence the others - I hope it doesnt work though because Nicole herself is doing my head in, and the arguments are just irritating haha.. I hope Nicole and Mohamed go up because I dont care which goes out of them two =P

i really hope she is not in the finals that would be ridiculous if she was,

Oh I so hope it all backfires on him African Queen because I couldn't bear it if him and Nicole were in the final - I think I would stop watching.  Let's hope he has his immunity stripped from him for trying to influence the nominations but knowing how BB fixed it for him to win HOH I doubt it will happen.  It has GOT to be one of them going this week and it can't be Rex!

Firefly! If I could only resurrect one show, that would be my pick, cause even with Serenity, I still have a whole bunch of unanswered questions (mostly regarding Shepherd Book and the freaky 'hands of blue' guys).



Also:
-Invader Zim
-Arrested Development
-Star Trek: TOS (of course, it wouldn't quite work NOW, but I'd like it if there were more than 3 seasons!)
-MST3K
-X-files... but Fringe looks similar enough to satisfy my supernatural-tv-show craving for now.
-Stargate SG-1, but as it was in seasons 4-8, those were the best. It went downhill fast after RDA left. The movies look promising, at least.

And, it would have been on this list a while back, but they actually DID bring it back: Doctor Who =D

He does, and he is trying to turn the housemates against her so that if she does come out and say it, that they wouldn't believe her!

Hopefully she does say it though because the reaction from the housemates would be soo funny, and think of the interrogation, Rex would leave in shame and Nicole would be chucked out for rule-breaking aww if only we could control that girl's mind!
Well I would slap Rex
And tell the housemates
And then laugh at him in his retched state

I think that in the end, BB will have to just TELL her to confront him....
because she's not smart enough to work out that they want her to do it without taking any of the blame for it from the press/media..

... is she dumb or what..

What is the title and artist of the song on episode 1 series 1 of Gavin and Stacey, when they are in the bar??



It's a dance kind of song, and it's playing when they are knocking back shots.

Can anyone help?



</question>



<additional details>



It's not one of the songs on that list, it's a dance song sung by a woman, think one of the lines has the words "calling..begging". It's on episode 1 of series 1, when Gavin, Stacey, Smithy and Nessa are in a bar drinking after Gavin and Stacey have just met, and Gavin and Stacey kiss and Nessa and Smithy do too

i liked it, but i think they should have kept ben shephard on the xtra factor, kate thornton as the main host and just the three judges, sharon, simon and louis. cheryl doesnt have enough experience and danniis annoying. it used to be so much better, like in Leonas year.

the trouble is its been done so many times, its gotten old its not funny cos we've seen it, we've seen the stupid singer who is off their head and thinks they can sing but really cant.

we know that at the end of the day even if a singer gets through they'll get chucked off and even whoever wins they'll get forgotten about.

i mean where is last years winner even....what was his name?

I'm soooo bored with the sob stories. Every week the sad music comes on (instantly we know the person has got through) and then we hear about poor Beilnda (or whatever her name is) and how she struggled bringing up little Timmy on her own while all her friends got nice jobs and oh she's so sad but sometimes she sings while doing the washing up and her mum thinks she can sing really well and she really,  really wants this more than anything.



It's so formulaic and I hate it.

I was disappointed with the first episode because it is the same now as all the other series.... There isnt much new now.... I prefer B.G.T

But i think what did it for me was that Sharon wasnt there... she was the best.... but i will keep watching .... It might improve as it goes through... but for me ... i tend to stop watching when they go into the live finals unless there is one talent that i think is really good like last year i watched because Nikki was awesome and i liked Rhydian because he had the Love to Hate factor!!! lol



But no your not on your own!!!

I think he did it to make sure that we the public dont get the chance to forget him. the little git. I mean, I havent heard mention of him for a while now... he seems to have been thrown from the public eye really fast since he came out the house doesnt he? I hated him when he was in there, I still remember him and I still hate him now.

And yes youre right re the daughter...sounds like she will get her nose firmly pushed out of line if those two marry. OMG Imagine having them two as parents...its sickening!!!!!!!

Karley he didn't write that to Lisa but to the general public to big himself up.  She didn't believe the crap he wrote anyway did she because she showed no emotion and had a bit of a smirk on her face into the bargain!  As you say she could have had a letter from her daughter - it would have meant more I think.

Jessie has never been very appealing to me he is all about himself and his looks. But he did get a little hotter on Sunday's episode when Michelle was trying to hang on the wall so they would not be in danger and he showed all the emotion for what she was going through. There might be more to Jessie than mets the eye I hope so.

Yeah I think this is his week to go...
He might be hotter if he wasnt so arrogant and a little baby..
But have to admit he really did stir things up in the house...
We shall have to wait and see Thursday should be interesting turn in the house when he does go...
Enjoy

hi, look a couple of weeks ago there were rumors about a 7th season, but it's not a fact, apparently mark sign with the CW for another season (and that Will be great), but nobody confirm that yet, maybe they are waiting to see what will happen with the season 6 premiere. The actors are really involve in the show because paul johansen it's directing a couple of episodes, and Joy and Chad too, and Chad also write and episode 6x13. I hope i help you

This question was asked yesterday.

Wearing nail varnish doesn't make you gay, it happens to be quite popular with a lot of men at the moment. It goes with his tattooed on eyeliner. It's because the "adrogynous look" is coming back into fashion.



I would have thought it was quite clear he was heterosexual and why does it matter to everyone so much, anyway?

Bring on the thumbs down!

Edit: Also, they all dyed their hair pink the other week. No one questioned the sexuality of almost every male housemate then. He's probably just bored.

No hes not hes just in touch with his femanine side, guys that are straight and take pride in their appearance by wearing nail varnish and keeping themselves really well groomed are known as metrosexuals also if they show a really sensitive side. David Beckham is a perfect example. I would love to marry both Stu and David Becks lol.

I know lads that wear nail varnish. I think Stu wears eyeliner too. It's just a sort of "emo/goth" phase. Plus, he has a daughter, so I presume he is straight. Plus, he was really attracted to Jen.

i have not heard of "girly" bumbells but im gathering you mean the ones with little weight?
in which case save your money and use canned food if you are at home, using a large can of beans  not dumbells will help define muscle in women. or just go to most sports shops and ask for small weights suitable for women.

Um screwed is not a rude word when you use it in that context. It's only rude when you use it like "Yeah I screwed that guy last night". A builder can say "I screwed the screw up tighter" and it's not rude. If you say someone has screwed something up it's definately not swearing.

He has sworn and he used the *f* word too. When Stu poured water on him and Bex when they were in bed (before Bex went out into the garden to do some semi-naked pirouettes), he picked up the teddy thing of the floor and said "look f-ing (whatever its name is, it also begins with 'f') is soaked" before getting back into bed. I think that was the show shown on Monday night.

He was fired from Corrie for telling everyone in a pub the outcome of the Tracy/Charlie storyline and for bad  mouthing his cast mates.  They say he will never be allowed to step foot on the Street again.  On the show he is supposed to be touring with Status Quo as a roadie.

He is currently performing stand up comedy in Benidorm. On 23 March 2008, Jones featured in Celebrity Wife Swap with Sinitta.

Asian Dramas (Romantic Comedies)...?



Can anyone make suggestions on other Asian dramas were a female is after the male (for any reason; love, revenge, etc.) but he isn't interested or appears not to until she grows on him and they hook up at the end.... Getting together at the end is a must! Main male character being gorgeous is a must ^-^

I am looking for dramas like 'My Girl' or "Full House' or "It Started With a Kiss (1&2)' or 'Goong' or 'Coffee Prince' or 'My name is Kim Sam Soon' or 'Seducing Mr. Perfect'



What's already on my list is:
Fated to Love You
Bull Fighting 
Why Why Love
Sweet Relationship
Hana Yori Dango
Corner With Love
Smiling Pasta

I prefer high schoolers up to age 35. More on the younger side.

I do not want an 'overly' sad one where there's a bad ending.

Hello,

(ANS) This is a much wider problem than just the "cops" program your talking about, repeats are a problem with ALL TV companies and TV channels.

**Repeats = cheap or cheaper

**Original TV programs of any kind or original TV programs that are commissioned = expensive.

**and TV series from the USA = extra cheap

**Repeats are a method commonly used by the BBC to fill in large gaps in the daily TV schedule, the worst is Saturday evening (in fact its so bad & TV programs on Saturday evening are frankly appalling I almost stopped watching. Its brain numbingly bad). Its cold comfort to see that even if I had SKY & a 1,000 channels I wouldn't be any better off.

**I think standards have slipped badly what oh!!

Ivan.

Yup!  I used to quite like him before I saw how he treated the woman "he adores", and have you noticed how every time he and Nicole have an argument (every time they look at each other really...) he'll have a go at someone else?  Eugh, he's a nasty piece of work!

When he is out, I want him to appear on The Weakest Link and see how he copes in front of Anne Robinson.  Nicole is too dim to appear in the show.

I did actually quite like him at first, and part of me still does, but since Nicole has come in, its not done him any favours, ok, a lot of it is his own fault, but what I mean is that before she arrived, his arrogance and boasting was all quite tongue in cheek, but now he comes across as a control freak too, thats not a good image.  I can understand his irritation with Rachel, she really annoys me too, she is like a kids entertainer, always happy! happy happy!



But in my opinion he was more likeable before Nicole arrived.

He is a bit of a twat when his slapper is around, but at least he tells Mikey what he thinks of the screaming tosser, and puts Rachel, the dullest fat arsed non-entity ever born, down all the time. Always fun to watch that.

Although he can be a bit too blunt at times, he's still likeable for some reason.  He's different with Nicole though - he acts really soft with her.  I think he's way too good for her.

she jumped into bed with Stu and made a big deal about it and then when Darnell skulked off to the living area she came through to persuade him everything was ok but he was too embarrassed by then.  He didn't want to go back through to the luxury bedroom so he jumped over the divide into hell and tried to go to sleep, big brother called him to the diary room and made him go back to heaven where he still wouldn't go into the bedroom he just sat on the sofas.  I think BB will punish him in tonights episode for crossing the divide.

well sarah was wearing a t-shirt with a heart on
and they were fooling around on the floor
then Darnell said to her 'so u need some love in that place'
then she said 'omg darnell..' then she got into bed with Stu
and asked 'do u think he thinks i fancy him?' anyway stu said no one thinks sarah fancies darnell - and darnell does not fancy sarah.

then darnell went to sleep in the lounge because he felt unconfortable
then he jumped over the wall into hell 
and went and slept in hell
until big bro called.
then it ended with him sat on heavens couch

sara said " OMG darnell i can't believe u just did that"
the he went in the toilet saying " i didn't know what i was saying until i said it "
Then stu was saying "what did he say? " so she called dale over and told them both. Then because Darnell and Sara sleep together in the same bed Sara said to stu " Stuart can i come and sleep in your bed for a bit he's gonna feel me up ! " stu said " he's not gonna fell you up "

sara keeps asking stu if he thinks darnell fancys her and stuff .

The CW is the American network station that makes OTH and has therefore the right to show it first. The 6th season will begin on the CW at 9pm (America time) 1st September. 
Of course it will be on the Internet I watched the whole of season 5 on the net and finished watching it ages before E4 started to boardcast (why do they wait so long? Eurgh)
I recommend trying surfthechannel or other sites afternoon our time on Tuesday 2nd September and you'll most probably see it available for viewing. Hope this help, couldn't really understanding what you were asking.

No way do I believe her!
She has been pr1ck teasing all the guys throughout her time in there and has made a bee line mostly for Darnell, more so since he was saved last Friday!

Nicole is the Mole.  Mark will win.  Craig is a toss-up, but he just seems to genuine to be the Mole.

Nicole actually sabotaged the most missions and some missions she didn't have to sabotage because other players were so bad at them that they lost the money.

Mark wants to win more than anybody.  He's genuine and is definitely not the Mole.

I was blind all along thinking that Nicole was the mole and now I point my finger to Craig. The mole's journal online says it all:



http://abc.go.com/primetime/themole/inde...

This last episode he said he wanted to start his own business and it said that in the journal. There are also many other clues in the journal that cost the winner $75,000.



Craig in fact is the mole. He breaks too many rules during games talking when he is not supposed to.

Nicole can't be the mole although she has been my number one suspect for a few weeks. There has been a woman winner for the last mole seasons and I think this year they want to make it a man.

Mark works too hard on his missions for him to be the mole. He does have unusual behavior sometimes like when his journal was burnt which caused me to believe he was over reacting. But I would think that being a teacher would be enough to provide for his family because the whole my wife has to work two jobs just didn't sound right to me. (Winner)

All these players have played a good game because at one time or another I was suspecting them to be the mole more than anyone.

<answer>



Here is my prediction....Nicole is the winner, mark is the runner up and Craig is the mole...

Here are some reasons why i think that Craig is the mole...

The first online clue was E_E_E_. (ElEvEn)?
-Craig was born in November. He is also the 11th player in the opening.

There was a clue on an advertisement, "I lie with my eyes."
-Craig wears glasses. In some episodes he doesn't...

In the first episode, they ride to the Robinson Crusoe misson on a boat based on Alexander Selkirk. With some research, you find that he was actually born Alexander Sellcraig. ahem

In the opening of every episode from 2 on, Craig is the only one that had the word "Age" in front of his age. Check it out.

The second text clue was: heart
That could mean "earth" which is mentioned in Craig's online profile. 
It could also point to his humanitarian work he's done in the past.

In the pig mission, Craig's team brought back 0 pigs.

When a woman said in Spanish that Bobby should eat something when they had to find their clothes, Craig understood and told him what she said. If he understands Spanish, why didn't he help find pigs in that mission?

In the Fruits of the Luge mission, Craig and Victoria continued going over the order after the finish line. Jon told them on many occasions that was not allowed. This disqualified his team, putting no money into the pot. They got all of them right, which ended up taking $14,000 out with their disqualification.

In week 4, Craig had to be hospitalized after the mountain mission. This left him absent from dinner where Jon took all the journal's and read quotes out of them. (We wouldn't want the mole's journal being read out load now would we?) Craig's journal also doesn't get his journal burned.

In the week 5's mission in the jail, the letters "CRG" has be plainly seen behind Mark in a couple of shots.

In the mission where Craig was selected to order what each person wore, Jon hold's up two bills with the number 5 as he says 5.5 miles.
Craig has 5 letters in his name.

Isn't it strange how Craig happened to say "exemption" to get an exemption?

Craig tried to sabotage the mission on the mission in week 7 multiple times. He tried to mess up Nicole's count, tried to waste time by telling the guys to wait for Nicole to come back with the correct tile count when they were on the birnk of figuring out the pattern of the the code. He gives the wrong answer when Clay asks what 89+144 is. Craig also waits until the very last minute to enter the code in. Lots of moley activity there.

Keep in mind that Craig is the only player that has never been given his results in an execution.

That would be a very controversial theme but bearing in mind the  recent stories in austria it could be possible. However more than likely it is his fault she had to give up the baby but not anything more than that.

I was thinking that actually. Although Ronnie is a very strong and straight forward woman. If Archie raped her when she was a teenager, she would probably be all quiet and depressed. And when she was arguing with him about her daughter in his house, she would have said something like "YOU RAPED ME!" or something like that so I don't think he did. She would have told Roxy about it anyway, maybe even Peggy. I can see why you thought that though, I thought the same.x

I do think that Archie abused her. He didn't father Amy as he said something to Ronnie about lying on her back for some spotty oik (sp?) so that seems to suggest that he wasn't the dad!

if he is leaving it has not been officially announced yet. as far as i know his suicide attempt is not successful so hopefully it will be the cry for help that gets his problems noticed and he can get some help with his anger management.

on this list he is still in the cast list, if you scroll down it tells you all the characters that are leaving. jo sugden and matthew king are both leaving at the end of the year.

Joy is not even funny,she thiks she is, who goes to watch her comedy anyways?  I think Joy is so ugly.. Whoppi won one Oscar a long, long time ago and I think it was because they felt sorry for her..

That show is done. I agree with you that Elizabeth should get her own show.  Barbara Walters should be ashamed of what she wrote in her book. She is so old, I don't know why she is still on TV. Joy could not even get her own show. Only Larry King, and who watches him??. Who is the other one? whop what, I don't know her at all. I know she came out in a movie called Ghost and that was it.. The show is so dumb.. This show is watched by house wives, do you think this house wives want to hear stupid politics, and Lady's who don't  know what the heck they are doing on TV in the first place.. I can't wait till it goes out the air..  I hate it.. None of my friends watch that so called "show"

Try to check out 'www.tvshack.net' or 'surfthechannel.com', I don't think the show is with English subs, but if they are english-talking, I guess you understand it well enough. But if they aren't, you can allways download the show here 'torrentz.com', you also need 'bitlord' or something to download the torrent. Then you just find English subs on the net, 'opensubtitles.com' for example. Run the vid eith 'VLC', then after extracting the subtitle, you just drag it into VLC-screen. enjoy :)

What does everyone else think of the Sex Education Show on Channel 4?



I think its about time a programme like this is put on tv. I think everyone can learn something from it. However I do think it should be shown at 9pm (the watershed) rather than 8pm, when some young children (ie 7/8yr olds) are up at this time.

At last - maybe this upcoming generation will learn something from this programme.

It sent the message across very nicely i thought, and clarified some issues for people as well without being crude.

Congrats to channel 4.

I totally 100% agree it should be shown after 9 - wayyy too graphic!  However, I'm 20 and I sat and watched it with my mum n dad, we laughed at some bits, but spoke seriously about others.  I think it gives young people the confidence to talk to their parents about it.



I wasn't embarrassed.  I think its extremely educational (and I already thought I knew it all! ha!)

I agree with this, especially for parents who wants to educate their children about sex , at the right age. It is a freedom of choice whether to watch it or not. As long as the parents agreed with this.

I think its good but of all the silly thinks that get complained about these days i'm surprised this hasn't been yet, it's quite revealing for an early evening programme.

EDIT: Just read some answers, I think it should be shown in schools because as someone else said it would most benefit teenagers and how many of them will be in watching TV at 8. They'll be roaming the streets getting drunk.

Who knows with those two. They lie to each other all the time. He is still keeping his Jabot secret from her. When is he going to tell her about that? The marriage is made on lies and false securities. Nick and Sharon will eventually get back together(I think). Phyllis and Jack deserve each other two peas in a pod. And why hasn't Sharon had any children by Jack? Is she still able to conceive?

Hopefully Sharon will go get a job and stop hanging on to Nick and Jack's coattails. Jack will go find a hot sexy woman and live happily ever after without PSS (post-Sharon stress)!

I like Jack/Sharon together, but I believe that they will break up. They may mend their relationship now, but it's a soooooap. I can see her getting back together with Nick; they were together first and were a major couple. People were also upset when they broke up.

Anything is possible though. Y&R has shown us that before!

I do think that Jack and Sharon will break up sooner than later but I don't see her and Nick getting back together I also disagree when everyone says they want to see them back together they are such a boring couple. In due time I believe Sharon will end up with Bradley just b/c there connection was so strong.

Jack's pride wont be able to take it anymore. Him and Sharon will separate. Why can't Jack find a girl that likes him for him? If the writer's did it for Kevin, surely they can find a mate for Jack.

It sure seems as though the story line is headed for Sharon & Nick to get back together, but I sure hope not!

I don't really care for Jack & Sharon together, there really doesn't seem much chemistry there and Sharon just seems to be way out of her league with Jack!
But, I do love Nick with Phyllis, they are great together and do have a lot of chemistry between them!
They just seem so relaxed with each other and can be serious when they need to, but have fun together when they don't!

Unfortunately, my prediction is that it will come out that Jack is really Summer's baby and Nick knew all along which will probably break Nick and Phyllis up and Sharon will be there waiting with open arms for Nick.
It wouldn't surprise me either if soon after Nick & Sharon hook up, Sharon will find out she's pregnant with Jack's baby.
All that would really shake things up for the four of them and for Noah and Summer!

Anyone seeking to write a new comedy?



I am currently writing a comedy script which i will be filming a pilot episode once finished..I have shown my ideas and have done a little part of the script and people say that they think its a great concept and i should push myself to do this comedy.I have done acting for over 18 months and have done numerous tv/film work but writing a programme is what i have always wanted to do.I also have a few contacts at the bbc, from when i did acting, who said they would help me push the pilot forward once i have shot it.

The thing is, i feel i would be much better working with someone else with the writing part, as most people i know just are not capable of writing the comedy down professionally.

Anyone who would be interested,please let me know by leaving your email.

thanks



Rob.

The only concern I would have on Rose's behalf was the Doctor did seem to have some of Donna's character in it........or was he just messing about!!  I had a good blub I have to admit, but I know what Rose meant about it still not being him though.  She was told the doctor she was left with was the doctor she changed, now she's going to have to do it all again!!  I think I'd feel a bit cheated left with a duplicate David Tennant!!!

Wow!! Wow!! An amazing episode. I loved every moment of it. I thought it was the best one since the finale of season 2 (when Rose first becamed trapped in the parallel universe).

I'm glad I recorded it and watched it on DVD because there were several bits which I needed to rewind & rewatch to figure out, such as how & why the 2nd doctor appeared, the reason for Khan going mad, the reason for Donna becoming half Time Lord. Some things weren't explained properly such as the doctors words to Doctor-Donna "A human Time-Lord metacrisis has never happened." Huh?! Guess it was one of those jargon things you're not meant to make sense of though I usually try to, and sometimes they do make sense!



Unlike some other people, I didn't think that the daleks were destroyed too quickly & easily. It was done with a twist and in a way which tied a lot of loose ends together. I found it gave a sense of completion about a lot of things. The daleks were destroyed because the 2nd doctor built the reality bomb invertor device and pointed it at Davros' DNA. As Davros used his DNA to create the daleks this meant that the destructive power of the dalek's reality bomb was  redirected at dalek DNA instead of away from the dalek's location (the crucible) and toward the whole of the rest of existence. Just at the point at which the invertor was needed there was only Donna available to use it. At that moment Davros shot her with the energy weapon and inadvertantly "switched on" the time lord in her thus giving her the knowledge to use the invertor.



At that point all the comments of the past few episodes about there being something different about Donna, reality bending around her, her destiny with the doctor, all timelines converging on her, were explained. She saved all of reality by operating the reality bomb invertor. It was a perfect!!



I thought Donna needing to forget everything was terribly tragic, but if the writers want to bring Donna back I'm sure they'll find a way.

The one thing that does bug the hell out of me is what the Doctor did to Rose. I think that was a big cop out so that Billie Piper wouldn't have to play a big part in future episodes. If the Doctor had loved her, as we've found out over the episodes that he does, then he would want to be with her as much as she with him. She has spent all this time fighting through dimensional walls and searching for him. Now he's using the excuse that the 2nd doctor is dangerous because he destroyed all of the Daleks (commited genocide which is an abhorrent thing to the Doctor) and so needs to be watched. Why does that mean that Rose HAS to go back to her universe? The 2nd Doctor could have been watched in our universe. He could have been left with Unit; they would have LOVED to have his expertise at close hand. If the Doctor had really wanted to be with Rose then he would have tried harder to find a way. And, the 2nd doctor is NOT the same as the main one because he's half Donna. Big cop out. It's been bugging me ever since I saw the episode.

Except for that - PURE MAGIC. ;-)

That was my biggest disappointment.  I know I'm a bit girly when it comes to the romance thing, but I couldnt believe the doctor could just leave Rose, as said when she had travelled so far.  It wasnt him it was a clone!!  That was my issue with it, but reading all the answers I agree it was rushed.

Actually, I rather quite liked it. Nice to have all the old faces (Rose, Sarah-Jane, Captain Jack etc) all together for the first time. It did seem a little below par, I mean the duplicate and all that, WTF?? but overall not a bad episode, although not one of the best by any means.

No - i thought it was really cleverly done and quite sad at times but also funny. I was glad rose got her doctor and i think that it was a good ending to the series. Sometimes they talk so quickly though i cant understand a word they were saying. I kept expecting his daughter - you know the blond one to turn up because that darleck man kept talking about his children

I hate to say it but actually, yes, I was.  It was a great episode, very enjoyable to watch, David Tennant was his usual brilliant self and yes it was nice to see all the companions united but.....



it seemed that after all the hype and all the build up to this almighty showdown with Davros and the daleks that it was all over really quickly in the end.



I thought it would take more than a single shot from Jack to destroy the Supreme Dalek and Donna becoming half Timelord, gaining all that power and intellect and destroying the entire dalek fleet by flicking a few switches....... wasn't that just a little too similar to Rose absorbing energy from the TARDIS in 'The Parting of the Ways' and destroying the daleks with a wave of her hand???  The Doctor's solution to getting rid of the daleks and cybermen in 'Doomsday' was much more satisfying.

And speaking of Rose - she got the best deal she could realistically have hoped for - she's in love with the Tenth Doctor and she gets to spend the rest of her life with basically the Tenth Doctor in semi-human form, he won't regenerate and he'll stay with her forever and the woman is STILL POUTING!!!!

Then there was Dalek Caan's prophecy that one of the companions would die.  For the entire season we've had all the not-so-subtle hints about Donna and then there was endless speculation after Dalek Caan's prediction in 'The Stolen Earth' about which companion would die but instead we just get this nice, neat little fairy tale ending?? I really liked Donna and I would have been sad to see her die but for dramatic purposes I think Russell T Davis should have followed through on that particular story line.  Wasn't the ending of 'Last of the Timelords' even more dramatic with the death of the Master? Even though I was surprised and shocked that the Master seemed to be completely dead once and for all - it had a much better dramatic impact and the series finale was all the better for it.

I love Doctor Who, I really do, so I'll watch the finale repeat again tonight and see if maybe I'm being too critical : )

I loved it but feel that RTD is rushing things these days, like at the end when they all parted very quickly Sarah-Jane just ran off!!  And if Micky can stay in this universe and it doesn't upset the world order, why didn't Rose stay?  In doomsday she made the choice to stay with him rather than her family.
And the darleks it ended a bit quick.
Wonder what spacephamtom will say.!!!

I loved every minute of it.

There was just one thing that i thought could have been done better.

That's the whole "real Doctor" and Rose thing. I mean if he loved her (which we found out he really did) like he would just put her back in the parallel dimension where he could never see her again.

It just felt a little rushed, he said goodbye then left without even looking back, surely he should have at least put her in his dimension or i don't know fought his clone thing for her, lol.

Apart from that feeling a little rushed/off i thought it was the best episode i've seen.

I think this episode just didn't match up to last weeks too much to resolve even in the extented time, RTD has done so much as far as bringing DW back but he isn't the best of the writers that have worked on the last 4 series.

I think there should have been another episode tbh the Daleks were so easlily defeated it was unbelievable.

Two David Doctors this was such a naff un-orginal idea, most of us knew this would happen last week!

Donna's methaphorical death well delt with it was really sad when she saw the doctor and had no clue to all they had seen!

As for Rose, what the full Time Lord Doctor did for her proved he loved her, the guy let her go with his clone because he knew that way she could have a proper life with him, he sacrificed his own happiness for her!

All in all I liked the episode but it wasn't the greatest, others in the last 4 seasons have outshone this one

If it was Rex, Darnell, or Mo on the other side then I would have taken, because they probably would have taken because they're greedy, especially greedy mo. Darnell cares about no one but himself, and rex, well is there anything good about rex, hmm. I'd rather have nothing than see one of them get a penny.

However, if it was Rach, Lisa or Sara on the other side I would share because I think they are genuinly nice generous people.

I'm so sick of Stefano Dimera always getting away with every damn thing.  I wish he would for once just stay dead. That's one reason why I'm starting to not watch Days anymore the story line go on and on with no end in sight the same basic story has been going on for 10 or more years OMG get new writers Geeezzzz boring

You had me a bit confused there for a minute, but then I figured out that by Loulls, you mean Lowell's.
That aside though, I am sure we are going to be seeing a lot more of Lowell, they had to have had him and Michael finally meet for a reason.

According to my Cable Guide Lowell is supposed to "get caught" on Friday, whatever that means.
Not sure if that means he gets caught by someone that knows he killed those people and they are after him for revenge or if it means that the law catches up with him.

If it is someone that is after him, they just may kidnap him and go after Michael for some money, and you may be right, maybe Kevin will somehow get mixed up in all this and get kidnapped right along with him, but whatever happens, I hope they don't kidnap Fenmore!
The way the story lines have been going lately, I would believe almost anything could happen!

My guess is though that it is the law that gets him and he will need Michael to save him from going to jail.
Michael probably won't want to help him, but you know Gloria will talk him into it.

Can't wait to see what really happens, but I hope they don't drag this thing on too long!

funny, but no. It's probably because some poor soul somewhere was getting phone calls from people ranting on about their step sisters brothers cousin being a slapper and stealing their uncles girlfriend. (the number needs to be completely unlike anyones number so if you dial the number wrong it doesn't go through to anyone)

Yes, it was changed to help people remember it.



The number used to be : 09011 40 50 60, but even though the "40, 50, 60" was supposed to be easy enough to remember, it was changed to the 09011 123456 so it was more simple for people to remember!

What's your favorite 70s/80s TV show and why?



I love watching good old TV shows from the 70s and 80s.  They seem to have much more color, style, and creativity than lots of newer shows; along with a refreshingly slower pace.

Did anyone watch Oprah today?



Dr. Oz was on and was telling tips for losing weight. I was just wondering if anyone knows what he said. I looked on Oprah.com, but since they redone the web-site I can't figure it out at all. There was something he said about eating a piece of whole wheat bread before you eat? I don't know. Just wondering if any Oprah viewers caught this or not?

here's a link for Dr Oz on Oprah that talks about it 
http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow...

here's some of what he says eat one slice of 100 percent whole grain bread lightly dipped in non-chemically processed extra virgin olive oil before every dinner. "[The bread has] B vitamins in it. It has fiber, which we've talked about is important for you," he says. "That's all good because it actually slows the movement of food through your stomach."



The olive oil, Dr. Oz says, is a healthy fat. "Remember, healthy fats are the ones that are liquid at room temperature in general, and olive oil has vitamin E in it," Dr. Oz says. "It's got all these cool little chemicals that work as antioxidants. If you combine them together, you're giving yourself wonderful nutrition to feed the liver."



Dr. Oz says this easy, yet powerful, combination will reduce the amount of food you'll eat at dinner and keep your fuller for longer amounts of time. "Dinner's our big meal where we make most of our mistakes," he says. These mistakes can lead to serious consequences, like heart attack or diabetes. Eating whole wheat bread and olive oil can reduce your risk for both, Dr. Oz says. "And you'll probably lose weight to boot."

Why Is The New Promo Page For Jon & Kate Plus 8....?



showing Kate standing in line first.



The new page shows all the family lined up in a single file and Kate is first, then Jon is behind Kate, the twins are behind him and the rest of the kids are behind the twins.

For some reason the page does not look right to me.

Now, I know Kate is shown more on the series, but I think Jon should be shown in line first.  He is the father, he works and he does contribute around the house and he helps out with the kids too.

I think they're just lined up however they're lined up. I don't believe the six are in order either. I can't find the shot you're talking about so I can't be certain, but if I recall correctly, the girls are grouped together and the boys are grouped together. I don't think the order really means anything.

Hopefully it is just that... A Rumor!
I dont want them together. Although since they have put Phylis and Nick together they have become quite boring but I still prefer them together.
The other rumor is that Summer is actually Jack's....Hopefully that is just a rumor also, I dont wanna see that happen.

I figured that's what they were going for, but I hadn't heard anything for sure.  I like Nick and Sharon together, maybe it's just for the fact that I dont like Phyllis.  I think she is good with Jack...backstabbing.  On the other hand, I think Sharon and Brad would be good together...oh i dont know.  I'm just not real crazy about Phyllis...never have been.

I think Nick deserves sooo much better and more than Sharon! He needs a woman who can pull her weight to help him out of his money probs and that ain't going to happen with Sharon because she's just a tag-along wife who can't do nothing for herself and always NEEDS a man to define her!

I just have to say what I think and thats that if someone really really plays the villian like Phyllis did at the beginning when she first started I tend to never really like that person...I know she has come back and made ammends but I still dont like her..I loved Sharon from the beginning and think her and Nick made an adorable couple so I am game for them to get back togather...just my thoughts

Cassie (even though she was adopted) and Noah existed before Summer, and I like him and Sharon together because they don't look right with anybody else, especially when those people are old enough to be their parents. If it wasn't for hot sex anywhere / anytime, Nick wouldn't be feeling Phyllis. Besides, Phyllis looks so ugly and pulled down in the face like an old race horse which is probably why Nick always her kisses with his eyes closed.

The Maury Show... Fake?



Okay so I know that a lot of people think this show is fake, but I always thought it was real.  That was until I saw this guy on Maury.  He was on the show about 4 times becuase he cheated on his wife.  Each time, he cried and cried and said he wanted his wife and he was so sorry.

THEN I saw the same guy on the Jerry Springer show, and he said the same thing... he was cheating on his wife.  But this time, he didn't care what she said, and he was being just a bastard.  Totally opposite from the Maury Show.

I now KNOW that Maury is fake (I already knew Jerry was fake lol)... what do you all think about this?  Do you believe it's fake as well?

Fake. I do think most of the shows on TV are fake or have a strong element of fakery, including the so-called 'unscripted' ones. The bottom line is that the people who produce these TV shows want to make money, and they are not going to put 'reality' on TV because it could be boring and nobody would watch. Whether there's a script or just some person telling the reality stars to create drama, I think it's manufactured.
But good for you for having a critical eye and noticing at least! I think fewer and fewer people notice anymore, lol...
I'll admit to ocassionally still looking at those fakeass shows though for a laugh every now and again though~ ;)

The most detailed exorcisms we've seen used in Supernatural so far are the ones that Sam uses in the season 3 episode 'Jus in Bello' - there were three exorcisms used in that episode:

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica
(This was the first exorcism)

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, et secta diabolica,
Ergo draco maledicte et sectio
Ergo draco maledicte et legio secta diabolica
Ut Ecclésiam tuam secúra tibi fácias servire libertáte, te rogámus, audi nos.
(This was the exorcism for Agent Henrickson)

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica

Ergo, draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adjuramus te,
cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque æternæ perditionìs venenum propinare
Vade, satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciæ, hostis humanæ salutis,
Humiliare sub potenti manu Dei, contremisce et effuge, invocato a nobis sancto et terribili Nomini
quem inferi tremunt
Ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, Domine.

Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus, omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica

Ergo, draco maledicte et omnis legio diabolica, adjuramus te ... cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque æternæ perditionìs venenum propinare

Ut Ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos.
(This is from the mass exorcism at the end)

Here is the official English translation of a Rite of Exorcism - though I don't think the full exorcism was used in Supernatural only bits of it:

I cast you out, unclean spirit, along with every Satanic power of the enemy, every spectre from hell, and all your fell companions; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Begone and stay far from this creature of God. For it is He who commands you, He who flung you headlong from the heights of heaven into the depths of hell. It is He who commands you, He who once stilled the sea and the wind and the storm. Hearken, therefore, and tremble in fear, Satan, you enemy of the faith, you foe of the human race, you begetter of death, you robber of life, you corrupter of justice, you root of all evil and vice; seducer of men, betrayer of the nations, instigator of envy, font of avarice, fomentor of discord, author of pain and sorrow. Why, then, do you stand and resist, knowing as you must that Christ the Lord brings your plans to nothing? Fear Him, who in Isaac was offered in sacrifice, in Joseph sold into bondage, slain as the paschal lamb, crucified as man, yet triumphed over the powers of hell. Begone, then, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Give place to the Holy Spirit by this sign of the holy cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.

Therefore, I adjure you every unclean spirit, every spectre from hell, every satanic power, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who was led into the desert after His baptism by John to vanquish you in your citadel, to cease your assaults against the creature whom He has, formed from the slime of the earth for His own honor and glory; to quail before wretched man, seeing in him the image of almighty God, rather than his state of human frailty. Yield then to God, who by His servant, Moses, cast you and your malice, in the person of Pharaoh and his army, into the depths of the sea. Yield to God, who, by the singing of holy canticles on the part of David, His faithful servant, banished you from the heart of King Saul. Yield to God, who condemned you in the person of Judas Iscariot, the traitor. For He now flails you with His divine scourges, He in whose sight you and your legions once cried out: "What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Have you come to torture us before the time?" Now He is driving you back into the everlasting fire, He who at the end of time will say to the wicked: "Depart from me, you accursed, into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels." For you, 0 evil one, and for your followers there will be worms that never die. An unquenchable fire stands ready for you and for your minions, you prince of accursed murderers, father of lechery, instigator of sacrileges, model of vileness, promoter of heresies, inventor of every obscenity.

Depart, then, impious one, depart, accursed one, depart with all your deceits, for God has willed that man should be His temple. Why do you still linger here? Give honor to God the Father almighty, before whom every knee must bow. Give place to the Lord Jesus Christ, who shed His most precious blood for man. Give place to the Holy Spirit, who by His blessed apostle Peter open

Absolutely not!!!!!  Luke Spencer and Robert Scorpio were so much better than these two.  Really!  Sonny and Jason have spent more time just talking in the office.  Luke and Robert saved the world.
Luke has paired with a few actors here and there and that was much more entertaining than the Mob garbage now.  Frank Smith was dangerous and a long running character.

They have always made such a great team (all the more shame that there is such a rift between them now).  I always thought they were GH's true super-couple in recent years.  LOL.  ;-)  i mean that in a good way, of course.  Here's hoping that a reconcilliation will come soon.  I miss their true-brothers-of-the-heart relationship.  They always had each other's back and GH hasn't felt the same since they parted ways.

Jerry springer episode with christian family?



i remember seeing bits of an episode of Jerry Springer where there was this really weird and offensive uptight christian family consisting of a father (with a beard/facial hair?) and mother and their (dark long haired?) daughter (between 12 and17 years old. very young teen or mature preteen kid). i didn't really watch it  and didn't know what the topic was about but i just remember seeing a few bits of it on TV years ago and the family was saying something to jerry and everyone that they would actually kill Christians or pagans or both or something just because they were not Catholic and following god and jesus. 
And i remember that either Jerry or an audience member was asking the young daughter if she would kill them (or something like that)



And she actually said "yes,(Absolutely) in a instant". Even though i didn't really watch it all and stuff i did find it ridicules and offensive.  Also murder is an actual sin and a crime in law against humanity so i'm not sure how it would pull together entirely for her to commit, and i'm sure wouldn't REALLY want that either cause it just sound pathetic and cruel.



Can anyone tell me the name of the episode, what it was about and what they were saying and all, if possible please?. thanks.

your story sounds like a episode from Tyra banks show she had ignorant people on there that claim to be Christan's but I'm a Christan's and i never heard of the hateful things that these people wanted to do to people, for there beliefs i don't care for the thought of gay people but i would never ever hurt another person i still would love the person but not what they do.everyone has there opinion but some live them out like terrorist, and say there killing for god, that's really sad.

Only predictable because it was Lisa and Sara neither of whom were clever enough to realise the strategy of the game.

If it had been other housemates the result might not have been predictable.

I think Sara will go this week.
And I hope Lisa wins or Rachel.

The task wasn't disappointing one bit. I thought it was great, possibly the two best housemates got the chance to win defenite money. They both thoroughly deserve it. I don't think it was predictable cos there was always the doubt there that one of them possibly could steal, even thought i dont think lisa or sara ever would. it would be a different story if rex and darnell were in there.

i knew no one would vote darnell, he is playing that little confused boy card and has everyone feeling sorry for him, when they have no reason to as he is a nasty agressive person - who is trying very hard to hide who he really is

Going nuclear can either mean something really hot, as in a nuclear bomb; that is, explosive, or "cool" as in "the bomb" meaning good.

"Bully for him" means "Good for him." It could be meant positively or sarcastically.  It's not all that popular a saying these days.

Calum explained it all to his Dad earlier in the programme ;)

He was doing the geek bit, but that didn't work.  Then he said he was going to do the manic depressive, and if that didn't work he would go 'nuclear', and when his Dad asked him what it meant Calum said he would pretend to be into S&M etc, to try scare Danielle off that way :-)

Tanya said to Max that Jack was clearing up after dinner (meaning that Max never did do that) and Max's reply was 'bully for him'.  Just before this convo when Jack and Tanya were in the kitchen Jack was loading up the dishwasher and Tanya said "I can count on one hand the number of times Max ever did that"  etc etc etc  So I think Tanya was just trying to annoy Max by saying Jack was better than him !

Once alone, Jared worries that Natalie is still angry with him, as she's not answering her cell. Although Jared knows she'll be even unhappier to hear that Ray is a murderer, Clint admits that he didn't think Jared could pull it off, leaving Jared to hope it'll all be worth it in the end. While Ray is getting ready, Nigel briefly asks Clint if he should secure the silver, to which Jared reminds, "Clint, I hope you know you asked me to spring a 'lifer'." Suddenly, Ray appears all cleaned up, and Clint doesn't see a need to wait any longer! Clint asks Nigel to show Ray to his limo then says, "Jared, you did good. You're one step closer to making up for what you did to this family." However, Jared can't get Natalie out of his head and leaves for Llanfair
Down in the secret room, Tess brings Natalie some food then says, "I need you to keep up your strength because we have work to do." Though Natalie warns that Jared will wonder where she is, Tess says, "You are going to write Jared a 'Dear John' letter, telling him all of the reasons why you left him!" After Tess reads Natalie the letter she plans to send to Jared, explaining that they've caused too much damage to others to live in happiness themselves, she demands that Natalie copy the letter - or Jared dies! In tears, Natalie is forced to do what Tess asks. Once the letter is written in Natalie's handwriting, Tess points to the television screen and says, "Enjoy the show!"



With Tess now upstairs, joining Tina, Sarah and Jared, Tess explains that she hasn't seen Natalie - but that she found a letter for him in her room! Tess hands Jared the letter, as Natalie watches helpless! As Jared reads the goodbye letter from Natalie, Tina makes eye contact with Tess, who says, "Jared, I am so sorry." Downstairs, Natalie cries, "I love you, Jared… I love you."
When Natalie wakes up in the secret room, she sees Jared standing outside the glass, who tells her, "I love her more than I could ever imagine." Suddenly, Natalie wakes up and realizes she was hearing Jared through the television, telling Tess how much he loves Natalie. Natalie rushes to the screen and says, "Tess, what the hell are you trying to do to us?"



Upstairs, Tess tries to comfort Jared, who has had no luck finding Natalie. "It's like she vanished off the face of the earth," Jared says, to which Tess believes her absence means she doesn't want to be found. Jared refuses to believe that Natalie is hiding from him and says, "Something else is going on here." Frustrated, Jared leaves.



Back in the basement, Natalie begins tearing the room apart - until Tess shows up with Jared's uneaten breakfast. "Here we go," Tess says. "Breakfast of losers!" Though Natalie warns Tess that Jared will not give up on her, and begs for Jessica to come out, Tess says, "Why do I bother going through all this trouble when I should just kill you right now!" Tess then lays out her new plan - to have Natalie be tortured by having to 'watch' Jared move on! "You get to watch Jared fall out of love with you," Tess says, "and in love with me!"



When Jared arrives at the station, he informs John, "It's about Natalie. I think she's been kidnapped!" After John asks Jared some common 'police questions', and reads the letter Natalie left Jared, John suggests that Natalie is not missing - but that she merely broke up with him! However, when Jared asks John to read the letter again, John agrees it's not Natalie's style and says he'll look into it.



Rex and Gigi Have Sex!  Gigi and Rex take time out to consummate their reunion this week.  Gigi leaves the carriage house pissed off because Brody is starting to get psychotic, so she tells him that when she gets back she wants him and all his stuff gone.  Gigi goes to share the news with Rex, who has just called Adriana to request a divorce.  Gigi comes in and says that they are going to tell Shane the truth that day.  Gigi wishes they had some time to celebrate finding each other again.  Rex says that Shane doesn’t get out of school for a few hours and they start kissing.  One thing leads to another, and Gigi finally has sex after 10 years.



Rex and Gigi Make Love!  Gigi and Rex have something important to share with Shane this week, but first they finally make love.  They make love in Adriana’s bed.  Rex and Gigi talk about going to Shane’s school and telling Shane that Rex is his dad, but there is time to spare so they spend a couple of hours making love.  After romantic bouts in the bed and in the shower, the couple goes into parent mode.  Rex dresses in his most appropriate fatherlike outfit.  Gigi and Rex’s trip to school turns out to be a new dad’s worst nightmare.

The office is an awesome show but make sure you don't get it confused with the american one (which is good to). The main guy (Ricky Gervais) can be so embarrassing sometimes you have to cover eyes. It's not the same type of funny as Monty python or faulty towers but that doesn't stop it from being a great show!

Should they ban pathetic sob stories on the X Factor?



I think they should, deeply embarrassing to watch.
Don't you just hate it, when someone has a passable. average Pub/Butlin's voice, and they spill out the tears and pleads, because they have a dying Granny or a handicapped Spas-ars*d Gerbil that won't get better unless Cowell and Co, admits defeat to Human Pain and admit them through?
Bollocks. Me, I'd have a pair of chaps to kick the veritable shite out of these usurpers, the minute they go bleating into the wind about mis-treatment.
Also, as a bonus. . . duff up the cross eyed Parents for bring these Crips kicking and screaming into the World.

They did this last year, at the end of each audition programme, and what a big surprise each one of the sob stories, seemed to manage into the Final TV Show.....seems like a forgone conclusion that we already know who we will be voting off each week, before the live shows have actually started...

yehm I'm getting really sick of hearing the "sob stories" too. The show should be about music and singing talent not hardships in life and people should get through based on their talents alone not their talents in conjunction with a hard life.

We all have difficulties, some more than others but that doesn't give those who've had things hard a right to get through over those who haven't.

It makes good viewing but getting fed up with it however this weeks sob one did not get through UNLESS he comes back for this weeks last auditions show and gets through for trying.
What makes me laugh is the ones who think they can actually sing ha ha

i would love that. i only watch the auditions to see peeps make a fool of themselves! they should do the decent thing and just claim benefits like half of britain. (i could have named a specific region but i sensed a violation and am in the middle of a points war with my brother so could not afford that)
i think if the judges are dumb enough to fall for the ''my mum recently died and i know her dying wish would have been for me to do this, not just for me but for her too so put me through so she can be proud of me from her golden chair next to jesus position'' bolloc*s then they might as well just give them a record deal and let them spend 6 years making an album consisting of themselves screatching in many different tones which might have a top 10 single but thats as far as it goes type of rubbish. i would actuallyt love to be the person that you refer to as kicking the crap out of theese people because its just pointless. lets face it then they would just get a tv show of their own because of their horiffic facial disfigurement!!!
got to go now but i think thats a worthy rant.

New asian family in eastenders?



Zainab Masood........ why does she insist on talking in that ridiculous accent while the rest of her family are speaking with London accents.

She doesnt have that strong an accent as Ive seen her on chat shows etc, and she never spoke with that accent on Goodness Gracious me, only if her character was essentially "Indian".
Why does she do it, its so dumb and annoying!
Her hubbys a bit of alright tho;)
What do you reckon older son is away for? Prison? Marrying a non-Muslim Woman?

i did come up with some ideas..but i need more help.
any help will be appreciated.



</question>



<additional details>



thnxx 4 the previous answers, however i need more original ideas. Also, its not a soap, it has to be a live show, where viewers get to call us on air, so i need some ideas about what kind of show can i create that people(british asians) wil be interested in watching and also be able to interact (call us, for e.g. to answers or ask questions)

i hope my question is clear now! thanks!

there has been a request for authorization to retransmit a free to air channel, from a Vietnamese broadcaster; does this imply that the sought-for authorization needs to be obtained from the government of Vietnam, by the channel, as is the case in many countries, like India?

I watched a show on how jerry springer was set up. People call in with their issues and the people that book them have to find people with really messed up situations so if the callers have a crappy story then of course they wont be chosen. Also they kind of instigate all of the fighting. Before a person goes out on stage the booking people are back there saying all kinds of stuff to get them mad and pumped for stage. So basically its staged with a hint of truth.

I think the episode that you are talking about is called "Back in the Game"
Season 2, Ep 35: Back In The Game: When a wheelchair basketball team visits the Tipton; Zack and Cody try to convince their friend Jamie, who uses a wheelchair, to join them in an exhibition game aganist them. Maddie tries to make a film for a film festival starring some of the Tipton employees, but gets more than she bargained for when she finds out that they are bad actors.

I think the mother has a lot on her plate. Takes me back to my teenage years going out all the time, i wasnt as bad as Emily though. She has very little respect for her parents and it does make you wonder where she is getting all the money from to go out. I was gripped and will definately watch it next week. A lot better than Big Bro, these are real people not putting on an act for the camera's

We went to our sons to watch it and seriously wished we had not bothered.What an absolute load of garbage.
Those who have posted that they liked it need major therapy because nothing happened as far as we could tell that justified sitting in front of a screen for a complete hour of utter boredom.
We will without doubt give it a miss in future.Channel 4 have lost the plot.

strictly, a programme i used to love now has become home to the ex soap stars who are out of a job and likely to stay that way, and hated dancing on ice, and all the rubbish shows like BB and celebrity nonsense. pap for the masses, and it dulls the brain like nothing else

i think the show has more lovers then haters so i dont think its going anywhere just now. i prefer shows like the real hustle and talk shows like mock the week, 8 out of ten cats etc. Those shows are really good, talk shows are funny and the real hustle teachers you how to keep your stuff safe and not get hustled.

We are all responsible for what we allow our heads to be filled with.



The trick is to be more selective about what you watch and when you have watched what you want then turn off that switch and leave it off.



I have been doing this for a long time. I went about 8years without a tv and now I hardly watch it.

This way you can not get "sick of tv programs" and waste your life in a motionless state staring into flashes of light generated by an electrical field, which hypnotizes you into purchasing their marketing products and fills your mind with rubbish!

aw man, ive stopped watching tv due to all the rubbish on tv these days...what ever happened to the good old days where comedy and nature programmes ruled the air waves..not all this 'celebrity' goes into the mountains and fights a lion and you ring in and tell us who wins!!



these shows just encourage z list celebrities to clutch at the remaining straws of a television career...ie, jade goody, peter andre, kerry katona etc etc...get a proper job and f*ck off

Your never too old to be a fan of Hannah Montana
my 50 year old mother loveeess singers that are way
too young for her. She knows most of the lyrics
to the Rihanna songs.
She sometimes sings in the car and i'm surprised how well
she knows the lyrics.



Don't be afraid to show you like Hannah Montana
ignore the people at your school and say whoever they like
listening to is uncool!



If your a true fan you wont let them stand in your way.

The Simpsons is the best show ever.. I hear a lot of people say family guy is better than the simpsons, but come on.. they've been around since 1987.. they've been around before a majority of the family guy viewers have been born.. and they're still going strong.



Family Guy is ok, but will never compare to The Simpsons.. prove me wrong with facts.



Besides giving me a thumbs down, support your opinion if you think Family Guy is better



The Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 24 Emmy Awards, 26 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000 it was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom and the longest-running American animated program. Homer's annoyed grunt "D'oh!" has been adopted into the English lexicon, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.



Family guy was canceled.. twice



Family Guy and its cast have been nominated for 8 Emmy Awards, with three wins:
The show has also been nominated for ten Annies, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008. The show has also been nominated for a Golden Reel Award three times, winning once

The Simpson's....They paved the way and opened the doors for many sit-coms that never could have made it without the Simpson's leading the way. The family guy is funny and pushes the edge of "legal" comedy , but would have never made it without the Simpson's "testing" the "waters" first.

I love Family Guy but I think they got most of their ideas and inspirations
come from The Simpsons.
Have you seen that episode where Brian is attracted to Lois's fathers dog Seabreaze? It's the same as when Santas little helper had babies with that other dog. And what a coincidence both settings were the same!
I think The Simpsons but Family Guy has got a lot of newhumorr.

Half of the shows on nickelodeon are for brain warped freaks anyway. Shows where they try too hard (I-Carly) makes you wonder why air the stuff. A lot of shows deserve to have the creator shot. It sounds pretty bad but seriously...

You might not like Korean dramas, but they are the best in the asian market in both Drama and romantic comedy. I have a good recommendation for a Korean drama movie, but you need to open your mind outside of your style. Have you seen Sil Mi Do? it's a true story about a secret special forces unit that was composed of South Korean prisoners who were supposed to be put to death. The South Koreans instead decided to train them to kill Kim, Il Sung. It's really not a war movie, it's more of a drama. As for Korean romantic comedy, the best is "My Sassy Girl". It's right up your alley, but I forgot the translation so I wrote it in English.



BTW I am not Korean, so do not think I am being biased. Just trying to help.

Hands down I have fond memories of being in another country where even though they had MTV it was in Russian and CNN was only on for an hr a day. We brought our DVD player with us and those episodes saved us from going mad in our hotel room. So I love the original Office and of course I love Extras,too.

Dog borstal yesterday with the 2 dalmatians!?



If you watched it yesterday didn't you think it was disgusting that that couple allowed those two large Dalmatians sleep with them in they're bed. I was so shocked and disgusted. What your views on dogs sleeping with they're owners?.

Hi!



Firstly, the essence of your thread is completely lost by the terrible misuse of grammar. "They're" should read their. I know this line of response will make me look decidedly pompous, however it is meant in a kind spirited way.



Secondly, I have woken up on several occasions to find the night-before-fodder drooling and itching... but hey that's men for you!

I'm looking for the transcripts from the mid-nineties series (94 to 97), but I can't find them. I've seen that for some tv shows like father ted for example there are even books of official transcripts. What about these books? What about websites?
even the most general knowledge about how it works with this things could help! could you help me?

They said they are just putting TRL on rest for a while and that it would be back in probably a few years.  It was getting low ratings.  People go to the net for music videos now a days anyways.  MTV is all about lame dating shows and realworld/roadrule challenges with the same "no respect having" contestants...oh and shows like the Hills which never show anyone who is not caucasian lol...fake anyways.

Well, the evil Carrie Ann Inaba FINALLY had the viewing audience bowing to her ways, and had poor ol' Cloris BOOTED OFF!...



Then to add insult to injury, Carrie Ann had the NERVE to DEFEND her HATRED for Cloris!...AND her talent!...



Thank goodness for AARP, who responded w/ such angry e-mails to ABC wanting Carrie Ann FIRED!...



Just wait until next week, when Len comes back, and Carrie Ann tells him the GOOD NEWS!...Hopefully, Len will pour his glass of water into her SHOES!...

i like him,i think hes honest, and to be fair - there'ss something about him that makes him very attractive. He does well in what he does and i think he tries his best to make all the money in the world that he can - but whowouldn'tt?!?! if i were in his shoes i would.  People say that the x factor and other talent shows are totaltalentlesss freaks, but i think really, if you have to stand and sing with nomusicc and just sing from your heart - that is talent. Don'tt get me wrong, some of them are rubbish and maybe some are made up - im in two minds on that one - but i like simon i think hes funny and doing a good thing in what he does. We should start a fan club !! ha ha

MEE!!



I mean, why should people hate him for being 'Mr Nasty', because, afterall he is only putting through the highest standards of acts for example, the X factor. Whats the point in putting through loads of okay acts and then moaning you cant make up your mind who to choose. Simons honest, he only puts good enough acts through to give them the best and most well deserved winner at the end.



Why should people moan about Simons honesty- would you rather be lied to and go through your life thinking you are an amazing singer??! Or whatever talent you think you have?

I'm was certainly sad about it when i first heard this morning, not to mention very surprised. It was quite a shock when i saw it announced on BBC Breakfast this morning. I was certain that Tennant would do one more series, and everything seemed to be pointing to that.



He has obviously decided to move on though, and we fans should do the same. As I've said many times before, Doctor Who has always thrived on change. Actors come and go, and the Doctor's appearance and surface personality changes from time to time, but his character and core values endure, as does the series itself. The phenomenon that is Doctor Who is bigger than any single actor.



The last of the 2009 specials will now be the end of an era in more ways than one, with both Tennant and Russel. T Davies leaving at the same time. Tennant is one of this countries finest actors, if not the finest, and has given some of the best performances as the Doctor in the history of the series. I'm sure his career will go from success to success. RTD has brought Doctor Who back from the dead and made it into the huge success it is today. We fans owe both of them a huge debt of gratitude.



So although I'm sad that Tennant has decided not to continue, I'm also excited to find out what comes next.



The Christmas special titled "The Next Doctor" is going to be very interesting. In addition to David Tennant, it features David Morrisey who also plays a character called "The Doctor". Could this be our introduction to the 11th Doctor, just a few episodes before the regeneration takes place? The Timing of David Tennant's announcement suggests it might be. If not, why didn't Tennant wait until nearer the time before announcing that he was leaving?

Hm, that's a hard question. Because it is was real life, they probably would. It's been building up for a while, what with all that tension where they pretend to hate each other but actually like each other.



Unfortunately, it is in TV Land, and in TV Land, writers love to keep us on the edge of our seats by dangling really obvious things in front of us and then taking them away at the last second (or dragging something out for a few seasons). So no, I don't think that they are going to be a 'pair'... or if they are, something unexpected is going to pop up and ruin everything. It's not going to be as easy as 'hey, let's get together' 'okay!'.

*chuckle*  No, absolutely not.  There's going to be a lot of awkwardness, they may sleep together a few times, but they're certainly not going to be a "couple".  Cuddy can't take all of House's crap with a smile and a roll of her eyes.  She gets way too pissed at him all the time.  There may be a physical attraction (in fact, we all know that there IS a physical attraction at this point) but there's no real romantic future for them.

I hope not.  That would destroy the show.  But I think the creators know that, so if we have to endure any romance between them it will only last a few episodes before they get back to normal.

I have been watching it faithfully lately and only up to begining season 3. I also watched the new episodes this past week. I'm rather curious about Orson and his ex-wife that was possibly killed by him and I noticed he went to prison.



What happened with his exwife?

His ex-wife wasn't dead, she just kinda faked it.  She and Orson's mother were in league - Orson was in love with another woman and wanted a divorce.  His mother killed his girlfriend and he felt obligated to try to protect her.  This is why he ran down Mike - Mike knew the victim and saw Orson at her house the night of the murder.  He eventually confessed and Mike forgave him, but Bree made him turn himself into the authorities and do prison time to pay for his crime.  As for his ex-wife, she tried to get him back and almost killed Bree before dying in an accident.  Both his mother and ex-wife were crazy.

Yup, I bring out my laundry basket and fold while I watch, I do the dishes or run the vacuum during the half hour break ( the longest).  My daughter brings out her toys and we play legos or Barbie (the two days she is not in preschool) of course many times I have to change it for 'adult' scenes.

I tivo them so they're always waiting for me when I get home from work. I usually try to watch right when I get home and while Im making dinner. Sometimes I'll try to multi-task and knit or scrapbook at the same time, but my favorite way to watch is after my husband leaves for work I put on my pjs and snuggle in bed and watch. :)

Yes!!  For one thing, you're right... Stephanie turns Max into a complete wimp which is a shame because he used to be much more dynamic.
AND to agree with some of the other posters- a) It IS creepy that they're together anyway since they're (by adoption) related!
b) DAYS changed the direction of both of these characters. They were both tough, cool race car drivers and then somehow Stephanie turned into a spoiled brat and Max became a bartended with a chip on his shoulder.



I hope something positive happens soon!  :)

Are you guys serious?  You honestly think Stephanie shouldn't have said anything to Bo and Hope?  That's a pretty serious thing to conceal.  Personally I think she did the right thing.  I think Max has been acting like a complete idiot as of late.  He seems to think his new found sister walks on water and glows in the dark.  He just lost the best thing that ever happened to him.

Actually I do not like this Stephanie at all.  It was better when they both were race car drivers.  Max acts as if all he can do is tend bar.  He has many skills and I think that it would be better for him if he pursued one of them instead of working at the Brady Pub.

Well, now that psycho Sammi has witnessed the murder of the sleazy major at the door step of the mansion, they'll probably want to put her in a witness protection program.



Then, she can hide it for months (or weeks in soap land) and who knows how long they'll drag out the story line?

Let's just focus on the crux of things, for simplicity's sake.  If it were just as simple as Greenlee sleeping with Ryan and thereby committing adultery, perhaps Aidan could get past that.  The problem is here Aidan realized that what is in Greenlee's heart is love for Ryan and love for only Ryan and love in a form that goes much, much deeper than any love she has ever felt for or shared with Aidan.  Most males don't want to be in marriages where they are essentially made to feel as if they are a female's consolation prize for not getting the one she really has very deep feelings of love for.  Then, it certainly did not help matters any when Aidan discovered Ryan and Greenlee literally shacking up when the pair were holed up in a shack during the twister storm.

Should he like to have a hat like that? (doctor who question)?



When Patrick Troughton played the Doctor (on BBC tv's Doctor Who) in the early stories the Doctor was obsessed with hats "I should like a hat like that!". Do you think the continuation of this trait troughout the Second Doctor's tenure would have enhanced the show or detracted from it?

<answer>



To be honest it was a bit of a turn off for me when first saw the second Doctors hat. The second Doctor was eccentric and whimsical enough compared too the first Doctor, and the hat thing was taking it a bit too far in my opinion. Perhaps if the hat had been a bit more sensible, my opinion would have been different. Something more similar to  4th, 5th or 7th Doctors hats perhaps. That silly looking stove pipe was just a bit too much for my liking though. So when he left the hat behind in "The Underwater Menace" it came as a relief for me.



I tend to think that one of the reasons they decided to ditch the idea of the hat was the big dip in ratings after the first regeneration.



The production team at the time realised they had to try and reduce the culture shock a bit for regular viewers, so they got rid of the hat in order to minimise the change of image.



Unfortunately it didn't work that well though. The ratings during the second Doctor's tenure never fully recovered to the levels of viewing figures the first Doctor got, and it wasn't until series 7 with Jon Pertwee as the 3rd Doctor,  that the viewing figures for the first Doctor stories were matched and even surpassed.

Whoa many things have happened on the show.



Here is what happen in the last two episodes.



In last weeks ep 10/14/2008 which is called Number One With a Bullet, Tay was shot.  He got shot while the dad involves himself in a robbery attempt. The dad pulled out his gun and so the robber pulls out his gun and fires shots towards the car where Tay his hiding. This pissed the mom off and she didn't think she'd be able to ever forgive the dad, but some how she was able to. Oh and the mom's boss admitted he had feelings for her and that's way he is taking the new job offer he got.



On this weeks episode 10/21/08 it's called Disarmed and many things happen. Eddie opposes the release of the man responsible for his mother's murder.  Lizzy is asked on romantic date by Devin and she decided to go.



The mom and the girls decide to throw a block party for the old lady to help raise mom so she can keep her house.  In the end they didn't raise enough money, but then when it came time the church came throw and own the house and the lady can't be kicked out.  Also there was a hit and run that happened and the person died on the scene. The dad had to tell the whole family and the person who died was Johnny Nightingale. Lizzy's ex boyfriend the chubby dude and it ended with Lizzy crying. Oh I also forgot that, the older sister her boyfriend was being sudsed by his boss and he didn't even know it. Cassie was there at the shop to do a painting. The boss told Cassie that she asked Charles to give her space and she told Cassie it was because she feels Charlie's had feeling and stuff but knew he wouldn't act on them because really love Cassie and she said her husband didn't like it.  Cassie confronts Charlies and asks him if he has feelings for her Charlies tells her that he doesn't.  Charlies goes to his boss and asks her if she can straighten this all out with Cassie and she says sure.  While they are talking she asks though if he would spent the night with her. He would get more experience and he would get his internship but he turned her down.  Later him and Cassie show up and her door and she thinks it's just Charlies and she is dressed very dirty like. Charlies gave everything up and Cassie keeps the money she gave her for the painting she painted but they want nothing to do with her.



This is what next weeks ep is suppose to be about 10/28/08 Each of the family deals with their loss in his or her own way. It's called Ode To Joy.



These past two episodes were really good. If you get a chance to see a rerun I would watch. I can't believe Johnny died. I rather it be Ruben the Johnny.  It's so sad and it's going to be very hard to Lizzy to go on.Ugh it's just really said.



I love the show and can't wait to see next weeks episode. I know it's going to really good.

l paused it on the shadows and it looked like Jim's that was missing, plus we keep hearing that Melissa will lose a loved one.
Professor Payne is going out of it but he's supposed to be going abroad, so l don't think it will be him.
l think Jim, but we'll just have to wait until the next series to find out, and l bet they'll keep us waiting until the end of the series before we do find out!

at first, i thought that the possibility was that it was either professor payne or jim because she can't lose another co-worker and ned and her mum are to unimportant to die.
there are a lot of clues that suggest it is professor payne eg, he says 'i'm really getting the hang of this', 'if that calls for me, i'm already gone' and he only communicates with melinda by the road.
as well as this, as he knew there were 6 people there, he must be the dead one.
HOWEVER, none of them are dead yet, as they are in the first episode of series 4.
series 4 is meant to be focused around possession.
so what i think it is, is that, when people are possessed,they do not cast a shadow. hence there only being five shadows.
but i did notice, ned's shadow was quite large, and jim was stood behind him so that could explain only 5 shadows.
someone is meant to die in series 4 though.
i really hope it's not payne, jim or ned.
(which doesn't leave many others!)
but i keep remembering in series 2 the latin writing scratched onto jim's back 'death of a loved one'
i wish the fourth series would hurry up!
hope that helps!

On House, why did Wilson come back. I thought that he left?



I watched when Wilson left because he was no longer going to enable House's behavior and said that they perhaps were never friends to begin with. I missed a few shows and now he is back, working at the hospital again. What happened and why is he back?

House`s Father died and he wasn`t going to go to the funeral.  His Mother contacted Wilson and asked him to get House to go.  They went in one of the best episodes of House ever.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthmarks



Here is the closing dialogue.



Wilson: I spoke with Cuddy. She hasn’t filled my position yet.



House: If you’re coming back just because you’re attracted to the shine of my neediness… I’d be okay with that.



Wilson: I’m coming back because you’re right. That strange, annoying trip we just took was the most fun I’ve had since Amber died.



House: You hungry?



[Wilson nods. House gets up from his desk, and they start to move towards the door.]



House: Wilson?



Wilson: Yeah?



House: My dad’s dead.



Wilson: Yeah. My sympathies.



[House walks through the door. Wilson turns off the light and closes the door, and they start to walk down the hallway together.]

It has been four months. He came back at Cuddy's request to force House to attend his (house's) fathers funeral. ON the trip there and after they made it up (great episode explainstheirr relationship alot!) andbasicallyy Wilson accepted that House is a part of his life, like a chronic disease.
I love Wilson and cried when he left the show; its like Watson leaving Holmes... just ridiculous. So glad he is back.

When House's father died, Wilson kidnapped him and forced him to go to the funeral. By the end of the trip he basically realized that he missed House, and so he asked Dr. Cuddy if he could have his job back.

Brain Drain. Season 4.



The Source kidnaps Piper and puts this alternate reality in her comatose mind where the Halliwell Manor is in fact a psych ward and herself, Phoebe & Paige are patients. Cole is also there, kept upstairs in heavy restraints. Phoebe runs around with a broom and has a 'Book Of Shadows' which is a notebook with crayon drawings. Paige keeps going on about how Piper hates her because she's not Prue etc. Piper ends up getting hit by a car and nearly gives up her powers but the real Phoebe and Paige intervene into the alternate reality and stop her before it's too late.

It's not English, but you would love McLeod's Daughters, an Australian drama about 2 sisters/5 women who try to run a ranch/farm in the Australian outback.  The show is in its 8th season in Australia, but it's first 3 seasons are the best.

Seinfield question. Am I going crazy?!!?



I was watching a Seinfield re-run. It was the one where the gang park in a handicap parking stall to buy the Drake an engagement present. George's dad's car gets distroyed and ticketed. Anyway, the actor in this episode who played George's dad was not Gerry Stiller! And I SWEAR I've seen this episode a million times with Stiller as the dad (as he is in all the other episodes!!!). Did they make two versions of this one? Why? All the lines and scenes are the same, just the actor is different. Am I going mad? Did I see things? HELP!!!

Make sure you type it in correctly, otherwise it will direct you to another site.  At 2itnow, you have to sign up, but they don't send any spam or junkmail.  It's just a way to keep the show private.

Who/what did Robert Cicchini play in Six Feet Under?



Apparently he played a relatively small part in a few eps of SFU, and while I know he played someon called Todd, I have no idea what or who Todd did/was/etc.
I just watched all five seasons of this show and should already know the answer to this, but WHO on earth was Todd?! I'd watch it over again, but my friend stole it from me.
Please help; as lame as it is, it's driving me insane.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cicc... here's his wiki page and when you click on six feet under, there's nothing what so ever mentioned about him.
It says he was a recurring cast member. nothing in there either.



for some reason imdb.com isn't working for me the page has been freezing up.  Maybe you'll have luck on that page.
when your on the 6' under page in wiki, click on the imdb link to the right and see if works for you.

I'm upset too.  I was so sure that David was gonna be staying on for at least one more series, if not more.  *sigh*



I was pissed when Eccleston left too.  He was my "first" Doctor and I was pretty damn sad to see him go.



Tennant really grew on me and he became my favorite.  It really sucks to see him go.  Dunno how much I'll like the replacement, especially since "whoever" is bound to be less cute than Tennant.



I must be an absolute rubbish Doctor Who fan if I can't handle a new Doctor every few years.  Heck, that one of the basics of the show!

If you still want to watch it, you can either catch the encore episode or view it online. The encore episode airs on Fridays at 9PM (8 Central).



The CW network loads the episode to the their site the next day. You should be able to find it at http://www.cwtv.com/cw-video/americas-ne... In the past, it was usually up on YouTube by Friday or Saturday.

Sheena. McKey was called first (-shudder-), and then Analeigh, who should have been called first, not second.
Then, I believe it was Marjorie, Sam and then the bottom two was Elina and Sheena. The judges think that Elina can let go of her emotions. She had a really strong face in her photo, but her hands looked like spikes. Haha.
Sheena was sent home because she's hoochy and she poses all weird. It made her look like she was sitting on a pile of towels.

Yeah it's alright.



For me it fluctuated between boring and gripping in a few moments.
Although each episode was short, it still dragged.
There were only a few moments throughout each episode where I was really enjoying it.
I must admit, it was a very clever idea and I think it could have been expanded much more.
At the moment it seems very centered around the house and I can't see it coming to a close with all the unanswered questions answered.

Yes you do but I would advice you don't watch any season 5 trailers as one I saw showed who it was before I had watched it. Also after you have watched it you should look for alternative endings for that scene. It's awesome trust me . Lost is awesome period

Spin off of "The Hills"......?



So... Can someone please tell me why Whitney is getting her own show?  I mean she has always been in the background, sorta.  I mean, I like her, but a whole show just about her?  She's so boring and bLaH..



=/  I am still going to watch it b/c maybe LC will be in it! and b/c I am a reality TV junkie and gotta watch it.  But does anyone else agree with me? You would think Audrina or Lo would have their own show before Whitney....

I think it's because Whitney is gorgeous and because she is moving to New York City, so they think it will be a cool change of scenery.



I can't believe all the spin-offs though!



First, there was the O.C. which led to Laguna Beach.



Laguna Beach has two spin-offs: "Newport Harbor" and "the Hills".



And now "the Hills" is getting it's own spin-off?



Where does it end?

I think Dean realizes Sam did what he had to do, he may not be happy about it but they did kill the demon and save the people. But honestly i think Dean is preoccupied with his memories of Hell than anything else. The way he reacted to the mask in the high school said it is definately a lingering thought. I think he worries that Sam is doing more harm than good.

Paula almost deserved it. Everyone saw through their BS but her. She was a fool to think they weren't thinking of themselves #1. Also, I bet she would do the same thing. If Evelyn said "I wont take your key if you you do this......" She'd probably do whatever she was told. She's just mad she didnt win money.

Paula should have seen it coming.  Besides, if Dunbar had kept his key, did she think that she would have been on the boat over Derrick or Dunbar?  Paula and Johanna didn't do much on this challenge other than join in the bullying of Kenny and Johnny.  The fact that they screwed her over in the end really seemed like poetic justice.  And what would have happened if Johanna had made it to the end with a key?  Again, there is no way that those guys would have taken the two girls over guys.



This was just like survivor where the women bond together with some men and go along with them bullying everyone and are then surprised when they get left in the dust.



So I completely agree with you that it was awesome how things played out.  Ev would not have won with the other team, and out of everyone Ev deserved to win, so she did what she needed to win - and since everyone had pretty much treated her like crap the whole time, she didn't backstab anyone in the process.



OH - but I was happy to see Ryan lose because he took the key of Kelly Anne who actually deserved to win her key.  He could have shaken things up by taking a key from someone in the alliance and took the coward's way out by taking Kelly Anne's key.  So I thought it was fair that he lost.

Whose team are you on-PAULA or JOHNNY/KENNY?



ok, on the last episode of the real world road rules challange paula walnuts was cut out of the whole alliance and the winning boat at the last minute and she lost, while her good friends kenny and johnny won. i was soooo pissed and felt so bad for paula, so that is why i am on team paula!!!
which side are you on???
and please explain!
thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



definitely paula..
when they realized they could choose the boat after ev got dunbar's key, then they should have taken paula instead of ev.. they talked craped to everyone on the challenge, so why couldnt they have changed their mind last minute (who cares what promises they made, theyre already snakes)..
it just stinks because i liked kenny and johnny on prev challenges, theyre pretty dang funny, but they were just such jerks to her.. its one thing to turn your back on dunbar, but its another to do it to paula too!

OMG THAT IS SUCH A TOUGH QUESTION!!! I AM AN ABSOLUTE OBSESSED FAN!!!



I love them all but if I did have to pick one it would be Maksim Chmerkovskiy!!! I think he is absolutely gorgeous and his choreography is amazing every week. It seems to me that his partner always learns a lot and usually does pretty well on the show. I also like what he does for the sport (yes it is a sport) of ballroom outside of the show. He is a great advocate for kids around the country and tries to steer them in the right direction through discipline, guidance, and example. Although he is famous, he does not get a big head about it and still enjoys helping out in the community and I really admire that.



I also absolutely love Mark Ballas, Derek Hough, and Julianne Hough. All of them are amazing dancers and creative choreographers. They have fun with their partners and it really shows on the dance floor. I guess the similarities are to be expected though since they all grew up in England together!!! :)

For those that watch MTV.....?



Did anyone watch (The Island)...you know with cast members from Real World and Road Rules.  The end was last night.  What did you think about it?  Evy shocked me!  I mean you do what you have to do to win I guess and it is a game, but I was really shocked.  They did pick on her alot and she deserved to win!!!!!  I thought Paula deserved what she got and I really wished Kenny and Johnny wouldn't have won personally.  Good show!!!!



</question>



<additional details>



Evey, Johnny, Kenny and Derrick!  I like Evy and Derrick more then the other two!

Well, I was def glad that Eve got a shot at winning... and did... she got screwed the entire time when it came to getting a key in the challenges... i really like derrick... i can do without kenny he is arrogant... i wish eve had taken johnnys key because he was such a jerk to soooo many people the entire show... but it just showed that she is a bigger person by squashing the beef they had... although i am glad they took her on their boat it just goes to show their true colors because they screwed paula out of the win and if i was her i would def not forgive them!!

I don't blame Kenny, Johnny and Derrick for picking Evelyn over Paula. Evelyn is stronger and a better competitor then Paula. It's a game and the guys did what they thought was good for their team. Paula shouldn't have expected anything from the guys. Paula came off as a big cry baby. Evelyn deserved it so much more then Paula did. I would have been happy if Johnny got his key taken away, because he acted like such an idiot on the island, but whatever. I am just happy Evelyn won, because she had to deal with Johnny and the other idiots.

I was totally shocked, I didnt think they would do that to paula. Ev knew that her only chance to getting onto the boat with the boys was to take dunbar's key bc if she took johnny's it would have been - Paula, Dunbar, Kenny, and Derrick on that one boat. The boys wanted her bc she is really a true competetor, and Kenny & Derrick had won the gaunlet with her before.The Reunion show is going to be out of control!

I think he got caught up in the hype of it all rather than being greedy.  He believed in his system - which was obviously flawed.  I do think he was a genuine guy and just wanted the best for the unborn child he had been wanted for over 2 years.  Not greed as such.  And no I don't get any pleasure in seeing someone lose.

Sylar has several abilities but his core ability is to figure out puzzles and when he figures out how a mutant brain works he gets the special ability that person possessed. Compare that to Peter who only has to have contact with others to get their ability. This also gives Sylar a lot more control over unstable abilities than peter.

in the 1st season he doesn't seem to have an ability. he kills a man with telekinesis and finds a way to acquire it and then kills others with abilities by using his telekinesis to scalp them and somehow acquire their ability. however in season 3 it is said that the scalping and acquisition of other abilities IS his ability (and peter has acquired it). this doesn't seem compatible and its confusing as the plots are contradicting each other

His original ability is called intuitive aptitude.  It allows him to look at and instantly understand complex systems, like watches and brains.  He can also look at the brain of someone who has powers and then rewire his own to match.  His ability has a side effect - an obsessive need for more information and to understand, kind of an addiction.  Due to his underlying mental and emotional issues, it's taken the form of an obsession with gaining more and more powers, although this could change given time and therapy.

Well John Simm was definitely brilliant as the Master and i think they'd pick him straight away but because he's already been the Master that might limit his chances. They could do some sort of body swap storyline maybe .... who knows what they could come up with.



I've always thought Robert De Nero would be good! It'll never happen though ....



Pierce Brosnan would be good too.



They also think it could be Paul McGann, and he's already been the Doctor! This does also increase John Simms chances slightly .....



I think it would be good if the next Doctor was Black. Maybe they should give Morgan Freeman a ring ....

I think it will almost certainly be David Morrissey.



This year's Christmas episode "The Next Doctor", certainly seems like a great opportunity to introduce the 11th Doctor before Tennant leaves the role, and Steven Moffat will certainly be glad of a familiar face to smooth the transition into his series in 2010. So I think David Morrissey will be the 11th Doctor.



I read a rumour some time ago (can't remember where now) that the 10th Doctor will be quite a bit older in the 2009 specials, and many years will have passed since he left Donna. That could be true now. The 2009 specials will certainly be leading up to the 10th Doctor's regeneration in the last one (probably to be shown on New Years day 2010).



So I think the likelihood is that David Morrissey really will be the next Doctor.



I was saddened by the news that Tennant is leaving, but I'm also excited to find out what happens next. Roll on Christmas!

Did anyone actually think that the Alliance on the Island would actually be loyal to all their members?



Paula was all pissed that they excluded her, but she should've know from the lies and deceit they pulled the whole time with everyone else that they were only out for themselves, and not anyone they supposedly pledged their allegiance to. Is anyone upset that Evelyn chose not to take Johnny Banana's key? Do you think she was a traitor?

In my opinion Dunbar got the key handed to him, he didn't earn it.  Johnny as much of a jerk as he was to everyone, did compete/win to get his key TWICE.  I didn't feel bad for Paula because she was on easy street the whole time...she just knew that she was going to win the $$ with the guys.
I did feel bad for Robin though...she has competed in SOOOO many of these challenges and she hasn't won yet...but she was hilarious to watch when she and Dan were drunk!

I don't think the guys (Kenny and Johnny) ever intended to have Paula or Johanna on their boat.  All they did was promise to try and get keys for them.  They never promised to all be on the boat together.



Dunbar didn't deserve his key because he didn't earn it.  I think Evelyn made the right decision to take his key and I think she made the right decision about who to take on her boat.  It's a game people!  You gotta make decisions that will help you win the game .. that's the point of the game!

The guys were totally in it for themselves...If I were Paula I wouldnt be surprised.  But Ev on the other hand... she is such a hypocrite.  She talked the whole season about Johnny--she had no respect for him whatsoever.  How can you go from pretty much thinking they are the devil to kissing thier *** in one hour?!?!?!

There is no way that those guys would have chosen Paula or Johanna over a guy.  They wanted the money, and the only people they were loyal to were each other, and even that only went so far.  I would have loved if Evelyn would have chosen Johnny's key, but, I'm not sure how that would have left things with who she would have ended up with on a boat.  Kenny and Derrick would have had Dunbar and then probably Paula, thinking that they could carry her and that she wouldn't hold them back.



Given that, I think it was the only decision that Evelyn could make considering her choices of who she could end up with in a boat.  If she had taken anyone else's key from the other boat, there still would have been the 4 guys and they would have gone together.  The only way that she could assure that she would be on a winning boat was to take one of those guys out.  And Derrick and Dunbar didn't seem like they banded together to sell out Kenny or Johnny.



So no, Ev isn't a traitor. She was a competitor and did what she needed to win the money.  Paula was a fool who stood by everything that Kenny and Johnny did, and she should not have been surprised about how things ended up.  She was never a strong female competitor.  Ev has always been superior and the guys wanted to win.

i don't really feel bad for Paula. She rode the coattails of these guys the whole time. Ev worked hard and deserved to be on a winning boat. i was surprised that she didnt take Johnny's key, but if she took it, it would have cost her the game. she would have been stuck on the boat with Robin, Jenn, and Ryan. i dont think she was a traitor, i think she wanted to win the game and made the right choice in order to do that. as much as i would have liked to see her take Johnny's key, it was awesome to watch her win and watch Paula have a temper tantrum :o)



as for Robin, she needs to go get a job, these challenges are not a good career choice for her...obviously. she has been doing them for how long now and never won?

Ev knew that her only chance to getting onto the boat with the boys was to take dunbar's key bc if she took johnny's it would have been - Paula, Dunbar, Kenny, and Derrick on that one boat. The boys wanted her bc she is really a true competetor, and Kenny & Derrick had won the gaunlet with her before. Johnny is a complete Jerk, but that was her only chance at winning.



Also...  I dont think Paula should be so upset, what would have happened if the tables had turned... If Johanna had won, her and paula both would have been out of the alliance on the other boat. If she won and stole lets say Jen's key, they would have still chosen Dunbar & Derrick rather than Paula & Johanna- so for them to think that they were so tight in the alliance is just plain stupid - there alliance consisted of 6- theres only 4 per boat they would have been on the other boat regardless...

i was actually suprised that they screwed paula.... only because she was with johnny and kenny from the beginning.... i also figured they would be true to derrick only because he is a fantastic competitor and a stong male to have in the boat.... i don't think ev was really a traitor because she didn't really have an alliance to anyone.. the entire time she just said she wanted a shot at winning and she did what she had to do to win.... i do wish she took johnnys key just to show him you can't be such a jerk to everyone and win in the end because they still would've won with dunbar in the boat (even though he sucks too).... i think it just showed that she was the bigger person in the end to just end the fighting...

Dont you think that his performance last week to save him, the way he told everyone about the song he was singing and about his wife and all the crying he did after was just for sympathy? I think all this sympathy stuff is getting out of hand now and the fact that the judges voted for him against scott was ridiculous, I bet they only did it because they feel sorry for him, What do you think? xxxxx

Well, to be honest, the look on Daniels face, he knew he was going and did say, if this is the last song I am going to sing..., but then, that could have all been a plan to keep himself in. Neither he or Scott are fantastic singers, so one of them had to go. But I have a feeling Daniel will be gone this Sat, there is no one else I can think of that will be worse than him in disco week. But you are right, the judges should not have chosen him just because of his sob story.

<question>



Was the female patient in the TV show "House 4x10" a prostitute?



Hi



In my area (Europe) the TV show "House" was aired with episode 4x10 "It's a wonderful lie" just a couple of days ago. Ever since then me and a couple of other people are thinking very hard about the female patient.



By what House said during his checks we think that he thought she was a prostitute having intercourse with a mule. Although he was pretty blunt about it the female person didn't deny or admit it. What's even stranger is the final scene of that episode where she is playing Jesus' mother riding a mule in what looked like a church play.



So it could very well be that she was just a normal woman who happened to be allergic against mules rather than a prostitute with a knack for animals. But this question was not answered sufficiently within the episode.



Does anyone here know what she was supposed to be?



Thanks!

I think the ending was subtle, but sufficient.
She was vague and evasive in Answering house's questions,
in an effort to get him to come to the production.
You are correct, in that she was an actress portraying Jesus' mother,
Taking place in a church.  Sometimes, during Christmas, Some churches will do this, as the story is age old and still relatively compelling.
Did you notice, when she visited House at the hospital for diagnosis, she was wearing a Medal of St. Jude?  House knows that St. Jude is the patron saint of prostitutes, and she tells him that St. Jude is also the patron saint of lost causes and children. Hope this helps.
EDIT:  Thank you Hamish.  I was going from memory and typing furiously, forgetting the saint's name and I thought st. Jude would be a good cover all.  Busted!

I think that House thought that she was a prostitute but I`m sure she wasn`t.  The necklace was of St Nicholas not St. Jude.



Saint Nicholas is also the Saint of the falsely accused, along with prostitutes, and children, making the ending scene of this episode all the more appropriate.

She was not a prostitute. She played coy because it was entertaining for her to have House think those things of her. Her ailment was caused by contact with a mule, which she was in contact with during her church's reenactment of Christ's birth.

Sylar has several abilities but his core ability is to figure out puzzles and when he figures out how a mutant brain works he gets the special ability that person possessed. Compare that to Peter who only has to have contact with others to get their ability. This also gives Sylar a lot more control over unstable abilities than peter.

in the 1st season he doesn't seem to have an ability. he kills a man with telekinesis and finds a way to acquire it and then kills others with abilities by using his telekinesis to scalp them and somehow acquire their ability. however in season 3 it is said that the scalping and acquisition of other abilities IS his ability (and peter has acquired it). this doesn't seem compatible and its confusing as the plots are contradicting each other

His original ability is called intuitive aptitude.  It allows him to look at and instantly understand complex systems, like watches and brains.  He can also look at the brain of someone who has powers and then rewire his own to match.  His ability has a side effect - an obsessive need for more information and to understand, kind of an addiction.  Due to his underlying mental and emotional issues, it's taken the form of an obsession with gaining more and more powers, although this could change given time and therapy.

Sylar's main ability is "seeing how things work".  His adoptive father was a watch repairment, and he took over the business after his father died. He was good at it because he was able to "see how things work". After 2 seasons of people wondering why he cut people's skulls open to copy their powers, we learned when he copied Clare's regenerative power that he cuts open the skull and looks at the brains. Somehow, he has the ability to see how the brain functions and then copy that ability.

Sylar's ability is called intuitive aptitude. That means he can understand the structure and operation of complex systems without special education or training. That includes people and their abilities. He usually has to look at the brain or the person to understand how peoples' abilities work. He also found ways to absorb others abilities that way. There is also a hunger to know and understand more that comes with the ability.

Which episode of Law & Order CI is this?



Well in the episode there's this boy that goes to a really smart school but isn't smart at all. I think he's pressured to find out the answer to this really hard math equation but instead just he keeps drawing these 3 symbols everywhere? What are the symbols too ?

<answer>



It is very unlikely that Clark and Lana will get back together. The actress who plays Lana has decided against being a regular but instead she will be recurring in season 8 as she had the choice once she completed her 7 yr contract. Therefore i doubt they will get together. As for Clark and Lois they will eventually get together but i think t depends on if the writers know that there wont be a season 9 so if they did they'd wrap it ur well quickly.

I am watching it too. Yes, he does but it's the other one with the black hair that I can't stand.  He is just like a spoiled little boy and feels compelled to pull faces at everyone else's answers.  I think his name is TJ or something similar.  He even has a name like a child.

well first of all I am sincerely hoping you are female. Second, she is not that hot, I mean she is definitely hot, but as far as bodies you should strive for, I can show you some much better ones. If you do want to look like her, do too many sit ups and too much oblique work.

No, because I never would have watched it previously.  He is definitely not to my taste but I have to say that I watched his apology, which appeared to be sincere and the fact he has resigned has enhanced my opinion of him.  I also recently heard that he was the only person to help a woman who had fallen in the street, so he can't be all bad.  I think he is probably a good person with an immature side to him.

Judging on the response of the "younger" set of viewers, then yes.  Me watch such dross? No way.  One Julian Savitch-Lee, whoever he is, writing to the Daily Express opinion ****, oops sorry slot, on page 39, said that Andrew Sachs should have answered his phone.  This  has no bearing on the matter and the type of call made is harrasment which is punishable by law.  Let's hope the legal system does what it has to do in this case and everyone concerned in this fiasco is brought to justice.  Andrew Sachs is an in-offensive man and does not deserve this kind of treatment.
I noticed that you edited the word s*ut, but allowed fcuk and Nazis.  Why?

Last night's episode of ER?



I thought for SURE Ray and Neela would get together last night. What was the point of even bringing him back on the show if they didn't? I've been dying for them to get together for a LONG time. Does anyone else feel like they should have gotten together?



The only theory I can come up with is that this episode was meant to show that Neela and Ray still liked each other, and that at the end of the season Neela will go to Baton Rouge to be with him. I've always thought they had great chemistry. What do you think?



BTW, I loved the way they brought him back wearing the Frankenstein mask! Neela's reaction was hilarious.



</question>



<additional details>



Dr. Green is coming back in a flashback, so he's still dead. And yes, this is the last season. Last season was supposed to be the final one, but the producers changed their minds because of the writer's strike.

When will One Tree Hill, Season 5 be shown again on tv in the UK?



I've just watched all the previous seasons on E4 in the mornings and Season 5 was on E4 on Monday nights, but I chose not to watch them because I didn't want to ruin it for myself.  But now I've caught up with Seasons 1-4 and want to watch Season 5.



Anyone know when it will be on tv again?



ps. I love Brooke Davis!!

the episode was "born under a bad sign"



Sam goes missing for over a week, and when he finally calls from a motel in Twin Lakes, Iowa, Dean finds him covered in blood, with no memory of what happened. they trace Sam's path back to hunter Steve Wandel's house. they find the hunter dead... and they watch a security video that shows Sam slitting his throat.
Dean destroys the evidence and blames a shapeshifter, but Sam tells him he has been having feelings of uncontrollable rage and implores Dean to kill him. Dean refuses, saying he'd rather die - so Sam cold cocks him!
Sam tracks Jo down to a waterside bar in Duluth, Minnesota. he almost sexually assaults her before tying her to a pillar. Sam tortures Jo with a knife and tells her his father put a bullet in her fathers head. Dean bursts in, gun ready, and Sam begs his brother to shoot him. instead, Dean splashes him with holy water, exposing black demon eyes. Demon-Sam flees to the end of the wharf, then shoots Dean, who falls into the water and doesn't surface.
Demon-Sam goes to Bobby's, intending to kill the hunter, but Bobby tricks him into drinking holy water, then ties him up under a devil's trap. Dean arrives, having had his bullet wound patched by Jo, and Bobby starts an exorciasm. but there is a binding symbol on Sams arm, so the exorcism fails, cracking the devil's trap open. Dean learns it is the same Demon who possessed Meg, and it's about to kill him when Bobby burns the binding symbol, forcing the demon out. Bobby gives the brothers charm amulets to prevent future possessions. Sam is pissed that Dean woulden't shoot him when he was evil, but Dean says he is going to save Sam not kill him.

I don't think it came as any surprise to him anyway, according to the press it was pretty much dead in the water before that and he was hoping she'd move on.



But at least by phone there is the opportunity for conversation on both parts, so in that way dumping by phone has to be better than a stark message by text. Though in person is the bravest.

Much better because then the person concerned can explain there reasons with feeling rather than a cold text.  Maybe Terri had to do it that way rather than in person because it was easier and she might have found she couldn't do it face to face or that Simon would persuade her otherwise.  Either way it is painful to them both but they have made their choice - her because she wants marriage and children and Simon's decision is not to commit because, as he says in an interview, you end up losing all you have accumulated (wealth) when it goes wrong.  Sad materialistic man.

My wife and I are watching Coolio's Rules. One of his daughters look extremely familiar to us and we cannot for the life of us recall where we recognize her from. Maybe we know her in REAL LIFE.. more than likely we dont though. Someone help if you can
