Ireland doesn't really do big cities, it's a largely rural country. Right now is NOT a good time to move here, due to the economic downturn, there's been a strict tightening up of the residency and work permits issued.



If you are not an EU national, it's very complicated and more difficult to move here to live. You need to have a very specialised education, and I'm afraid that a US college degree doesn't often cut it here.

You got Killarney, large Town(By Irish Standards) and very beautiful. Then there is Dublin, quite big but easy to get out of. Loads of Jobs but high rent. Galway is alright but the rents are far too expensive for what you get, and after a few weeks its gets boring. The closest city to Galway is Limerick(which is known mostly for its stabbings), but it could also be an option as that is only a bad rumor. At first glance, Cork has it all - and maybe it does. Reasonable rents, close to West Cork(Beautiful) and a good transport service to most parts of Ireland.

Well I don't know if they are traditions, but here are some things



In no order really....
The 8th of December - Shopping Day, or Farmers Day ,when the Farmers traditionally do their shopping.



Most Business Close on XMAS DAY.



Everyone overdoes the Christmas Decorations these days also....



Family usually all come together for Dinner...



No News on Television on Christmas Day, up to a few years ago at least, (on RTE)



Usually there is the midnight Mass on Christmas Eve.



Its possibly the same everywhere with a few minor Differences...?



OH!!! THE BEER IS OF COURSE NUMBER 1, BUT WERE NOT ALL OUT OF IT AT CHRISTMAS (?)

The republi of Ireland is constututionally a republic, whcih like the inted states and france means that there is a separation of church and state. The religious affiliation of its citizens has no bearing on their constitutional rights. Since independance protestants have generally prospered in the south, attaining a higher proportion per head of the wealth than those of other religions. Most of the poor in the south are and alwasy were catholics.
The UK, on the otherhand is a constitutional monarchy with an established church. It could be argued that catholics, muslims, jews and dissenters are effectively 2nd class, although in reality this is not the case - except in northern ireland where catholics really were 2nd class citizens.
Constitutionally the republid is more evolved than the feudalistic system of monarchy and established churches.

They were NEVER treated as second-class citizens!



Ireland is not as Catholic as some people think, regardless of what that fool De Valera put in the Constitution. There have always been Protestants living in the Republic, quite a lot in Limerick and Dublin, and honestly, nobody cares. The general feeling today is that your religion should not be your politics.



And there's also the influence of other religions coming into Ireland - Jews have already been here for hundreds of years, and we're now seeing Hindi, Muslim, Orthodox Christianity, Buddhism, and of course Paganism. (In fact, Ireland is more Pagan than Christian.)



You can go to Mass, you can go to Protestant Services, you can go to Temple, and you can go to a Mosque - and other places, I don't know the names of places of worship in other religions, but I am sure that someone will tell me.



You can also be an atheist and opt out of religion completely.

No, Ireland is not a Roman Catholic country for a Roman Catholic people. We have separation of church and state, as do most non-theocratic states. If you go to a Catholic school you will receive a Catholic education replete with prayers, nuns and moral teachings, but not all schools are religious (educate together, VECs, private schools) so individual families have a choice as to how much a part they want religion to play in their life.



Attendence at RC masses etc has been dropping off rapidly in the last 20 years. Contraception is freely available. Abortion is not, but then neither is it available on demand in Northern Ireland so that can hardly be described as discriminatory.



There is lots of Irish-made and EU-directed legislation in Ireland which ensures equal rights for all residents, regardless of ethnicity, colour, religion, sexual orientation, age, nationality, etc. So no, Protestants are not treated like second-class citizens. Neither are our Jewish, Muslim, Baptist or atheist minorities. I do not practice any religion and have never been discriminated against.

to be honest, religion isn't at the forefront of irish life anymore,the numbers of church going people is declining, nobody cares whether you're catholic, protestant, lutheran or worship the spaghetti monster.



ask any protestant person that lives in the republic, they'll tell yo no one treats you any different for your religion.

The government does take Catholic doctrine into account with things such as birth control and abortion (however birth control is avaliable contrary to some popular belief, abortion is not)



Protestants arnt treated as second class citizens as far as im aware, however i never did quite get why you have to put wether you are protestant or catholic on application forms.

Protestants have never been treated as second-class citizens in the Republic, it's a myth created to scare Northern Protestants away from the prospect of a United Ireland.
Ireland is not a Theocracy, therefore cannot be described as 'Roman Catholic' or 'Klingon God Worshippers' or anything else in religoius terms.

Yep, A church in every parish, a parish priest for every church & school. Regular visitations from Bishops & priests for blessings,



I went to a roman catholic school in cork. One of the last magdelene laundrys to close in Ireland, Converted to a primary,secondary school oratory churches & statue of ST.Vincent,I left in 2004 ...im 23,



you can count on prayers before during & after school.



Kids still say a prayer before each class starts, to this day, my kid sisters in her last year right now & they still at 17 years old do roleplays of the bible in religion class, we were thought by nuns to act out scenes of the bible, learn the differnt book names...  told that sex was blasphemy before marraige.



The "North Mon" (North monastery,because its the north-side of Cork) across the road was run by the Christian Brothers, notorious for heroism & noted for worse.



Its a part of life, which is definitely changing now, im 23 years old, up to the age of say 16/17 I had no choice but to go to church(we called it mass) but its changing rapidly, we are catching up with the real world eventually & actually realising that life might have not actually have been that way. I consider myself now as a free thinking atheist... Mind you I hate the word for the stigma attached to it . But Ireland is still very much a catholic country.....



When I was younger if we were to see a black man walk down the road, it would be strange, it still is for most, especially the older generation.We have a long way to come..



Interesting topic though, made me think a lot about the way things are. I could write for hours !!!

No. The majority of the people are Catholic but this does not mean people are treated differently!



In some places this may be the case - By this i mean, not the Goverment putting people down, but narrow minded people that cant seem to accept that these two belief systems stem from the same book... And to put it another way... The same pagan belief systems!

Very few of us take Catholicism seriously nowadays it's just a cultural thing with no meaning really and nobody cares if you're prodestant or whatever and whoever said that about contraception is wrong, six year olds can buy condoms if they want (my cousin bought a flavoured pack, he thought they were sweets!). And in the North there's been peace for about five years

What clubs are good in Dublin City Centre?



I mainly go to Copper Face Jacks with my friends because it has its half 3 late license and most of the others only stay open till half 2 (by the way I know that place has a reputation for a particular crowd, but it's good craic).



Is there any clubs with a more pub feel to them that are any good. We tried Fitzsimons of Temple bar which is kind of what I am looking for but minus the tourists. Nothing against our lovely American, English, German etc. visitors, I just get a bit sick of the whole 'wow I love your accent', 'I love Irish people' etc... (you know what I mean)



So basically a pub with a 'clubish' vibe and GOOD music (I hate dance music)

Working holiday in Dublin?



Hey guys, I'm an Aussie wanting to come over to your great city on a working holiday next june. I am kind of worried about the state of the economy at the moment, and I know that Ireland is in a recession and it's quite expensive to live there. So my question is do you think it's wise to come over? I know it's 8 months away and things could maybe get better but I just wanted to know. Also would it be better to live and work out of the city of dublin?

Dublin's really expensive to live in, but one of the unexpected bonuses of the economic downturn ist that there are suddenly hundreds of empty rental places available, so if you haggle, you might get a very good deal on accommodation. Try to have your job sorted out before you come over.

Schweppes Ginger Ale in Ireland?



I was on vacation in Dublin and after filling up on all the heavy beers for the first 5 days I had to switch over to Jameson & Ginger until I became drunk enough to drink straight Jameson then on to Paddy.... things got pretty rough....



Anyways, I loved that damn drink (Jameson & Ginger) however, when I went back home it just doesn't taste the same... I brought bottles of Jameson with me so I know it is not the fact that I am drinking imported Jameson rather than the real deal Holyfield you can get in Dublin. So I think it is the Ginger Ales' fault. So, here is my question: Is there a difference in the Schweppes Ginger Ale you are handed in any of the 100's of bars in Dublin and the Schweppes Ginger Ale I can buy in a store in Germany or America?



Also does anyone know the volume of those little Schweppes bottles they have in bars?



Thanks

What's up with Ireland?



My partner and I are thinking about moving to Ireland, so I started doing some research. I have come across nothing but really negative things about the place and I really want to know is it as bad as everyone is saying.
We don't want to live in a big city, We'd like to move someplace that is good for young families and opened minded (we're an interracial couple). I mentioned this because right know we live in Austria and well it's great for everything except giving  a little cappuccino baby a major complex.
I would appreciate any advice the more honest the better.
Thank you

I'd like to move somewhere along the south coast. Let's see bad things... crime is really bad, it's expensive, a soul sucking black hole, that the people aren't friendly and that the younger generation has lost it's mind is creating chaos. Yep pretty much sums it up... Oh and the weather stinks, but that's not a great concern for me.

At the moment we're going through an economic slowdown in Ireland, so coming here might not be the best idea right now, but don't rule it out.



Interracial families are becoming more and more common here, but you will get comments, especially from older people in more rural settings. That said, not all of those comments will be nasty, they will just be commenting on the fact that you and your partner are from different races. Then most of the them will leave it alone. And the one or two that are left are more like to be too embarrassed to say anything that could be construed as racist.



East County Cork might be an option, or close to Waterford city. But I would suggest waiting a bit before committing yourself. Ireland is expensive compared to other countries. And the people are quite friendly, who told you they weren't? Who said the crime rate was bad? It's no worse than anyplace else, and far safer than either the US or Britain.

It can depend on the area, if your looking into a rural area then crime and rampant teenagers will not be as much as a problem, it's when you get closer to the city that it gets quite bad. Obviously ireland is expensive and will only get worse during the recession so it may be best to wait a while before you move.
You should look into the southern counties and see what they have to offer.

If you've heard so many bad things about this country why are you asking about moving here?  Every country has it's problems, I'm sure Austria is no different, in fact it might even be worse as you are an interracial couple.  And the weather stinks in a lot of countries not just here, that's something beyond our control, I think the list of things you are using are petty and could be overcome with you being a bit more flexible.

I'm Irish living abroad for some 8 years. It saddens me to say you to strongly rethink your decision. Dublin should be avoided at all cost and whist there are still some beautiful places to visit and see, the Celtic Tiger has destroyed the country.

What negative things? Well it is an expensive country. If you want to live someplace good for young families, there are rural towns, not all of Ireland is one big city.



And take any notice to the answerer above me. He's probably on something.

Its the same as any other european country. You get racism everywhere, but I can't imagine interracial couples with a cappucino baby, being a major issue.



It depends on what skills you cann bring to the work force. It's very competitive and hard at the moment to find work.



Crime is not that bad, it is expensive, and people are friendly, but cautious with strangers.



Your child would love it here, and I'm sure if you can find work, you'd love it too. I would say Cork, or Waterford , just like Orla C said.



I am from Dublin.,and I enjoy living here, but then my family is from here.



I travelled the world, and found a joy in Irish society not found in other countries. Unless you've been away, it's hard to notice. especially when times are tough, and the  government enjoy screwing the country.

Our friend Mr Digipics is spot on.
If you could tell us where there's a Shangri-La in this tired old world of ours we'd be on the first plane there. Reports of negativity have been greatly exaggerated. The crime rate is still relatively low especially in rural areas. The crime rate in our major cities would be no better or worse than other cities their size.
The young wans are relatively well behaved. Sher you'd get the odd gurrier here and there but sher isn't it the same everywhere? Dublin is very expensive but you can still get a bit of value in rural Ireland especially for the pint of plain and the half one.
The weather stinks but sher what do ya want us to do, fly a plane up and disperse the clouds? If we could we would!

Fairytale of New York is my favourite of the modern day Christmas songs, but Shane McGowan is one of the London Irish, not sure what passport he holds.



Galway Girl - gosh, I'm so sick of hearing that song.



I suppose you could just google 'Irish folk songs' and see what comes up.



Actually, google Christy Moore. He's one of our favourites here. And his live performances are legendary.

We feel very privileged that someone would go to the trouble of opening multiple accounts just for us. It must have taken ya ages to do it.

No, it's not a bit like Dublin. Architecturaly, there are a lot of red brick 19th and early 20th century buildings which are reminiscent of a northern english city There are beautiful new buildings which have an international contemporary atmosphere, and the setting, with the hills and the sea are what make it instantly recognisable - a bit as Edinburgh castle on its rock and Arthur's seat do for Edinburgh.
It 's a bit like the difference between Edinburgh and Dundee.



Both are worth visiting, but the atmosphere is very different too, although I found Belfast as friendly as Dublin, the friendliness was more anxious - people were almost on edge in case you didn't like Belfast. In some ways, that edginess makes Belfast a more exciting place to be - you feel as though you're at the start of something struggling to emerge from difficult times. The breakfasts are superb, and so is the humour - when you ae relaxed enough to recognise it! Oh, and I found what I think is the best Chinese restaurant in Europe!

I'm from Dublin and in the sixties I used to spend many weekends in Belfast going to the dances up there, Boom Boom Rooms and other great places. I really loved the place and the people. Then the terrorists ambushed and killed the members of the Miami Showband.
I never set foot in the place again for 40 years.
However in the past couple of years I have started to go back up there again, initially for shopping trips.



I am so glad that I have rediscovered the place and regret that I ignored it for so many years, The people are as friendly as ever, have a great sense of humour and Belfast is a beautiful and vibrant city.
" Is it a bit like Dublin "



Yes!  Both are modern 21st. cities but unfortunately both are governed by a bunch of idiots still living in the past.

Would have to say, it isn't as congested. Its not as dirty either, don't mean that in a bad way, Just wouldn't have as many people in it, therefore not as much litter.



Has many good restaurants, shops. Big brand names too. But it has diversity because they're many big popular streets, with big shops along the side, also has smaller streets and cobbled streets with small shops & coffee shops.



Quite nice environment like gardens & old, wonderful buildings as well as new, clean, buildings.



Has quite a few good shopping centres too.

Sweetheart, Haughey WAS  the most cunning and most ruthless of them all. After De Valera, that is.



De Valera is reputed to have ordered the murder of Michael Collins in 1921 (or was in 1922?), and while the De Valera family are still involved in Irish politics, we will never know the truth.

This programme is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to hagiograph Bertie's life.



No doubt over the next few weeks Bertie will get all doe-eyed when he talks about his marriage break-up and his kids again and how he apparently didn't have a pot to p!ss in when he was Minister for Finance.
Pull the other one Bertie!



Edit:
Ah lads, what's with all the thumbs down?



Are there some closet Bertie lovers around the place today?!

Between 20 to 30 Euro. And of course there is a taxi rank by the airport .... but if you take the local bus, it will cost you a lot less. There's also the airport-city centre coach, which costs less than a fiver per person.

We feel very privileged that someone would go to the trouble of opening multiple accounts just for us. It must have taken ya ages to do it.

It's ok but like there's still a lot of tension.  I wore a poppy on my school uniform during war memorial time and was called a few names by angry catholics, even though i was only showing respect to my relatives that fought in the world wars.  Oh yeah and my wee brother was punched in the face last week for walking alone past a group of catholics.  But it works both ways, a lot of protestants beat up catholics too.  Overall its ok like I know a lot of people that go out with the opposite religion or are really good friends with them.

I do, but it's not easy, I don't smoke, or drive a fancy car. I go out once a fortnight, and  don't have any dependents
But after tax, it's probably worth €26k (if not less)
I do have a mortgage though and household costs which add up to €1,000 a month, so €12,000 per annum. The other €14k, goes  so easily, a holiday, petrol, clothes, going out, car repairs , family occasions, all I can say, is it gone, I do manage to save €1,500 a year, .woo hoo, lucky me.

It depends on what part of Ireland you would live in and what your outgoings are. At the moment I'm on that salary and have a mortgage on my own and find it difficult, especially with petrol prices the way the are at the moment too! However before I got the mortgage I rented a room in a shared house and lived quite comfortably on it, so it just depends on what other financial commitments are, but without any big financial commitments, you should be able to manage ok!

You get a train direct to Dublin Connelly Station, then change to Heuston Station and get a train to Cork (the tram line connects both stations in Dublin)



You can also get a bus or drive.

Its not possible to pick the cheapest because a flight that might cost you €30 one day might cost you €100 on another.



This is the list of flights and operators from Cork



Scotland
Edinburgh - Aer Arran
Glasgow Prestwick - Ryanair & Aer Arran



Wales
Cardiff-Aer Arran



England
Birmingham - Aer Lingus & BMIbaby

London - Aer Lingus (Heathrow) & Ryanair (stansted and Gatwick)
Manchester - Aer Lingus & BMIbaby
Newcastle - Jet2.com
Newquay - Air Southwest
Nottingham - Ryanair
Plymouth - Air Southwest



Just look at the websites of the companies who offer the flights you might be interested in and look for a deal.

For the love of all things holy, don't go with Ryan Air!! Chances are, you'll get there quicker if break-dance over. Try Aer Lingus or Aer Arann. Maybe go to Dublin to get a wider variety of flights. Ryanair have a notoriously bad customer service record. Late flights, cancelled flights only at a minutes notice, lost baggage, rude staff, cramped planes, the list is endless. Easyjet are OK, I think...but im not sure if they operate from the South.



Good luck with whoever you choose, though.

Irish people what is your opinion on this?



Might I just add first that I am also Irish, and if you're Scottish, Welsh, Cornish or Manx this applies to you too:



What would you think of having English neighbours?
I would not like it at all, I don't mind them holidaying here or having English friends (actually I do have an English penpal) but I absolutely abhor the idea of English people setting up home here. This includes people of EnglishDescent such as EnglishAmericans but not people who have lived in England of IrishDescent. My thinking on it is that we were only declared a republic sixty years ago and we are still very anglicanized, most obviously that most of us cant speak Irish (I can though, not from living in the gaelteacht,actually from listening in school).



We don't allow people to buy a house in the Gaelteacht unless they speak Irish well enough because we don't want the place becoming anglicanized I don't see why the rules should change for the rest of Ireland. I can't stand the idea of Ireland becoming a little England or America
So do you agree with me and why or why not ?



</question>



<additional details>



I know language isn't the only thing but it's the most obvious thing, it's just the thing I used as an example. And I'm not including Cromwellian planters and such because they all converted to Catholicism which then was seen as 'choosing Irishness' I mean the English families coming here NOW

I think you'll find the largest immigrant community in Ireland are the English.  And most of them, like the Normans, have become more Irish than the Irish themselves.  Take a trip to West Cork and you'll see what I mean.



Speaking English does not make you anglicised, thats just ridiculous and offensive to the majority of Irish people.



Ireland will never become a little America or England, no more than we'll become a little Canada or Australia,  it takes more than a language to make a national identity.

If you follow your argument, this would mean that no Muslims, Jews, Polish (despite being Catholic, as there is such a thing as a Catholic English person also), Germans, Dutch, French, Spanish, or any other nationality should be allowed to settle here.



Honey, with all the Asians, Africans and other nationalities working in the HSE, the health care system would topple over and die completely. The hotel and catering industry would, quite simply, implode. And as for all of the foreigners who work in the universities as professors, well ....



Then you'd have to go back and weed out all Irish with Spanish, Portuguese, French or Moroccan ancestry, thus halving the population overnight; then you'd have to find all the Jews and get rid of them - and there was this guy named Schickelgruber in Austria who moved to Germany and changed his name who tried to do that in Germany, messed things up a bit for everyone when he did that - and then all those who can claim Norman-French ancestry .... And you'd have to weed out all the Scottish, Welsh, etc. that moved here any time over the past 150 years. There'd be nobody left!



New people coming into a country bring their own culture with them, and this eventually becomes assimilated - it happened with music, visual art, literature, dance in Ireland. No culture can exist in a vacuum, its very nature is that of constant change.
The only place in Ireland that's even close to being either little England or little America is Dublin.



Like it or not, the English are our nearest neighbours and we've been the best of enemies, worst of friends for centuries now, but it's better the devil you know.

My next door neighbour is from London, I work with three English women and my best friend is from Norwich. No, I have no problem with it. I DO have a problem with racists like yourself however. You say:



"we were only declared a republic sixty years ago and we are still very anglicanized"



So what? We were a colony for centuries, that will always be part of our history and our culture. There is no such thing as 'pure Irishness'. We have had independence for almost a century, surely you should be secure enough in your national identity to be able to move on from defining yourself in terms of 'not being English'? Would you ever go off and learn a bit about the world and come back to us when you've matured?

Well let me tell you this I am Protestant, my mother is from England and my father from Cork. I was born, raised and educated in Ireland and I dare say I know more about Irish history and culture than you.

So, what's the Irish for bigot again? I myself am not Irish, but then I don't really have to be to spot xenophobia.



Might I remind you of the great numbers of Irish who have emigrated to England, Canada, Australia and the US for years - and who blended in just fine while keeping a bit of their own culture?



Or perhaps you could send all the jobs and investments in Ireland that come from the English and multinational firms back where they came from as well - wouldn't want all that foreign money and employment now would we? Too English by far. Better start giving the EU some funding back  while you are at it.



So, you'll take the money and assistance, but demand that people from abroad cannot become Irish, while reserving the right of Irish to travel and live elsewhere...yeah, that makes sense...

A couple more questions while you're at it:



Why are immigrants taught Irish at school? it's our language not theirs!



Since we all know we are the real Catholic country, should we call the Italians plastic paddies for being ROMAN Catholic?



Should Irish people who are not of Scottish descent be "allowed" to support Celtic (or [shudder at the thought] Rangers)? - or people who are not of English descent be allowed to support Man United?



Should the Irish Diaspora, all 70 million of them (according to a thing on the radio the other day) be 'recalled' to Ireland, we could all then stand on each others shoulders for want of room unless we can swim.



Ironically, 1 in 10 Brits is entitled to an Irish passport (based on a parent or grandparent) - that means there are more "Irish" there than there are here.



Personally, I love to "hate" the English in jest, I love to see them get beat in places like Croke Park, Lansdowne Road, Webley, Basra :-) etc but that is all in fun. If I went to the pub and saw a few people in England shirts singing for their football team, if I was rich that week, I would offer to get them a drink.



Do you also feel we should abandon everything that is not native to Ireland, football (soccer), oranges, bananas, potatoes (which were brought from America to England to Ireland), kebabs, Chinese and Indian takeaways - and of course cancer drugs, insulin, computers, television, cars and phones, which were all developed/discovered abroad?

No, we don't drink as much as people think we do although the underage drinkers do subscribe to the myth & are trying to make up the difference for their elders.



We have a 'democracy'.



The predominant religion is Roman Catholicism but there are Protestant religions, Church of Ireland, Methodists, Baptists, etc and a growing number of Russian & Polish Orthodox and Muslims.



St Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland, he brought Christianity to Ireland and it's a national holiday in the Republic of Ireland.



It's up to you if you want to move to the Republic of Ireland but if you don't have a parent or grandparent who was either Irish or British, you will need to look into acquiring a visa.

Food? Obviously the potato features a good bit in our meals, Irish Stew, Soda Bread, Potato Bread, Wheaten, Dublin bay prawns and salmon, Colcannon - but of course we have access to practically every dish from across the world, I am a big fan of Indian and Mexican particularly, so you will find pretty much anything you like here.



The 'drunk Irish' is a stereotype. I love a couple of glasses of wine on a Friday or Saturday night as do most of us but contrary to popular belief we do not spend every night in the bar.



As another answerer said, we have a democracy in Ireland.
The most common religion is Catholocism, followed by Protestant, and the smaller ones would be Islam, Buddhism, Orthdox, Hindu, Jewish, Mormon and Atheist.



St Patrick is the patron Saint of Ireland. Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland and according to legend, banished snaked from Ireland (no snakes live in the wild in Ireland)



Other info - Ireland is the third largest island in Europe, with a population of over 6 million.

You should visit before considering moving - it's a lovely place - but why move to somewhere you know so little about? Negative Irish stereotypes are just as accurate as the ones about Americans - meaning that they aren't accurate at all really.



They have the same food as in the US really, better beer and rainy weather. Main religion is Roman Catholic, but there are muslims and other faiths as well.



Go visit.

We don't drink as much as we are known for, the english are much more 'fond' of there drink then we are, we also don't beat our wife's or live in some kind of backward society stuck in the 1900's!



Catholicism is most popular but we have a very diverse population.

<question>



Would you feel guilty for claiming welfare?



I'm Irish but moved to England (because I couldn't get work here) almost 15 years ago. In January I got a job here (well, actually just over the border in the North) because I wanted to be near my father who is now pretty sick and needs care. I resigned from my job there - but between resigning there and starting here, the company I was supposed to be taking up a job with went to the wall.



From then until now, I've been doing a few 'odd jobs' but the lions share of rent and food money came from my now depleted savings.



I've had to sign up for welfare money, because otherwise I would no longer be able to eat or pay my rent - since being unable to drive and living in a huge unemployment blackspot, I have been unable to get any work other than an odd week through an agency.



I feel terrible for doing it. Sure I have paid contributions, but I paid them to the English government and now I'm scrounging from the Irish government.



</question>



<additional details>



Just to clarify, I would have been living just over the border in the south but crossing the border to go to work.

Dont feel guilty, your case in genuine and your entitled to welfare here, thats all part and parcel of being in The E.U. The way things are going there'll be a lot more signing on in the very near future. (possibly myself, big meeting called in our company for friday!)



So, no don't feel guilty, just try to get work, and if you cant, consider moving to a larger town with more employement oppourtunites whilst still being close to your Dad, if thats possible. I'm saying this because life on the dole isnt all its cracked up to be.



best of luck in the future.

If you're outside the bus station, facing the river, go left.  Continue along the river until you get to the Opera House.  There's a bridge over the river here, so cross that.  Continue straight, staying on the left hand side of the road.  You should pass the Heineken Ireland brewery on your left.



Keep going straight, it's a very long road.  Ignore all the left hand turns. You'll pass a few sets of traffic lights, but eventually you'll come to a very large intersection with traffic lights, where the footpath you're on swings around to the left.  Follow this and continue.  Eventually you'll end up with the entrance to the retail park on your right, on the opposite side of the road.  There's a set of traffic lights here where you can cross the road.

First of all Sarah, What are you on??



So, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and most of Belfast are full of kanckers? Is that right?? Well whatever your discriminatory view of a "knacker" is, I wont get into that, but if you take the 4 areas you've mentioned that means that at least half of the population of the Island of Ireland are what you deem to be "knackers". Well I've absolutelyt nothing against Donegal (my Dad's from Dungloe) and I also have family in Ardara and Ballyshannon and visit them quite regularly and can quite confidently say that I've met as many as what you may deem "knackers" up there as I have down here in Dublin.



I know I'm going off on one, but I'm totally fed up with the anti-Dub and now anti-city sentiment that is regularly aired on YA, theres good and not so good everywhere!



Going back to the original question, well They didnt write the song Galway Girl for nothing!

You question is not specefic. For me Ireland is better, i am not Iriish but i have lived in diff. places.Ireland has a diff auro.people are friendlier.I like the weather (its not all the time raining-the irish just loves to give out and slags them selves which i find it funni) the weather dont get extreme cold or hot (unlike canada),rains some comes and goes and its not really like heavy rain its showers mainly! I live in Ireland and now in Uk (uk needs me). Ireland is expensive for drinks,housing but for the food its not too bad.Ireland has also the highest min. wage. (9euro)while Uk the min.wage 5.73£ plus its expensive. In Ireland you dont pay water bill,the cousil tax is cheaper than uk, education is better (Ireland is highest Literacy in europe), The Irish would say its laid back but i think London is...i have lots of experience paying in the shops/buying tickets the english people will see that the queu is long they wont bother to open another counter or when u transfer money via bank to abroud it takes 5-10 days.(crazy)But in Ireland the Irish has this thing "do it right away"and its fast.The pubs or bar in Ireland are alive in Uk  its boring. Transpo (train)is good in London but the buses are bad. London is big so lots of variety. Cinema in London is mad expensive (double the price n euro). and Ireland is cleaner than UK. In Uk theres a feeling of tension when it comes to race and be cautious whenu say the work african,blacks,or oriental "political correctness" is always be aware.

Do you mean "where" is better? Who relates to a person not a country.



I'm English by birth but I live in Co. Cork now. There are pro's and cons for both countries. Ireland is very rainy and very expensive to live in lately but on the plus side is relatively crime free compared to the UK.  Also we have hardly any speed cameras here and at the local supermarket the checkout girls let you pay tomorrow if you forget your purse. Try that in London!  The UK has lots more tourist attractions and is "busier" generally but I don't miss that at all.

what's your criteria?

Least densley populated - Ireland



if you don't really have some sort of criteria then I probably say you're being racist.

The only differences are cultural, and to say one place is better than the other on the basis of culture is dangerously close to racism.



I'll say Ireland because its my home, but if I had been raised in the UK I'm sure I would say the UK was better.

That depends. They are two very different places. Ireland is much less densely populated, so it's a lot wilder in many ways. The UK has a better infrastructure.

As an Irish Republican, I am proud of my country and the advancements it has made in the last 90 years since gaining partial independence from Britain.

However, in this case I feel that England is a better country as regards infrastructure compared to the current situation in the 26 Counties ("Republic").

I live in the United States but visited both countries last summer. They both had their own advantages, but I must admit that I really enjoyed Ireland.

I was not expecting to. I fully expected to fall in love with England, but those green hills, those sheep, those pubs in Ireland just got to me.

However, my opinion could also be influenced by not living in either country, spending more time in Ireland, and seeing more of Ireland than England.

No there is not a museum dedicated specifically to Joyce.  You can visit the writers Museum  in Dublin. There is Joyce's tower in Dun Loaghaire (SP)(pr: Dun Leary). DL is on the DART and a lovely afternoon. Joyce moved about a good bit, so no there is no Joyce home open for tours.

I'm visiting Ireland, what do I need? (Or need to know?)?



I'm planning on visiting Ireland over Thanksgiving break (Nov. 24 to Dec. 1) and Ive never been abroad before. Luckily Ill be with family who has been in the Ireland before, but there is a significant age difference between my aunt and I. I was hoping someone else who has traveled there and has a lot of experience could help me.



Basically, I need everything covered. What to pack, what to expect, what their slang is, important people I should know, important events I should know, popular music groups, EVERYTHING!!

I want to be able to blend right into the Irish culture and not feel that American barrier between us. That's also a question, should I tell people I'm American? I know theres some hostile feelings towards Americans now, but I don't know everything about it, such as which countries feel it or not. Should I share that I'm American?



Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!

I was just there in May for a short holiday. I had a great time! We went to Dublin. Not sure where you're going, but the tourist buses were a great deal and really convenient for us. For a flat rate you could ride the bus and get off at all the major site seeing venues and every 7-10 minutes a bus would arrive that you could jump and and ride to the next venue. If you are in Dublin go to the Temple bar area for night life.  If you like beer go the the Guinness storehouse take the tour and go the the sky bar for a really cool view of the city.

The weather can be rainy, so I would pack for that. I think they dress pretty similar to Americans. I didn't witness of feel any hostility from the Irish for me being American so I think you should be fine. I thought the people there were really nice and hospitable.

I really hate to burst your bubble, but you're NOT going to be able to blend seamlessly into any culture on your first trip over no matter how much you know before you go. Not even people highly trained in ethnographic field methods (people like anthropologists or sociologists) can blend into a place instantly and they devote months or years to pre-fieldwork study. Trust me on this -- I'm both and anthropologist and a frequent visitor to Ireland and I still stick out. My host-brothers claim they can spot an American from across a football field and they usually wind up being right. Even if this isn't the case, as soon as you open your mouth people are going to know you're American, or at least Not Irish.



That said, Irish people are generally pretty friendly towards Americans. If you have Irish ancestry don't be afraid to admit it (but seriously, don't run around announcing it to people either, let them ask you first). You can get into some awesome conversations that way. Don't worry too much about things like slang, Irish people are quite familiar with American English (there are lots of American shows on TV, for example) and if some really heavy Irish slang does creep into conversation, just find the friendliest person in the group and ask if they can explain that bit because you didn't catch it. No big deal and you'll get more fun out of it.



Packing: I come from a cold climate so to me, Ireland doesn't get very cold. Check around for the average temperatures in Ireland at this time of year and pack accordingly. Long pants, long sleeved shirts, and a medium-weight jacket (not a parka) should be enough, and if it's not is just gives you a really good excuse to buy some nice warm wool sweaters. If you bring an umbrella, get a good sturdy one that's made for windy conditions, because it WILL be windy there (especially if you're near the coast at all). Alternately, you could buy an umbrella in Ireland. Unless you're planning on going to 5-star restaurants you shouldn't need to pack anything too fancy. One nice pair of slacks and a somewhat dressy shirt should be fine. Bring shoes that are good for walking, since you'll probably be doing a lot of it. Also, if you're planning to go out to Gaeltacht areas (Dingle, Connemara, and parts of Donegal are the biggest) you'll want to try to find a bilingual English and Irish Gaelic map, regional guide book, or something along those lines. Even two maps, one in English and one in Irish, would be better than just an English map. This is because tour books usually give English place names but road signs in Gaeltacht regions tend to be Irish-only. You'd never guess that Maam Cross and Teach Doite are the same place, but they are. It's just that the single-language maps and books don't tell you that.

The best way to learn about people and events important now is to read Irish newspapers. I've noticed that bookstores like Borders often sell the Irish Times, even in the middle of nowhere where I live. You should also be able to access Irish newspapers online. Otherwise, you don't really need an in-depth understanding of Irish history to be able to enjoy the place, but there are hundreds of Irish history websites out there that could give you a good foundation in the basics. Just google Irish history, seriously. Also check your libraries and bookstores for Duffy's "Atlas of Irish History" (link below). It's a nice overview, and I feel it does a better job than a lot of other similar books out there.

People will KNOW you're American dear, but in all likelihood they won't hold it against you - we in Ireland are not so shallow as to assume that all Americans are the same. If asked, simply tell people where you're from, and don't volunteer any more information.



I'm afraid you won't blend in, but don't worry about it. Irish people like American rock bands, we listen to music from all over the world, and are far more multi-cultural now than we were 15 years ago - the number of people from former USSR countries living here is phenomenal, particularly from Poland and the Czech Republic.



In practical terms, bring good waterproof walking shoes and a rain jacket. Bring a light scarf and heavier one, and be prepared to dress in layers - the weather being what it is, it's best to be prepared for this.



Slang, events, people, music groups - not so important. The local dialect changes ever 20 miles anyway, and events tend to be small and localised.



Talk about whatever you like, but it's best if you don't mention: The Iraqi war, as people feel very strongly about i; religion, because this is still a touchy subject in Ireland; politics, because it's too like religion an people are inclined to be partisan; and the cost of everything in Europe. (I personally got VERY tired of hearing Americans in Italy gripe about the cost of simple meals. Our food is not subsidised here, we pay real prices for real food. I even got to the stage where I told one or two of them that if they didn't like it, they should feck off home. Different places have different things about them, and if you don't like this, tough. But I digress.)

Sher the minute you open your mouth they'll know you're American. We wouldn't be worrying too much about it. Sher the last time we saw anyone being hostile towards an American was Richard Harris in The Field and poor Tom Berenger didn't know what hit him, the poor fella.

Important piece of advice re slang: Don't go around saying 'fanny' too often. It means something else entirely here. And don't go talking about 'fanny packs' either. You'll get some strange looks. 
Every morning we like to greet each other with the phrase: "Top of the morning to you!". It sets us up for the day, so it does.

Other than that you'll be grand, so enjoy your stay!

It used to be coffee and a *** for me, but since I've gone straight it's become a bowl of cereal and some juice.

I don't think anyone has the time for a full fry-up these days, it's kind of a morning-after-the-night-before lazy Sunday thing now. Lots of people (single men, mostly) go for the immortal jumbo breakfast roll (all the ingredients of a fry stuck in a butter-sodden white bread roll) with a cup of tea, but they don't cook it themselves, they buy it at a filling station and eat it in their van while they wait for the rain to stop.

Some times I might have a Sardine on Toast or A Grilled Kipper or Perhaps Grilled Tomato on Toast or very rarely a Boiled Egg on Toast. If on the Rare occasion I might have a Fry up of Rasher of Bacon Black & White Pudding Tomato Perhaps Mushroom and Egg I Pay for it Afterwards with Pains in my Stomach and Grease and Belching up of the Stuff. I had a Gallbladder Operation 8 Years ago so Fries do not Agree with me.

Some people might have egg and toast or a rasher sandwich but that's about it!



At weekends loads of people have a ''fry'' (especially Sunday!).

Loads of girls in my year (we're 15/16) just have cereal and juice or tea and toast. Many don't have any breakfast at home and may just buy a sandwich or cereal bar in school!

<question>



Moving from America to Ireland?



(Like Job, housing, economy, etc.)?



Obviously, to move to Ireland, you get on a plane and bring the things you want.  Thats not what I mean.



Currently I work for a foundation company, which has been for the past 5 years.



It has pretty much died.



I see all the things that are coming, like a new depression, and I feel moving out of the country is the best idea.



Granted I could move to Canada, because its only 70 miles away from where I live, but I figure if I move, I want to move somewhere I like.



I like Japan, Ireland, France, and a few others.



Ireland seems to be the easiest to move to, and it fits into my check list.



Like, English speaking, no snakes, beautiful land, and so on.



(Thats right, I won't go somewhere if their are poisonous snakes.)



What part of Ireland would be good for me if I want these things:  Not alot of people, but not far from civilization.  Country area, not expensive, and English language spoken?

I have graduated High School, Mastered concrete foundations, I have some computer experience, I have independently studied things like psychology and politics.



But, considering I have no job lined up, what would be something I could get there, or, get educated here so when I move there I can get it?  Like, computers.  I can work on anybody's computer, as long as its not programming something.



What Jobs do they have if I want something I already have experience for?

And how does the economy and life compare to here:  Taxes, shops, businesses, wages, etc.

How much do homes cost, and how does that all work there?



Considering here, you go in debt with banks, and end up spending way more then what the house is worth.



Last but not least, how are the laws?

If you want civilization without being gouged for money...go to galway! It is a small city, but it does actually have businesses and a night life. There are ,ore job opportunities in dublin, but its a lot of money. Its like if you had the choice between st. paul and nyc. one you might have to do more searching for a job but you won't be broke and the other there are quite  a few jobs but for the price a rent you are getting a closet. Just so you know  the ero is way stronger than the dollar. I have been saving up for almost a year now to move to ireland from nj. The cost of just moving there is so much plus i have to buy a car. I am going to move in with family so thats no rent, but i am going to spend all my saving from the past five years that i have been seriously working in the first year.

Padraigh Pearse, Eamon De Valera, James Connolly,Tom Clarke, Joseph Plunket, Eamaonn Ceannt and Sean Mac Diarmada

Michael Collins was in the GPO helping out Pearse.



If you want to talk about peoples views you should be aware that the people of Dublin spat at and threw tommatos at the leaders as they were been taken to Jail. It was only after the executions that people began to feel sympathy for the rebells.

If you have to talk about people's views, then why have you chosen the Easter Rising? It happened nearly a century ago. It's hardly current and the people whose views you want are all dead.

Priscilla - You're a little minx!

We can't remember much about the Rising. We were only babes in arms at the time but we do remember our poor mother couldn't get any postage stamps for a while because they'd taken over the GPO and she couldn't collect the lone parent allowance either. 
We couldn't get any Kimberley, Mikado or Coconut Creams either cos they'd taken over the Jacob's factory as well. We think they were probably trying to find out how Jacobs got the figs into the Fig Rolls.

We do know that the IRB had something to do with it though God knows why the International Rugby Board were getting involved in a military coup.

Life looks fine, right enough. By the beginning of October the weather will probably be shyte, the same as it is now. And the oul nights will be drawing in as well so if we were you we'd wait until next June to come here.
If you're working in Dublin 2, you'll probably be around the Stephen's Green area. We're out in Dublin 4 with the RTE crowd......

The Weather has not been that Nice this Year ,Plenty of Rain but not Cold. We get the Odd Beautiful Warm Day where People can go around in their TEE Shirts and then the Day after it is non stop Rain. In October it could be Brilliant or else very Cold and Wet. Dublin 2 is a very Fashionable Area where all the Nice  Shops are and you Have Saint Stephens Green and a lot of Pubs and Clubs . That is not to say that Dublin 1 on the North side is not nice it has Nice Shops as well and Pubs but D2 is more Swankier. We have some very Beautiful Parks, The Phoenix park has 1,700 Acres and Contains Fallow Deer and Equestrian Facilities also a Cricket Club and the Zoological Gardens. Saint Annes Estate in Dollymount is another Parkland also Marly Park in Rathfarnham on the South Side. We are beside the Sea and you can Participate in Various Water Activities like Boating  Swimming Fishing. The Dublin Mountains is not far away about 7-10 Miles and you can Roam the Hills by following  The Wicklow Way on a Map. You can go down the Country in 2 Hours or Four Hours to Kerry by Train we have very Beautiful Countryside. A lot of People come to Ireland to Ramble the Hills in Autumn or Fall as the Americans  call it.

i got my eyebrow pierced in georges arcade on camden st for like 28euro, so georges arcade would be the cheapest.
but there are tons of places in Temple Bar where you can get piercings, check them out!

Celesial Ring in Stephen's Green is also great, one of the best but expensive

I like Adonis, its at the back of Miss Fantasia's on South William Street. You go into Miss Fantasias and the studio is down the back of the shop.

I had my tongue and labret pierced there by Glen.

I also p pierced in the Celestial ring in St Stephens Green. I was going to go back to Adonis but I was getting it done for free. It was good  but not for tongue piercings.

I have yet to see one tongue piercing done as good as Glen can. My piercing never even touches or damages my teeth.

You cant go far wrong getting your nose done though.

I recommend Celestial Ring or Adonis.

I dont like Metalmorphasis because they gave my sister two industrial piercings in one ear at the same time. Its a very bad idea to do that and any good piercer would have refused to do it and make the person wait until at least one was healed. She had to take them out of course and her ear is a bit mangled.

I also got my eyebrow done at Georges street arcade and I would never go back there and I would never ever recommend it. You want a real piercer not a monkey with a needle.

If you want somewhere cheap then Adonis is only about €20 your nose. Adonis is cheap because the rent on their shop is less than the other bigger places (Celestial ring is €25).

I fell in love with Dingle in the south-western part of Ireland when on a recent visit. (County Kerry)
It is very touristy and I'm sure you would find work in a restaurant or pub there.
Good Luck.

I lived in cork for five months. It is the second largest city in Ireland, besides Dublin, and I absolutely adored it.  Its the perfect mix of Irish culture and city living, so you still feel comfortable but you are immersed in the culture!

What music do you secretly listen to?



I have to admit it, I have to come clean, I listened to Glen Campbell singing Rhinestone Cowboy a few days ago on YouTube, and then I listened again, and again, do you think I need help or am I in good company?  So who do you listen to or have a secret stash of their cd's or records (ah Big Tom, whatever happened to that thread?) hidden under your bed.  It's time to 'fess up and admit it, you'll feel much better afterwards, that's what the Guards are always telling me.

Place name in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.?



My great-great grandfather left Nth. Ireland for Scotland around the early part of the nineteenth century. In the 1851 UK Census, it's stated that he was born in a town/village in County Tyrone by the name of Limlianangra (?)  The spelling of this place seems to be incorrect as I cannot find reference to it anywhere. Does anyone have any idea what the correct name of this place might be?

Sorry, no, unless it's Lisnaragh. Lim- is an unusual prefix, but it's certainly not unheard of, Limavaddy in neighbouring Derry being an obvious example. 
A lot of rural areas are known locally by townsland names that aren't printed on conventional maps. These placenames do appear on Ordnance Survey maps so your best bet may be to order the ones that cover Tyrone from the OS website and then go over them until you find a place with a similar name:
http://www.osi.ie/

Where is a good place to live in Ireland?



I am currently looking at moving out to Ireland - specifically Co. Wexford. I would like to be within approx 15 mile of Wexford Town. Can anyone let me know some nice areas that are quite, couple of pubs, friendly people etc.  Thanks.

</answer from>



<answer>



Taghmon and Adamstown are nice quiet little villages about ten miles from Wexford town. In general, if you find a place off the main roads, it'll be nicer. Villages close to Wexford (like Blackwater) have seen a lot of development lately and they've lost a lot of their rural charm. You should also stay inland a bit, as many of the coastal villages are dominated by tourist facilities and are a bit lacking in soul.

Have you ever spend your entire life WITHOUT going to Disneyland?



I have My life is totally depressing. I feel like I''m living in the great depression!!! No vacation, cheap fattening dinners, we only celebrate christmas for only 1 hours (open presents, caroling and high in fat dinner) on christmas day. the rest of christmas day is all about cutting oleanders, going on top of roof and clean the rain gutter. before and after christmas we always have to go to work.. that's why we have to do outdoor jobs on holidays. I don't have time to stay in bed whenever I'm sick. we also have only one channel on our TV which is channel 8 (nothing but sesame street, barney and wall street programing).. All of the items that we received are from the dollar store and all of them wear out and break within 20 minutes. The rest of the money we spent on is fattening foods, oleander equipments, camera to make our neighborhood safe, and security systems to our house and car. we drive a car that looks just like this.......

Hey bob, you are more than 60 years out of date.  We have been independent a long time.  Here's a quotation from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish...



The Irish Free State created by the Treaty came into force on 6 December 1922 by royal proclamation after its constitution had been enacted by the Third Dáil and the British parliament.



What's it like to live here?  I'm answering you on broadband.  Surely that tells you something?  You won't find too many thatched cottages now.  Same daily life as anywhere, home, family, work and social life.The newest technology hasn't changed that. We are thriving, our eductional system is second to none, food is natural and good, and apart from getting more than our share of rain, it's a great little country.  And the people are nice too.  I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.

The republic of ireland (Dublin Wicklow Wexford Carlow Kildare Meath Louth Monaghan Cavan Longford Westmeath Offaly Laois Kilkenny Waterford Cork Kerry Limerick Tipperary Clare Galway Mayo Roscommon Sligo Leitrim and Donegal) has been independant since 1921. However, 6 of the counties in the northern provence called Ulster (Tyrone, Fermannagh, Derry (sometimes called Londonderry) Antrim, Down and Armagh) are still under british rule, due to the high ammount of protestants who consider themselves more British than Irish. Ther Northern Irish paliamnet is held in Stormont, Belfast, and the Republics is in Leinster House, Dublin.



And I, for one, couldn't stand to live anywher else on the planet  - I love it here. People say its expensove, but that doesn't bother me - Since I grew up here, I don't have anywhere to compare it too. But, if you're not from here, there may be more on mainland Britain (England, Scotland, Wales)

Ireland is an ISLAND not a country.



Ireland is made up for two countries, The Republic of Ireland, an independent country and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

How would I go about applying for a work visa in Ireland?



I am thinking of moving to Ireland in the mid spring I am needing to know where the most reasonable place is to live or maybe find some one to share the bills with after finding work.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It would help to know where you are from, as different nationalities have to apply for different visa. If you are an EU citizen, you do not need a visa at all. If you are Australian and under 30, there is a special 1-year visa you can get. If you are American you will have to be eligible under Ireland's 'in-demand occupations' list. See:
http://www.citizensinformation.ie/catego...



If you are qualified in one of these areas, you can apply for a green card on your own behalf.



Employers can apply for a work permit for positions they have been unable to fill from the national labour force. They must first offer these positions to workers from the EEA & Switzerland, then to workers in Bulgaria and Romania, and only if they have not filled the position at that point can they apply for a permit for workers outside these regions:
http://www.entemp.ie/publications/labour...



The list of occupations changes frequently, you should contact your local embassy for an up to date information pack.



Alternatively, if you have an Irish parent or grandparent, you can apply for an Irish passport which will entitle you to live and work here for as long as you like.



Accommodation is expensive everywhere, but Dublin is most expensive. Small country towns can be cheap, but may not have a lot of employment. Go to the town where you get work, as the economy is in recession and jobs are getting scarcer.
You can find accommodation/people to share with here:

Ireland is mostly rich farmland so the answer is yes.  Much of their dishes contain meat with veggies added so you might have a problem at a restaurant.  England is well known for the number and quality of its Indian (India) restaurants, I do not know if there are any in Ireland or not.

No you won't have any problems. All supermarkets have a good selection of fresh veg (superior to most other countries I've lived in) all year round and most also carry vegetarian options like tofu, soya products and veggie ready meals. Indian food is very popular here - almost every town has an Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi restaurant - and people like to prepare Indian dishes at home, so rice is readily available even in small shops. We eat/drink lots of dairy products - you will have no problem getting milk although it tastes quite different here than in India. I'm not sure what kind of wheat products you mean, but if you don't find what you need in the supermarkets you should find different types of wholemeal cereal products in health food and organic stores.



In Dublin there are some speciality stores which stock Indian ingredients:
The Asian Food Company on Mary St.
The Asia Market at the back of George's Arcade
Spiceland in Rathmines
(I'm sure there are more but I don't know them)

Life is pretty easy for vegetarians in Ireland... even if you go to a restaurant there always is one or more vegetarian options and you can get plenty of fruit and vegetables in the shops. What doesn't grow locally is imported, so you can pretty much get anything you want, and definitely anything you need, including wheat, rice and milk!



I don't know exactly about food alternatives for Indians, but I know for a fact that a lot of Indians live happily in Ireland.

I recommend you go through the Irish rules of the road and take some online driver theory tests for your own benefit before you drive here.



You can find free tests online here:
http://www.irishmotoring.ie/theorytest/i...



You can download the most up-to-date rules of the road here:
http://www.rsa.ie/PUBLICATIONS/Publicati...



You can watch instructional videos on some of the most important rules from a right-hand-drive perspective here:
http://www.rotr.ie/videos.html



Also bear in mind that the vast majority of people drive a stick shift here, so if you're planning on buying a car you may find automatics hard to come by. If your stay is not going to be a permanent one, a long-term lease agreement from a rental company might be an option to consider. http://www.irishcarleasing.com/
http://www.laserleasing.ie/index.html



Some general guides for newbies to Ireland:
http://www.visitireland.com/planning/dri...
http://www.myguideireland.com/driving-in...
http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g18659...



If you are really unsure of yourself you could always book a couple of driving lessons with an instructor, even to help you navigate around the town you will be living in. They have insider knowledge on the best routes and ways to avoid heavy traffic and can point out anything that you are doing wrong. A 60 minute lesson costs 30-50 euro and is well worth it. Make sure that they are RSA approved.



Good luck!

Hahaha...oh boy. I had loads of fun (actually, terror) trying to learn how to drive on the opposite side of the road. But you catch on quite quickly and actually, driving on the other side of the road makes a heck of a lot more sense. Roundabouts are quite possibly one of the smartest and sensical inventions ever.

No, they are not a delicacy. They are Irish, and it just seems that Irish bars and Irish centers worldwide have latched onto them as being something that epitomises Ireland.



If they really wanted to do something that Irish people wanted, the would import soda bread, potato bread, white pudding, decent rashers;  and then serve decent breakfasts.



Personally, I prefer Walkers, which aren't Irish but are available here, because Tayto seems to ration the flavouring a bit too much.

Yep, they are Irish. They are credited with having developed cheese and onion crisps in 1954, having developed the technology to flavour crisps in the process. The company is owned by Largo Foods.



Tayto crisps, along with Club Orange, Lyons Tea or Barry's Tea, and Galtee or Denny meat products are among the most commonly exported food products to Irish ex-patriates.
Tayto has entered the Irish vocabulary (see Hiberno-English) as a synonym to crisp (noun) and as a genericized trademark, particularly in rural areas.

Well they are an Irish crisp, but nobody would be in a cold sweat if they couldn't get any. If you did want something Irish, homemade brown bread made with buttermilk. A proper fry up with mmmmmm galtee or denny sausages/rasher or even better if you can get the Irish butcher sausages/rashers. Butchers make the nicest white & black pudding.
Back to the crisps, Tayto would be one of my favourites along with hunky dorys. They do taste nice, and in my opinion nicer than Walkers crisps, but that's just my opinion. Others may not agree.

You can't smoke in public places like bars, restaurants, offices etc but you can smoke in your hotel room proving it's a smoking room (or you open the window and do it anyway!), in the streets and any open space. A lot of bars have beer gardens/smoking areas where you can sit at a table and smoke... other don't and you just have to go out and have your cigarette.



Irish people smoke a lot and they quickly learned to cope with the smoking ban! If you come to Ireland keep in mind that a pack of cigarettes cost more than €7, so you're better off packing a carton in your suitcase!

Black tea is the most common type. You can get blends and there has been a rise in popularity of green tea also.



Tea here is normally made with a teabag, milk and optional sugar or sweetener. Some people take their tea black. There is a proper way to brew tea in a tea pot, instead of using a kettle of boiled water and a teabag.



Tetley and Nambarrie are common brands here. Twinings, PG Tips and Punjana are others.

Barrys and Lyons are the most popular. We also have Twinings, Earl Grey and some supermarket brands.



Barrys tea would be my favourite! =]



If you are asking how it is drunk, hot sometimes with milk and sugar. We don't tend to drink iced tea here. That's mostly in American and also some continental countries.

To buy or use a Student Ticket you must have a current Student Travel Card. Ensure the Student Travel Card number is written correctly on ticket before use. The Travel Card must be held with the ticket at all times and must be shown on request to any official.

segosha is an old Irish term of endearment, e.g. "ahh, me 'oul segosha, how are ye". The spelling here is an Anglicized version, in Irish it would be segotia.
segotia: gra, cion, cuid, cumann, stsr mo chrom, srl
Me oul(not gaeilge) is just 'my old'.

Ireland is mostly rich farmland so the answer is yes.  Much of their dishes contain meat with veggies added so you might have a problem at a restaurant.  England is well known for the number and quality of its Indian (India) restaurants, I do not know if there are any in Ireland or not.

No you won't have any problems. All supermarkets have a good selection of fresh veg (superior to most other countries I've lived in) all year round and most also carry vegetarian options like tofu, soya products and veggie ready meals. Indian food is very popular here and people like to prepare Indian dishes at home, so rice is readily available even in small shops. We eat/drink lots of dairy products - you will have no problem getting milk although it tastes quite different here than in India. I'm not sure what kind of wheat products you mean, but if you don't find what you need in the supermarkets you should find different types of wholemeal cereal products in health food and organic stores.



In Dublin there are some speciality stores which stock Indian ingredients:
The Asian Food Company on Mary St.
The Asia Market at the back of George's Arcade
Spiceland in Rathmines
(I'm sure there are more but I don't know them)

We don't speak the language of the country, I mean that very few Irish people really speak the language. Most of us use English.



The country is not densely populated, I think the island as a whole has less than 7 million inhabitants, with the Republic of Ireland having around 4.2 million.



Compared to other English-speaking countries, immigration into Ireland only started in the last 15 years or so. Before then, people tended to emigrate from Ireland to other places.

Well firstly you'll need to know that Ireland isn't a country but an island. That island has two countries on it - 1/The Republic of Ireland and 2/Northern Ireland.



Both of these countries have the most special people living in them. Friendlier than anywhere else in the whole world. And the best pubs. And the best music.

Fiddler's Green maybe? It's about where fishermen go when they die, although there's no mention of a wife, just boys and mates. Maybe Fiddler's Green is a gay bar for dead fishermen.

Yes honda and toyota hybrids.
ECO ola are a company that produces biofuel here.
iesels using bio fuels is not new here , the lord mayor of dublin had a bio diesel volkswagen in the 1980.
There is a freight company here in galway that is producing and using biodiesel in their trucks and selling it to the public soon.
You can also get bio ethanol in my town (E46).

Toyota announced that sales of the Prius in Ireland reached the 1,000 mark in 2007, with 50% more cars sold between 06-07 than in the 3 years previous to that. The Prius is the most popular hybrid car in Ireland.



A lot of vintage car enthusiasts are experimenting with DIY conversions and biofuels, but there are no official figures on this. You could try forums like http://www.boards.ie and http://www.eircooled.com to find out more, but I don't think they keep any stats.



There's a guy in Waterford who runs free demonstrations on how to make biofuel - he might be worth contacting for more info:

There is a filling station near me that sells bio-fuel, rather cheaper than unleaded (which I use), but the guy serving behind the counter said we'd have to refill at least twice as often, so apart from eco issues, there's be no savings.



I don't know anyone with a hybrid or electric car, but read headlines today online which sounds like these could be coming our way soon.

Do you think Ireland has a credible political party?



FF have just shown what a shower of shite they are. In the boom they spent every penny while trying to persuade everyone else to save for a rainy day. Now we are knackerd the fact they are playing Billy Brennan is even more obvious.



FG have some bloody good minds in there, and I think Richard Bruton would make an excellent Taoiseach, but as long as Enda Kenny is the front man they lack credibility to me at least.



The Greens are FF's bidet.



The PDs are FF's broken bidet.



The shinners, well, if their was any substance to their claim to no longer be the 'politcal wing of the IRA', and be committed to peace and so forth now, why did THEY claim the IRA was not involved in a recent murder, but even if this were the case, their only policies seem to be debunk everyone else's policies but not come up with their own.

Nothing to add to that, Sarah. You're absolutely right. I've been flirting with the idea of becoming a Labour supporter recently, but our local representative has just come out against the reintroduction of university fees, so I'm afraid that's them out - fees are another one of my bugbears, since they were abolished the number of working class kids attending uni has fallen, not risen. No one left but the independents. Here in Tipp North, that means Michael Lowry, a man who will serve as anyone's professional bidet, for a fee, of course. What a joke.



Where can I find a pro-Europe, pro-immigration, pro-choice, socially and fiscally responsible candidate with a proven track record of sound policy choices and honesty, committed to improving the health services and bringing about total public sector reform and rehabilitation while maintaining the economy's competitive edge?

Find a castle to stay in, those are so awesome.  Tour old historic sites because they are so cool.  We stayed in Northumbria (Great Britain, not Ireland, but close) and the castles were so amazing.  There are several that operate as hotels, and it is an unforgettable experience to stay in a castle.
Basically....umm....you need to know WHAT TO DO on your honeymoon?  LOL

I will move from Belgium where I could never got used to the quite boring social life ( no offense to the belgians :).

A sliotar (or sliothar - may derive from Irish sliabh, meaning "mountain" and thar meaning "across"), pronounced /ʃlʲɪt̪ˠəɾˠ/, is a hard solid sphere slightly larger than a tennis ball, consisting of a cork core covered by two pieces of leather stitched together. Sometimes called a "puck" or "hurling ball", it resembles an American baseball with more pronounced stitching. It is used in the Gaelic games of hurling, camogie, rounders and shinty.

A question about Manderley Castle?



Ok, so I have this project in my english class to do. I have to take a trip somewhere and pretty much log absolutely everything I do.



I chose Dublin Ireland. And one of the places I would like to "visit" is Manderley Castle, home of my favorite singer, Enya.
I've been looking all over the internet trying to see if there is anyway to tour the castle or at least get near it, since a celebrity lives there and all. But, I haven't found anything helpful.
Does anyone happen to know any information about this castle, or any websites that could possibly help me?

You can't visit it I'm afraid - it's Enya's private home and she has had a number of scary security breaches in the past from stalkers.  I found the following info from nationwide.com and wikipedia.  Hope it helps.



Manderley Castle (Irish: Caisleán Mhanderley)(formely Victoria Castle and Ayesha Castle) is a large castellated Irish Mansion house built in the Victorian style, which is situated on Victoria Road, Killiney, County Dublin. Crenellation (is the name for the distinctive pattern that frames the tops of the walls of many medieval castles, often called battlements. ..



From the roof of its crenellated turret, it looks over the Irish coastline as far as Wales. Manderley Castle, then known as Victoria Castle, was built in 1840 by Robert Warren to commemorate Britain's Queen Victoria's accession to the throne and is surrounded by three-and-a-half acres of manicured gardens, threaded with sylvan walks. A secret tunnel at the bottom of the garden used to give access to Killiney beach, but it has been cealed off since.[



The interior was gutted by fire in 1928 and was magnificently restored by Sir Thomas Power of the celebrated whiskey family. He renamed it Ayesha Castle after the goddess who rose from the flames in Rider Haggard's novel She. The Aylmer Family lived in the grade I-listed building since 1947.[



The castle was bought by Irish musician Enya in 1997 for €3.8 million, reportedly outbidding Michael Flatley, who also viewed the house. Because of her love for Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel, Rebecca, she renamed it Manderley, which is the name of a fictional house that plays a central role in the book. Because of some serious threats from stalkers, Enya has already made substantial reinforcements to the security of Manderley Castle. She installed new solid timber entrance gates, raised the surrounding 45 yards of stone wall to more than 9ft and added 4ft railings on top of some sections.Despite this, around mid-August 2005, there were two separate security breaches at the castle, and Enya was present on both occasions (her security system includes a panic room).

You're better off finding some other castle to visit, I would suggest one of the places that actually let tourists in. You'll probably find lots of those at this website: www.discoverireland.ie.



Incidentally, celebrities live in Ireland because we leave them alone. The actor Jeremy Irons has (or was that had) a home in West Cork, not far from a village, and this attracted many many fans - but none of the locals would help them find the house, because they respected his privacy.

Enya is a very private person and doesn't have tours of her home. Enya has had 2 stalkers in the 11 years she has lived in Manderlay Castle and has raised the height of the wall surrounding her home twice. The wall is 9 feet tall with 4 foot high railings in some places. You can read a bit about the castle on the wikipedia web site below.

I wouldn't say you're our closest allies, but you certainly are close friends and have been for a long time - until of course your President decided to launch an illegal war on the Middle East and his administration bullied our government into letting him land aircraft at Shannon that were in transit to and from that illegal war .... and the thing that pissed me off about so many of you was that you kept spouting on about how it was fighting for freedom and truth and all kinds of other absolute hokum, when the dogs in the street knew it was all about the oil .... and what REALLY got up my nose was this know-it-all attitude that we OWED them our unquestioning support for that illegal war, didn't they fight in our wars, liberate us from the Nazis, and didn't American companies provide jobs in Ireland? No, they stepped in at a time that made them look good, and most of the funding for those American companies in Ireland came from the European Union.



The problem is, so many of them believe their own hype. But there are enough of them that don't to give me hope for the country.



Don't get me wrong, I like people, and will talk to anyone, regardless of their nationality. But I have very little liking or respect for sheep that walk on two legs and carry a passport.



I do enjoy how predictable Americans can be sometimes. At the moment, they are reeling from the fact that their dollar gets them diddly squat over here, while the Euro is the currency of the moment. Suddenly Europe is SO expensive! Hello? Two things, mate: It's your bloody currency that's weak, and try living in Europe. I'm a bit gripey about this because I was in Italy and Spain over the past few months and the only Americans I heard were the ones complaining about the cost of everything. I suppose someone had told them their dollar went a long way? Those days are over. I'm sorry they are disappointed, but not that sorry. I mean, that's life!



And as to their predictability: I was born and reared in Ireland, and no matter where I go, any Yank I meet, as soon as they hear I'm from Ireland, I get this: "Oh, my great-grandmother's people were Murphys from Galway, do you know them?" In a way it's so predictable as to be endearing, so I'm almost sorry to tell them, no I don't know them, and frankly I don't care either. I usually get asked something along those lines within five minutes of meeting them!



I've met a lot of Yanks in Ireland, and in mainland Europe, and I travelled to the US once, but it was such a different culture to what I was used to, and the people were so into money and talking about sex, that I haven't been back. I was lonely there, I missed people who spoke my language! Yes, everyone spoke English, but no-one talked about good books or films, and they had some odd ideas about Europe, which they would not hear challenged. No, I'm in no hurry to go back, even though my money would go quite far. I'm perfectly happy to meet them here.

Irish and British history is not that simple, nor is our relationship with the USA.  Alliances are not simple things based on whether or not you like someone or not.  If you ask questions that require complex answers then you're going to hear a lot of things you don't like.

As you can see - there is plenty of stereotyping and bigotry in Ireland. This woman visited America once (likely NY or FL) and made some pretty quick judgements. She doesn't know the US at all, and she is as arrogant as she accuses Americans of being. Life is simple when you are prejudiced. US = bad

its a 50/50 kinda thing some are sound and some are irritating!
you could meet an American who is like anyone else want to talk to and up for a laugh and be a very interesting person
the other type would be the hated type the one who presumes without knowing the facts eg. (America is the best country ever! --- have you ever been anywhere else? --- no when I go on holidays I just go to another state! ---
then how do you know?)  &lt;&lt;&lt; noone wants to know!



most people I know listen to Americans speaking to each other before they make up their minds about the individual!
sometimes they come out with some right clangers that has everyone in stiches!

The ones that annoy me personally almost always without fail have an unfeasibly large camera around their neck, talk about how things are so much bigger and better back home, and presume to give us a one-sided lecture on Irish history and how great-granddaddy fought the Brits back in 1922.

For Northern Ireland you don't have to do anything,it's part of Britain.

When you apply under the parentage rule you still need to provide the long form of your own birth certificate as well as your Irish parents birth certificate & if necessary, their marriage certificate.



Short answer, yes, you need to provide the long form of your birth cert - ask your mother/father if they have a copy, they should have been provided with one when you were born, there must be a copy somewhere as you can't a British passport without one.  You could also try contacting these guys:

Where to go at New Year in Dublin?



Me and 8 of my friends (a mixed group from ages of 21-40) are going to dublin for New Year. As we've never been before we're looking for somewhere to go on New Years eve where we could maybe see a good DJ (someone like erol alkan?). Either that or just a good club with great music that isnt ridiculously expensive. And if anyone knows of any other events on in Dublin between the 30th and 2nd that'd be great. Thanks!

Try a few places on Aston Quay. Its relatively close to Temple Bar. I think there is a Jury's Inn there and a few other hotels. Good location.

No cheap hotels in Dublin city centre at all anymore. But try www.hostelworld.com for cheap accommodation, there are plenty of hostels in the city.



Don't forget to bring lots of money with you. You're going to need it.

There are some great hostels close to Temple Bar and O'Connel Street. Off the top of my head: Ashfield House (a block away from Temple Bar and O'Connel Street) and St. John Gogarty (in the heart of Temple Bar). I prefer Ashfield if you can get a bed.

Check out this link http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-... , I stayed here recently and it was fine, right in the middle of Temple Bar, perfect for restaurants, bars and the like, you can walk to anywhere in the city centre from here, very busy area , very safe even late at night,
hope this helps

You're going to have to call them if it's one of them number recognition places.Otherwise on the day you'll have to press for the attendant and see if he can sort it.Go a bit early in that case.
Check the site you booked at.They might have a FAQ section that covers that problem.

It depends on what you want to do. For nature/ old Ireland sightseeing I would go to Kerry and drive the ring. Visit Dingle,Tralee, and Kilarney. There is an airport in Kilarney served by Ryan air and Air Lingus. Otherwise I'd stay in Dublin. Temple bar is great fun as is the Guinness tour and the national Art Gallery in Merrion Square. It is an under appreciated  treasure.

the Natural history museum is good,
St.Stephens Green Park is beautiful its like a square and you can walk around it there is lovely flowers and a pond with little bridges..there is also horse and carts outside the park and they give you a ride around the streets.. a really nice park and also just off the park there is a street called Grafton Street. There is loads of shops there and some good resturants and cafes... you could make a day out of that..there is also tour buses that go around the city you'll see the bus stops for them so just keep your eyes peeled! Wherever your staying I'm sure you'll be able to get maps for directions ect. If you want to go outside the city centre there is buses and trains. There is some lovely harbours  and villages outside of the city centre just like 30mins/1hr away... Such as Howth, Malahide(in malahide there is a castle) ect.



For night time there is some good restaurants in the city centre there will be so many too choose from you will not be stuck for choice!



I hope i helped you! Have a great time in Dublin!

I don't think they'd need to have been rich in Tallaght to be seen as quite wealthy in Roscommon. House prices anywhere in Dublin are higher than they are anywhere else in the country, and Belgard is a fairly well-established area where houses fetch a good price. Lots of nurses and teachers live in  the area, although they are hardly the wealthiest strata of society.



By selling a house in Tallaght and moving to Roscommon where houses are relatively cheap, they might have been able to buy their house outright without a mortgage. Anyone who can manage to live mortgage free is in a pretty good position financially. I don't think this makes them rich though, just clever.



I'm making a huge generalisation here, but people who are wealthy in the way that most people understand tend to live at more prestigious addresses like Mount Merrion, Dalkey or Killiney. Not Tallaght.

Eddie Doyle in Blackrock is absolutely excellent, and cute with it. His junior stylists are well-trained and cost about 50% less:
http://www.hairperceptions.ie/pricelist....



Other than that, the Peter Mark salons are decent enough, they're a bit cheaper than Toni & Guy if you don't request a particular stylist. They also have a training salon on the upper floor of the Stephen's Green Shopping Centre where you can get your hair done at discount prices by a trainee under the supervision of an experienced stylist - I used to go there all the time when I was a student and never came away crying:

English, with a very thick Irish accent. Although some regions in Ireland still speak Irish Gaelic you will definitely be fine if you only speak english.

English.  Some people do speak Irish, but everyone speaks English.  I'm curious as to why you'd think we speak Dutch though..

The Cork area is nice...Blarney Castle is very close.  Bunratty Castle near Shannon is a good experience as well.  And nearby is Durty Nelly's, a pub established in 1620.  The Rock of Cashel is also a great stop.
