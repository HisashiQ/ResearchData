Okaaay. You need to write an essay here and address the following:

Define Imitation of Life as a commonly used literary device (use citations from the field this test is covering - theater, film, lit, etc.)

Critique the concept. Strengths of use include aiding in content credibility and suspension of belief because the target audience can relate to the topic. Then critique the shortcomings of I of L overreaching into melodrama and give examples of how this damages Art and Audience.

Finally, apply these arguments to Sirkian lit. Did he avoid the shortcomings, employ  them with good effect or employ them with poor effect in your opionion and in the pieces your were assigned?

Well, you could mention that Tom hasn't seen or heard from William in two weeks (or was it three?) and that he's worried, mention that he found the belt, mention the bombs - bear in mind that a lot of people died in london every single day, and Tom loved that kid and he's worried.  Try and put yourself in his shoes and you'd know what to say.

Here's two:

roll & hole
dove & dub



Sorry I can't do proper notation on this computer.

The problem with the other one is that very few words have /r/ in final location in English, most words that end in 'r' don't have that sound but an elongation of the final vowel or a schwa.

Because people's homes were located close to those of their neighbors, the people there were more socially engaged than people who lived in larger cities. Unlike Ingemar's urban  hometown, the people in this town were more friendly and the adults around him took good care of him. These scenes made the audience feel that living in a rural area is much more comfortable and friendlier experience.

An example of a "professional" paper is called an MLA report. The margins are to be set up at 1" on all sides. Depending on your teacher's instructions, it's usually double-spaced. Your name, teacher, class, and date are supposed to be aligned to the left. A proper essay has 5 paragraphs (intro, body [3 paragraphs supporting your main idea], and the conclusion]. As a header, align it to the right and type your last name then page number. Don't forget to include a cover page and a Works Cited page. And of course, proofread and spell check.

Good luck on your future papers.

Green galoshes day (green can be environmentally OK galoshes as well as green in color)

Yowling Yellow for Young'uns--the three youngest people wear yellow

Baby blue belts for Tuesday (see below)

Royal Purple for People of Particular Prominence

Orange overcoats or anything for Only Children. All only children wear something orange (not necessarily an overcoat) to signify they're different, as orange is an uncommon color



This is pretty forced, but it's the best I could do. My parents used to recite the depressed man's chant for the days of the week:

Glumday
Bluesday
Deadday
Dirtday
Dieday
Dratday
Doneday

The last five alliterate, but they don't help you much with colors. Maybe "bluesday" does.

Rainbows of happiness to you in the project.

First investigate the cause of their grudge.  Now, talk to them and tell them to disregard that feeling and work as a group, if one of them or both of them doesn't or dont listen to you, you have to tell this to your teacher and ask her/him what's the best way to resolve your problem.  Hope this will help you.

crux i get is this --- 2 gals fought over a issue which is not clear to u why they fought , n there is huge communication gap btw them , but u don't want loose marks due to this fight so u r worried

i want to suggest you a basic funda this will be usefl in every sector that is communication notes
Effective Communication Fundamentals
Communication is the complex two-way process, involving encoding, translation and the decoding of the messages. The effective communication requires a communicator to translate their messages in the way which is specifically designed for the intended audience.
Creating and delivering the effective presentation requires basic understanding of a communication process. Most of the business presentations require a clear and an unambiguous communication of the message in the way which can be clearly understood by a recipient.



Tps for Effective Communication



·



Be honest while communicating. Dishonesty will somewhere show up along a line.



·



Take interest in the people you are communicating with. Remember the people are more attracted towards those who have interest in them, and pays more attention to what they say.



·



Think before you speak or put pen to paper: what message you trying to convey? What outcome do you want to elicit?



·



Be direct and not aggressive. Lot of flannelling around can make the people lose interest and miss a vital point.



·



Don't use the jargon – and acronyms, and also the technical expressions, unless you are sure about that your listeners do understand



·



Write the way as you will speak. Do not fall into a trap of using the long words just because it is written down.



·



Take time. Whether in the speech or in paper, rushing will make you seem nervous, unconfident and like downright scared.



Ten Tips for Good Interpersonal Skills



Listen to the person first. Communication is the two-way process; getting all your message across depends on understanding a other person. 
Be interested in people you will be communicating with. Remember that the people are more attracted towards those who have interest in them, and therefore will pay more attention to what they will say. 
Relax. The bad body language like hunched shoulders, fidgeting, the toe-tapping or the hair-twiddling all give a game away. 
Smile and use the eye contact. It is a most positive signal which you can give. 
Ask the questions. It is great way to show the people that you really are interested in them. 
If the other person has different point of view towards you find out why they have such point of view. More you understand reasons behind their thinking more you will be able to understand their point of view or can help them understand your point of view. 
Be assertive. so that we can try to value their input as your own inputs. Do not be pushy and do not be a pushover. Try for a right balance. 
When you will be speaking try to be enthusiastic in appropriate context. Use voice and the body language to show this. 
Immediately don't try to latch to something which someone has just now said ... "oh yes it happened to me" and immediately go on and telling your own story. Make sure that you ask questions about them first and then be careful while telling your story so as not to sound like a competition. 
Learn from the interactions. If you have a good conversation with someone try to think why it all went well and remember key points for the next time. If it did not go well - again try and learn something out of it.
Body Language
We all do communicate with one another through our look as well as what we do say and how do we sound. In fact what our body is doing while we are talking (i.e. the body language) could often play much greater part in the communication than we do think.



Most obvious form of the paralanguage is the body language or the kinesics . This is a language of the gestures, expressions, and the postures. In North America, for the instance, we commonly use arms and shake hands and say good-bye, point, count, express an excitement, beckon, warn away, a threaten, etc. In fact, we will learn many subtle variations of each of the gestures discussed above and make use of these gestures situation. We will use head to either say yes or to say no, to smile, frown, and wink acknowledgement or flirtation. The head and the shoulder in combination may shrug to indicating that we do not know something about the topic.



The eye contact
The eye contact helps to create the better interaction and the rapport with the listeners. Always try to look at listener at the end of the sentence to reinforce a message in that sentence.



The gesture
The gestures can help to give your voice the extra energy and the confidence Try to gesture on some of the key words – this will give the words a greater emphasis.



The Presence
Adopt ‘Anchor Position’ whenever you do want to keep the body language calm and controlled. While sitting do keep the small of back into back of the chair. This will help and support your posture and do maintain the energy and the confident style. Aim to keep the body language op

let x = first integer
next = x + 2 (since both are odd)
last = x + 4

3x = 3 + 2(x+4)
Distribute out of parentheses
3x = 3 + 2x+ 8
Combine like terms
3x = 2x + 11
Subtract 2x from both sides
x = 11
x + 2 = 13
x + 4 = 15

Whichever one you feel strongest about, it is easier to make a speech in front of people when you really get into the topic.

Legal abortion is a good topic, people feel passionate about that and it will certainly grab attention.

Here's a good point to make, a woman should have the choice to have HER body change permanantly to have a child.

Those are pretty controversial topics and probably most everyone will choose it. How about raising the driving age to 18? This is a new topic. Personally I'm all for it. There are too many distractions for a kid 16 to be driving, radio, phone, GPS, friends. Heck there are too many distractions for an adult. They say the recent train wreck was because the engineer was texting at the time of the crash.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I would say that it is the same as a regular retailer.  The difference is the medium by which the products are sold are strictly digital.



For example about a year ago the large computer retailer CompUSA filed for bankruptcy.  Their stores across America closed down.  However recently they reopened as an online retailer.

http://www.compusa.com/

They actually do more business with for less cost.  This is because they can afford to only fire webmaster master professionals instead of a bunch of underskilled employees.  In addition an online store does not need to spend money on maintenence of the store such as building permits, and electricity.  They do however have a cost associated with maintenance of their servers, but that is minimal in comparison.

I believe they will still have a traditional business model in terms of their chain of resources.



Their HR deptartment will handle issues such as customer service, returns, and fault devices.



Their tech support will obviously technical questions.



They will have a series of administrators who manage the databases which keep track of secured customer information, and the distribution of their products.



Overall online is the better way to go.  Again this is because you don't have to hire a bunch of employees to babysit the store.  I say babysit because most of the time I have to explain myself when I ask them computer questions about products they should be familiar with.  Most of the time I know more than the employee that handles the product on a daily basis.  With online however, the physical staff is reduced to more intensly trained experts.

Oh by the way, about the storefront.  Comp USA is well known so it uses its name as a store front.  For small businesses the biggest problem is getting known, and becoming a trusted provider.  This is done by establishing an account with a known online distribution market such as E-Bay or PayPal.  Through PayPal customers are ensured that their money is secure and if they buy something they will receive it.

Jamestown: First English Colony in America
Explorers had been landing in America for some time before English settlers arrived in what is now Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. But it was in that spot on the James River that English colonization began and with it, the history of America.



America's first elected assembly, the House of Burgesses, met in Jamestown for the first time on July 30, 1619. This group boasted many famous members through the years, including Patrick Henry, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.

I'm not sure if I am answering the is correctly but goggle Mabinogi (wikipidea), 
The Mabinogion is a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts. They draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs, and on early medieval historical traditions. And while some details may hark back to older Iron Age traditions, each of these tales is the product of a highly developed Welsh narrative tradition, both oral and written.

Normally it means either something that costs less than the normal price--it could be a trip with coach air fare and a stay at a lower quality motel or even a hostel.  It could also be a larger sized package of something for the same price as the usual, smaller package.

I presume that you are speaking about some product that is marketed as an economy package.  This usually means that you get the most (of the product) for your money.  For example; let's look at laundry detergent.  This would probably be the biggest bottle or box and in theory the unit cost (per oz.) is the lowest.

It would normally mean that you will be spending less money on it than you normally would or would expect to.

This can be achieved in many different ways :

1) By removing any unnecessary "frills". Maybe, if this is a tour package you may be staying at a 4 star or 3 star hotel instead of a 5 star hotel.

2) By reducing costs like delivery costs, etc. You may have to pick up the goods yourself instead of having them delivered to you.

3) By removing some services or goods unnecessary to the main product. For example, in a budget or economy airline, no food will be served on short flights.



4) By simplifying packaging. For example, the box that the stuff comes in may not be fancy, just a plain box.

and any number of other things.



Hope this helps

Could u proofread this short paragraph

In 1996 a very close relative to our family started the construction of his residence. My father was the person in charge in this construction and he managed the process every week. My father is not an architect or has any study related with the field, but he was given this position thanks to his knowledge learned from experience. I used to accompany him almost every week to check how the residence construction was going. I saw this project process since the place was an empty terrain until the huge residence was completely done. I realized many aspects contractors face while developing a project; and also, I felt surprise to see a real structure built after being seen it on drawings only. This experience influenced me even more to pursue architecture as a profession

In 1996, a close relative began the construction of his residence and appointed my father project manager. My father is not an architect nor has he completed any formal study in the field; he was given this position thanks to his wide experience in construction. I used to accompany him almost every week to check on the building. I saw this project progress from a greenfield site to final completion. During this time, I became of the numerous issues contractors face in bringing a project to conclusion. What remains with me most of all, however, was the profound pleasure I felt at seeing a real structure come to fruition from drawings on paper. This experience definitely influenced in my choice of architecture as a profession.

My father is not an architect and does not have any formal education in architecture or construction but, was handed this position based on his knowledge gained from first-hand experience. I used to accompany him to the construction site every week to check the progress of the construction. I have seen the process of the construction from the beginning when the residence was an empty lot to the the final completion of his residence. I never realized how many issues and problems contractors face while developing a project. I also felt amazed to see the realization  of the finished physical structure after seeing it in the beginning as a

In 1996, a close relative started the construction of their new home.  My father was put in charge of the construction and he managed the project every week.  My father is not an architect; nor has he studied anything related to this field, but was given this position due to the knowledge he had gained from previous experiences in this profession.

I used to accompany him, almost every week, to check on how the construction was going.  I saw the many different phases of the project as they proceeded; transforming what was once empty terrain into a beautiful home at its completion.  Along the way, I realized many of the aspects and decisions contractors face while developing a project.  I also felt rewarded to see the real structure completed after seeing it only in drawings.  The experience influenced me immensely and ultimately convinced me to pursue architecture as a profession.

I hope you don't mind some of the embellishments.  I don't feel it changed the point of what I thought you were trying to say.  Good Luck with whatever you needed this for!

In 1996 a close relative began the construction of his residence.  He made my father the "project manager"-- a catch-all phrase for designer, draftsment, and builder.



My father has not completed any formal study in architecture or in any related field.  He was given this position because of his vast experience in hands-on construction.  Growing up, I used to make weekly trips to the city to check on the building.



I saw it progress from a thought to a sketch to a greenfield site to final completion.  During this time, I learned of the numerous issues contractors face in bringing a project to conclusion.  What remains with me most of all, however, was the profound pleasure I felt at seeing a real structure come to fruition from drawings on paper. These experiences made me want to become an architect.
