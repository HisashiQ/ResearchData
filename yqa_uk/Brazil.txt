I'm more jealous of him. Driving the fastest car on earth and dating pussyscatt dolls.

I have to admit my fav driver is kimi. Ice cool and knows when to party without bringing attention to himself.

I suppose you are an admirer of the number one bully and crap driver Schumaker? I note that he continues his disastrous driving on the public roads both here in the UK and in Germany.

Lewis Hamilton obviously has talent, something which Schumaker sadly lacked.

Hate is a strong word. Why do you hate a "sportsman" who has done nothing to you? This is an idiot statement.

What time is it in Brazil when it is 15.00hrs in London, between now and 12 December?



Please can someone just tell me this answer simply? I understand that Brazil is either 3 or 4 hours behind London time, depending on Daylight Saving Time, but can't figure out when this change happens, etc.
