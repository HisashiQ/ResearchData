It depends what type of sky box you have as the sky plus ones are coded and if the dvd recorder isnt tuned into the box correctly you wont be able to record programmes anyway, If you go into the tuning menu for the dvd recorder and see what the set up is its recording source should be the signal from the sky box if your dvd recorder lets you monitor the input source put the sky box on a channel that isnt on the normal tv like sky one and tune the input source till you see the programme thats on there then select ok or enter on dvd recorder that should mean when you record thats what youll get whatevers on the sky box if that doesnt work call an engineer sky and independants charge but if you want to record sky youll have to cough up to do it

if it is a plug that you do not have to put a fuse in then yes it will work ok  the advantage of having a fuse is that if any thing goes wrong then the fuse will blow first if you feel unsafe there is nothing stoping you puting a plug on that has a fuse inside

if you just plug it in it won't work without the fuse, you should check with radio shack to see if they have something comparable or you could bypass the fuse with a jumper wire between the fuse connections but that is only a temporary fix and your T.V. Will Blow Up eventually possibly causing a fire so don't leave it plugged in when your not home and keep a fire extiguiser handy when you are watching it.

Because it's a useful feature for many people, especially those who don't have Sky or Freesat or some other service and want the digital channels without the hassle of an extra box, extra wires, extra remote, etc.

Also, freeview receivers have reached the price point now where it barely costs anything to include one in the TV, so they may as well just stick one in anyway.

And if you don't need the built-in freeview, just don't use it! There's no harm in having it in there, even if it's just sitting there unused.

By the end of 2012 all the standard channels will be switched off, so everybody will need a freeview box to watch tv without subscription. Therefore it doesn't make sense for company's to continue making non-digital tvs since the analogue format is dead. I think you can still get one without freeview, and fairly cheap. You can get one here for Â£360 for a samsung: http://www.pixmania.co.uk/uk/uk/974617/a...

Hi there,

If you have a TV that is in use in the premises then you will need a TV Licence.  If you have a television, or anything else that can be used to record or watch live TV, such as a DVD Recorder, PVR, Sky+ even a computer with internet connection or anything similar, but it is not being used you may not have to buy a TV Licence.

If you have these items in your household and are not using it, you can send a letter to TV Licencing to inform them of this. They will keep this notice on record and may send an inspector to check to make sure you are not using any appliances that can receive a television signal.

As some of the other answers have stated you can set up monthly direct debits and payment plans with TV Licencing so you can spread the cost of your licence throughout the year.

The best thing would be to call TV Licencing on 0844 800 6779.

Hope this helps you out.

Does your TV have any red/white audio OUTPUTs? If so, just run cables from that to you stereo. If you don't, do you have a headphone jack? If so, you can buy a headphone to red/white audio cable. You can usually find those in stores near the mp3 players and iPods.

Why does my Mitsubishi WD 65831 shut off?



I have a Mitsubishi WD 65831 TV. I have had this annoying problem with it, and that is that sometimes it shuts off. It says "TV will turn off in a few minutes, please check airflow in back". This can happen even when I just turn it on (within 2 minutes) and I have an extra fan in the back drawing air OUT OF the tv. Plenty of space behind unit for airflow. Did I mention the room temperature being around 60F. Any solutions will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

How can I tell if a tv is analog or digital?



I have no idea.  I'm trying to find out if I need converter boxes.  Is there a list of tv's?  A date if they were manufactured before or after?



Thanks for any ideas.

The easiest way is to look at the picture, if you have a ghost or noise on the screen, you are looking at an analog set.  With digital you will not get ghost or noise. You get a crisp clean picture.

Doesn't matter about the tv so much as to what kind of signal is going into the back of the tv. you can have a top of the line High Def tv running off a set of rabbit ear antenna and it will not work next year. You can also have a tv that is over 5 years old if it is recieving it's data from a cable box or satellite you will be fine next year. So in the end if your tv handles the standard three colored cable the most you'll need is a converter box if there is no cable/satellite at your place. If it is an older tv that has the co-ax cable connections it may be time to upgrade the tv or you'll need a RF box as well as the converter box

An "HDTV ready" TV should have DVI or HDMI connector and would need an external OTA, cable, or satellite box to get HDTV or other digital channels.  Component (which is actually analog) may be able to do HDTV modes from OTA, cable, or satellite, but not from DVD (since component does not do HDCP copy protection).

If it is an actual HDTV it should have something about digital in its menus (besides DVI or HDMI connector).  Any TV manufactured since July 2007 should have an ATSC (digital) tuner.

In any case docs for the TV should say if it has an ATSC tuner (assuming USA) and whether is supports HDTV video modes (720p, 1080i, or 1080p).  If not you would at least need one of the digital converter boxes to if you want to receive over the air TV. The cheap boxes with $40 coupon only do composite output (yellow video plug, and red/white sound).

A very simple way to tell if your tv is digital is to look at your remote control. It must be the original factory packed remote that came with the tv. If it is a digital tv the remote will have a decimal point "." or a dash "-" under the 7 or 9 button. No decimal or dash, then you have an analog tv.

BTW, you need a converter box only if you use an antenna. Cable users will supported by their cable company.

The best way is to turn the TV on, wait for the picture to come on, so you can see a station, then unplug the antenna, if it goes to snow then blue/black screen (or even straight to blue/black) it's analog, if the picture freezes for a bit, then says "no signal" you've got digital.

The most accurate way is to look at the owner's manual or Google the model number.  What you are looking for is if the set has an "ATSC" tuner.  ATSC is the North American (US, Canada, Mexico) standard for free Over The Air digital signals.  The set may also have a "QAM" tuner; QAM is the North American standard for digital cable.

If the set boasts "MTS" sound, it is probably an analog set. MTS (Multichannel Television Sound) was the US standard for Stereo TV.

If you continue to have problems, post the brand and model number from the sticker on the back of the set and I'll look it up for you.

I hope this helps.  Please return and select a Best Answer from all of those submitted.

A 1080p HD LCD TV is anyday better than a plasma screen TV. Have you noticed on a plasma screen if you change your viewing angle, the image does so dark. Something that does not happen in an LCD.

I won't be able to give any technical details but surely a HD LCD is anyday better. Check out Sony Bravia. It rocks!

Plasma has a deeper, richer color and display.

LCD is cheaper and usually has a very loud, sharp image that only 'wows' you at the beginning.

Plasma is certainly better, but more expensive.

Which DTV converter box is the "best" bang for the buck?



I'm looking at getting a converter box for my TV. The city I live in decided to up the ante and switch over early. At the end of last month actually... So, no TV for me right now. Despite the extra time I have now, I need to make a decision for what I want to get soon as I have a coupon for the $40 off already and it will be expiring soon.

Out of the options available right now, I'm leaning towards one of the three models below with the main reason that is pulling me towards each option. There seems to be few reviews that do any direct comparisons though, and I was wondering if anyone out there could vouch for one or the other to help me make a better decision.

TIVAX STB-T8 - seems to be good reviews for picture quality (++++)

RCA DTA800 - More TV codes for the remote(for controlling both TV and box with the same remote) (++)

Zenith DTT901 - people cite it for a good value, but pricing is pretty comparable with the other models right now... (+)

http://dtvconverterboxes.blogspot.com/
http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/archive/i...

I've dug around quite a bit in these 2 sites already... not sure if I agree fully with everything they say though and I'm not yet convinced with one option or another. As you can see, I am leaning towards the TIVAX model, but I'm not yet sold on it. So, are there any other good converters available now that you can recommend and what are the reasons why you would select them?

(First, look at the AVS CECB page and not the archive page you linked to.)



I've been digging for info since Janurary and have come up with this decision tree.



Best converter unless you have a special need:
Zenith DTT901 (or its clone, the Insignia model at Best Buy)
(I have 2 or the Insignia models)

If you need something with a simple remote control. (simple box for elderly or non-tech people. I'm looking for one now for an elderly relative):
RCA DTA 800B1

If you want S-video to get a bit more picture quality:
Channel Master CM-7000

If you are using it with a VCR or analog recorder  without an IR blaster:
Zinwell ZAT-970A

Best converter for use with 12 Volt power :
Artec T3AP-Pro

Cheapest box:
Echostar TR-40. Can be used with VCR etc. The newest software for it seems to have fixed most of the quirks in the earlier production

I've tried lots of online coupon sites that either don't get updated on a regular basis or don't have any coupons worth using.



However, I found one great free site where I get loads of free online coupons. There's always hundreds on there from major brands so I save money on my shopping every single week.

Without question, the 'general' answer to your 'general' question is plasma. Best at producing true color and blacks, as well as -0- lag time in fast movement, like action movies and sports. Read about it at www.cnet.com. All the "I like lcd" answers are somewhere between ignorant and stupid.
