They are a collection of like-minded people (a fairly small collection, I suspect) who seem to believe that the government or some other State organization is trying to control their thoughts electronically.



I think the content of their website gives lie to that theory.

Question about British law system?



Ok so i was reading the new's even thow they lie a lot but it was a story about four men who were jailed for armed robbery and one of the men was jailed for armed robbery and murder he recieved 45 months for robbery and 21 years for murder the other three men got 5 years for robbery plus possesion of firearm,8 years for robbery and 7 years for robbery to run concurrent with an attempted murder charge of 14 year's all of these men worked together and commited 28 robbery's between them this was in the UK but in America i heard that a man was jailed for 23 year's for Armed robbery on his own and he did it just once and he had to do 23 year's before parole and he used a hammer instead of a gun.So why does someone in UK get 8 years for armed robbery plus possesion of a gun but someone in America got 23 years for armed robbery with a hammer and commited the robbery once?

The British system of sentencing is far different from the American. Here, it is very unlikely that anyone serves a full life sentence, for example. There are sentencing guidelines which judges take into account - I don't think such exist in the USA. On the other hand, we are far more strict about guns. The American system seems to be (looking at it as an outsider) far more designed as a punitive system only, ours has ideals of being not only that but reformatory also. Whether it works is a different matter. Which is better is a matter for constant debate. It does seem to me, however, that there is more crime in the USA than here, by and large.

Mens rea with regard to careless driving?



I'm not sure if I have understood this concept so could someone let me know if this sounds right?
I am doing a report for my studies on a case I watched in court where the defendant was charged with driving without due care and attention.  I am writing about the moral side of the offence (he dropped a cigarette on his leg and was distracted) and I don't think he did anything morally wrong.  I was going to say that if he was intentionally driving dangerously he would, under mens rea (did I use this correctly?) be morally guilty, but as he was charged with careless driving he is not morally guilty.  Is this right or way off?  Can anyone help please?  Thank you!



</question>



<additional details>



I also read that for something to be 'criminal' there needs to be a moral wrongdoing.  So how does this fit in?  I don't see it as morally wrong just a natural human reaction to something burning on your leg.  Or was it the smoking of the cigarette (the action) that is the moral wrongdoing?

I guess it depends on your definition of a moral obligation to give complete and total care and attention to moving a multi ton vehicle thru a situation where inattention or distraction for the blink of an eye can cost someone their life. ANY deviation from the job at hand IMHO is a moral wrong doing; you've put others at risk to smoke; or talk on a cell phone; or eat; or whatever you elect to do that isn't undivided driving of a vehicle.

Perhaps it is a civil infraction.  If not, only a general intent is necessary for some crimes. Specific intent to do a bad act is not always necessary.  Also, some crimes are malum en se, or bad in itself. (murder) Others are malum en prohibitum, bad because the legislature says so. (not wearing a seatbelt)

The expressions you need to try and understand are:



'mens rea' which is taken to mean the guilty state of mind,



and 'actus reus' taken to mean the actual guilty actions.



Much simplified, it is sometimes said that 'they can't lock you up for what you are thinking, only when you put your thoughts into action' .. a way of explaining that for the majority of offences there has to be those two elements coming to-gether. So you may well see that an Act of Parliament may say something like: ( eg for burglary it is an offence ) ' if a person enters a building as a trespasser with the intention of stealing anything inside ' the two element are 1) entry as a trespasser ( the actus reus ) and 2) with the intention ( the mens rea )of stealing . Mere entry as a trespasser to sleep is not burglary it lacks a mens rea to steal , being there legally and then stealing is not burglary but would be simple theft.



Sometimes some offences are termed 'absolute offences' , or 'offences of strict liability', usually situations where the public interest, safety and protection takes priority over the thoughts that may or more importantly were absent from the offenders mind. Since this concept of absolute liability is serious the legislation will need to make it clear that offences are to be so treated and unless this is clear the courts will not find that strict liability exists. For the legally minded look at the case of Sweet v Parsley [1970] AC132 .. concerning a property owners liability when occupants used the house for smoking drugs.



Examples of strict liability would be driving with excess alcohol .. the proof of being over the limit enough to justify a conviction. Public health and food hygience offences often fall into the category of absolute offences.

There are two types of laws and legal violations;
Malum Prohibitum  (bad because it is prohibited)
Malum In se



(action is ban by its nature)



To the extent that violating the law is bad, all Malum Prohibitum crimes are morally wrong.  We also know however that there may be unjust laws and the like.  Thus crimes do not always coincide with moral wrongs.



As to your intent question, yes you got the mens rea bit correct.  Mens rea is a term generally indicating the scienter element of a crime, or the criminal intent level required to convict.  The model penal code generally gives 5 levels of mens rea,



Purposeful
Knowledge
Reckless
Negligent
Absolute (strict) liability



At least in the eyes of the law the wrong action was smoking while driving.  The smoking was wrong exactly because he could get distracted by the fumes, or burned, and thus drive in an unsafe fashion.  Naturally we know that many people do not consider smoking wrong, or even naturally reacting to the burn as wrong.  The moral issue, if any, arises from the chance that something bad could happen while smoking and driving.



Certainly there is only a small chance of something happening.  Many people drive doing things that are less safe everyday.  However what the government is essentially alleging is that society has decided, through the legislature and driving laws, that distracted driving is not acceptable.  Following from that, it doesn't matter how minor the distraction was, or what it was, only that he allowed himself to drive while distracted.

'Mens rea' and criminal 'intent' are not always the same thing.Nor is 'mens rea' the same as moral guilt.



Each criminal offence has its own 'mens rea' and 'actus reus'.'Actus reus' is the result prohibited by law which your actions have caused.To be guilty of the offence you must also have had the required  'mens rea' at the time.'Mens rea'  generally but not always means 'intent' but more accurately is the state of mind the accused needs to be in at the time if the offence is to be proved.



Generally there needs to be a deliberate and voluntary act designed to bring about a particular state of affairs e.g inflicting serious harm intending to kill is murder.Equally you can be guilty of manslaughter for instance if your reckless or grossly negligent act results in someone's death even though you had no intention of causing death.



So 'mens rea' is about state of mind not morality as such.It is clear that the basic common law offences of murder robbery burglary etc. correspond directly with established notions of moral guilt.But many modern offences (particularly those relating to road use) are breaches of organisational regulations or standards which do not obviously correspond to breaches of established morality.So 'careless driving' is committed is someone's standard of driving falls below what is expected of a reasonably competent driver.'Mens rea' as such is not an issue. Hope this helps clarify it.

Which state would I have to file a lawsuit in?



I bought an AKC certified "Boxer" from a breeder in PA when she was 8 weeks old.  As she is getting older she looks NOTHING like a Boxer so I questioned the AKC and they are now investagating the Breeder since they also believe she is not a purebreed Boxer.  If she is proven to NOT be a full breed Boxer I want to sue since I bought her thinking she was a Boxer not a mixed breed.  I live in NY but the breeder is in PA.  Which state would I have to sue in and what is the most I could sue for?  I love the dog, but have young children and bought this dog (at 8 weeks you really couldn't tell what she was she was so small) under the assumption that since she was AKC registered that I was buying a Boxer.  I have no idea what she is mixed with Pit Bull, Mastiff - who knows?  Now I have committed myself to this dog for the next I don't know how many years and I wanted a Boxer.  I would feel terrible to give her away since she is now 9 months old and my daughter is very attached to her, but I feel scammed.  Would I sue in PA since that's where she was purchased or in the state I live in NY?

File in Pennsylvania, where the contract was made.



You could sue for the purchase price; and any incidental damages, like vet bills; and possibly punitive damages, in a fraud case.  But, the law considers a dog property, so if you win, you'll have to give the dog back.



You could, however, for the sake of you daughter, sue for the difference between the price you paid for the dog, and the price to adopt a mutt from the local shelter, and keep the dog.  And it doesn't hurt to ask for a few hundred dollars in punitive damages.

If someone attacks you, and you fight back, that diverts some of that attackers' attention from attacking YOU, as the attacker is now also concerned with defense - I'd say Bush has very much helped prevent further attacks with policies of direct response, stiffened security, reprisals, and other actions that require terrorists to consider their own defense.

The government agencies (CIA, FBI, etc.) were a mess before 9/11, which prevented them from being able to thwart the attack.  Afterwards, they were better prepared and have since prevented a lot of attacks (many in the news, many not in the news).  Many people can be given credit for preventing any additional attacks, but only one person can be given credit for the 9/11 attack - Osama Bin Laden.

Non-Exempt Employees
Employees classified as Non-Exempt will be paid 1-½ times their regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. A workweek is the 7-day payroll week that begins on Sunday of each week and ends on Saturday. Hours worked include all time that a Non-Exempt employee performs duties that benefit the Bank and/or its customers or employees.  Such time specifically includes meal periods of less than 30 minutes and/or rest breaks of 15 minutes in length. Hours worked, for purposes of calculating overtime, specifically exclude any hours paid for time not worked such as vacation, absence, compensatory time, jury duty, bereavement, or holidays.



Under no circumstances are Non-Exempt employees to be given or offered compensatory time-off in lieu of payment for any time worked whether overtime hours or not.  Nor may a Non-Exempt employee be requested or allowed to work off-the-clock, i.e., work any hours that are not accurately reported on the employee’s Weekly Time card.

There is a rip on the cheap carpet on the floor of one of the bedrooms of a house I've just moved out of. The landlord is saying that I caused it and wants to take it out of my deposit. He says he knows it was me as he checked the house before I moved in. I am kicking myself as I took photos of all damage in the property excluding this carpet rip. Where do I stand legally?

But when if he does take it out of your deposit, he can only take the amount it takes to fix the carpet.  he first has to get it fixed then give you a copy of the receipt.  he still has to pay you back the rest of the deposit.

Its basically a civil matter. You need proof that the rip was not there before you moved in. My suggestion, just pay him and get him off your back. You'll probably end up paying more in court cost. Good luck!

Taking pictures of the interior of an apartment before your first move in is the best protection.  If there are no pictures of the torn carpet, it is all over.



Small claims court, in my experience in dealing with landlord-tenant matters, generally favors the landlord.  The only chance you would have in small claims court would be if the landlord does not show up for the hearing.

Code enforcement not returning calls?



We received a letter on our door from Code enforcement in our area about 2 weeks ago. It was actually taped to my door but due to the weather, was found blowing in my yard. I only noticed it because it was near a plant in our front yard. I called that number listed immediately the following Friday. I left a message and a call was never returned.



I also received a notice that I had a Certified Letter at the post office however they were open 8:30 am to 4:30 pm and I work exactly those hours, an hour away from home where the post office is. I called and left another message to which no call was returned. I received another notice in the mail and said the last day to pick up this letter would be 9/25. I called Code Enforcement again on 9/18 to explain that I was NOT ignoring them, I was attempting to get the notice at the post office, but the hours weren’t working for me. And asked if I could please know what this was in regards to.



The man on the phone took down my address, and said there was nothing in the system regarding my address. I took down his name, the date and time we spoke and of course, that he said there was nothing on file. I got home from work to find ANOTHER notice on my damn door asking me to contact Code Enforcement.



Because I am about to kill these people, I passed this along to my husband. He called yesterday, AGAIN, and left another message and has STILL not received a call back.



I understand they’re busy, but we are attempting to find out what this is about. We have questions in regards to what it is they’re talking about. And we need answers before we can fix the problem.



What’s the best way to go about this? We talked about sending THEM a Certified Letter/Return Receipt stating that we’ve tried contacting them and list all the dates and times calls were made. Asking them to please contact us regarding this issue. The ONLY reason I’m concerned is because this is in regards to a dead tree that may or may not be on our property. We’re trying to figure that out. And we also need to know if this is the branch that needs cutting or the entire tree. And if it’s too close to power lines because in our opinion, it’s a bit of a risk. And we are concerned because they said they would take care of it and we would foot the bill if we didn’t respond. But we ARE responding, they’re not returning our calls.



What would you do in this situation?

You can look in your county online.  Just google code enforcement and your county name.  You should get a hit of the gov website.  Search for your property on there.



We got a notice once about an out-of-commission car on our property.  It took us a long time to take care of it because it belonged to my dh nephew and he was in Iraq.  They never came back out to enforce or follow through with the notice.  I would just document all that you are doing to recify the problem.  Keep a log of dates and times, contact info, info gathered, etc.  It shows that  you are not ignoring the issue but working on it.  That's all you can do until a solution is found for the tree.

E- mail them if possible. I've seldom ever gotten a call back from city or state but when I e-mailed them , they responded. Maybe because there was a bit of documentation involved? I don't know. Good luck & it is part of their job to respond to your questions , not just ignore it out of laziness.

How can I find the name of the prosecution lawyer from a case I viewed in court?



I am a student and last week went to court to watch some cases so that I could do a report.  At the time I didn't get the name of the prosecution lawyer and have since tried to phone them but can't get through to speak to anyone.  Is there any resource online that lists details of cases that have been in court?  It was a magistrates court and I have a reference number and details of the defendant.  Thanks

The best way is to phone your local fiscal's office - where all their offices are and describe him. However if you have the name of the defence lawyer it might be worth asking him if no luck with the fiscal, however the fiscal's office should be able to give you all the information.
Worst comes to worst go back to court and ask the reception and perhaps the clerk of court who was in that day as they might know him from always being in the court building. You also might see the prosecutor there when you visit again.

You would have to do this informally. You could phone the listing office, explain that you are a student and were doing this as part of your studies, and ask them who the prosecution lawyer was in that particular court. The clerk of the court always notes the name of the prosecutor as part of the court record. Sometimes it is a CPS employee and at other times it will be a solicitor or barrister briefed by the CPS for that day. The best time to do this is at about nine o'clock in the morning, before things get too busy.

There has been debate whether the martial law declared by Palosi was actual military martial law or a tactic used to move a bill through without giving members ample to time to read and understand it before they vote on it. Who has the authority to declare military martial law on the US?

No, she doesn't, and no, she didn't.



The term "martial law" as she used it is a slang term for an emergency legislative session where the normal time frames for debating bills are waived. Such sessions have occurred many times before, and the members of the house all knew exactly what she was talking about.



I'm no fan of Pelosi - who I believe is the quintessential "Limousine Liberal" - a billionaire that claims to be a Socialist supporter of "the little people" (though not, of course, of the illegal alien grape pickers she was caught paying less than 1/2 minimum wage to!) - but this is a storm in a tea cup.



A true declaration of martial law is the responsibility of the executive, not legislative, branch.



Martial law can be declared by a Governor, within his State only, or by the President.

Martial law is when military authority is imposed rather thant he usual police force. It has happened several times in American history. Lincoln declared it. It was declared in Hawaii in 1941. Something like it was declared in New Orleans after hurricane Katrina.



The executive branch has that authority, i.e., the President, governors of states, etc. It cannot be declared if the courts are operating. Usually, it is only declared in times of emergency or war.



I believe, if Ms. Palosi declared "martial law," she was using it as a figure of speech. Otherwise, I cannot see her handing such power to President Bush.

Are some laws just meant to be read but not executed?



For example, it is illegal to smoke if you are younger than 18 years of age, but at my school, minors smoke in front of the teacher. It is illegal to bring iPods to school (some schools) but students listen to music in class and the teacher says, "Nice iPod. Can hear a couple of songs?" I got many more examples.

There is a difference between Law and Policy as there is between Felony and Misdemeanor.  Policy, such as when a bank says, "...you may write 10 checks for free but after that all checks will cost 10 cents each..."  In the case of some depositors (businesses) the bank may "disregard" the 10 cent fee.



A law, on the other hand, may too be disregarded.  Underage smoking is a good example.  Since a lot of people do it, the enforcement effort alone, e.g., writing tickets, arresting people, throwing them in jail, costs more than what society would realize from it.  Writing a ticket means the state must pay someone to write the ticket, someone to print the ticket book, the purchase of a pen, the training of the person to write the ticket, the health care benefits and salary of that person, the judge who would hear the ticket case, the lawyer for both the prosecution and the defendant, the court time of the judge's clerk, his secretary, and on and on.  The total fine realized is often $50.00 while the total cost is over $1,000.



Often, such "laws" or "policies" are simply ignored.  Why bother?



Other crimes, like rape, burglary, etc. are prosecuted even though the actual dollar cost is usually much greater than the dollar compensation when the perpetrator is convicted.  There is compensation to society, however, and it is called "social capital."  Social Capital (Prof. James Samuel Coleman, American Journal of Sociology, June 1985, Supplement) is anything that facilitates individual or collective action, generated by networks of relationships, reciprocity, trust, and social norms.

In the fact that you are pregnant already emancipates you.  I am a health care professional which women's health is my area of expertise.  Your parents can not make medical decisions for you any longer.  You can receive medicaid, food stamps, and WIC services, even welfare, while still living with your parents.  I would encourage you to live at home with your parents and except the help they have to offer as living on your own with twins at 16yo would be a nightmare.

Its Who is Nelson Mandela as he is not dead. He worked to end apartheid in South Africa and was imprisoned for several years for standing up against the unfair treatment. After the struggle ended and he was released he actually went on to become the president of South Africa as he had always possessed natural leadership abilities. Nelson Mandela did great things for his country and the people in it. He has to be one of the greatest world leaders of all times....one of the greatest fighters for equality of all time. Im sure there are many internet sources on his achievements as well as books in your local or school libraries. Education is a great thing.

Mandela's words, "The struggle is my life," are not to be taken lightly.



Nelson Mandela personifies struggle. He is still leading the fight against apartheid with extraordinary vigour and resilience after spending nearly three decades of his life behind bars. He has sacrificed his private life and his youth for his people, and remains South Africa's best known and loved hero.

Is it wrong I am helping to design a Robotic Police Enforcer that can arrest and kill criminals?



I have created a fully automated 8 foot tall robot that is very menacing looking. It has very advanced AI and can have a basic conversation with anyone. It can report and give commands and has GPS location and functions with numerous cameras and voice recorders. It can arrest and detain suspects on its own and can administer the tazer, beatdown suspects with three times the force of a normal officer, and can use two police made handguns that can fire at an accurary rate of 995/1000 ammo up to about 500 feet away (direct fatal or non-fatal wounds). Is this project a good idea? Should every street in America have this robot?

What should be done, who can he contract?



He buy everything his son needs; diapers, milk, clothes, etc... Mother tells the father can’t see his son unless he does everything she says. Take parenting classes, he has, take anger management classes he has (never needed them) but still he is not allow to see his son.  He works and she says “stop working and babysit your son or you won’t be able to see him anymore”. She told him that she has a restraining order against him(witch it’s a lied), so he doesn’t  go to the house, but still he has to take diapers, milk, clothes, etc... “so how am I suppose to do this if theirs a restraining order against me” he tells her? He doesn’t do what she says as soon as she says it than she tells him, “ You don’t love your son, I’m taking him to a different state”. If he calls to see how his son is or he doesn’t call she gets angry. He now has someone else call her to see how his son is. He called her to say that he wanted to see his son for his birthday, she said yes but only if you pay for half of the party. He had bought some clothes for his son because he outgrew clothes he had and with winter around the corner he needed warm clothing. But he was told to just leave the gift on the door step and to ring the bell. He loves his son, not a day goes by without him thinking about him. What should he do?

From what I understand, very few police officers have actually wanted these powers - it's an obsession of the government to get it through.



In any case, it is not yet law - Parliament reconvenes next week and it will not be prorogued by the Queen until December, as there is expected to be a long period of negotiations and disagreements between the Commons and the Lords.



The Lords is expected to rub out the 42 days clause of the Bill, and it's also hoped that the narrow pro-42 days majority in the Commons that there was before recess will evaporate, especially after the anger the vote generated last time.



I don't think the clause will survive.

The recruitment bar for the UK police force has never been set so low.
Now any Tom,Dick or Mohammed can sign up with no qualifications or experience.
Most of them are weedy or short and fat and are too cowardly to intervene in fights until there are 40 backup in full riot gear.



So,yes,our modern police force does lack even basic skills.



The role of policeman in this country has been replaced with CCTV cameras and detectives have been replaced with state pressure on Banks,solicitors and accountants to spy on us.



Having said this,the reason that government have asked for 90 day then a 42  day terror bill is because they know that civil unrest is over the horizon and the "terror bill" will be used against our own citizens.Race riots are a certainty as resources become scarcer and inner city tensions boil.The government will want to take out the leaders with or without evidence.Keeping them in prison for 42 days should be long enough for the police to fit them up with something nasty.



eidt @jzd.



First of all,youre not really a lawyer so lets not try and buy credibility with such claptrap.
Secondly,my opinions are mirrored by tens of thousands of other people,that believe that 42 day terror bill is ratcheting up state control of the public.
Nowhere in my post does it suggest that "duskier people" as you call them are to blame.
I take it that you are not familiar with racial tensions in inner cities including the ritoing that already has took place in birmingham where a fatality occured?
These are facts,not speculation.As a "lawyer" surely you would be au fait with the difference.
I would have hoped that someone capable of mounting a reasoned answer such as yours wouldn't be so pompous when addressing someone elses opinion.
As a matter of fact ,I do have strong opinions about the immigrant situation in this country,but they are irrrelevant to the question here and so I didnt mention them.
However,I make no apology to trendy,hypocritical,PC leftists who consider everyone that doesnt agree with them to be "ignorant,bigoted racists".

42 days was a compromise on the figure the government wanted of 90 days, then reduced to 56 days.
The reality is that the period is irrelevant to fighting crime or what GWB calls 'terrism'.  The Govt (or police could not give a single example of a case which failed due to insufficient time to hold suspects.



And the reason is simple - in order to detain a suspect for longer, all it is necessary to do is to charge him with an imprisonable offence and then ask that bail be refused.



Regrettably the bidding war on detention periods has nothing to do with tackling crime (in whatever form) and everything to do with painting the party opposite as being 'soft on crime'.



As for 'Private', I notice that his answer to every problem lies with the duskier citizens in our society.  Send 'em all back, eh?

I woke up at 6am this morning, and it took me an hour and a half to get to university. It usually takes about an hour, but there was unexpected traffic and road works. I get to the lecture 5 minutes late, and I'm told to get out ¬_¬

i dont think there is any law against this but it will be down to the lecturers discretion.  just explain to your lecturer next time you see them...and smack him up the face!!! actually dont do that, just speak to him...

Legality isn't relevant. The lecturer reserves the right to kick you out.



If you have a problem with it, complain to your head of department.
Some lecturers seem to be on a constant ego trip.

I don't know if thats fair to be honest, and no they shouldn't refuse you, its just a case of respect I suppose, you should go to the person who told you to get out, explain why you were late then ask if you could have the documents that support the lecture as you were not allow entry, also if its really bothering you, go to student support.
People just hate people being late!

Some of my lecturers refuse people entry if they are late too, but you could just say, no it took me 90 minutes to get here, I'm not going anywhere. And see what they say. If they shout at you, you can make a complaint to your course leader...Although if this particular person marks some of your work, he/she may be bias. It's a tricky one!

Not sure about legally - what are you going to do, sue them? It does seem unfair though when it was for reasons beyond your control; unless you make a habit of arriving late. I suggest you have a polite word with the lecturer and explain what happened; say you're sorry but you set out in loads of time. At least it should set things straight (and possibly give the lecturer a chance to apologise, since he she may realise they over-reacted.

I think that this is a matter of contract. You have paid tuition fees and are entitled to attend lectures as part of the arrangement, but under certain terms and conditions, which presumably include entering the lecture hall before the lecture starts in order to prevent disruption. There are probably internal rules covering this which would entitle the lecturer to use his/her discretion in the matter.



In my university, I think anyone who had behaved insolently (which is what is implied in defying the instructions of a lecturer in public) would have been reported to the Senior Tutor and disciplined. I have no idea what happens elsewhere.

Yes you can.  My uni allows for about 5 minutes - more if some people have a lecture which finishes at the same time as the next one starts!  If there are problems, phone the uni and explain the situation - you are then usually OK.  I can't believe there are many students without mobile phones nowadays and it is only good manners.



Students coming into lectures late and for no good reason are disruptive to the other students and the lecturer.  Refusing to leave the lecture would end up with a serious row and not only will the lecturer be pi**ed off with you but most of the students as well.

If someone is ordered to pay money for driving without due care and attention?



What is it likely to be for?  As in, the amount is about £350 so this would seem too small for compensation.  Is it likely to just be a general 'fine' or what would be a good guess?  Court charges?  Administration?  Any ideas welcomed!

Before I go into my response, I should point out that I have never practised law in the UK (although I have in Australia and a number of asian countries); however, many similarities can be drawn between these legal systems.



In answering your question.  "Driving without due care and attention" seems to imply that either another party other than the driver was harmed directly, or that the driver breached a duty of care he/she owed to another party, but without causing any actual harm.



In the first instance, that is, another party suffered actual damages, the money would go towards compensation for the most part, "costs" if the issue went to court, which includes administration fees, court charges, and usually the victim's legal fees.  While compensation for medical expenses or loss of income would normally be expected to be higher than the amount you've stated, you should also consider the possibility of property damage.  for instance, the driver may have swiped a wheelie bin, or knocked over someone's letterbox, and the cost of compensation would only be for replacement.



In the 2nd instance, that is, no actual damages were incurred, most of the cost would be a fine.  It is generally a tenet of the law that all drivers who hold a valid driving license acknowledge that they owe other users of public roads a duty of care, and agree to uphold this duty.  When this duty has been breached, the police will issue a fine.



What i've highlighted here are just the general points; UK law may have additional points which i've not yet covered, perhaps someone else with more knowledge on that area could add a few comments?

Compensation would only be ordered where there was a victim.



It may be the fine (it's a bit small) but I suspect it's a contribution towards the prosecution costs.

There are two elements to the money that someone is ordered to pay.  The first part is the fine - the punishment for committing a crime and getting caught.  The second element is costs - this is to cover part of the costs of bringing the prosecution.



Additionally, there may be a third element in some instances.  If someone suffers in consequence of the offence, such as the driver going into another vehicle, the court may also award compensation to the victim.

Personal info got compromised, what to do??? Should I tell police? Thanks!?



Because of a worker’s mistake, a package of mine that contains important personal info has got sent to my previous home address, someone lives in the house signed for the package and opened it! I don’t know any of the people that are living in my previous house.



There was my passport, bank statements from my 2 banks, pay slips inside the package.



I don’t know if they kept a copy of all my personal details, or if they are identity theft, should I inform the police? But it’s really hard to prove, it’s just my words against theirs. I wonder if it’s possible to change passport number.



Help me please, I’m really worried :s thanks

You can go to the big credit agency experian and ask for a note to be put on your file.  They should also give you an added password so any credit applied for would need this password before being approved.

First off, sorry about how you must be feeling at the moment.



I'll try to answer your question from a couple of angles:
1. Opening someone else's mail is usually a felony, but may not be, depending on which area of jurisdiction you live in.
2. They may have just opened it without checking who the envelope was addressed to, and may not have looked at the contents after realising it wasn't for them.
3. Yes, your passport number can be changed, go contact the department that issued your passport.
4. If you're worried about the bank statements, depending on which bank, you might be able to change the account number without being required to close the current account and opening another one.  Talk to the bank, explain you situation and concerns.  Generally they'll be sympathetic, since problems with your money are their problems too.
5. If, as a worst case scenario, something bad does happen, the employee who made the mistake is liable for all damages incurred by you, PLUS further compensation for anxiety and distress ... this last option depends on how far you want to take things, though ...



Hope some of that helped.

Contact the post office and ask if there is any law against opening a package that is obviously not yours.



If you can, contact the bank, social security, and the credit companies and change account numbers, freeze accounts.  Ask for a free credit report to see if anything has been opened using your data.



I don't know the process of  changing passport numbers because I think that they just check the photo.  Maybe someone else will know.  Call the offices and ask.

If, and most likely it was, registered to be signed for by the person it was addressed to, the Post Office should have a copy of the slip and who signed for it! A NORMAL person, at least, I am, give it back to the Postman, If you were expecting this parcel, hopefully, you had put a change of address card with the Post Office. NOW! Sometimes, SOME packages state, NOT TO BE FORWARDED ! When the Postman delivered it to your previous address, the occupant should have spoken right then! Yes it is a felony to open someone elses mail! Contact the Passport Office immediately, and all your other personal information - SS number, bank accounts if there were any in the package, and get to work ASAP changing the lot! The Post Office should take action against the person who signed for it - it didn't open itself! I know this is a bloody mess, but to secure your identity, it must be done!  I would definately go after these people for tampering with the mail!

I don't really know what you're asking.  In my state, what we would call a partition suit can be brought at any time that there is co-ownership of property - is that what you mean? It doesn't matter that the co-owners have owned the property together for twenty years and then one of them decides to partition, they can do it.  I don't know if the law is the same in other states though.

if you've signed the contract, then I'm afraid you're stuck with it.  However, if the phone keeps crashing, you might be able to get it changed or fixed.  Does the p[hone come with a warranty?  I thought nokia had a blanket 12 month warranty on all new phones sold through registered dealers?



In any case, your best bet would be to go over the small print in the contract you signed, there might be some clause there that allows you to wriggle out on the grounds of non-performance on the part of the phone dealers,  since the phone you got was defective.

Demand another new phone.  This one is faulty.  Keep doing this every time the phone crashes for the second time.



Go into the store and have them check to see if all is programmed properly and that you are using it as you should.



You'll have to read your contract to find out what you can do to get a refund.  They may just give you one if you call and talk to a supervisor and nicely explain what is happening.  Be sure to mention each and every time this phone has malfunctioned and any other problems you are having with it.  Be polite and persistent.  Go up the ladder.



I can't find any complaints online about this phone, maybe because it is so new and not an IPhone.



My guess is that their system has a few kinks in it.



Keep track of the days the phone actually works and how long it takes to get it up and running again.  It shouldn't keep doing this, so they should be willing to make it good.

ok so here's the story, I got to San Diego City College and I got a citation ticket for not having a parking permit and I want to fight it with the college student affair. any way, on our college the very two weeks of the semester parking lot a free of charge but I bought and pay for my class on the first week and also pay $30 for my parking permit and on the third week, around 8:45am the city college police gave me a citation, he said that I didn't have a parking permit so I got mad and I took my receipt the city college police department and I show them my reciept and parking permit that the police gave me a ticket for a wrong reason so they made me fill out a form and now I got a mail said that instead of paying $40 the charge is reduced to $10. so I'm still angry because I have my receipt and the date of my purchase ticket and still I have to pay $10 for the mistake police has made. so what should I do, should I pay for the $10 or what should I do. please help me find a solution. thank you.



</question>



<additional details>



I forgot to add and say that the parking permit sticker they gave me I place on a cardholder that has a ring and I put it on my rear view mirror just like everyone else.



second the mail that came today it has a small print says that Appellant vs Officer.

Read the form they made you fill out! The small print! Then ask them what the $10 is for? Maybe they do this to get a little extra pocket money! Ask them if they will give you a sticker for the $10 for your windshield so they will know next time they checking cars, you are paid up AND SOME!!! LOL!

California has a law that says a person has to fill a prescription within 5 weeks or face fines and/or jail?



Does this just mean that if a person fills a prescription more than 5 weeks after it was written then they can get in trouble? or does it mean that if a doctor writes a prescription that a person has to fill it no matter what? What if the prescription accidentally got destroyed?

Interesting, actually that is not correct, and most of the respondents are incorrect also.  Although I do not practice any longer in California, I did for years, and I still retain my license there.  Expiration of Rx's are only a concern for certain types of medication, specifically opiates, certain other analgesics, and tranquilizers.  Most medications written for chronic diseases, such as diabetes, glaucoma or MS, have an expiration date on the Rx, placed by the physicians office, in order to encourage the patient to return for their regular evaluations.  There are no fines, or jail time, unless you decide to forge or steal Rx's from another patient...relax, the pill police are not on their way.

I think you have it wrong. When a doctor writes a prescription, it expires after 5 weeks, and a pharmacy will no longer fill it.  Actually, what really happens is the pharmacy calls the doctor and he tells them it's okay to fill it or not.  Either way, you won't get in trouble unless you do something fraudulent, like forging a prescription or trying to change the date.  These days, pharmacies nearly always call your doctor anyway when they fill a prescription.



You certainly don't have to fill a prescription a doctor gives you.  You have the choice of accepting or refusing any medical treatment (so long as you're an adult and mentally competent).  I have often had doctors write me prescriptions for pain killers after minor surgery, and then decided I didn't need them so I didn't bother with them.  I never had police show up and my door and force the pills down my throat.  8^)



If a prescription expires, you can call your doctor and he will write you a new one (if the drug still applies).  He will even fax it to the pharmacy.  They do stuff like this all the time.

No, not always. Nongovernmental organizations are simply non-profit, religious, charitable or social service agencies (what we might call a 501c3 in the United States). Some deal with human rights issues and some do not. Because NGOs are generally concerned with social issues such as labor, women's' rights, the environment, children, etc, they often intersect with human rights issues - but NGO's as a rule don't always deal explicitly with addressing human rights.



In terms of a branch of government dealing with human rights, some countries do have this. For instance, in the District of Columbia, the local municipal government has an office of human rights the deals with rights violations at the policy and implementation levels. See - http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/frames.asp?doc=/oh...  In the US, at the national level we have the Office for Civil Rights, which is part of the Dept of Education. This office deals with discrimination and violation of the human rights of students, particularly those from vulnerable populations, such as students with disabilities. See - http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr... .



Other countries have similar government offices as well, such as Australia (see http://www.hrc.act.gov.au/) and the UK (see for example http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/...

Jacket lost by nightclub?



I paid £1 to a nightclub cloakroom attendant to look after my jacket but at the end of the night, they had lost it. I'm trying to get the club to pay for a replacement (the jacket costs £250 new, and I've had it for 8 months or so) and wanted to now what rights I had.



I figure that as they are charging money for a cloakroom service, then they must take on some legal/ financial responsibility for the items they take. There aren't any signs to suggest that items are left at their own risk etc, and even if there were, again, the fact that they're charging must imply some sort of responsibility.



So, I guess my question is am I correct in asking for the full amount (£250) for a replacement and are they obligied to pay up?

If they're charging for the service, they should be liable to pay something.  However, since the charge is a token $1 (sorry, don't have a "pound"key on my keyboard), you'd be unlikely to get the full purchase price.  To draw a similar case, when i go to the dry cleaners', on the back of the collection receipt, there's a bit of small print limiting the amount they pay for loss or damage to 5 times the cleaning cost, and only if reported within 24 hours of collection.  so while the club should have a legal obligation to pay some sort of compensation, it may not amount to very much ...

There's no proof that you can prevent a future crime. Crime rate may go down but unless someone walks up to you and says "I was going to commit that crime but I decided not to",then there is no real way of knowing if a crime was prevented.

Visitation of kids when father is a crooked cop?



I know someone whose children were taken from her after her divorce by her ex-husband. The problem is he is a cop & threatened to kill her if she tried to see them at all. I guess he had remarried & was trying to start over in this manner. His 2nd wife left him, so he started to let my friend see the kids again(after 2 years!)  He imposes strict rules of visitation on her. Now, he has another woman in his life that he is planning on marrying. Now, a whole other set of problems is arising. Please believe me that my friend is truly afraid for her life if she goes against his wishes. Remember, he is a crooked cop with the badge & the entire police force in this major city I live in. She has reason to take his threats seriously. I guess my main question is whom  she could go to for protection. Would it be Internal Affairs?

Internal affairs is one shot, but they may be friends of his. I'd tell her to go federal. Talk to a lawyer, see if the circumstances can move jurisdiction into a federal court. Tell the lawyer you aren't sure whether you need a lawyer or not, so you were seeking a quick, free consultation. The local people would have each others' backs generally, so you need to find a reason to bring it further up the chain of command. I would write a book or something, it sounds like a good movie plot.

What type of custody agreement did they have with the courts when the divorce was final?  If he received full custody, then he did not take the children from her, but if she has full or they had joint custody, then he is in violation of that court agreement.  Even if he has crooked cop buddies, the court system is definitely above local cops in the food chain.



I would advise your friend to contact a lawyer and he can help her with all the legal aspects and what she should do next.  And it isn't a bad idea to contact internal affairs... but she will need proof that he is a "crooked cop" because unfortunately being an *sshole isn't enough here.  She should have done something sooner, and not waited a few years because she loses some credibility with the time line... but better now than never or much later.  Have her get a lawyer first, preferably one that specializes in family law or custody, and go from there.

Yes, it varies from state to state. But, also remember that it is illegal to transport a minor across state lines without the permission of her parents, and, in most states, it is also illegal to go to another state for the purpose of committing an act that is illegal in the state you are from.

I'm no expert but I do know that there is no trespass law in Scotland and there is also the fairly recently introduced Right to Roam legislation.
Not sure how you go about challenging whoever put up the gate, suggest you look up Right to Roam and take it from there.
In the meantime, climb the gate if you're able!

Minimum Wage changes UK?



In the UK yesterday (30 Sept 2008) the minimum wage was: £3.40 for 16-17 year olds, £4.60 for 18-21 year olds and £5.52 for over 22. My boyfriend is 20, in his job he is being paid £5.66 an hour as is everyone there regardless of age, (his 17 year old friend earns the same set rate as does his 29 year old friend). Today minimum wage went up to £5.73 if you are 22 or older. Thefore anyone over 22 in his work should be, by law be paid at least this, as his employer was previously paying everyone the same rate (22+) does that mean that by law my boyfriends wage will have to go up along with everyone aged 22+?



Hope this made sense!

Makes perfect sense to me...



I hope that your boyfriend gets his rise, however the rate only affects those of 22 and over so by law his boss only has to give the rise to those in his workforce who are 22 and over...



Good Luck!

No.  By law your boyfriend is not entitled to have his wages increased to £5.73 as he is in the 18-21 age group and the law states that  this age group has to be paid at least £4.77.  However, his employer will probably increase his pay to £5.73 anyway, but if for any reason he doesn't your boyfriend will not legally be able to fight for the increase.

Can I claim my letter back from the post office? URGENT?



I don't know if I can trust what my friend told me. I left my oyster card at her house and she told me she would post it to me. She handed into the post office and it still did not get to me within 5 days. Then she told me that her friend happened to work in the post office and he checked that she wrote the wrong adress and he took the letter back to her. Is that possible or not? Do you need evidence to withclaim a letter? Can any member of the post office take anyones letter for them? This is urgent and I really need your advice! Thanks x



</question>

I'm not going to ask her to repost it incase anything happens AGAIN.. and she says shes got it in her hands now. I just wanted to find out if she was lieing... thanks  x =]



And I forgot, if she was lieing, why? Would she be using my oyster card or something.. thanks again x

Is it ok for employer to check employees pockets?



I work at a daycare center. My boss decided to do random pocket checks and made us pour out all of our pockets. If he found cell phones he took them till the end of the day, we had to throw cough drops, aspirin and even tampons away. In the employment contract we agreed to random drug tests but nowhere in there does it say anything about pocket checks. Is this legal?

Well, it is legal but very draconian.  For him to throw out cough drops and tampons is just plain stupid.

He sounds very paranoid to me.

It is totally legal. For example, if you go into refineries or chemical plants you can be searched for any of the items the company does not allow into the facility (usually drugs, alcohol, firearms, cameras, etc., but I have seen some that ban cell phones too). Your boss has the right to ban anything he feels is inappropriate from the work place and can enforce that with searches. It doesn't have to be in an employment contract, it just needs to be applied universally to all employees. However, it is rather stupid and I suggest you look for another job.

And lets not even get into Sarah Palin's gaffes.....and John McCains:
McCain thinks the recent conflict between Russia and Georgia was “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.” He thinks Iraq and Pakistan share a border. He believes Czechoslovakia is still a country. He’s been confused about the difference between Sudan and Somalia. He’s been confused about whether he wants more U.S. troops in Afghanistan, more NATO troops in Afghanistan, or both. He’s been confused about how many U.S. troops are in Iraq. He’s been confused about whether the U.S. can maintain a long-term presence in Iraq. He’s been confused about Iran’s relationship with al Qaeda. He’s been confused about the difference between Sunni and Shi’ia. McCain, following a recent trip to Germany, even referred to “President Putin of Germany.” He thinks Spain is located in Latin America and that Spain is not our Ally. All of this incoherence on his signature issue.

Joe Biden is an idiot. However, he is a good politician, especially when it comes to foreign policy. The man may spout complete drivel, but Obama didn't exactly have a stellar line-up of nominees. He isn't a bad choice, because people know that Joe Biden cannot publicly speak worth beans, but has a track record that isn't bad. He'd never be president, but VP is not a terrible slot for him.



Of course, it doesn't matter when compared with the competition's VP. Palin couldn't even name a newspaper when she was asked. A newspaper! She cannot give an answer to any softball question, let alone a serious one. Come on, the woman said Alaska's proximity to Russia is an example of her "foreign policy" experience. In comparison Biden is a genius.

I always enjoy seeing other people prove the point someone else is making. Oh let's talk about OTHER people's mistakes. That was the point. That everyone talks about McCain and Palin but leaves Biden alone as oh that's just Biden. To be honest though if the best you can do is him mixing up the name Kool-Aid as Flavor Aid I can't say much there. I mean I'm hoping the comment was more a joke or sarcastic about he just wasn't good at making it. Sounds like it was in poor taste either way, but I'm hoping he wasn't so stupid he didn't know what happened. In any case this is the LAW&ETHICS section, not the elections section.

Ethical question....money in picture frames?



I was thinking about this today, this is a story that happened years ago when I was young.



My mother once bought a box of antique picture frames from an auction, like super-duper cheap. As she got to unpacking them and deciding where to put them, etc. she opened one and found a $20 bill. She got excited, so she opened another, and found another $20 bill. She kept opening them, and found cash in every frame, which added up to $200. We were all excited and kept the money.



Now, ethically, what would you have done? Kept the money? Or would you have returned it to the auction site and told them you found the money and that whoever had the picture frames should keep it, since it was their money they put there for safe-keeping, or whatever reason they put it there. After all, it was rightfully their money and wouldn't it be dishonest to take it if you knew whoever sold those picture frames didn't know it was in there?



What do you think?

It's ethical to keep anything you purchase at an auction, even if something is hidden inside.



It is the seller's responsibility to ensure that they're selling what they want to sell.



My guess is that this happened at an estate auction after someone died. The money in the picture frame was probably the deceased's emergency money, and they never told the family where it was hidden.

you got ripped off.



sometimes people by innocent looking pictures at garage sales or auctions for 10 bucks or less, and they turn out to be painted by the masters, not a pint-by-number thing, and worth millions.



the seller has had full opportunity to evaluate what price they would like to accept and how to sell it. Yours is not to double-guess.



By the way, people buy and sell money all the time, as collectibles, and as cash. "Cost of money" is an important business concept. That you bought some at a price favorable to you is good - now if only you could replicate it over and over it would be a great business!

More than likely if these things were being auctioned off, the original owners were probably dead and had no further use for the items nor did members of their family ,therefore the items were auctioned off....which means whomever purchases said items own them, contents and ALL!

FYE ripped me off. What should I do?



I bought a CD back in January at FYE, and they signed me up for 3 free subsciptions to my choice of magazines. I asked if I was going to have to call and cancel this, and they said no..that they would. In the past month, I have had 3 automatic withdrawls from the magazine company.  I contacted FYE and told them that what they did was dishonest, because I was getting charged for something that was free...and the manager said "well, I know. but we can't really do anything about it." How should I go about getting this issue resolved.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Contact the magazine company directly and cancel the subscriptions.



Any other rights you may have depend on what you signed at FYE back in January.



But it sounds like you did get the magazines free for several months.  Perhaps you misunderstood what you were getting.

Depends on the circumstances.  Was your nephew justified in hitting the person (only if it was self-defense)?



If he had no good reason to do it, your nephew could get in trouble.  Likely a fine/probation or some short term jail time.



Your nephew should simply plead guilty.  If he does that the judge will likely go easy on him because it shows personal responsibility.

What can my friend do? Rape accusation! ?



My Greek friend, Stavros has been accused by one man of 400 accounts of attempted rape within the period of one month. What can my friend Stavros do to deal with this looney? Even the police consider it pretty far fetched however since it is all official and the other guy is using his money to buy up some good lawyers. However there is no evidence accept the Greek guy touched his shoulder in a rather queer way apparently. But what can he do? This could ruin his reputation if nothing else. What would you do? Is counter sue possible?

If all he has been is accused, there is no court case,then your friend can sue for defamation of character, as long as he has proof that the accusation is totally untrue. It could cost a lot of money to implement though, and I suggest a visit to a solicitor may be a good idea, just to see if you have a case at all.

First off the guy would have to sue your friend before your friend could counter sue.



Since these accusations have not resulted in criminal action against your friend, he should consider suing the man for defamation of character.



If the guy expects to win the lawsuit, he will have to provide evidence that your friend actually did commit the rapes.  Since there is no proof of that you're friend should have no problem winning the lawsuit.



I would also suggest your friend go to the local courthouse and file a restraining order against the man.

It depends on the state. For many states, lottery profits are considered "charitable" because the money benefits the state. For instance, I live in Minnesota and some of our lottery proceeds benefits the environment (see below for a breakdown). Our state does allow some gambling in other ways, like Bingo and pulltabs, but only for charities. (That, of course, is not including the casinos which are operated on American Indian reservations.)
Other states have far different rules.

Lets say you see someone vandalize a car then leave the scene the owner of the car comes out and accuse some else who is standing next to the car. A fight happens and the owner of the car beats up the guy standing next to his car and the cops are called. Could a person who saw the car get vandalized  get in any trouble for not saying anything to stop  the fight.

Most states are employment at will, meaning an employer can legally fire you any time for any reason, there for there would be no such thing as "wrongful termination" in those states.  If your state is one of them, they're ignoring you because you have no case.

Mattyboy, even in at will employment states there can be grounds for wrongful termination. There are still federally protected classes that can not be the basis for termination (sex, race, religion, etc).



If you think you really have a case and the company is not responding, you need to see a lawyer or report to your state's labor board.

What was the reason they gave for termination?  You can file a complaint but you will probably not get anywhere unless you were employed under a contract (for a specific amount of time/ until the completion of a specific job), or for any discrimination reason (religion, race, disability, sex, ect.).  If you were termination with or without reason from the company, and none of these stipulations apply, you are probably better off just cutting your losses and looking for a new job.

Going back to the law after 10 years off?



I graduated Law School and passed the bar in 1999.  I've been in a different field for the past 10 years.  I've paid my state and American Bar dues every year but have neglected CLE.  I'm interested in practicing law at this point, but not sure if this is too big of an uphill battle to gain competence and get caught up on CLE.  If anyone has any experience in this, I'd appreciate some input.

The basic principles of law you learned in school haven't changed since 1999, only the specific application.  Law school doesn't teach you much about the specific applications anyway.  I'd say that you are pretty much frozen in time and on a par with newbies coming out of law school today.



So, in my firm that would qualify you for an entry level position where you would start with simpler stuff until you gained experience with the specific applications of law needed in the area you are practicing and until you learn more about civil procedure for your area.  (Civil procedure and court rules do change a lot over time.)



The problem for you is finding that position, especially if you are trying to find a law job that will pay as much as the field you have been in for 10 years.



But I think it would be unwise to try to go out on your own.  Without a mentor, you will need to spend hours and hours per week looking up what you need to know.  So much easier to have someone to point you in the right direction.



Good luck.

He is the father, and the gov't will make certain that he provide support.
This is for the benefit of the child.
A court would say if he wants to see his child, he should be able to do so, but, probably not on demand, as you are the sole parent.

I don't know the exact rule, but he is just as much a parent as you are, and i'm pretty sure that it's illegal. You need to deal with your problems instead of trying to run away, unless of course he is violent or you think he might become violent. In that case, you should take your child to a safe place and file for a restraint put upon him.



Then you need to take him to court for legal rights of the child. I would be wary of his mother.

Feel very fortunate. When I was in school we AVERAGED 35 students per class. I have been in classes with 50 other students. My chem classes did not drop until I was in college and then we had about 30 students.



The number of students is controlled by necessity. Their is a limited number of classrooms in any district. The school system must fit whatever number of students they have into those classrooms.



In high school you do have the option of choosing when to take a class. The more popular time slots will have more students in them. You might want to consider rescheduling some of your classes.

"We didn't anticipate the number who wanted to take chemistry, we are doing the best we can."



The only possible illegality would be if your school was dominated by one ethnic group and a school with another pattern had smaller classes (over all probably, not just one class), and then a federal suit might be resolved about the time you finished college.

Oh shut up. If women had a piece of skin that could in time reattach and tear during sex or an erection then I guess we would cut it off too.  circumcision is not mutilating your genitals, it is helping you in the long run.  You have to be very clean and careful.  That skin holds in moisture and can grow all kinds of nasty fungus if it isn't cared for properly.  Also it can cause problems with erections and sexual dysfunction.  It is a personal choice either way and you do not have to have your child circumcised.

Yes and no. The justification for circumcision is that it is a health issue. The foreskin retains some bacteria from urine. However, it has long been proven that proper cleaning prior to sex eliminates any hazard of infection.
Aside from any religious considerations, it is a barbaric mutilation of the male genitalia. Most pediatricians of today will ask if the parents wish the infant to be circumcised.

I had a credit card from when I as 18 that I never paid off.  It went through several collection companies before they actually went to an attornies office.  I received a letter from county sheriffs office telling me that they were taking it out of my weekly paychecks, which they called my employer and had it set up.  At that point I had the money to pay them off and did.



So generally the local police agency will take it (not as a criminal matter).

Is there a way to report water abuse in water-starved california?



california is practically rationing water, there is a real problem here.  yet there is at least one hotel that washes its exterior walls on a regular basis with several running hoses.  we see sprinklers turned on in gardens at midday, a time when most of the water will evaporate before it benefits the garden it's meant for.  these people are wasting water.  is there a way to report them?

Check with your city or county.  There may not be a water shortage where you live, or this hotel is.  Where I live in California, our water company has not given an alert.  We have our own Aquifer.  While that is not fair, we get enough rain and run off to keep going.



If you are under water regulation and the hotel is in your district, call as noted above.

I don't know about there. But a few of our hotels in Florida actually recycle the water so they can keep their lawns watered. It could be happening there. The moment you see them watering or washing, call the water company and tell them. They can normally get someone out there in a short period of time to witness it for themselves. They have to witness it though! Then they can fine them and if needed, call the authorities for breaking the city law of water usage.



Many of our large businesses have found great ways to recycle the water for very little money. The hotels here recycle the rinse water from the washer as well as recycle the water that comes from the showers in the hotels. Even some of our neighbors figured out how to do so for only 300 dollars! Amazing! One has to wash the clothing and why not find a way to recycle that water? So you just never know. But i say tell the water company and let them find out what is what.



We're restricted over here in Florida too and i too get mad when i see someone wasting a ton of it.

I think you should probably find someone your own age.



My friend who was 16 at the time went out with a 14 year old and had sex with her. Her parents found out and hell followed for him. So I wouldn't risk it. Thats just me. I'm pretty sure the age of consent in the U.S. is 16 nationally



and when a Junior going out with an 8th grader-freshman isn't really that cool to talk to your friends about.



Another dude I know gets ragged on for it all the time. The girl gets it worse though.

Switch out the word "legal" for "stupid" and ask again.
Whatcha doing with a little boy like that?  What happens when you turn 18, are you going to break up with your jail bait boyfriend?  Really, you shouldn't be dating at all for at least 10 years, if you have to ask this question.

If you do it very carefully.
1) attach it to an email addressed to yourself.



2) print out the email and make a certified photocopy immediately.
3) Keep it attached to your original design.
4) when you post it, state that the item is copyrighted using the copyright symbol, your name and the date of the email along with the statement "All rights reserved".



This will not stop piracy, but will give you third party testament to your copyright and is valid in any court.

HIPAA rules and hospital security video.  ?



As a nursing student I was verbally attacked by another student in the lobby of a hospital.  Because the attack was public and in the lobby, the administration of our university is trying to kick both of us out of school.  I never responded to her attack and merely walked out of the hospital.



As I do not feel like I participated in this unprofessional behavior, I want the security tape in case I get kicked out and want to go to court for wrongful dismissal.  When I sent a letter to Risk Management of the hospital asking for the tapes, they said the hospital lawyer is concerned that giving me the tapes would violate the patients' HIPAA rights.  However, the tapes I requested were in the lobby of the hospital.  Are patients protected in the lobby?  Or is it just patient care areas?

Sounds like a bogus argument to mean, or at best, an overprotective interpretation of HIPAA. First of all, not everyone in the lobby area of a hospital is a patient and therefore, not assured of these rights merely by their presence there. Secondly, unless there is sound on the video that is also so sensitive so as to pick up confidential converstations of hospital staff with patients, mere presence in the hospital is also, not  protected information under HIPAA.

Patients are protected anywhere in a hospital. Ask them if they can make a copy of just the part of the video that you and the other student are in and not the whole tape. If there are no patients in that part then I don't see why they would have a problem with it.

It depends. Most restraining orders are temporary restraining orders. They can mature into permanent injunctions, but there has to be a pretty big showing of potential harm to do that. Being temporary, they last up to a year before there needs to be showing of continuing harm to get it extended or made into a permanent injunction. That being said, when you are 18, the TRO will probably have lapsed anyway. This is all assuming that your mother can get the TRO in the first place. You can have a hearing, and the judge will hear both sides of whether there should be a temporary restraining order.



Now this guy that you are seeing, make sure that you don't engage in any sorts of sexual acts, because that would constitute statutory rape, and I'm sure that you don't want to be responsible for sending him to jail.



All in all, you should listen to your mother, and wait until you are 18.

"i have been seeing this 22 year old boy"



First off, a 22 year old is NOT a boy - he is an adult man, and has NO business whatsoever hanging around a 16 year old kid. Listen to your Mom. There are *ONLY* two reasons that a 22 year old man would want to date a 16 year old child. One is that he's not capable of getting a date with an adult closer to his own age, and the other is that he believes he can take advantage of your youth and immaturity to get sex. That's it - there are NO other reasons.



Only a court can issue a restraining order. Only the same court can remove it. If your Mom asks the court to issue an order, and they do, then it can only be taken off by the court - your turning 18 does not affect the order - although at 18 you could go to the court and ask them to remove it as it pertains to you.



Since you are a minor, however, your Mom can, herself, simply order him not to have contact with you, and he is required by law to comply. That personal order from your Mom will expire when you turn 18.

since your mother is paying for the restraining order, its up to her.
ther restraining order probably wont be active in 2 years, and this'boy' who is actually a man, will probably be out of your life.
yes, I am aware that this is not what you want to hear, but hes 22, and probably with you for only one reason.
find someone closer to your own age, or wait till you're 18 to shack up with old men.

Your mother does not want him sending messages to you through them.  A 22 year old should not be hanging around a high school anyway.



Yes, once you are 18 you can at least dissolve the RO against him in regards to you.



You are lucky.  If you were my daughter, you would be under watch 24/7.  Your mom is looking out for you, and a 22 year old boy is not.

ok as a mother that also HAD to put a restraining order on a young man, due to your age the court will automatically put your school, your home etc on it, also it should state that he can not contact you nor any of his friends or family via telephone, text or email.



Not being nosy or a pushy mum BUT whilst you think she is being dumb I would guess this is not a decision she made lightly and is ONLY looking out for your safety, as for the removing of it, well my own daughter turned 19 two days ago and has NO intention of getting it lifted as in the 3 years it has been in place she has grown up and seen for her self that this guy was a nutter, once she has the order then the school gets a copy and they WILL enforce it.

First, he is not a 22 year old boy. He is an adult male who, depending on the state you live in, could go to jail for dating you. You could ruin his entire life and he could end up labeled as a sex offender for being with you.



No, you cannot take of the restraining order when you are 18. It will be listed under your mother's name. If you like this guy a lot, break it off with him. Your mom could make life very difficult for him. She could talk to his job and get him fired among other things.



She isn't being dumb. The only reason a 22 year old man goes out with a 16 year old girl is for sex. All you'd have to do for him to break up with you is say there can be nothing sexual for 2 full years between us. He'd move on quickly to the next insecure girl who was looking for love in the wrong places. Your mother understands him better than you will at this age. I've been your age, i had the 20 year old boyfriend and found out all his talk of love was meaningless, the hard way. She wants to save you from yourself.



At your age it's hard to see a parent as being right. It's apart of growing up. You want to fight your parents and fight the rules and become independent. But it's your parents job to make sure they keep you as safe as possible. What happens when you end up pregnant and this guy runs? Who will take care of you and the baby then?



Your mom would only be dumb if she wasn't trying to protect you. She knows what's in a 22 year olds mind and she knows what's in a 16 year olds. Money, car, probably a place of his own and an older guy to take care of you. Ever wonder why he isn't with a woman his own age? One he could take anywhere, places your age won't let you go in?



If you are half as grown up as you think you are, you'd think these things through more carefully and realize a man that age isn't going to give you truth... no matter how badly you want to believe him. Be like a 16 year old guy wanting to date a 10 year old. What would you think of that? Telling yourself you are mature and being mature aren't the same thing. Being mature takes plenty of thought and careful deliberation. At 16 it's almost impossible to not fall in love with every guy you meet and that doesn't wear down for a bit. Realizing your inner self is the way to seeing htis clearly.

You are only eligible for unemployment if you are out of work through no fault of your own, such as lack of work,  plant closing or your job being eliminated..



Not working due to  stress, or not feeling comfortable on the job, or pregnancy would  disqualify you for unemployment. Even being fired , may be a difficult case to prove, as you were warned.

First answer here is correct. However, if you are stressed out you may be able to collect family leave, the amount of paid time varies depending on state and company.  If you do not pay into long-term care it may be very short.  My company generously gives up to 26 weeks, put we pay half of that each pay period.  The law says you can take family leave w/o threat of losing your job, which covers pregnancy or family illness.  But if you your company does not pay family leave or only pays 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks, considering how you will manage may be a factor.  My advice, I do not fight for control at work, it is not my company, but only a JOB - I surrender 7 hours of power to any boss or company as long as I am not physically abused.  If someone does something legally wrong it is on the company not the employee!  Do yourself a favour and try to take care of yourself and your baby and to hell with the company.

In this economy I wouldn't quit unless you don't need this job to survive.  Since you have already been there for 5 years you are obviously doing something right - you need to just keep doing what you have been doing, and don't give her any reason to fire you.  It sounds like your job has always been a stressful one - just give this new woman a chance to get to know you and to settle into her position.  If the doctor feels you are under too  much stress & puts you on bedrest then that will be a medical leave, and you should receive disability benefits (although I don't know what state you live in - in CA you'd get disability insurance benefits) - you wouldn't be quitting your job (at least I wouldn't until AFTER the baby is born - you're going to need that medical insurance!!!).  You're in a good position being pregnant also - most employers wouldn't dare fire you for fear of a lawsuit (providing you don't give them a reason to, that is) so I really wouldn't worry too  much if I were you.  Just do your job, take deep breaths, and kiss *** to the nazi - she may become your best friend before long, ya know?

That war, or rebellion, ended over 143 years ago. Robert E. Lee handed his sword over to General U.S. Grant and pulled down the colors of the confederacy.



At the time some rebellious sorts still raised the flag and said different vows to it and the KKKlan used it to raise hatred and racial division throughout the South.



It is only a piece of cloth. People use it as a symbol of what it is they are thinking but the war is over. The South lost. That should be enough for reasonable people to put the flag to rest. Until that happens certain rebel sorts will always be dragging out the past trying to stir up old divisions.

Forget what the south stood for with slavery and all.



the people who fought behind that flag were americans and they died for a cause they believed in. It is a part of history and shouldn't be destroyed. Just because you fly the flag doesn't mean you stand for the same things they did back then, each person has their own reasons.



I fly the american flag on my house not because I support the president and the current state of america.



I fly it for all the troops currently fighting for what they believe in and for all the veterans living and passed on who have made the country free as it is today. Some people won't salute it because they hate the president. Flags mean different things to different people and before you take offense you need to see why they fly it.

Banning the flag will not turn time back, it will not change the fact that possibly someones great, great, great grand pa was a slave, it will not make the KKK go away. MOST people down south now don't even relate that flag to anything other than just the "southern flag" , period. There was racism and slaves in the northern U.S. so lets just get rid of all flags and start from scratch.

Freedom of speech, limited by incitement of violence. Offensive speech by one group should not generally be restricted by legal action by another. Flag is a symbol with subjective interpretation (proud history, horrendous crimes), so limiting its use would deprive some people of their right to a proud display, even if others see it differently. The flag itself is not dangerous. Limitations on free speech must endure strict scrutiny under the constitution and must be carefully crafted to assert only the minimum infringement necessary to carry out a bona fide goal for the benefit of the public (such as maintaining community peace). The flag (among ALL flags) could be limited as to time or place for its display, but not effectively banned, nor singled out because of its content (except in comparison, perhaps, with the American flag, which must always be higher than other flags, etc).

It's a civil matter and the police will tell you that they cannot get involved in civil matters. If you live in a small enough town, and if your police department is nice... you could claim you are afraid and only want someone there to witness while you remove your items.



Instead of emailing, call him to ask when you can pick up your furniture. He could make it very difficult to get it back if he choses not to play nice. One reason you should have gotten the money up front or taken it with you to begin with. But that's past and can't be changed. But remember it for the future, live and learn. Great life lesson here.



worst comes to actual worst... is the furniture worth truly fighting for? Small claims court would be the place to start if you think it is. Often, people will do stupid things out of spite and if you don't play into that spite, it will ease up. If it were me, i'd let the furniture go if it came down to a big battle, but that's me.

No, you don't need to get local police involved unless he won't let you take the items. Even then, you would probably have to sue him (you could do it in small claims court without a lawyer) to get that stuff back. If it is amicable, don't worry about the police. Just go over to his place and get your stuff.

If you have any intrepidation in picking up your furniture, then show the email to the police who will either accompany you to pick it up or a constable will be assigned to do so. I don't blame you for being a little suspicious. Anything can go down in that situation.

you can call the local police an ask for an escort to the property.
The police will ask about the situation, so it is usually best to go to the station that way they you can explain yourself in person. Go to the station a day or two before you would like to pick up your items. once you explain the situation, the police officer handling your case will probably try to contact your ex to set up a date and time where you can get your stuff. If you have any documentation proving you lived there (license, mail in your name, bills, checks, etc) it would be helpful to bring them with you to the station to establish proof of residency.



good luck!

The police can accompany you to see that everyone is being nice but they won't get involved in who owns what.  They also will not give you permission to enter; your ex needs to do  that.

A manager told all employees to take our last 15 min break. only i didn't get mine cause he put me to work.?



so while everyone else was in the break room playing cards and watching movies he pointed at me and this young guy and put us to work despite telling everyone that there was no more work to be done.



after i finished my task i went to the break room to join everyone else and he sends me home 1 hour before my shift wasn't even over. i was supposed to be there from 2:30 to 11:00pm. I got how at 10:00.



now let me remind you i was the only one he sent home everyone else was still there.



i contacted the temp agency they told me that they couldn't do anything about it. they didn't even want to give out numbers so  could seek more help. i contacted the bbb and the dept of economic growth still didn't get nothing.



then i called the us equal employment opportunity. they told me that since i wasn't under the age of 18 that i'm not required to have breaks. is this true? i really want to get to the bottom of this and find out what other actions that can be done about this situation.

What should be done, who can he contract?



He buy everything his son needs; diapers, milk, clothes, etc... Mother tells the father can’t see his son unless he does everything she says. Take parenting classes, he has, take anger management classes he has (never needed them) but still he is not allow to see his son.  He works and she says “stop working and babysit your son or you won’t be able to see him anymore”. She told him that she has a restraining order against him(witch it’s a lied), so he doesn’t  go to the house, but still he has to take diapers, milk, clothes, etc... “so how am I suppose to do this if theirs a restraining order against me” he tells her? He doesn’t do what she says as soon as she says it than she tells him, “ You don’t love your son, I’m taking him to a different state”. If he calls to see how his son is or he doesn’t call she gets angry. He now has someone else call her to see how his son is. He called her to say that he wanted to see his son for his birthday, she said yes but only if you pay for half of the party. He had bought some clothes for his son because he outgrew clothes he had and with winter around the corner he needed warm clothing. But he was told to just leave the gift on the door step and to ring the bell. He loves his son, not a day goes by without him thinking about him. What should he do?

He gave the money to C's wife, who said to A that C was not at home but she would let him know that A had bought the vase. A took the vase away with him.
What case law supports that A is entitled to the vase? Does anyone know of a past law case that is similar to this situation?

What do you think of this idea ?



Instead of us all sending around more questions about how horrible Sarah Palin is, let's all make a donation to Planned Parenthood in her name.



Let's send $10, or even $5, to Planned Parenthood in her honor!



I can't think of a better way to let her know what we think about her desire to take reproductive choices away from American women!



Here's the good part: when you make a donation to Planned Parenthood in her name, they'll send her a card telling her that the donation has been made in her honor.



Here's the link to the Planned Parenthood website:



https://secure.ga0.org/02/pp10000_inhono...



You'll need to fill in the address to let PP know where to send the "in Sarah Palin's honor" card. I suggest you use the address for the McCain campaign headquarters, which is:



McCain for President



1235 S. Clark Street , 1st Floor



Arlington , VA 22202



PS. make sure you use the link above or choose the 'Donate' pulldown  and select 'Honorary or Memorial Donations', at plannedparenthood.com.

I used to say, MEN stay out our (women) business! But I guess there a lot of women too who don't believe in a women's right to choose what she does with her body! If they want women to stop having abortions, OK! here's MY plan!  Let these pro-lifers take those children and raise them!! OR! take those $10 donations to build an enormous facility to house all these unwanted children, and let the Government take care of them!  They are already doing that on a smaller scale with these women on welfare having one kids after another, and each one with a different father!!

Wrongfully accused? how do i get out of jail?



YOUR GUNNA WANA READ THIS&gt; im speaking on behalf of my friends brother..cause hes a little incapacitated right now..hes in jail..state jail. your probably going to freak out when you read this right now and thats ok...because you should. This is a PRIME example of how the United States Court System is full on BULL.



a year ago my friends brother (lets call him Sean) was going out with a 16 year old. well her father is a prick and didn't really approve of them dating, only this wasnt known till after he turned 18. he was only 17 when they started dating mind you, ONE YEAR APART. Her parents took him out to dinner, laughed with him, hung out with him etc. I know Sean and his family and hes a legit human being. The second he turned 18 his dad turned into someone else for an unknown reason and forbid the relationship..18..and 17..mind you. and when i mean forbid i mean completley tried to cut them off. WEll..like any human being in love would do, they went behind his back and still saw each other. I mean if you were in love, wouldnt you do the same damn thing? I dont know about you, but not the president of the united stated himself would keep me away from someone i loved, RIGHT? thats the point of love, especially if its genuine and real. Anyways, her dad caught him in her room one day, and called the cops. HEs been in jail since. an 18 yr old has lost his life because of a psychotic Mormon father. hes now almost 20, and he was realeased on bail..WITH A ANKLE LOCATER, AND REGISTERD AS A HIGH RISK SEX OFFENDER FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE&gt; ...high risk sex offender, really? come on. anyways, before he got rearrested last week, he had stayed away from her, gone to church every sunday, hung out with his family, woke up at 6am every day and sat in one spot for 2 hours to charge his ankle braclet, and just tried to reestablishhimself in the community. well GUESS WHAT. HE was arrested for having the movie OLD SCHOOL, they did a raid on his house and they SAID OLD SCHOOL was too offensive for a sex offender to have. so hes now back in state prison, for having a Will Ferrell Movie.



now i want you to know these amazing facts......
-her dads buisness is LITERALLY across the street from the prosecuting  police department.
-her dad knows the important peopel in the town.
he went through 4 psychologits that deemed him a normal guy and not a sex offender before "THEY" finally found a 5th pyschologists that said he should remain in jail..which my guess was they paid him off or sean was just over it by that point and felt hopeless.
-its an inside job and something needs to be done!



this isnt just about SEAN....its about YOU. this is our country! lets take it back. how can we get innocent peopel out of jail? how can we get sean out of jail? how can we take back our justice system?



anyone know what i can do for him? please his families hurting...

Dude, you need Internal Affairs. It's not a federal thing, it's a state thing so you have to find the one for whatever state you live in because you didn't specify it I can't find it for you, however I would google the sheeite out of that. "Internal Affairs+your state". Internal affairs is the police of the police. If that doesn't work, you should go to the state police, not the local police and tell them your problem. If that doesn't work, you need to get your friend a good lawyer, preferably a private one and not a state defender.

I've heard stories like this before. It's sad and I don't know what the answer is. The jail is just the start, I've talked to a guy in a similar situation, he dated a 16 year old when he was 18 or 19, and got himself on the sex offender's list. Ten years later, he can't live anywhere without constant harassment from the neighbors. The vandalize his home, and spray paint his car. No where on the sex offender web site does it say why the person is on there, everyone just makes the assumption the person is a child molester. I've heard of people making the list because they got caught urinating outside, how is urinating a sexual act? They need to have better judgment on who makes the list.

YES!



Firstly, let me say that I am completely biased. My grad-dad died a long, slow and very painful death from lung cancer due to asbestos.  He should not have been made to suffer for 3 long months in pain that the morphine could not cover.  In  the end he did not know who he was, who his family were and just lay there and cried wanting the pain to end. It is simple - He wanted the pain to stop, he should have had that control.



The problem from a legal point of view would be at what point and for what disease should people be allowed to make these decisions.  This should be the debate, not if it should be allowed. I can see the problems in who gets to make the decision - the patient who may have lost the ability to make decisions for themselves, families and the conflict this may cause or the law - which takes time and is already overburdened.  The idea of for what reason/diseases is also interesting - for depression or for end stage cancer?



There are no easy answers but there should be a discussion rather than ignoring the issue.

Well, the reason it is NOT legal is cause you can't be 100% certain the person has been influenced to ask for euthanasia.



There are many pros for legal euthanasia, however it can be easily manipulated into foul play.



One reason is, people who have a will, the heirs can convince the person to ask for euthanasia just to get the fortune. It would be then like legal murder.



Animals however, when they need to put down, they are put down without a second thought cause the owner is responsible so it's up to him/her (just like the closest relative is responsible for pulling a comatose plug or not when it's 100% sure they aren't reviving).

If it's consensual, when the person decides that it's their time then I see no reason in making them live if they don't want to. They can decide to make the paperwork proccess tough, that way there won't be any foul play. (ie murder)



Its kind of strange how we are allowed to poison our bodies with prescription drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. But we can't get a doctor to kill us mercifully without pain.

This is just my opinion, I feel like if partial birth abortion is legal for someone that doesent even have a say in the matter ( the fetus) then euthanasia should be legal as well. Of course I dont like the idea of either. As I am pro life.

Go to the police station.  Maybe tape some of his calls, but it is really against the law to tape anyone unless they know they are being taped, so get him to say something on your answering machine and that is legal then.  Try to get proof of what he is doing.  Save your e-mails and print them out.  Stay away from him and talk to the police.  There are restraining orders, but sometimes that can actually escalate his need to bother you and get attention from you.  Be careful.

You need to prove that you created that song on a certain date.  And on that date the music was automatically copyrighted. Put your music or song in some tangible form - a piece of paper, a CD, a floppy disk or written as sheet music or even on a napkin. Just remember - it HAS to be in a tangible form. Then you have to find a copyright office, google it with your state and city, and they will give you a process to go through.

Which state would I have to file a lawsuit in?



I bought an AKC certified "Boxer" from a breeder in PA when she was 8 weeks old.  As she is getting older she looks NOTHING like a Boxer so I questioned the AKC and they are now investagating the Breeder since they also believe she is not a purebreed Boxer.  If she is proven to NOT be a full breed Boxer I want to sue since I bought her thinking she was a Boxer not a mixed breed.  I live in NY but the breeder is in PA.  Which state would I have to sue in and what is the most I could sue for?  I love the dog, but have young children and bought this dog (at 8 weeks you really couldn't tell what she was she was so small) under the assumption that since she was AKC registered that I was buying a Boxer.  I have no idea what she is mixed with Pit Bull, Mastiff - who knows?  Now I have committed myself to this dog for the next I don't know how many years and I wanted a Boxer.  I would feel terrible to give her away since she is now 9 months old and my daughter is very attached to her, but I feel scammed.  Would I sue in PA since that's where she was purchased or in the state I live in NY?

Now I lost my license, what should I do?  ?



I lost my license sometime last week but did not worry about it thinking that I will eventually find it.  After not finding it for a week, I decided to go to the Driver's Bureau in my state to get a new one.  My request was declined because I have not yet gone through social security to change my last name.  (Newly Wed by the way)  Took my wife's last name instead of her taking mine.  Long story.  Anyway, Yesterday I found out that I am a victim of identity theft.  I am scared to do anything now because I feel like someone else is me!  I know this sounds crazy but I'm frozen.  What should I do?  Whatever I do, I do not want to risk someone being able to use my identity again.  I already filed the disputes and a report.  Now I'm just waiting till investigation is done.  What should I do now?

The TV licence is a form of tax.  Most of us pay our taxes even if we don't agree with what they are spent on.  If you don't pay, you get a £1,000 fine.  If enough of us did it, the BBC would have plenty of money for yet more crap programmes.

No - but we should adopt the Greek system for TV licencing.  Everybody with a house gets a set amount added to their electricity bill, whether or not they have a TV - it's far less than we pay for our TV licences.  Imagine if we operated that system how much money would be saved - in administration costs and IT, vans roaming the countryside with revolving luggage racks, court costs for non licence holders who have a TV, and Satellite system identifying every property in the UK to see if they have a licence!  etc etc

Do I need a TV Licence?



You need a TV Licence to use any television receiving equipment such as a TV set, digital box, DVD or video recorder, PC, laptop or mobile phone to watch or record television programmes as they're being shown on TV.



If you use a digital box with a hi-fi system or another device that can only be used to produce sounds and can't display TV programmes, and you don't install or use any other TV receiving equipment, you don't need a TV Licence.



Where does it state that your licence is for watching the BBC only?It is for all tv channels including Sky/Virgin/Free Sat.

Is pimping and pandering serious crime in ur opinion?



several girls I met at schools and online have tried introducing me to older rich men or guys looking to score in some weird way.
like they would pretend like they just met the MAN and try to hook me up with them. in some occasions, they were smoking marijuana and get me to smoke with them while they were passed out. (acting like they were passed out)
I am so upset and I dont understand why I attract these girls.
and I am pretty naive and I am not even from this country but asia.
I've already been victimized hugely in the past and I am pretty much angered. not sure if other women go thru the same thing..or if I should just simply avoid them because I was not sexually assaulted except One occasion.



I want to understand the consequences of reporting these crimes and these girls at my conversative christian money hungry university I am attending. will I get into a serious trouble for being around people abusing drugs? or drinking? (altho I am legal to drink)
are they going to get me into trouble as well?



I am in a lot of pain and I just want to report everyone who tries to bully me and put me in that kinda situation..
what are your thoughts?
I have been advised not to report them because they might retaliate.

It would be dependent on the hiring qualifications of the department you're looking at.



Most departments will want a high school diploma OR EQUIVALENT, as well as college hours.  The usual requirement is anywhere from 35 college hours up to a full 4-year bachelors degree.  The college is the important part, not so much the GED.  As you can see from the link attached in the sources, the Illinois State Police require college, and no mention is made of exclusions for those applicants who hold a GED rather than a diploma.



As a former police officer who has a GED and a college degree, I can't say that my education prior to college was a sticking point.  I knew of several officers who were hired with ONLY a high school equivalency and completion of a private, state-licensed police academy, although they were employed by smaller towns whose hiring and firing policies and decisions were made only by the police chief and possibly the town council.



Look into the licensing/certification requirements for your state, or call your state police recruiter and ask-- they'll give you the right information right off the bat and even suggest where you could start heading education-wise if you really want to go into law enforcement.



Hope this answer is helpful to you.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A barrister is a person who is licensed to prepare and try cases in court. A solicitor is a person who is licensed to handle out-of-court legal matters. These terms are English in origin. A lawyer is a person who is licensed to handle both. It is an American term. A judge is a person who decides contested matters. The judge serves as the trier of fact and the trier of law when there is no jury. The judge serves only as the trier of law when there is a jury, which serves as the trier of fact.

There are many alternative ideas out there that the LIBS refuse to listen to.  In my opinion, we as tax payers should NOT BE BAILING OUT THESE CORRUPT GREEDY PEOPLE & BUSINESS"S.  It CAN be done without tax payer monies.  It CAN be done without our Government taking over.

Help! Do you think its fraud?



Probably a week ago, I seen the advertisement of green card lottery. (www.usafis.org).
Notice: this seems like an official website.



SO I went to that link: https://www.usafis.org/masterssl/start2....
And it required me to fill in the information, that also included my phone number. After I have seen that I actually had to pay to participate - I didnt finish the procedure.



Few days after I had a phone call from the guy, saying that he has seen my application and everything, and if I didnt know how to register and do the payment procedure he could help me with that.
I told him, that I am at work and cant really talk ritght now, and I wudnt wanna also leave the credit card info online, but he was politely insisting, saying that there is a high protection on website and I shouldnt be worried about the account information.



I think its weird just havin someone calling you. Do you think that website is fraudish?

I think that that website is fraudulent. Any time a "government" website has a lot of grammar errors involving basic English then you know that it is more then likely fraudulent. This toolbar will also turn red if a website is known to be fraudulent. download it at http://www.siteadvisor.com/
when you go to the website with the toolbar the bar turns red and if you read the security report it says this



"This site charges a fee for processing entries for the US Diversity Visa Lottery (aka green card lottery). There is no charge to enter the Diversity Visa Lottery program directly through the U.S. Department of State Web site.

As far as I know it's 18. Yet, you can use a gun at the age of 12 if supervised by an adult.



What's the point of "pro gun control"? The 2nd amendment says it all.



We, the people, have the right to bear arms. End of story.

Where was the wine bottle relative to you? If it wasn't near you and it wasn't your room, they can't reasonably show that it was yours (although they may come down on your friend). As to if you will get in trouble, that depends on what type of system the school/dorm has for resolving these issues and if they actually require proof that it is yours (it's not a court, the legal standards of proof do not apply).

've been reading that are some agencies and people out there who are still determined to track down the Nazis who went into hiding and escaped after the war ended.

Is this normal.. Concering labour laws?



I live in new brunswick and have just recently started a new job as a cashier. At the place where i am working, all the employees were FORCED to sign a sheet saying that we are only entitled to a break after 4 or MORE hours of work, and also if we work only a 4 hour shift, we are not entitled to a break at all. Working 4 hours straight on cash with no breaks is hell. Is this illegal? Also, if our cash is under 3 dollars or more, that money comes out of our paycheck. They are saying that if we make a mistake, it is our responsiblity to pay for it. To me, this seems absurd. I thought that the labor law stated that an employee is entitled to a break after 2 hours. Can anyone clarify this for me and/or tell me what the real law is? It's really pissing me off.



Thanks in advance!

No employer is required to give a break for under 8 hours of work. I'm not sure about the employer but it sounds pretty much the way it is . You can always try to find another job, but some employers will make you responsible for missing money. It is your responsibility to make sure your cash drawer is accurate. Make sure you count back the change correctly and there should be no prblems with that, also watch out for short change artists, do not let them fool you .

The mandatory break law in New Jersey only applies to minors under the age of 18 and they must be given a thirty (30) minute meal period after five (5) consecutive hours of work. Company policy dictates break and lunch periods for anyone over the age of 18.



So I'm afraid to tell you that your company policy is the final word.



Hope this helps.

You will have to ask that your children be questioned by the judge.  Usually that is done in private with each child separately.  However, at their age, they simply may not have any way to get out of going with him for visitation.  They may be furious with him now but he is still their dad.  However, I don't think you are required to force them out the door and into his car.  Ask the judge how to handle this.  Have your kids interrupt, politely, if they are being overlooked.

What I can tell you is that what you need to do is put the well being of the kids as priority. A judge can read through spite and maliciousness. it has to be about the kids, what is best for them, so if you deal with all of this with those kids as #1 priority, you will prevail. Also, no matter what happened in your divorce, you need to keep in mind, that you and your soon to be ex, need to put the kids in the middle as less as possible. So both of you need to set all hard feelings aside when it comes to them, and make sure you 2 get along as much as possible. Those kids don't need that and it is hard enough going through a divorce. So my advice is to make nice with the ex-in regaurds to the kids and come up with a solution that is fair for both of you and works best for the kids. Vs playing tug awar in court.

My cousin finally won full custody of his son after many years of battles!  He would never miss and visit and he would get his 6 month old son with a bleeding butt because the diaper rash was so bad, raw skin under his chin where the bottle had been propped up and allowed to run into his cute little fat rolls without being cleaned up.  The burn on his leg where is rolled into the heater, before he could roll over.  As he got older not having a home, having head lice so bad the back of his head was a solid scab, the numerous new boyfriends, and the new baby that would follow!  Finally when the boy was 4 my cousin received full custody.  Then the state terminated her rights to her other 4 children, but not this boy as she didn't have custody of him!!

Not a popular viewpoint sadly in this era, but children are better off being brought up under the loving care of both their natural parents, if only their parents can both see this and make it the single priority of their lives.  The collective wishful thinking that this is not the case still surprises me.  So, if there is any chance that you and your husband can still rally round in the cause of your joint children, do it.  They only get one childhood.

Can my mom really get my sister convicted?



Over three years ago, we discovered that my mother had been cheating on my father for quite some time. She decided to give up a 35 year marriage, 5 children and 7 grandchildren to "be bad" and drink, smoke, and have sex with many men (all things she taught us were wrong). None of us have spoken to her since.



However, while she was still in our lives, my younger sister was in college. Being that she lived in another state, our mother had agreed to get her some Parent Loans. My sister had to sign things in her name, on occasion, which my mother said was ok. (i.e. sign the loan check over to the school, etc.)



Now, my mother (3 years after the fact) is prosecuting my sister for fraud even though my sister is making the monthly payments. She wants and needs the debt cleared off of her record in a bad way, for some reason, and decided that the only way to do it was to take legal action. She is claiming that my sister forged her name in order to get these loans, but at the time, she did what any normal mother out-of-state would do for their child...allow them to sign for them.



Does she even have a case against my sister? What can my sister do since she is making the monthly payments and has no extra money to just pay off the whole loan?

Can she prove that your mother told her to do it or are ANY of the document in your mother's actual signature?  I would think that  that would prove that it wasn't done behind your mother's back.

It is fraud. Unless your sister can proove that your mother ever said that, then yes, she can get into a lot of trouble. She should have NEVER done that. You don't do that to anyone not even because someone said they would do it. That's the difference, she said she would do it, but did not, so now your sister has used your mothers name and credit to benefit herself and that is fraud. Sorry, but she should have gotten the loans in her own name or asked your father for help. What she did was wrong, no matter what is going on with your mothers life. Which sounds to me like a mid life crisis. Probubly that you have no clue as to all the true reasons. She has issues and instead of helping a parent with issues, sounds like all of you have fully thought of yourselves. She is human and your sister took advantage and used her own mothers name. WRONG. Nothing makes that right, and trust me I have a father who has been in the place your mother is, and I woud never have done that to him. He's human , not perfect, but love in a family should be unconditional and when a family member is doing things like what your mother is doing, it is a huge cry for help, self distructive and you guys instead of giving tough love and unconditional love, sound like you have thought of yourselves and used your mother. YOur sister should have put the loans in her name, gotten a job and worked hard at putting herself through college. I did.

Again a double standard. What you watch and view in your own home is fine but going out and finding someone on the corner is viewed to be wrong and illegal. Certainly some will mention drugs and other criminal activity but when you look at the fact 97% of all federal inmates are incarcerated on drug charges then you see that everything revolves around drugs when it comes to criminal activity.

It wouldn't be necessary. A good liar who believes his own lies can always beat any lie detector test. Besides, it would only confirm what we already know.



Politicians tells us only what we want to hear in order to be re-elected. It is our own fault.



Voters need to start thinking for themselves to get us out of the mess we are presently in.

Can I get a Restraining order...no contact order?



Can I get a restraining order?
My X's mother will not leave me alone. I have been communicating through intermediaries to try to appease her and I've been just going along with whatever they want. But the more I try to do this the madder she gets...like she wants a big confrontation. She is trying to bully me into selling them the house I bought next to their new property (they convinced me to buy it for my finace and i to live in...we already moved in together for 5 months and were getting married this dec). They both slowly drove by this property in 2 seperate cars one right after the other. they have asked friends whether I'm still living there, where I'm working..etc. My x has a mental condition and I've been told that if I ever tell they will make my life "very difficult". The mother has temper issues and deep connection with law enforcement in a neighbooring county. Their son told my friend he thought about saying that I'd committed a felony which is ridiculous but him possibly telling others that is unnerving. I worked for the family business so they have my social, dob, and all my sensitive info. His mother is verryyy angry and is just telling everybody that I'm getting nasty. I even arranged had her pick a time slot to get more of their stuff. They have back all his stuff...furniture they were letting us use...even a gun that he gave me while we were dating and I haven't founght them on anything at all. I thought they would just leave me alone but now they say I have to get the A/C and gas stove out of my house and give it to them. My ex bought the stove for me and let me pick it out right before we moved in together into my house. The A/C his mother bought for us and installed (window unit) it about a couple of weeks after my ex and I moved into the house. I went to the sherrif because I was scared and he said to contact the Justice of the Peace....but he's just saying that I have to get a lawyer and talk to Adult Protective Services but they doubt they can do anything since they haven't broken the law yet. I'm scared, intimidated, she is getting worse and says that since I've been nasty (which I haven't even had contact with her directly!) and now she says she's gonne get nasty now..I thought she was already. I live in the country with nobody I know within 45 miles and their property borders mine. What do I do??



His mother also said on tape that she refuses to give me phone records I printed for her son to prove I wasn't cheating on him (I didn't realize at first that they were draging my name through the mud for a couple of months before they broke it off so that nobody would believe me if I told some of their shady secrets...not that I would anyway...I just want them to leave me alone and I didnt want to anger them.) She says I won't get them back unless they get the stove, A/C and "everything they've done for me" back. It took them breaking it off for me to realize how controlling him and his mother are....I could not cut my hair without him freaking out, if I went to lunch alone (I did twice in 4 months!) he wanted to know where I went, who I was with, what I ate.... His mother controlled everything he does and was trying to have me put the house in his name too about a month before they broke if off and I was uncomfortable with it later he said I misunderstood.

As for the driving by cause they own the property next door its hard to stop them,. You need  to stop letting them get things if its their and was not a gift you might have to give it back. But if its not theirs like the ac and it was a gift they cant fight for it back. You need to do your self a favor and document EVERYTHING. If someone comes to you and says something write the date and time and every detail in a spiral. they drive by write the date and time start collecting your evidence. If things are not theres liek the ac have your mom start looking now for the reciept for it. LOL build your case your gonna need to fight and that way when the time comes to call the cops say they drive by and throw something on you lawn to harrase you have that and all the other past issues written down forthem to see your being bugged. GL see if maybe a family member or friends will stay with you for extra protection. Keep your house locked tight when ya leave

Is this an actual law firm or collection agency?



My friend had a debt collection from 2004 sent to a law firm called Hayt, Hayt, and Landau in Florida. When she first was contacted by them, they said they were attorneys of her original creditor (credit acceptance, I think). She is a student, and makes very little money, so she said she could only afford to pay $40 month. The lady told her "that's way too little". So my friend said "well thats all I can afford". Next thing she knows, about 6 months later, she gets a letter to appear in court. She has graduated from college but has not found a better job, but gets a few more hours at work and agreed to pay $100 to keep from getting her wages garnished. She settled this at the courthouse on that court date. The "attorneys" weren't there, and they entered this over the phone.
She has been paying this $100 faithfully, but with her only making $550 a month, it is KILLING her to pay this. She has went 1 month already almost losing electricity. My questions are, what can she do, and is this REALLY a law firm, or a collection agency? Also, they don't send receipts, or report her paying to the credit bureaus. So the only proof she has of paying is her money order receipts.

Hayt, Hayt, and Landau is a law firm acting as a collection agency.  They operate in Florida and in other states.



Do a Yahoo! search on that name.  You will have interesting results.



She may consult a counselor at her credit union, if she is a member.



She should be very concerned about getting no receipt or statement.



She may want to contact the consumer protection division of the state attorney general's office to see if she can find any help there.



Overwhelming debt at such a young age limits one's options.

Can we slip removal of federal gun control into ban?



Really, I see very little use for federal gun control when the states and D.C. could legislate their own.



As you know, Gun Control is a hot button issue, and when there is a sweeping federal law on this topic, half the nation always gets angry.  But... if we allow individual states and D.C. to legislate their own rules, then everyone can be happy.



And if you live in a state with disagreeable laws, you simply move.



I suggest all federal gun control dating back to 1968 be nullified after a certain future date (say 6 months from now) to give time to the states to put their own laws into place.



IF such text is included within the bailout package, then perhaps I would agree to it.

I would use the term "person with a hearing impairment" if at all possible. It's more in agreement with the standards of "people first" language.



Rather than specify that the person does not speak, I would simply note the means that the person does use, ie. ASL, keyboard, etc. (There are many technological means to produce speech.)



Therefore, your "deaf mute" might be "a woman with a hearing impairment who communicates primarily with ASL." Note that she's a person first, not a disability.

Never heard of this until now, Barney Frank is proposing it.  Not surprising, he probably needs to smoke it after his debacles with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac policy (look it up, he's one of the main guys responsible).



After looking at it, it really doesn't legalize it:



http://www.house.gov/frank/hr5843summary...



It removes federal penalties, state penalties still exist.
It decriminalizes possession and not-for-profit transfer, you still can't sell it.
Public use is still punished, a $100 fine.
Growing it is still illegal.



It was introduced, status pending, hasn't made it to committee:

Hey guys, out of curiosity, is it legal to have a bonfire on a beach? (in Scotland) are there restrictions?



So some friends of mine have decided they're having a beach party with a bonfire and I was wondering if they're going to get carted away and arrested for arson lol

Well I have had a few bonfires on Scottish beaches and never had any bother with it.  Just make sure you don't do it in a popular or residential beach as there will be complaints about noise, smoke or danger to children and animals.  Make sure you're well away from residential areas or not close enough to cause annoyance.  Keep the fire reasonably small and you should be okay.  Have fun!  :)

it's a media thing, don't you think that everything to do with the media is corrupt & will try to stop freedom of speech at all costs, anything anybody says or writes cc:education of the people for the better, the media will ban it.

And there should be cencership. This is a public forum. Kids as young as 13 come on here to ask and wnswer questions. They don't need to be lerning curse words or reading about some idiot who thinks it's cool to light bunnies on fire. Thats just an example.

Maybe if the guy stated his opinion in a more appropiate manner, they guy wouldn't have gotten banned.

People take that freedom for granted. Some people think that the freedom of speech constitution gives you the right to run your mouth and say what ever you want.  Thats not the case, some things what you say have consiquenses, and physical threats is one of them.

You can openly express you views with out persicution, like saying how much you hate out president, or you think some laws are stupid and you think marijuana should be legal. Just say appropriatly. So it can be read by every one.

If you were to say how much you hated our dictator in some other countries, you can face severe penalties.

They have to regulate what is said and the nature because they have a wide range of members of all ages, sexes, races etc.  I don't know what the guy had said, that would be interesting to see, but putting that aside, if they let anything published on this site they may get a bad name, and potentially looking at it in the extreme they might be seen to be aiding all sorts of things that could potentially be a threat to its users.  In that sense, it is essential they vet comments and actions of potentially dangerous acts by users to protect others.  It maybe that they could be subject to claims of negligence if someone had suffered harm in some way if they had not taken steps to protect others (i think, but not sure?!) and also loosing their reputation in the commercial market.

Sono una prof del sud che insegna al nord...?



Il mio primo incarico mi è stato dato da una scuola in lombardia e non perchè fossi migliore di altri ma per il semplice fatto che tutte le persone del nord e del sud contattate prima di me hanno rifiutato(prima di me c'erano circa 31 persone)detto questo vi posso assicurare che alcuni colleghi del nord  venivano a scuola solo per aumentare le loro entarte mensili visto che avevano già un lavoro,se ne  fregavano altamente dell'istruzione dei ragazzi lasciandoli liberi di fare quello che volevano per poi difenderli a spada tratta anche in presenza di gravissime insufficienze, perchè avevano paura che un mumero troppo alto di bocciature impedisse ai ragazzi di iscriversi in quella scuola facendo diminuire le classi e perdere il posto a molti di loro. Il lavoro di questa gente veniva criticato da tutti dalla vicepreside (milanese)e da molti altri colleghi (brianzoli da generazioni) i quali invece hanno apprezzato il lavoro di molti prof del sud...a voi le conclusioni.

When is it morally legal to kill?



Is it moral to kill someone when you have seen them carry out a crime that would influence so many people that their death would help prevent the deaths of hundreds of others?  Would it look good in the eyes of the press to snuff out the life of a really sick person if their death meant that so many thousands would live?
Hitler for instance.  His early death wouldve meant life for millions.  yet would the press tolerate his death when he was a budding politician?  Even weeks before hitler ordered the invasion of french germany the West was blind to him but many knew his dangers.
why is mankind so stupid in the face of evil, snuff it out, kill it when you have the chance.

You're asking two separate questions at the same time.  Are you asking when it's moral or when is it legal?  If you're asking about morality, that is based on your own values.  However, what you consider evil isn't evil all the time.  Was Hitler bad?  To the rest of the world?  Yes.  To Germany?  Probably not so much if you were getting the benefits.  It's all relative.

moral and legal are not the same thing at all.  it is never morally right to kill unless in defense of yourself IMO.  even some reasons that cause someone to be legally executed can be argued from a moral standpoint. and while an example like hitler, at face value, would seem to show what a great thing his early elimination could have brought to so many that were terrorized at his hand....but who is to say how the world would have ended up should that have happened.  there could've been someone even worse waiting to take his place.  snuffing out the "evil" isn't possible when evil is never ending.  and being over vigilant about doing so would only be a detriment to this world...after all at some point the ones determining who the evil are...could very well be the evil themselves.

To protect yourself or another human. I don't know how you could possibly know what is going on in a persons mind, and I don't think it would be ethical to takes someones life until they actually do harm, or are about to. (back to self defense). Evil must be by an action not a thought.

It is never morally right to kill someone and in most countries I doubt it is legally Ok to kill someone in general either...(death penalty exceptions). Those with the face of evil dont get into positions of power by showing themselves for who they are until they have used their charisma to ensure no one will question what they are doing when they are doing it.
Human nature is to look for leaders who appear to be able to resolve the major issues of unemployment, financial crisis, etc and sometimes society makes a mistake not because they are stupid but because they want to believe that help is available, that the leader cares and will do the right thing...unfortunately by the time they have reached that point in their leadership role they have also ensured their power to do as they like....people like this are insidiously clever and why we always need to be vigilent when voting in our leaders.

Your question mixes up two separate issues. A legal sanction to kill is a codified statute enacted as law which permits the taking of life(ie:the death penalty) A moral imperative to kill is an ethical judgement of an individual or group of individuals unsanctioned by law. You can, in retrospect, judge the removal of a particularly heinous individual like Hitler or Stalin early in their regimes would have saved countless lives and therefore would have been ethically and morally justified but if you were caught in the act in the early 20's you would have been regarded as a murderer, assasin and terrorist because neither Hitler nor Stalin were guilty of anything yet.

"Is it moral to kill someone when you have seen them carry out a crime that would influence so many people that their death would help prevent the deaths of hundreds of others?"

Does Yahoo Answers have a policy against rheotical questions?  You know, the ones people ask when they're not really interested in an answer?  Oh well - anyway, as ypu've learned by now, there is a difference between morality and the law.  Not that the law is immoral, but that you set your own morality and hope that the law supports it.  This question is also poorly phrased because it seems to suggest that the critical events are both past (you've seen them carry out the crime) and future (the witnessed crime would influence something in the future), and also blends certainty (the witnessed crime definitely happened) with the uncertain (would influence).  The question is also so factually vague that it presents no adequate basis for a response.  I'd liek to say that having witnessed the death of Mary Joe Koepechne (okay, so I just saw a documentary about it) I should kill some Kennedys - that would cause an effect damn possible to save a bunch of lives...maybe.

"Would it look good in the eyes of the press to snuff out the life of a really sick person if their death meant that so many thousands would live?"

Why does everybody constantly assume that there's one press?  Answer - questions of morality always lose their ambiguity when there's a chance that the media may actually be on your side.  In your case, the "New York Post" (depending on the "victim") might find this mercy-murder good-in-the-eyes, while the "New York Times" might not.

"Hitler for instance. His early death wouldve meant life for millions. yet would the press tolerate his death when he was a budding politician?"

Was Hitler ever a budding anything?  For one thing, you evince no understanding for the state of Germany during Hitler's early political years.  Nobody would have had a tear for anybdy.  Of course nobody would ahve felt the same not knowing of the future because....well, nobody knew of the future.  However, knowing the future leaves a rather unpalatable dillemma - sure, kill Hitler for stuff he doesn;t even know about; but that means that the killer himself would be subjecting himself to punishment for things he doesn't even know he will do.

Oh, as everybody knows, Hitler didn;t start WWII, he had plenty of help.  One man doesn;t alone start a war that kills millions.  Also, in the 60+ years since the end of the war, popular culture has seen tons of alternate-history fiction about the war alone; what if Hitler was a nice guy, what if he died before he was famous, what if they won the war, etc.  Remember, if you think that your killing f Hitler will change things you're taking responsibility for every change, for better or worse.  Doesn't sound so easy now does, it?

"Even weeks before hitler ordered the invasion of french germany the West was blind to him but many knew his dangers."

How can the West be blind, yet know his dangers?  Are you talking of wilfull blindness or just stupidity?  The West knew about Hitler's plans to conquer Eastern Europe and for the most part, they didn;t really care.  If anybody was surprised - it was Hitler:  Britain and France uniting against a fellow non-Bolshevik country to save...Poland.  Nobody much cared because in pre-war Europe, the real danger was not a fascist dictatorship which seemed generally adored by its own citizens, but a communist police state in perpetual state of Stalinist purge.  People weren't afraid of Nazis in pre-war Europe - most countries already were Nazi.

"why is mankind so stupid in the face of evil, snuff it out, kill it when you have the chance."

Isn;t this the part where the camera pans to Rod Serling, and we learn how the horrible, evil fate that the righteou skiller sought o proevent was actually caused by him?

When Hitler was just a politician, no-one knew what he would become. Are you suggesting we kill anyone with the slightest hint of becoming a killer? because most of them won't actually kill anyone.

It is morally alright to kill when the benefit of many people outweigh the disadvantage of having to kill someone.
Killing in war is alright, but only if you are fighting in defence - being the invading or attacking force is wrong, unless invading would save the lives of many of the people in that country that were otherwise in danger.

But of course when it is morrally legal to kill will depend on each individual.

You have to have parental permission if you are only sixteen before you can get married in the UK.  I very much doubt they would be able to over come the immigration laws.  Good luck to you all.

No, I don't think we should kill off religious and ethnic minorities, quite the contrary actually. But I do think, we don't need to waste money housing and feeding the common vagabond, when we can just kill 'em off, and scare the potential rogue away from crime.

Executing thieves and fraudsters is.... excessive to say the least. Here's why it doesn't work:

1. You run into enough instances of faulty convictions with the current set of capital crimes. If you throw every thief onto death-row, then the number is going to increase exponentially.

2. The expense of capital punishment comes largely from the appeals that ensue. We don't want to execute innocent people, so we cannot simply get rid of the appeals process.

3. Nothing says that the specter of punishment is enough to deter thieves. No one WANTS to go to jail, and so no one who commits crime is doing so with the idea that they're going to be caught. The idea of punishment as a deterrent is not one that has a demonstrable basis.



So, it's not cheaper, a lot of innocent people will die, and there's no basis for believing that it would be a deterrent.

The law used to be that you couldn't vote until the age of 21.  It was lowered because of the draft which is no longer in effect.  People realized the hypocrisy that an 18-20 year old could be drafted and sent into a war zone but was unable to cast a vote to determine the leadership of this country.  Was the draft was revoked, the age to vote stayed the same.

I don't think you've given a logical arguement for reducing the drinking age either...In fact you're using "argumentum ad populum" and "argumentum ad hominem" to boast a "non sequitur" claim that one's self determination is no more greater than one's right to drink when clearly self determination is more important.



Saying "The government deems me responsible enough to vote" means "Therefore I should be allowed to drink too" is simply "argumentum verbosium" offering no proof that a society would benefit better by having younger drinkers rather than younger voters.



The problem with "argumentum verbosium" is that anything is right so long as you say it is...

EXAMPLE "The government deems me responsible enough to join an armed service, therefore I should be allowed to start my own armed militia"

So anyone who runs their mouth is right.

Hopefully this shows you that "Logic" and "Politics" (Popular or Otherwise) do not always mix.

The legal drinking age,  voting or going into military service has nothing to do with each other.  Driking itself can be done in the privacy of your own home.  This is only a short phase you will go through in life before you stop drinking after you realize how useless it is to allow any substance to abuse you.  Why not get over it already and not drink at all. Think of all the brain cells that you will save by not drinking and how you will not end up like so many old people with dementia and alzheimers.

Death threats from landlord.?

Saying"your gonna die" "you all gonna pay" I called the police because well its after midnight so I was think someone broke in and stole records and is just calling people. So I called back and the same guy answered sounding all messed up saying Emergency after hours can I help you. I recognize the voice as the same man "MIKE" I have spoke with him before and I can hear the Secretary in the back round talking. Anyway I called the police and they acted like I was crazy I told them to check my cell records. What do I do?

<question>



Your views on abortion? ?



I am totally against terminating a pregnancy - in any circumstances. I know that it should be a woman's perogative whether or not she wishes to continue with a pregnancy...... but I just feel that terminations are simply a convenient way for the "mother" to get out of her responsibilities.



When my mum was pregnant with me, she was told that I had brain problems & would be severely disabled...... she was offered a termination & refused flat out ........... and guess what........turned out they were wrong! Maybe this is my reason for being so anti-abortion......

Your views if you would be so kind.



</question>



<additional details>



Obviously in the extremest of circumstances ie - rape in young girls. I can accept there choice. I am talking about when terminations are used as a form of contraception.

I dont think it right but it wouldnt be right to make someone who go brutally raped have the rapists baby and then go on to despise the baby every time she looked at it. Or would it be right to make the 11 year old give birth to her pedophile fathers child. I think in certain circumstance abortion should remain an alternative.

I used to be all for it until my mum told me the only reason I came to be born was that her doctor was a Catholic and told her that due to his beliefs he would not have any part in terminating me.

She didn't report him to the GMC or found 'the right Doctor' she just accepted it. When she told me this story (because I was getting a bit uncomfortably vociferous about how 'right' abortion is) she said what a load off her mind it was to be told she couldn't have an abortion

Kind of changed my way of thinking for ever that did.

I'm completely against it. That may have to do a lot with me being Catholic but even if I wasn't I would be pro-life until I die. I don't get it if someone murders a pregnant woman they get charged with double murder but a pregnant woman can have an abortion and people say its ok. This is a twisted world. And other people say "oh it's not alive until it's born" but yes it is no matter what. And I agree with you completely if two people think they're are responsible enough to do what they do to get pregnant. then they need to accept the responsibility to have the baby. Their are other options then abortion like adoption perhaps. There are plenty of couples out there that want to have children but are physically unable. And has anyone seen the movie juno? Its a perfect example of that. and people do say its her body, it's her baby, its her choice. but what its the baby's life don't you think it has a choice. and although it can't talk or communicate with anyone I don't think it would like to be murdered do you?

Pro choice. Even moreso in cases of rape or when it's still in the bundle of cells stage rather than the sentient being stage. In the very early stages it isn't too different from being on the pill which many would-be mothers do.



I do think that if someone is going to have sex but doesn't want a child from it, they should be careful and use contraception so it doesn't get to the point of needing an abortion unless it's one of the rare cases where the contraception fails.

A lot of people say to have it and give it to an orphanage, but that ignores how many unadopted children there already are which they'd be adding to.

Its a wrong and evil process. Did you know that babies get their own heartbeat and are "really alive" after as few as two days? Well its true. I am 100% catholic, and i think that even if a 13 year old was pregnant they should at least give birth, and then they gan give the child to an orphanage. I also think you should definetly definetly definetly not be getting pregnant until you are married, because having children is gods sift to married couples.  Its always, always, always wrong, and i am very proud of your mother for being pro-life. thank you, and always remain pro-life. Also, birth control can sometimes kill a child also, even if it doesnt tell you that.

Hi, I was the result of an illcit affair between my mother and a bus driver in 1946, her husband still being in the forces 'mopping up' after the war, I was never wanted and I found out at a later date that my mother tried everything to get rid of me, so if modern technology had been around then I would not have been here which, would have been a pity because I have really enjoyed my life and would not like to have been aborted, and don't forget, the young child is always the innocent party, so I've got a good reason to be ant-abortion, ironic, but I'm a bus driver too, I hope this has been a little help to you.

I think there are many reasons and circumstances that would lead to making an abortion necessary.  If a 12 year old girl is raped, is it fair to take her pain and humiliation that much further?  If a pregnant mother of 5 was told that she would die if she gave birth one more time, should she give birth and leave 6 orphans?  If a mother of 8 is pregnant with her 9th child and can't afford to feed one more mouth, should she bring number 9 in so that they can all suffer?



My grandfather and his sister were brought up in an orphanage because their father abandoned them and their mother.  There was no public assistance then, and most states are cutting way back.



I believe that we as a people should take better care of the people who are already on this planet instead of being driven to bring more in. 
Some people do use abortion as birth control, and I do not agree with that.  But I think it should be between a woman and her God and not legislated on.

Edit:  Well, Emmie, most anti-abortionists I have encountered only see it in black and white.  You obviously see the different shades of grey.

1) Abortion is NOT used as a form of contraception. That is one of the lies anti abortionists peddle.  If that was the case, they would be offered more openly than they are now.
2) I've seen distant female members of my family get pregnant in their teenage years and end up living on state handouts pushing prams, simply because they wouldn't terminate.  I was determined not to end up like that.
3) I've just heard from another Yahooer that the Aussies have extended their abortion time limit to 24 weeks - the same as us.
4) I don't impose my views on you, do I?  So why impose your views on me?

there could be a justification of entrapment, but given the circumstances, it may lead the way to prosecution for other offences discovered after the original "sting". Computer records may show you have groomed others and that would be admissible.

its slightly different from other entrapment scenarios, where the only offence they can charge you with is the one you were trapped by.

One can envisage the scenario you paint, but it is fraught with pitfalls. There are some important differences between a sting and entrapment and it would be difficult for an amateur to avoid crossing the line. Its is also unlikely that the police will make an arrest, let alone press charges, just on the basis of data provided by the public. They will want to carry out their own investigation and verify the info. By every little helps, as they say although I won't encourage people to start vigilante operations.

There would be a number of serious problems associated with what you suggest.Firstly there are the laws of entrapment to consider not to mention possible danger you could put yourself in.Secondly if you feel that someone could be the target of an online predator your first responsibility should be to report the details to the authorities.
The reason you should report this is simply because the authorities have the technology to correctly locate where the predator is located this technology is not available for ordinary people.
You mention an important word in your last paragraph "suspected" paedophile,well anybody could be classed as this for a number of reasons and would not be acceptable for a police investigation.
In short,the safest and legal way to deal with this and indeed,any form of crime would be to gather evidence safely if you can and pass it to the officials to do their jobs.This way any court action would be more positive,and not have the risk of crucial evidence being thrown out or not allowed.
There is not a law agency that will encourage you to do this because of the risks,also you need to be aware that not all paedophiles are dirty old men in some back street and,can be a well organised crime syndicate with some dangerous members.
Be safe.Be careful and get help.

If you can prove that the allegation was purely malicious and that there was no truth behind it, then sue the person who made the allegation.  You can't sue the investigating authorities, they are doing their job and are protected as such.

Does anyone know the guidelines and timescales for this?



I have been off work for 18 months on long term sick leave. I know its probably dependent on the company but I have heard that after a certain amount of time you can get paid off on medical grounds. I have been paid out on a company pension scheme that pays me part of my salary



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There are no statutory rules on this.  The answer will be contained in your contract and the terms and conditions governing long-term sickness.
Dependent on your age, you may be getting paid under a PHI scheme, not your pension. The t&c's of the scheme under which you are paid are contained in your contract.
If it looks like you'll not be retuning for some time, the PHI scheme operator (which is not your employer) may offer to buy you out with a lump sum.

But to reiterate: there is no law requiring them to do so.

When if at all is a criminal conviction spent?



9 years ago i was convicted of possession of a very smell amount of Ecstasy. I know this will be on record for life but somebody told me that after 10 years it's a spent conviction and for most jobs  you don't have to declare it.

Is this true that after a period of time I don't have to declare this on job applications?

Depends on the laws of your unknown country and/or State, and you didn't tell us where you are.

EDIT - Under the UK "Rehabilitation of Offenders Act", a conviction that results only in a fine is spent after five years from the date of conviction.

Even if an employer asks "Have you ever been convicted.....?" you can legally answer "no", and it is a violation of law for the employer to investigate spent convictions, or use them to make hiring decisions.

You don't have to tell everything.

That is personal to you.  A job application is not

a summary of your convictions.  The 2 are

separate issues.  Right some places ask for

a criminal check  Darn policies.....

Call up the records office and find out if it's a spent

conviction and get the info you want then you will know.

Courts do not destroy records.  However, many employers will ask only about recent history.  If someone asks if you have ever been convicted, the answer is yes and they can discover the truth.

In the UK a sentence of a fine is considered "spent" after 5 years.  Once a conviction is ‘spent’, the convicted person does not have to reveal it or admit its existence in most circumstances.  However, there are some exceptions relating to employment and these are listed in the Exceptions order to the Rehabilitiation of Offenders Act.  The two main exceptions relate to working with children or working with the elderly or sick people.  If a person wants to apply for a position that involves working with children or working with the elderly or sick people they are required to reveal all convictions, both spent and unspent.

Hope that helps.

I have no idea about percents, but usually if they have caught you, they call the police as soon as they have detained you and you are taken away and either reprimanded (if you are under 18) or charged and it could even get to court (if you are over 18).

Do you think that it is better to quit rather than get fired?



In a performance based position and facing a slowing sales economy, my quota on the job will most likelyy not be met. I could stay there two more months on a performance document and then get fired if numbers are not brought up. Do you think it is better to quit before getting the performance document with the possibility of being fired or to wait things out. This is amid a most recent check point of succeful for me with above average performance. I'd be throwing that history down the drain if I take the chance on getting fired. Should I just quit? I have no othe rjob and the mostpromising one has not started the hiring process yet. Mabe because of the econmy? 
Thanks in advance for your responses.

I found myself in that situation once and was glad that I quit.
It was rough at first I'll admit but just getting away from the pressure of knowing I'd be fired helped and then all that was on my work record was I left as an employee in good standing and that can only help when job hunting.
I hope you have good success!

Third party contract law case?



A had heard from B, his brother, that he had offered C $160,000 for the vase. He immediately went to C's home with $170,000 with the intention of buying the vase for himself. He gave the money to C's wife, who said to A that C was not at home but she would let him know that A had bought the vase. A took the vase away with him.
What case law supports that A is entitled to the vase? Does anyone know of a past law case that is similar to this situation?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Look for intentional interference with contracts or business relationships. There will be cases where B and C do not have a "contract" and those where B and C have a "business relationship" not amounting to contract but possibly giving them rights against meddlers.



However, this is done all the time. If I make an offer to buy your house for $160,000 and tell my brother before you accept, he can certainly make a higher offer and the seller can accept any higher offer until there is a contract acceptance, after which there would be damages for breach.

There is a phone number for the court clerk on the ticket (back, usually) and they will tell you.  It's hard for anyone outside of the Fresno court system to answer specifically because courts can vary so greatly.  In my jurisdiction it is about $150 fines, plus it's going to make your insurance go up, so you may want to consider a lawyer so you don't get any points on your license.

Call the court that issued it and ask them what you need to do to clear it, you will probably need to be booked into jail and then immediately released, and will have to pay bail until you can clear everything up.

This is the problem with racism, everyone has different opinions. Personally I wouldn't class this as a racist comment but it could be interpreted differently by different people.

Usually racist comments start with small insults  & remarks...and later escalate in a higher level...These two mates have be reprimanded...and learn  to be social polite..a Warning from Human resources will be very  appropriate...because  I have a feeling  a racist always be a racist... A record has to be start towards the present & future conduct...so when the time will come to be eliminated  will be no problem.

Its interesting to see how many academic establishments and companies have prayer rooms for Muslims, yet none have rooms for dedicated Christians to pray.
I don't believe the comments are racist, its much the same as saying "God will guide you if you need help" in any religion

Depends what you mean by RACIST. The remark ITSELF (whether the lady in question was in earshot or NOT) was obviously NOT racist--it was to do with RELIGION. BUT (IF it was in earshot) it was DRIVEN by racism, being an attempt to WOUND a FOREIGNER with a funny jibe. If it WASN'T in earshot, then the same applies but without the attempt to wound. Both cases in my view are driven by RESENTMENT (prejudice). I think you would be able to answer your own question IF you could guess whether the remark would have been made about a WHITE CONVERT to Islam. Do you think it would?
As is obvious, the BNP use religion as their axe against Asians (because they know "Religionism" is not recognised in Law), they know they can't be ARRESTED for it (yet). Are the BNP racist? If so, then so is your subject.

Abortion Question (for people who are against Roe vs Wade)?



Why do you think that the government should control a woman's uterus? I really want to understand, can you please explain it to me. 
The two reasons that I have thought of were:
1) God doesn't want it - In which case I will respond "The church and state are separated"
2) It's murder - In which case I would respond "Scientifically speaking, a fetus is not alive until 24 weeks, so it can't be killed"



</question>



<additional details>



Let me clarify - I want to know why the GOVERNMENT has the power to control uterus's. I, personally am pro-choice, but I don't think that I would have an abortion.
And no, at like 8 weeks, a fetus does NOT have a beating heart etc. (I don't when it develops those features, but it definitely doesn't before 8 weeks) It is just a mass of cells which have the potential to become life, sort of like a seed that is planted - if you don't give it water, it won't grow.

&gt; 2) It's murder - In which case I would respond "Scientifically speaking, a fetus is not alive until 24 weeks, so it can't be killed"

I am on your side, but this is a flawed argument.

the issue is not when the fetus is alive in a scientific sense, and anyway science offers no answers because the question diesn;t really make sense - life happens on a continuum and happens in various forms, ranging (for humans at least) from gametes, to fetuses, to those who have been born but not yet died, to those who have died while at any of the other stages.

the issue is solely a legal one - in our system of laws, which, as you noted, are to be strictly interpreted in a secular fashion, one does not achieve the standing of "personhood" until one is born alive. during the period after birth, and while still alive, you are a legal person, before that and after, "not so much" as the kids like to say :)

we can quibble about when someone dies in fuzzy cases, but the exception just proves the rule.

same for birth, you can quibble about when the precise moment birth occurs, and at a fine enough scale, these transitions happen on a continuum of their own, but they do happen. we are not really debating where the actual instant of birth is when determining personhood.

similarly for the definition for "alive".

if any of these are in dispute in a particular case, then courts are prepared to listen to the evidence and decide. That happens sometime, although more with death then birth.

Bottom line, if you have not been born alive yet, then you are a human being still at the fetus stage of your lifecycle, and have no legal standing under our system as a person.

there is no serious legal argument to be made that it should be otherwise. really, someone would suggest that a fetus, from the stage it is only 2 cells, has the same rights and responsibilities as a citizen? I don't think anyone is going to argue that.

The real issue is that people are not clear on what it means to keep their religious  beliefs, which they are entitled to hold,  out of a secular legal system that needs to treat others with different or no religious beliefs fairly and equally.

I am not sure if that is deliberate ignorance, or for some reason is hard to grasp among those brought up in certain religions, but either way, it seems to be the case. Sad really,

I don't know what 'science' you're referring to, but a 'fetus' as you call it is alive long before 24 weeks.  The baby has a beating heart, a brain, arms, legs, internal organs, fingers, fingerprints much earlier.  So, how can he or she not be alive?

2) It's murder - In which case I would respond "Scientifically speaking, a fetus is not alive until 24 weeks, so it can't be killed"

The 24 week argument is rather arbitrary. I could claim it is alive at conception, as many prominet biologists have



However, a better argument against the actual ruling is that it unconstitutionally gave the supreme court judicial powers and thus broke the seperation of powers. Not good as an ideological argument but if we are going to argue ideologically, im allowed to bring in God.

I really expect all the anti-choice to adopt a child and to financially take care during and after the pregnancy of any teen victim of rape. Until you commit fully to this in action and not only on sterile words and judgemental attitude, and prove it on the field, I do not think the pro-life people should have the right to play any role in such debates. 
I think a poor girl who is raped has already enough emotional problems and you should leave them dealing with their will to abort if the want. This is usually not the easy decision you may think.

I would also add that most of pro-life won't hesitate one second to send to the death row anybody suspected to be guilty of a crime, knowing that unfortunately some people can be wrongfully convicted. This is  pathetic

In catholic schools, why not.  In public schools I think that's actually extremely offensive.  There are many religions among students and I believe that they should all be treated and celebrated equally.  Also, it would make people who practice other religions feel unwanted in a place they should feel that they belong.

Yes, the Ten Commandments are a generally guide to be good to one and another. Teaches how to be civil. If you post them as is, and not displaying the title "Ten Commandments" and tweek the 'thou' wording a bit, you'd think you were looking at one of those cheesy public service announcements. No one would think these were 'words from God' unless you told them.

Depends.  If it's part of display about religion, I think it's okay.  Otherwise, I don't think public classrooms should be seen as showing favoritism to a particular religious belief.  It could make children of different faiths feel not as accepted and impair their willingness to learn.  A good teacher would not and should not undermine the educational process just to promote their own beliefs.

What is the policy for school resource officers using pepper spray on minors?



my son was involved in a small altercation between him and another student in the hall at school. the student and my son decided that the situation wasnt worth arguing over and they both walked away to class. the argument was not witnessed by any teachers but did draw a small crowd. the asst principle stopped my son and wanted to question him about the altercation but did not know at that time that he was directly involved in the argument. my son replied that everything was okay and continued to proceed to class. the officer who was with the principle told my son to stop and listen to the principle. my son then turned and siad again that everything was resolved and continued to walk to class. the officer then grabbed my son and wrestled him into a classroom where he proceeded to try to hit him with pepper spray but fortunatly missed and spayed his self. this was not witnessed by the asst principle because he siad he shut the classroom door behind him so it would not cause a scene. my son some how broke loose from the room and i was told by another principle that he ran to her office terrified. the officer did not deny trying to spray my son, in fact he sounded very confident in talking about in the meeting we had today. he also ammited that my son was not trying to defend his self in any way until the pepper spray came out and he ran. my son is only 15.  he has 2 criminal charges behind this and 2 days school suspension. the school principle says this out of the schools jurisdiction because it happened with an officer. is their anything  i can do???????

yes if he admitted that he was going to spray him before he started to defend himself... I think you should talk to a lawyer. The school sound like they are trying to wash their hand of the situation...if it happened on school property they are involved. talk to your son and make sure you get the whole truth from him first, because kids have a way of down-playing their part. Get a lawyer!

So, the officer admitted your son wasnt doing nothing when he tried to spray him, then they suspended him for it. this doesnt make any sense. It happened on the school property, I dont know, sounds like they are just going to try to sweep it under the rug. If you get a lawyer, I dont think much will happen with that. I am from Canada, my brother got his throat slashed and was almost killed, the cops charged him only to be let out the next day so he could go on with his normal life while my brother suffered. nothing is fair is this world sorry to say, and they wonder why ppl take matters into their own hands.

Is there anything unethical about?



Ethics, are these examples actually wrong for any reason? If so WHY?
An ethical question: What part of a child sneaking a cookie from the cookie jar is morally wrong? The sneaking is necessary because they know that their parents don't want them to eat it. But is is morally wrong? And if so why? If it's a two year old taking the cookie is this the same as a 12 year old taking it? I was thinking about this today, a child gets everything s/he has from their parents, in most countries it's a legal requirement to look after your child (although I'm aware that legality and morality are not always on the same page). In essence, what's yours is your child's as well. Originally I was trying to make a point with this but the more I thought about it the less sure I was. What is wrong about taking the cookie? If it's simply because your mom or dad told you not to I might ask then is it morally wrong for a well endowed daughter to wear a low cut top after being told no, or for a young man who gets his ear pierced when told not to? I don't see any ethical implications with any of these things. Just parents with power forcing their will on their children. Can someone who does explain to me why they do? The more detailed the better, thanks everyone!

I don't believe there isa question of an ethical issue until the child knows the difference between right and wrong.  Does a 2 year old really understand the difference between right and wrong?  Maybe not.  Does a 12 year old? Probably.  My question would be is it really an ethical issue when it concerns a child taking a cookie from their home cookie jar?

Are you saying that you think you should be able to do anything you want as long as you're sneaky enough not to get caught?  Sorry, but I can't agree.  That's the kind of rationalization criminals have always used to justify everything from robbery to murder.  We need laws and rules to maintain social order, and learning to obey them begins in the home in early childhood.  If a child wants a cookie and asks his parents for it, they'll probably give it to him.  If he takes it after being told he can't have it, it shows he can't be trusted and he should face the consequences.  It's not just about power; it's about knowing when not to cross the line between proper and improper behavior, or between honesty and dishonesty.

I am actually agreeing with you on this one.  Yes, parents need to assert their authority to let their kids know who is in charge.  In the cookie jar incident, the parents are "testing/trusting" the kid as to what the kid will do when they are not looking.  From this standpoint, the parents have every right to say, "no, you cannot have a cookie".  When or if the kid does steal the cookie and get away with it, that only implies that if you are sneaky enough, you can get whatever you want.  If you know much about life, then you would know that it is pretty easy to get caught up in a web of lies and fall face flat.  So, in conclusion to the cookie problem, no, it is not morally/ethically correct to steal the cookie.
In the case of the "well endowed daughter and the low cut top", she has the maturity to make that decision at a certain age.  Until then, the advice of her parents is all she has to go by, considering she has had little to no experience with flaunting her body.  There is a time when the daughter needs to draw the line, though, and take charge of her life.
Finally, in the case of the "young man who gets his ear pierced when told not to", there should be no argument there.  The young man has every right to get his ear pierced.  His decision would affect no one but himself, so if he decides to pierce his ear, then the parents should have no problem with it.  But as experience has taught, parents rarely act that way.  They try to live their lives through their kids because it's the only way they can be kids again.  Whether it's sports, academics, or restrictions, parents usually try to complete what they did not accomplish in their youth through their children.

I sincerely hope this has helped clear your head,
-Kyle

Is there a legal way of finding out whether someone has a criminal record?  Conviction was in 1970's in South?



My ex-partner has made false allegations against me, and used entrapment.  I have no criminal record, not even a parking violation. Her reason is greed, and to avoid paying a large sum of money she owes to me.  She alleges harassment, without violence. She is very convincing, and the authorities have chosen to believe her so far, although I believe their opinion will change when evidence they are not aware of becomes common knowledge. She alleged the same three years ago, about a neighbour, but this is inadmissable.  She is stringing it out (three cancellations already) to cause me anxiety.
My brief asked me if she has a criminal record.  It is possible she has, but I don't know how to find out. She told me she travelled on the train at weekends between Kingston, Surrey Hospital and Brighton I think, between 1968 and 1972 to see her boyfriend who lived on the south coast. She only bought a ticket to cover the last stop of the journey, but was caught by the Railway Police, and convicted of travelling for at least a year on the trains without paying.  She was fined and received a warning.  Also, she told me she gave evidence at Court 2 of the Old Bailey between 1977 and 1980, (she told me she had lied) in support of her new boyfriend, Frank.  Frank was convicted of drug dealing and sentenced to four years, but she maintained he was a recreational user who bought a little extra to supply to his friends. The Police raided his house, but after his arrest, and unbeknown to them, my ex-Partner told me she recovered the money from his drug sales from his house at his request, and kept it for him. 
She may still have kept her first partner's surname at that time, so I am beginning to accept that details of that trial may be impossible to find especially now she has reverted to her maiden name.  Is there anyone out there, (a criminal lawyer, a criminal records keeper, anyone who knows the system, and) who could help me find the impossible?  Thank you for reading this, and your help may save me.

I'm assuming that you are facing a criminal trial, and that this isn't about your civil action for debt against her.
A minor offence committed in the late 60s/early 70s will be spent for the purposes of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act which will make it much harder to find. That would also be inadmissible, prima facie, but together with the previous false accusations it might be used to establish a propensity to lie, which might make it admissible. 
Really, you should trust your lawyer on this. He is more likely to be able to judge admissibility, and find out about previous convictions, than you are, privately. You could give evidence that she lied in a criminal trial in the late 70s... but whether or not it would help (or be admissible as evidence of bad character) is, again dubious.



Good luck with it anyway.

In the Uk you would have to prove self-defence. You are only expected to use reasonable force. So if an expert decides that say the first three hits were enough to subdue the burgular but you continued after that you will be charged with mansalughter or even murder if it was done out of anger and revenge.

I beleive only reasonable force is a good thing. I'd hate some 15-16 year old kid die for the prize of a TV.

In what you have written, it is certainly not racist.

Some people might think it insensitive o unkind, but too many people cannot take a joke nowadays.

I have Christian beliefs and when I read the question had not immediately made any connection to Islam. I assumed a prayer room was for prayer. The comments were probably made as a bit of a joke as people make jokes about any situation these days. I would take no offence from the comments as they were not particularly humourous, but to a religious person would probably feel very true.

Life is built on realities and even when people are offensive, we should be learning to deal with it rather than trying to run to the law at the first opportunity.

Can money be transferred as deed of gift, not just property?



The mother-in-law wishes to ensure a "fair" will to three daughters. However due to personal reasons she would like to ensure two of them receive a greater amount preferably in cash during her lifetime. This would then reduce the chance of the will being contested later on.

Of course it can. she should speak to her solicitor about it or just pass it on before she dies, that way she can avoid any contest to the will.

Look into a "Living Trust" Will.
 Also have her add to the will if any Daughters dispute this Will, Than their share shall be distributed to the others and the person who disputes
the will will receive $1.00 as their share.  This is Legal to do !
This insures the Mother's Wishes.

I am not sure that you really need a solicitor for this. All your mil needs to do is to give the money to the two daughters with a covering letter outlining the amount of the gift, and keep copies with her will.

For starters, just tell the judge the truth: that you don't have insurance, because you simply can't afford to pay for it.  Judges are people too, and considering the cost of going through law school these days ...



But make it clear that you are not currently driving your car, it is inside you garage, locked up, and will not be driven by yourself or anyone else until you do have insurance.  The court will set a date for this to happen by, agree to it sincerely, and make sure you get the insurance before that date.  If you tell the truth, the court will generally be sympathetic the first time round, but if there's a second time, will generally give a very harsh judgment.



With some luck, you might even get off without the fine, or a delayed fine of sorts if you don't have insurance by the agreed date.

Wrongfully accused? how do i get out of jail?



YOUR GUNNA WANA READ THIS&gt; im speaking on behalf of my friends brother..cause hes a little incapacitated right now..hes in jail..state jail. your probably going to freak out when you read this right now and thats ok...because you should. This is a PRIME example of how the United States Court System is full on BULL.



a year ago my friends brother (lets call him Sean) was going out with a 16 year old. well her father is a prick and didn't really approve of them dating, only this wasnt known till after he turned 18. he was only 17 when they started dating mind you, ONE YEAR APART. Her parents took him out to dinner, laughed with him, hung out with him etc. I know Sean and his family and hes a legit human being. The second he turned 18 his dad turned into someone else for an unknown reason and forbid the relationship..18..and 17..mind you. and when i mean forbid i mean completley tried to cut them off. WEll..like any human being in love would do, they went behind his back and still saw each other. I mean if you were in love, wouldnt you do the same damn thing? I dont know about you, but not the president of the united stated himself would keep me away from someone i loved, RIGHT? thats the point of love, especially if its genuine and real. Anyways, her dad caught him in her room one day, and called the cops. HEs been in jail since. an 18 yr old has lost his life because of a psychotic Mormon father. hes now almost 20, and he was realeased on bail..WITH A ANKLE LOCATER, AND REGISTERD AS A HIGH RISK SEX OFFENDER FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE&gt; ...high risk sex offender, really? come on. anyways, before he got rearrested last week, he had stayed away from her, gone to church every sunday, hung out with his family, woke up at 6am every day and sat in one spot for 2 hours to charge his ankle braclet, and just tried to reestablishhimself in the community. well GUESS WHAT. HE was arrested for having the movie OLD SCHOOL, they did a raid on his house and they SAID OLD SCHOOL was too offensive for a sex offender to have. so hes now back in state prison, for having a Will Ferrell Movie.



now i want you to know these amazing facts......
-her dads buisness is LITERALLY across the street from the prosecuting  police department.
-her dad knows the important peopel in the town.
he went through 4 psychologits that deemed him a normal guy and not a sex offender before "THEY" finally found a 5th pyschologists that said he should remain in jail..which my guess was they paid him off or sean was just over it by that point and felt hopeless.
-its an inside job and something needs to be done!



this isnt just about SEAN....its about YOU. this is our country! lets take it back. how can we get innocent peopel out of jail? how can we get sean out of jail? how can we take back our justice system?



anyone know what i can do for him? please his families hurting...

"Internal Affairs+your state". Internal affairs is the police of the police. If that doesn't work, you should go to the state police, not the local police and tell them your problem. If that doesn't work, you need to get your friend a good lawyer, preferably a private one and not a state defender.

I've heard stories like this before. It's sad and I don't know what the answer is. The jail is just the start, I've talked to a guy in a similar situation, he dated a 16 year old when he was 18 or 19, and got himself on the sex offender's list. Ten years later, he can't live anywhere without constant harassment from the neighbors. They vandalize his home, and spray paint his car. No where on the sex offender web site does it say why the person is on there, everyone just makes the assumption the person is a child molester. I've heard of people making the list because they got caught urinating outside, how is urinating a sexual act? They need to have better judgment on who makes the list.

You need to find 2 lawyers.
1. A good criminal lawyer can go through they system, and based on harassment, abuse of power, mutual consent and other factors can either get the verdict overturned, or at least get a new trial.



2. At the same time, a good civil lawyer can file lawsuits against the father, the police department, the city, the state, etc.



When this is all over and the smoke clears, he will be a free and rich young man, with a clean record.



Oh, and P.S. If the problem is money, find lawyers who will take the case on a "contingency basis", in other words, they will get paid if and when he does.

Like it or not, if sean had a sexual relationship with a child, regardless of how much he loved her, then he committed the crime of Statutary Rape. He knew it was wrong to have a sexual relationship with this girl, but none the less he ran that gauntlet & will now have to pay the price for his crime.



Sean is now in an extremely sad situation, but he also went against the girl's fathers wishes, when he tried to spilt them up & the girl's father gave Sean the chance to walk away. He should have taken the girls father's wishes into account & waited until this girl was a little older, her father probably saw no other alternative to protect his daughter, other than report Sean to the authorities.
His family may well be hurting & so are you, but I don't really see how you can help your friend, other than just to stick by him, regardless of what happens.



Laws are there for a reason, if people flout them, for whatever purpose, then they will pay the price, as Sean is finding out.

Oh boy, did Wiz miss the point completely. I understand the situation your friend is in. The girls dad IS a prick.



However it sounds like the lawyer representing your friend needs to be released and your friend needs to look for good counsel. Where is Prick's daughter now? Why hasn't she come forward and redeemed your friend? She is the key in all this and she is just as responsible for the act as he was. If your friend is now 20 that makes her 19 and in most places, over 18 is considered an adult. If it was not rape all she has to do is request a private audience with a judge and her lawyer (Note I did not invite Prick and family into this private meeting) and explain the situation. If convincing enough, you might even get a reversal of the whole verdict opening up the way to sue Prickies ***, which would be considered rather tasteless but so is defamation of character, slander and a whole bunch of other words lawyers know.



Now, let me clarify, if your friend did rape the girl, he is getting what he deserves and hopefully will continue to get screwed just as he screwed. But if he didn't and it was consentual sex between two teenagers, though I do not promote underage sex, I can understand where hormones get enraged and get out of control and without proper supervision teens will be teens.



I hope your friend can resolve this soon.

If the laws of his state say that 18 is the age of consent for sex, and that sex with anyone under 18 is statutory rape, then sorry, he did violate the law, and technically, he is a sex offender.  Knowing how much her father disapproved, could he not have kept it in his pants a few more months until she turned 18?  And I'm sorry, I don't believe you that they put him back in prison just for possession of one Will Ferrell movie.  I would suspect they had reason to raid his house in the first place, and even if they didn't, I guarantee they found something more than that movie that he's just not telling you about. And BTW, a father doesn't have to be a "psychotic Mormon" not to want his 17-year-old daughter having sex and risking pregnancy or an STD.

This may not be what you are looking for, but...



What state do you live in?  The facts are simple.  If the girl was under the age of consent (in many states it is 18), and your friend was legally an adult, then he committed statutory rape.  It has nothing to do with her father being a prick or who he knows, as much as it sucks for your friend.  If this was the case, he was not wrongfully accused.



Anyone charged with a sex crime must register as a sex offender, it's the law.  And as far as the movie, he would know what would be a violation of his parole.  The police would not be doing a "raid" on his house without a warrant for a very good reason.



No offense, but either you don't have all the facts or this story is greatly exaggerated.  If he was in state prison he was convicted of a felony... which means he went through the court system at a federal level, not a city level/district court.  In other words, it's impossible that the girl's father had that amount of pull to get him "wrongly convicted."  The police do not do the prosecuting, so the dad's business being across from the police is irrelevant... even if he was dating the prosecutor, it wouldn't matter- the prosecutor's job is just that, to prosecute!  As far as the psychologists... seriously we are to believe that the word one one opposed to five kept him in jail?



I understand you want to help your friend, but there is no conspiracy of the justice system here, just a lot of BS.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Depending on how bad the crime is and if he/her has commited before.



Its a first offencive not really no.
If he has been arrested or on warnings before hes ogbviously a chav and deserves to be in jail.



Basically if its something quite petty like fraud,theft,fighting,GBH(to an extent) then no.



But if it was something like murder,rape,IBH and such things then possible. But i woudlnt really expect hed get life anyway, and even if he did he wouldnt go to the big boys prison where they get raped untill he was 18, Which would give him time to buff up in juvenile

Why would my ex be recording our conversations and trying to gather evidence for our upcoming custody case?



My Ex has gone nuts. He is a previous drugo, and i beleive he is on them now, he didnt care out his son when he was born and basically started to care a year after, he is emotionally abusive towards me, i have a protection order out against him and he has psychological problems, hes been in trouble with the law so much, hes damaged my property. At the moment i have full custody of our son and he see's him twice a week, i take care of him and take him to all his appointments and give him everything he needs. I Do everything a mother should do. I havent done anything wrong, and i havent done anything wrong to my ex who now has a fiance and thinks this is a bitter war. He use to tell me what a good mother i was. I dont understand. He is so cold to me when i drop him off and pick him up, we use to try and get along for our sons sake but he has turned into a monster. Why would he be trying to do this? Im so emotionally drained from him and his crap. Why do i have to put up with it, why should anyone?

I am not 100% sure, but I believe that depending on what state you live in he cannot record your conversations without your permission, if he does than it cannot be used against you. My ex wife has me in court for custody of my 2 children about every 6 months, I have always been able to maintain custody for over 7 years now, I have learned the best thing to do is have a lawyer and let them take care of everything, and give your ex the silent treatment the less he knows the better for you, therefore he has less to prepare with.

He is trying to build a case against you. By recording you, he is trying to gather evidence that your not a good mother. More than likely, he wants to prove you are an unfit mother, so he can have custody of your son. My suggestion, avoid as much contact as you can. You don't have to put up with his crap. Don't give him the satisfaction. Don't get upset or stressed out. That is what he is looking for and that will give him satisfaction. Try to find a relative that can take and pick up your son. If he calls, and is not regarding your son, let him know you are not interested, cut him off. Unfortunately, he will always be part of your life but you can make it to a minimal. Good luck.

No, but  nicotine SHOULD be.
I figured out a way to get rid of cigarettes:
Pass a law requiring nicotine content to be reduced by 10% per year for the next 10 years, then outlaw it completely.



With no nicotine, cigarettes would no longer be addictive and everyone would quit.



This would also give tobacco companies time to put their money in something else.

i don't think smoking cigarettes should be illegal. they do not kill brain cells- at least like drinking and doing other drugs.



if it's because "they are bad for you" then they should take candy bars off the shelves. they should take high fat meats off the shelves. they should take white bread off the shelves.



technically EVERYTHING is bad for you. making it all illegal won't keep people from doing it. it will just make more crime b/c people will still want to do it, and then just do it illegally.

Cigarettes should be legal as should a number of other things that are currently deemed illegal.  Using the excuse that "something" is harmful is extremely open-ended.  If you look at cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, automobiles, carnivals, skateboards.....they all kill people and could be considered hazardous to your health.  The idea is to live responsibly.  I choose not to smoke cigarettes, do drugs, and I have about 6 beers a year, but if someone wants to ruin their life for the aforementioned I say let them.  It makes life easier for those who want to live a full, productive, and wealthy life.

We are walking into very dangerous territory if we ban everything that is bad for us.



I do agree with countries where they have banned ALL forms of public smoking, including standing outside of buildings.  However, if people want to kill themselves, let them do it.  Japan have "smokers clubs" a superb idea, if you smoke, you can puff your eyeballs out without another person suffering for your habit, all of the staff must smoke and no non smoker is allowed in.  Good for them I say.
I like a drink, I love a pizza, I will cry if they ban either of these.
Plus, our government will never get rid of this canny revenue generating scheme.

I agree completely. Drugs are just as dangerous. Guns and knifes are too, so why are they still allowed? I think they should be illegal.

I'm not by any means asking for anyone to do me how work. Just saying out of 160 Questions, here are a few I don't understand & if you would like to help and know the Law great if not no need to be rude. This is not a test question. I would be in class timed, it is a disscussion questions I don't undrstand.



I don't think you are understanding, I do my homework, very hard I must say. I don't want to be a lawyer (LOL), it is a required class to take. I'm in my first year. I will pull an A on the exam, just want to know about these questions, (lol), why even respond to a question is it is going to be rude&gt;&gt;?? (thank you for the people that do read the whole article I wrote)..some people...lol.......too funny



it's not so much i don't understand them ma'am it's more that I want to get an A in this class, which I'm 110% about all the others. I will tell you what I think. my answers are as follows, just want to make sure they are correct, hopefully this will prove to some of the people out there i don know, and have studied hard. d,b,c,a,c,d,b,b,a,c,b,d,a,b,c,d,d,c,t,f,... ..running out of room to aswe



the first person that comm. on this said, "We're not here to do your homework; and if we were, odds are we would fail." I don't think so, or I wouldn't have asked you guys. There are very, very smart people out there.



wow, the last two from both of you were awesome!!! now it's oing to be hard to choose best 1 (LOL) that way very well put by both of you, and I guess I can now see how somw might think that I wish to cheat and just ask for the answers due to the long question. I'm very worried now though !! I have put 8-weeks, really in this dorm room bymyself, because the other guy "Evgeniy" , my roommate don't speak english very much and hangs out with his Russian friends. I have tried to meet people, and set up study groups w/ a few from class, and I was waiting in the lib. for over 2-hrs. for the 4 to show, and guess what..I felt like a complete idiot. No one came, after they promised they would be there. I asked why in a very nice way and all had excuses, or hungover. I have went to my instructor and he was like, "okay I have 60 + students, plus some type of online class, just take notes and read the chapters". Yah.. my money went towards that advise for a instructor. Start over 8-weeks down drain



Thank you writing in so details the both of you two.. just feel like that the other answers were totaly wrong that I posted, and worried other answers may be wrong for the exam. Nice to hear from two people whom seem to care. Thank you..mayby I can find some bleach to drink&gt;&gt;??Grrrrrrrr....

I'm a little confused. What don't you understand about these questions?  I have a degree in Criminal Justice and these are from a class I remember called elements of criminal law. If I can help, I will. They are very simple word and definition questions. I'm not trying to be rude, I just don't understand what you don't understand.



I'm still slightly confused because the first three answers you've listed are wrong.  Stare Decisis is about case precedence.  Question number 2 can go between A and C. It is in fact a part of the mens rea or the "guilty mind", but it also can be used as a defense. Most likely your teacher is looking for the what your books says and not a lawyer.  The second question would be A.  Question number 3, in OK the sufficient element sufficient to prove possession is mere possession.  Maybe you want to rethink your answers a little more?  Thank you for being so polite, by the way.



The guy under me is quite right. It would be best if you found a law forum. They are very easy to find. You can either google it, or use your school's website to find forums and blogs. Good luck.



lol Poor guy. I completely understand what you're going through. They will be worried when it comes exam time. I think you will be just fine. You're doing the work early which is very studious of you. You're such a sweet guy, I can tell lol.  It will get better. Freshmen year is always the year to adjust.  Maybe you should try going to these parties to meet people.  You could also make an appointment with your professor. That way, he will have to see you because it's an obligation to meet with students when they ask for allotted time.  My IM is the same as my name if you'd like to add me. If you need some help, suggestions, or just a little confidence booster, I can do that.  I've been through it all.  I wish you well.

Well Brad, it is obvious that you are new to yahoo answers, don't get me wrong "ANSWERS"  is a WONDERFUL forum to discuss current events, get some feed back on issues, learn about a wide array of (trivial) topics, and just have some fun in your spare time, BUT it seems like , well how do I say this, " YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BELUGA CAVIAR, IN A BAIT SHOP".  It will be a shot in the dark, if by chance you find, another law student, or attorney to help you. I am NOT saying you won't find ANYone on this site with enough intelligence to help you, I am just saying, the demographic you are reaching out to right now, reads your question (if they even get that far) and all they see is... Blah, Blah, Blah, they will lash out, by telling you, you need to do your own homework,  you will get more help, if you where to find a forum, of law students, or attorney's, with sites to answer your questions, and have true study group discussions It will be interesting to see how many responses you will receive, my guess would be not many.



I DO NOT mean any offense, to ANYONE, (and if I have offended ANYONE), I DO APOLOGIZE. I am aware that there are intelligent people on "answers" I just feel, Brad needs more...



GOOD LUCK to you in school, and your search for a study group.

I do agree with the other posters, but I am bored and you spent a great deal of time typing so I will answer.



1.  The process by which lower courts base their opinion on prior appellate decisions is Stare Decis (latin for "stand the decision")  The other answers are all procedural.  Habeas Corpus is post-conviction relief for people held improperly.  Nunc pro tunc allows lawyers to doctor the books, and back date stuff with the court's permission.  Corpus delicti is the total body of evidence of a crime.



2. Unconscious automatism is an affirmative defense.  It allows a defendant to be relieved of criminal responsibility for an action over which he/she literally had no control.



3.  Dominion and Control is the answer.  They are the legal elements of posession.  You will cover it when you take property.



4. Intent required, in addition to the act, is specific or general intent.  Specific intent correlates to either purposeful actions or knowledgeable actions under the Model Penal Code.  General intent covers recklessness and negligence.  The other answers are distractors, Transferred intent is a way, in limited circumstances, of establishing Mens Rea for a crime.  Strict liability is a small class of crimes for which no intent need be proven, only the action.



5.  The right to privacy is found in Mapp v. Ohio, where the Supreme first extended the exclusion doctrine under the 4th amendment to the states.  However, the answer you are looking for is Griswold v. Connecticut, since the court essentially erected a right to privacy from the 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14th amendments.



6. The crime drama with only women who speak to the boss through a microphone is Charlie's Angels.



7. Failure to protect is an omission crime which sets forth an affirmative duty to protect and punishes any failure.



8.  Probably Actual and Sole posession since the automobile is probably locked and no one else has access to it.  However, if he were at work, not in in close proximity it would be Contructive and Sole posession of it.



9.  The infamous equal protection clause is in the 14th amendment, right after the Due process clause.



10.  Crimes for which intent need not be proven are called strict liability crimes, or in older terms Absolute liability crimes.



11. A criminal statute not clear to a person of reasonable intellect is a violation of the Vagueness doctrine requiring that people be on notice of what conduct constitutes a crime.  Based on the fill in the blank spaces the actual term you want is the Due Process clause.  For more info look up procedural due process as opposed to substantive due process.



12. A law retroactively making conduct illegal is invalid under the ex post facto clause.  (Latin for "after the fact")



13. Conduct that is evil only because it is prohibited is Malum prohibitum (latin for evil because of prohibition).



14. Conduct that is evil by nature is Malum in se. (Latin for evil by its very existence.  A related latin phrase you will become familiar with is Per se.)



15. Stare Decis does NOT require that judges follow legislative history, only prior judicial decisions.



16.  Culpability IS based on blameworthyness.



17.  Trick question.  You must answer false.  All material elements must be proven BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT rather than mere probable cause or preponderance.



18.  False, the only thing which strict liability crimes do require is the actus reus.  What you don't need is mens rea.



19.  True, omission is the failure to act upon a legally imposed duty.



20.  Mere presence can never be a crime.  There is no action, just passive presence.  Moreover there is no mens rea, only apathy.



21.  D.  automtism is an affirmative defense which attacks the voluntariness of the actus reus.  It is NOT a level of culpabilty.  It essentially says "yes the action happened, yes my body did it, but it was unconsious and I didn't choose to do the act." Hence no voluntary bad act.  The other answers are levels of mens rea, or criminal intent under the Model Penal Code.



22.  A.  Powell v. Texas held the statute constitutional.



The other two answers are distractors, but B is the WRONG answer.  Squarely and on the merits opposed to the holding of both Powell v. Texas and Robinson v. California.  These cases are usually discussed to show the prohibition against criminalizing status.  In Powell the court held that unlike Robinson (whose sole crime was being addicted to drugs) the Texas statute punished the act of being in public (while drunk) rather than the status (of being drunk).



23.  State v. Loge was not covered in my law school classes.  I had to go look it up.  However, the answer is A.  The case discussed strict liability, and held that the crime in question was such a strict liability crime.



24.  I need more context for this question.



25.  This question got cut off.  Email me and I will be happy to help.

Translation plagiarism?



I don't actually plan to do this, but out of curiosity I ask: If I were to translate a text or parts of a text (essay, song lyrics, story, etc) from German to English, and use it in my own text, would it (by law) be considered plagiarism?



The thing is: When you translate something, you aren't really copying the original author's work, but paraphrasing it. Consider that it's nearly impossible to translate anything exactly word for word and slight alterations must be made. Therefore, the end translation is in my own words and thus my own work, is it not? What would be the difference if I read what they said and then rewrote it in my own words? (Which is essentially what translating is.) Perhaps I misunderstand something. Please correct me.



For the record, I realize that regardless of the law, copying another's work, without permission or due credit, for my benefit is ethically wrong, but, out of curiosity, this is a question of legality and not of ethics.

Plagiarism means you're misrepresenting earlier work as your own, and a written work contains more than mere words; there are ideas, structure, sequence, etc. The original structure, sequence, characters and such may also be copyrightable, thus a translation would be a derivative work and a copyright infringement in most countries in the world.



On the other hand, if you took a work of non-fiction and rephrased (selected) statements of fact (but not the creative structure or sequence), it would not be a copyright infringement (facts and ideas cannot be copyrighted), but would still be plagiarism if you tried to pass it off without giving credit to the original work.

That is true, but your parents have to emancipate you. This is a simple court procedure. If they don't really want you around either or agree that you should move out then it shouldn't be too hard.

You can "legally" move out at any age.  If you runaway and your parents don't go looking for you, it's not against the law.



However, you have to attend school until you're 16.



You're parents are your legal guardians until you're 18.



You can't sign any kind of contract (including renting an apartment) until you are 18.  Can't open a bank account, etc.



So it doesn't do you much good to move out until you're 18.

At the age of 16 you can move out with a parents permission, they are still incharge of you though. At the age of 18 you can legally live on your own and are incharge of yourself. Your parents can not legally kick you out before the age of 18 though, without finacially supporting you.

It can be 17 but you need to get a court order to do so. Usually if the judge sees that your parents are unfit to raise you or there are some other problems involved they will give you permision to be your own guardian.

If you think living with them is annoying try living with someone else or living alone and paying all your bills..know how to appreciate what your parents give u...then again don't stay there for ever but at least until you finish college and get a great paying job to where you could fully support yourself and your desires.

Until you turn 18, you would be considered a minor and would need parental consent.  You could however, petition the courts to emancipate you to an adult, which would supersede your parents rights of authority over you.

You have the right to get and keep a job that you're qualified for — with dignity and without discrimination. Federal, state and local fair employment laws say that no one can deny you a job or treat you differently on the job because of your race, color, age, gender, national origin, ancestry, marital status, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. These groups are called "protected bases."

Lawsuit question...help please!!?



I fell in a restaurant 2 months ago and hurt my knee pretty badly. I got a lawyer because the insurance company was being difficult to work with. We did the interview with the insurance, sent medical records, etc...



Today I got a call from my lawyer and he said the insurance company had denied the claim. He said the reason was because there wasn't enough witnesses. He told me that this is normal reaction of insurance companies and now we have to file suit.



I have a few questions, though. 1--Is it normal procedure for an insurance company to deny the first claim?



2--If I file suit, how long will the case take?



3--Will it go to court, or will it setlle out of court?



I have about $11,000 medical bills sitting out there that NEED to get paid...I would appreciate all advice!!

&gt;&gt;  1--Is it normal procedure for an insurance company to deny the first claim?  &lt;&lt;



Yes. Insurance companies make money by collecting premiums; not by paying claims.



&gt;&gt; 2--If I file suit, how long will the case take? &lt;&lt;



As long as necessary to settle or get to trial.  Depending on issues & jurisdiction it could take a couple of months or a couple of years.



&gt;&gt; 3--Will it go to court, or will it setlle out of court? &lt;&lt;



It will settle if you agree to accept what the Ins. company offers to settle it for.



Don't worry about the bills.  Medical providers will agree to accept a lien on the case proceeds for any sums unpaid by your insurance.

An insurance company is going to look after their interests, which does not include paying you.  They want to resolve it as cheaply as they can.  They may still settle, but only if the odds of them losing a court case compel them to do so.  The time it could take to settle a suit could take quite a while, maybe a year or more.  Interviews will need to be conducted with any witnesses, then you will have to go through a deposition, an informal hearing with the concerning attorneys, in which you will be questioned on the details of your accident.  They will follow this procedure for all witnesses as well, and then assess their position.  They may at that point decide to settle, or proceed to trial, depending on the strength of your case.



I would suggest that you contact the doctors office about your bills and let them know that your bill with them is headed for litigation, and that you will settle your bill with them promptly once your case is resolved.  Otherwise, they will refer the matter to collections, which can have an adverse effect on your credit rating.
Good Luck.

Muslims never move nation. They move to another country.. but they never move nation. And they are very honest about that. They told us who they were all along and we didn't want to listen.
I hope america wakes up before they end up like THE NETHERLANDS, BELGIUM, SWEDEN,THE U.K.,FRANCE, GERMANY, FINLAND.
Because muslims have ONE nation and they never lied about it. It's always the same. And that is ISLAM.
They (like many other religious people) put god ahead of state.. the difference is, SHARED VALUES.
I share the VALUES of most Christians.. even tho I am NOT a Christian. I share the values as most Jews, Buddhists, and I do not belong to their faiths either.
But I do not share many of the values of Islam in fact I oppose MANY  of their "values". That I shall not list here! LOL This clash of value culture WILL not just evaporate. Like the muslim effort to feed every child in the U.K. Halal meat at school. A cruel practice.. where the animals throat is cut without stunning, while people yell to Allah.. then while alive the animal is often hung by meathooks to make the meat as blood free as possible. The animal gasps for air while it's own blood pours over its face. And the next animal watches. I will never eat halal meat. NEVER.  I look at the Muslims in Europe and I think... They act like they booked a vacation in ICELAND, and they are now angry the climate isn't tropical.
Muslims never told us they wanted to integrate .. they want to integrate US!

we should throw Islam out of Britain. it will never be compatible with civilisation. it is not a religion. it is a hate fuelled vile oppressive cult. and the sooner the British people wake up to the danger it puts in to their children's future and ejects Islam from the country, the better.

Worse thing: He goes to prison.



What will happen is hard to say. There are many variables that I do not know. How old is he? How much did he have on him? What kind of narcotics was it? What are the laws in your area? Is the judge hard on these types of cases? And many other questions that you may or may not be able to answer.

This just happened in a school around where I live.  He wasn't arrested, he just had to pay a fine and attend rehab and whatnot.  He also had to show up at court, but nothing terrible happened.  He got a pretty decent suspension though.

He will either be put in a detention center or forced to go to a rehab.
Please father, don't fight for him, that would be 'enabling'. Forcing someone into a rehab or telling someone not to drink or do drugs, DOES NOT WORK. All drug addicts and drunks are liars and cons. Let him go to a rehab, if the Judge says to but don't expect him to change his ways because of it, after he gets out. If jail is the outcome, just let 'em go.

The burden of proof will be on you to prove it was both your faults. Get any police reports or other proofs. Expect to get charged with leaving the scene of an accident if the police weren't called. Driving without insurance is a crime and in some states your car can be taken permanently away. In Ohio anything used in the commission of a crime can be confiscated including people's homes. Talk to a cheap attorney about how to represent yourself. And quit driving without insurance.

How do you NOT have insurance? You do know it is ILLEGAL to drive with no insurance..that right there puts YOU immediately at fault, regardless of who "caused" the accident.



Should you settle? Do you have tens of thousand or even HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars just sitting around doing nothing? You were in the wrong for driving without insurance. You will likely be charged with operating a vehicle without insurance (YES-its a crime. You will get a fine, and possibly jail time to boot).



You need to talk to a lawyer ASAP.
You are in a lot of trouble, don't think you realize the mess you've gotten yourself into.

Definitely not lowered. I do lean toward the side to raise it, though. The big argument for me is that it provides the teens more time of supervised driving, that (hopefully) should make them more prepared when they are able to drive on their own.



Automobile accidents is the #1 killer of teens right now. Why? Partly because they "goof off" too much while driving, and partly because they are not very experienced.

In my state, you get a learners' permit at 16 and a provisional license at 17 (if you pass the test, of course).



My daughter, who is not quite 16, just wrote a speech on why she should be able to get a license at 16 instead of a permit and she had some valid reasons - such as she can work at 16, but I would have to drive her back and forth. This is time consuming for me, but you do what you have to do.



My older daughter used to argue that most kids her age were good drivers and that it was more the fault of older drivers who caused accidents. I almost got into an accident last night when someone was trying to make a left turn and didn't see me coming down the road. She said that ever since she started driving, she started to become more aware of those possible dangers and is able to anticipate what could happen.



Unfortunately, a friend of hers was in an accident two years ago and one of the passengers died. Once the dust settled and the newspapers stopped reporting on it, I found out that yes, the driver had too many people in the car (at 17 on a provisional license, you can only drive one unrelated passenger but that doesn't stop people) but that the passenger who died didn't buckle her seat belt and refused to even when the driver asked her to. She still would have been in the accident, but she might have survived.

Age has absolutely nothing to do with the capacity to drive.  Rather than focus on the age of a person, it would make more sense to gauge them on their knowledge of automobiles, their reaction times to immediate situations, and their capacity to make quick judgements.



The current process of handing a license to anyone who can answer a few simple questions and happens to be 16 or older is very flawed.

the age limit should be higher too many kids thinking that they control everything and no one else can get through to them. It should be raised to 18 even though most 18 year olds aren't that responsible either but at least they won't run the risk of an accident driving to highschool everyday. then again most kids aren't graduating high school till their 20's if at all.

Higher.



I have actually seen a letter written to our local paper that said our law limiting the allowable number of passengers in a car driven by a provisional-license driver (almost always a teen) is unfair, because it "forces" the new driver to make a choice between which of his friends can ride in the car and which can't. I thought it was a joke at first. BTW, this letter came from a PARENT!



A teen driver who is so immature that he cannot make that kind of decision should not allowed to drive at all. Driving is an adult activity.

Its a kind of peer rated review based on what other attorneys think of your skills as a lawyer.  AV is the highest rating and CV is the "lowest" (but its not a bad rating, its simply the lowest measure they use).  And there are plenty of attorneys who aren't rated at all - it can be a big popularity contest.

av bv and cv are rankings developed by Martindale-Hubbell, the publisher of a legal directory that lists most lawyers in the United States.  The ratings are developed based on comments received from other lawyers in confidential surveys.  Not all lawyers have a rating.  The fact that a lawyer is unrated does not necessarily mean there is anything wrong.  Some lawyers request that they not be rated.



av is the highest, bv is in the middle, and cv is the lowest rating.



You should go with a lawyer who is av rated.  bv is okay.  I would stay away from the cv rated lawyer, however, because that indicates that other lawyers have questions about his or her legal ability.

Isn't it so sad about the 8 yr, old little boy who shot himself?



I live in Mass and I had no idea they have a law that says it's legal for an 8 yr old to shoot and automatic weapon as long as he is under supervision.  He was with his dad, who is an ER doctor and an instructor.  The weapon somehow kicked back, shooting a round in the child's head.  He died.  This is terrible.  Where are the minds of these parents.  I don't care how much supervision there is, NO child should be allowed to shoot any weapon.  This law has to be changed.  Do you agree?  It really makes me sick.  An innocent life taken because of the stupidity of an adult.

I live in Mass too, and I'm a shooter.  I do agree, that this child was too young to be given an automatic weapon.  Although the laws were followed completely by all present, there should have been some common sense used.  The child had never been taught to shoot a firearm, therefor had no idea of what would happen.

My attorney advised me to call the police and report my ex husband's terroristic threat.?



I called the police and they took my name and number and said a detective would call me in 1 to 3 days.  ? (is that normal?)  My ex put on his myspace page, "Do I not f**king pay enough, guess I'll have to call a guy that knows a guy that knows a guy"...and his wife has that she is going to kick my (fat) ***.  (this all started because of a letter from my atty. to his that he was in contempt of court for many things, my ex believes he is above the law and does not have to follow the decree of divorce) Anyway, gave copies to my atty. who is sending a letter to my ex's atty. and also advised me to file a complaint with the police department.  When I called the police she said they could have an officer come now or call me...I felt bad as my situation is not dire and I said they could call me.  ?  They asked if I thought he would do it...and the truth is, I don't know...he is off his rocker and you just never know what he's up to.  He did try to kill himself as a "punishment" to me for leaving him a few years ago...I have no idea what he would actually do.  We have 2 children together, so we have to communicate...but, I am so tired of all the drama.  Please no speeches about the kids, etc...I have tried everything to make it work with him and his new wife ....I keep our children in counseling and have for the past year at my own expense.

<additional details>



I guess I'm asking...is that typical for the police to wait 1 to 3 days to file a report about something like this?

When you are drunk is a made contract still valid?



Cliff Hanger was in a bar having drinks with some friends.  Later in the evening, X. Marx DeSpott joined the group and began talking to Cliff.  During their conversation, DeSpott offered to buy Cliff’s motorcycle and Cliff accepted the offer.  The group continued drinking, and by the end of the evening, several friends took Cliff’s car keys away from him and gave him a ride home.  The next day, DeSpott came to Cliff’s house with the agreed upon price and asked for the motorcycle.  Cliff claimed that he never intended to sell the cycle and refused to deliver it or to accept the money.  DeSpott sued Cliff for breach of contract.  Cliff defended by claiming that he lacked contractual capacity.
What does Cliff have to prove to be able to avoid his obligations under this contract?  Explain fully.

Can you make a contract with a minor? who will win?



Lilac A. Rugg, an adult, entered into a contract to sell an automobile for $4,750.00 to Hope Ferterbest, a minor.  Delivery was set for the next day.  Rugg learned that Hope was a minor before she came to pick up the car.  When Hope arrived, Lilac refused to accept the money and refused to deliver the car saying that she did not want to deal with a minor.  Hope sued to enforce the contract.
Will Hope win?  Why or why not?

Lilac will win.  A minor is not permitted under law to contract in their own name. If Lilac would accept payment and deliver the automobile, Hope could some time later ask for her money back because it was not a valid contract of sale.  Yes, the courts would force Lilac to give the money back.



A contract for necessities of life (e.g., food) would be enforceable.

Personal Injury Claim - Please, Can Anyone Help Or Advise Me.?



Five years ago, my husband was out in the company vehicle when he was hit from behind by another driver.  He suffered a broken back and ended up having his lower spine fused and has been on pain meds ever since.  He got compensation in the area of $90k.  However, 2 years ago, another driver hit him again from behind, and ever since, my husband has been in agony.  His surgeon claims that the second accident, "Might have aggrivated the injury a little", and the driver's insurance company have made an offer of just $15k...  which drops down to $4k after lawyer fees, etc.



We just feel as though we've been kicked in the teeth.. the second accident caused my husband to start having erectile dysfunction problems (he had no problems prior to the second accident) and our lawyer has suggested we take the claim to trial.



What I want to know is... what are our chances of getting a significantly larger offer than $15k, and would my testimony about the sexual dysfunction make any difference?



What if we lose at trial... would we still get the $15k regardless?
How can my husband prove that the problems started BECAUSE of the second accident... and how can the courts prove differently?



Please, only serious answers guys, as this is a really sensitive issue right now.

Geez some of you guys are harsh and dont really understand the situation as I explained.

When my boyfriends current lease runs out we fully intend on having him added to my lease. Wouldnt you think that since he has proof of his own residence they couldnt evict me because they assume he lives here?

wow, the land lord must not like you guys because theres no such thing as visitors once a week or what ever. The land lord can NOT evict you with out any evidence that you have people living there, you can fight that by taking it to their superior or court. Now, keep in mind that you cant run a business from your place but visitin with out staying the night is ok. Dont forget what your contract says and I'm pretty sure it didnt said a time limit for visitors

The short answer: pack and move



Now, a little more detail.
If you are month to month, the landlord can give you 30 days notice to vacate. This is not technically an eviction, this is simply the end of the business relationship as allowed by the contract and/or state law. The landlord does not need a reason to do this.



If you are still on a fixed period lease and it has not expired, then he would need to get a court ordered eviction. At the hearing you can present evidence that you are in compliance with the lease and he will present evidence that you are not.



Many leases limit the amount of time you can have guests that are not on the lease stay in the apartment. You can be evicted for violation of that as well.



If you are on a fixed period lease, you can assume that even if you stop the eviction your landlord will not allow you to remain after the lease expires and switched to month to month.



There seems to be some underlying sentiment that landlords want to "screw" with people. Simply not the case. They want the rent paid and no damage done to the units. Empty apartments are lost income. Getting new tenants is expensive. They would rather keep a good tenant for many years than to look for a new one every 6 months.

Seriously I've lived at the 2 highest rated complexes in a major city and they both had a habit of trying to accuse me if things like "breaking their a/c system".  And that's from a guy with a full time job, a near-perfect credit rating, and no late payments whatsoever.



You can probably fight them legally.  But, by the time you get a verdict, even if you win, the legal costs will most likely near bankrupt you.  Probably not worth the effort...



If you need a quick place to move, stay at a by-the-week motel and put the rest of your goods in storage while you search for property to own.
----------------------



Once you've found a good (usually $45000-$60000 in a safe suburban area)  condo, get together $10000 or so and make a 30% down payment on it (simple fixed-rate mortgage, avoid dicey adjustable and balloon mortgages at all costs).



Your monthly payment + association fee for a one-bedroom should be $600 or less...and, since you own it, you can have, for example, a boyfriend staying there and not have to worry about any "double occupancy charges" BS.



Best luck...

have you talked to your landlord about this? that would be a good start, if not then ultimately you'll have to move and pay court costs. but you may win in court too but depending on the terms of the lease you may still get evicted on some detail you were unaware of.

You could probably fight it, but it may cost you more than moving.



Have you discussed it with your landlord rationally?



Good luck.  Those types of issues ALWAYS suck.



And when I see situations like this, I recommend Pre-paid Legal services.  Find a rep in your area.  You would be able to call for free legal advice, and the monthly costs are not expensive. (and no I do not sell it...I am merely a client)

Can anyone please help with this question about Business Law?



QUESTION:  Josh and Brett enter a contract in which Brett agrees to write a how-to guide for Josh’s publishing company for $500. Brett gets into the project, and calls Josh to tell him that the project is entirely too much work for $500, and that he won’t be performing his obligations under the contract. Josh decides to wait to see if Brett will change his mind. Brett does change his mind before the time his performance is required, and calls Josh to tell him he’ll be meeting his contractual obligations. Josh tells Brett to forget it; he won’t pay him the $500. The most likely result will be that



ANSWER CHOICES:



A. Brett may successfully sue Josh for breach of contract if Josh fails to pay him after Brett performs his obligations because Brett retracted his repudiation.



B. Brett will lose if he sues Josh for breach of contract because Brett repudiated the contract.



C. Josh may successfully sue Brett for anticipatory repudiation, even though he waited to allow Josh the opportunity to perform his obligations.

B.  Brett intended to repudiate, and communicated this fact to Josh.  At this point, Josh is under no obligation to act immediately, and can sue for breach.  Although having waited, a new contract needs to be entered into.  Brett's later change of mind constitutes a new offer, but without Josh's agreement at that point of time, there can be no contract.  As such Brett will lose if he tries to sue.

<answer>



(B). Once the contract was clearly repudiated, the contract was over, Josh had the right to contract another writer to perform all of Brett's tasks, and it would be unfair for Brett to expect to be paid after Josh had no further expectation that the work would be performed by Brett, even if no alternative writer had been paid. Answer (C) would not be true unless Josh changed his position (spent the money somewhere else) after Brett repudiated, thus causing damages.



However, Brett and Josh could certainly form a NEW agreement, or simply ratify and re-institute the old one by mutual assent, thus giving each the benefit of the original bargain.

When determining Ohio Child Support:?



In a case of shared custody 50/50, when determining support, do they only look at your current salary or is it an average of a certain time period that they consider.



for example, on parent is making 65k, and takes a paycut to 50k to screw the other parent, is the prior salary taken into consideration?

The court can make the determination that a person is voluntarily underemployed and then use "earnings potential" rather than actual earnings to calculate support. See the full guidelines below.

With 50/50 custody there normally isn't any child support awarded.



Are you kidding me someone actually took at 15K pay CUT to screw the other parent? Does this actually work? I mean relatively speaking child support is based on percentages and it don't matter what you make you pay XYZ% of your salary.



Or I guess this could also be someone who is bitter and like to talk trash about "being screwed" by her ex. Get a grip and get a job and support yourself and your child.

How does Fair Trade Act work? I got cheated by NRMA. PLEASE HELPP?



Hi, i bought a policy by NRMA when my car broke down. I talked to them on phone and told me that if i pay $100, then i would get my car towed away PLUS i will get free membership. So, i was stunned and excited by this offer and i accepted it. I paid for it. Few days later, i called NRMA and they told me that to get membership it costs $450 and the other day they charged me $100 just to get my car towed away!!
They lied to me. If i knew that i wouldn't get membership, i wouldn't have accepted the offer.
And now, i ask for a refund because the person from NRMA who misleaded me (Steven), they say no. i said i will take them to court.
i have a tight budget right now and desperately need money. And on top of this, NRMA ripped me off!!
so, does this situation cover in the fair trading act? Please help meee.
Thank you very much

I agree, if they put him in there in the first place, it is because he stole ALOT, like hundreds of dollars worth of stuff. If he stole a shirt and a lighter or something, they would have just called you to pick him up and give you a court date.  Leave him in there to learn his lesson. They won't keep him long.

This is tough. You can pay the bond and get him out now, or wait until his bail hearing and see if the judge will release him to your custody without bond. This depends A LOT on his prior record. If this is his first offense, chances are pretty good that the judge will just release him.

Do not bond him out no matter what you do.  Do not do it.  You will set him up for a life of crime.  At the very least, leave him in 3 days.  Then if you don't have the bond money, you have to raise it or go find a bondsman and work something out.  Tell him you will bond him out if he will make you an agreement right now that he will do whatever it takes to turn his life around now and that you will help him to find counseling and what resources he needs.

if you got that money take him out of the jail because the jail will put a bad side on him because of the people inside that jail they will treat him really bad just let your son stay in jail for a week then take him out in 1 week he should learned a very good lesson to stop stealing and when you toke him out start gobbing at him shout at him all the time because if you don't he will say oh my mum didn't mind i will do this again latter...

You will have to bond him out. Maybe you have a family member who can help with the expense if that is an issue. You will get the money back when he shows up for court. If your son has a good attitude and shows that he's sorry for his actions, the judge will most likely be lenient. Be careful, really stress to your son how important it is that he doesn't get in this sort of trouble again. Once the courts get involved in your child's life, it can be a living hell.

Tell him your only going to bail him out if he works off the money and if he comes home and is grounded for a month. Make sure he agrees and sticks to it. Then you have to go to the jail and pay them $750.00. You son should not be handing out with 14 year olds in the first place.

You don't get him out.  You do what my parents did to me and leave him in there.  They won't hold him in there forever and you know this.  But that time that he does sit in there, he will realize more and more what brought him to this place and it will hopefully depress him and make him realize he doesn't want to go back.



Then after he's out, you pay his court fees (I'm sure he doesn't work if he's stealing) so it does get paid.  Then you take him to and from a job where he will pay you back EVERY CENT.  You also have to forbid his contact with ANY of his current friends.  No phone, no cell phone, no tv in his room, the works.  If he's going to steal, and you don't give him a reason to want to "get his life back" he will continue stealing.



I'd also talk to him about WHY he did it.  NOT right after he gets out of jail because he's going to be sad, and angry etc.  A lot of emotions come with jail, and at that age it's really hard, trust me.  But some people have a "rush" from stealing and it's an addiction like gambling or drugs, so if you can find out if this is something that he's dealing with this, he can get the proper help to possibly keep him straight.

I'd leave him there for about 24 hours to wake him up and then I'd go bail him out on the condition that he would work off the cost of his bail around the house. I'm talking no friends, no freetime, serious hard labor around the house until it was paid off. His rate of working it off would be like $1.00 an hour until every cent was paid back. Ideas: make him clean the gutters. Make him scrape and paint a fence, your window trim anything that needs painted around the house.  Make him rake leaves/shovel snow, chop wood, etc... depending on the things you need this time of year around your home that are just labor intensive jobs.  When he got done with that I'd teach him how to clean vents, vaccuum and do things INSIDE the house as well- there won't be any loafing on his butt in front of the television or with any music etc...  while he's inside.  You can serve him his meals three times a day and allow him a bed and bathroom.



I'd let him know if he ever pulled a stunt like that again and ended up arrested for it that you're not bailing him out twice and that he had better straighten his act up.  If he can't agree to your terms and do so then leave him there. It will be a good wake up call for him that he can't do those kinds of things.

It depends on what the circumstances are. If he was caught stealing a car or something, or if it was shoplifting. Also was there any breaking in involved? While each is serious, there is some variance there.



If you have the money and feel that it is best, by all means post it. I would try everything possible to make sure he learns from this and does not do it again. If kids do things and get off without any consequence now, it could lead to more serious trouble later. With him being 17, you are right on the cusp of not having the ability to directly influence his actions in the future.

Is it legal for a city police officer to tell me I cannot have a truck parked in my driveway?



I have a 1999 Dodge pickup that is not registered yet and needs some body work.  The city police stopped by and told me I could not have it in the city limits since it wasn't registered.  They even went as far as to come up into my driveway and place a tag on the truck.
We do not have homeowner's asociation, just city ordinances.  When the cop first came over, I asked to see the ordinance guiding this, and he said I'd have to go to city hall.
My question is, can a city law be made to cover what you can have in your driveway?

It could depend on the zoning ordinances in your city.  Most cities don't like to have derelict vehicles parked anywhere in sight.  Yours probably isn't in that category, but the police won't really know that.



Your best bet would be to either keep the vehicle out of sight--as you are doing now--or get it registered.



Many cities have ordinances prohiting parking recreational vehicles in driveways.  This is probably a bit more common than most people think.  Also, they may object to commercial vehicles--such as driver-owned big rigs--being parked in neighborhoods.



If it were me I'd go take a look at that city ordinance.

Duh that wouldnt happen. The clinic would question the girl ALONE and get her to confess to them that the man is not her father. You are making up something that would never happen.



First of all let me educate you, a 12 YEAR OLD IS NOT A TEENAGER duh! TEEN means your age number ends in teen! You arent a teen until you are THIRTEEN! Like 13!



So anyone 13-19 could have an abortion and not have to tell their parents which is a good thing. Many scare kids will not tell anyone and then deliver at school and dump their baby in a trash can. But if they can secretly have an abortion then it may prevent problems later. And some kids parents are strict and will disown or beat a pregnant daugther.

Teen abortion without parental notification.
I strongly disagree with this concept.



A teenager isn't old enough to enter into a legal contract so how would they be able to read and understand the forms and sign them?  A hospital can barely treat a teenager for an illness without parental consent so how could she choose to go through an abortion?



And I haven't even begun to write about how she may not be mature enough to make the decision---or taking the feelings of the father in consideration.



No, no, no, no.  I can't support anyone who would even consider this.

I am being charged with theft by shoplifting in Georgia, what will likely happen to me? What should I plead?



I was talking to a friend of mine and told her that I was going to a certain store. She told me that she knows a a young man who works there and can get me a 40% discount off of regular price items and that I'd just have to give him something like 20 or 30 dollars depending on what I buy. Each week the store offers half off different sections of the store. So if I saw something that wasn't half off she said he can give me his discount.



I thought it was a good idea since I was going to spend about 250.00. Well when I got to the store he knew who I was cos she had sent him a pic of us through her phone. When I arrived at the register he rung all of my things, there was a lady standing beside him at the register (another employee) which I thought was ok since he was giving me a discount. I gave him my debit card because the machine was at the other side of his register. He told me that my purchase was half of what I'd expected to pay without his discount. When he gave me the receipt to sign it said 8.00 and I was thinking it would be around 160-175 with his discount. I was scared, people were behind me in line and I didn't want to ask him anything. So I left and called my friend. She says that he must have put the wrong amount mistakenly and not to worry about it. Five months later I was visited by a detective that showed me a tape of me shopping and leaving the store. They said that I am apart of a shoplifting ring. My friends sister and grandmother was also visited. I didnt know this was going on. They took out a warrant for my arrest because they say that I didn't cooperate. I didn't tell them what happend, I just stated that I dont know the guy, which was the truth.



Now I have to go to court. What is going to happen to me? I am 29 and I've never been in any trouble. My husband recently was laid off and and I am a realtor. I can't afford a lawyer right now due to market situations. I told my husband what happend at the store when I got home and he told me just not to go to his register again if I shopped there again. I have kids and I dont want to go to jail or have a criminal record.



When I received a copy of the warrant it said that I allowed me to undering my own merchandise, I've never worked in any retail store. The warrant is wrong but I still turned myself in. The guy had underung over 10 people in two days!! I honestly didn't have a clue.



They stated that I am being charge with a 700.00 felony which is not true, I had my calculator while shopping and I was prepared to pay the full price incase he couldn't give me a discount which was well under 300.00.



Please advice, thanks.

If he didnt report it you can always report it to your insurance co and they will go after the driver that was at fault. Usually insurance company will want a police report.

Yes, I believe it is against the law. It should be reported and not just for insurance purposes. Some people don't tell the insurance company because of excess, but if it cost you a lot to get your car fixed then i would do something about it. I'm sure you have enough evidence, if the insurance company isn't listening. Write to there head office and if that fails get a lawyers advice, i'm sure you will win with enough solid evidence which i believe a photo is.

It's not a criminal matter, I'm afraid, and the police won't be involved. In the end, someone's going to have to take this character to court, either your insurers or yourself.  What are they doing about it?

Maybe i missed something but, a police report should of been generated at the time of the incident, unless you didnt have police at the scene. If there was no police at the scene and you just traded insurance cards and names then your pretty screwed.



If there is a police report from the time of the accident (if police where there , there should be one) then submit the claim to your insurance along with the police report and they will take it from there by contacting his insurance company and forwarding the police report.



Now you said it was your own fault. then isnt it a good thing he hasnt reported it? your insurance rates wont climb, and the cost of the repairs (unless the car is undrivable) is probably less then the over all increase in insurance.



Keep those pictures though, incase you decide to do nothing and he decides to do noting until a day before he can longer file ( 5 years i think but not sure) this way he cant add more damage in by saying it was caused in the accident.



good luck.

Unfortunately its too late to report it to the police as it has to be reported in six months.  your insurer should have obtained witness details, and as long as he/she is independent you can use it in court.  Your insurer still can report it to the third party insurer who then has three months to investigate the claim, at the end they have to either admit liability or give their reasons for disputing.  Third party insurers can admit liability on a without prejudice basis, meaning they will deal with the claim and pay you out but not officially admit liability.  Go back to you insurer and demand they make a third party first report, and report it themselves.  The insurer is fobbing you off.
The statute of limitations for making a non injury claim is 6 years, and 3 for injury.

Although I don't believe this is possible, I think that you should ask a legal aid lawyer about it.  You might become a test case.  The laws of most states do need to be changed, but I don't see this happening in the near future.

They probably consider you under-employed.  That means you could be working and making money but you are choosing not to.  Take their advice and get a second job until you find a better one.  In a nutshell, the answer is no, you cannot reduce your child support.

Mother insists that her ex get doctors note before allowing visitation with son...??  Read on for details...?



My brother has court-ordered rights to see his son every wednesday night for 2 hours and every other weekend.  He is supposed to see him this weekend, from tonight (Halloween night) to Sunday.  This past Wednesday my brother was sick and went to the doctor during the day and was prescribed antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection.  He had our mother, the 3rd party contact, call his ex and let her know that he was sick and although he wanted to see their son, he was giving her the option of not bringing him over so as to not risk getting him sick before Halloween came.  Now, just to clarify, she is a horrible, mean girl who does everything in her power to hurt him and make his life miserable.  She lies in court, sends people to his house to threaten him and then denies it in court, etc..  So anyway, instead of being appreciative, she got all mean of course and said, "Fine, if he doesn't want to see his son, that's fine!"  So yesterday, she calls my mom and says that she contacted her pediatrician and that the pediatrician recommended she not take their son to my brothers so he doesn't get sick and cause his asthma to act up.  (Although, he lives with her and 5 other people in her house, and never gets to leave the house when any of them are sick, hmmm), so she is refusing to bring him over unless my brother gets a doctors note.  My brother refuses to get the note and I don't blame him.  He's on his 3rd day of antibiotics, is feeling better, is definitely no longer contagious, as anyone who has any common sense would know, and I'm sure she does too, but she's just trying to give him a hard time.



Now I, personally, believe that this is complete bull and that she cannot do this.  It is illegal, and as per the court order, my brother should be able to call the police when she doesn't show up, and she should have legal action taken against her for being noncompliant.  (especially since she has been noncompliant in past, dropping off late, picking up early, and having multiple people with her at the time of transfer, when it's only ordered to be one 3rd party person and she is not to be present)



Anyway, I really have no idea about legal stuff.  Thankfully, I haven't had any personal experience with this sorta thing, but for my brother's sake, I wonder if anyone has a firm grasp one the legalities of these situations and can maybe help us.  Can she legally claim that she has a right to keep him away?  What can we do to ensure proper legal action is taken against her?



I am sick of her always doing what she wants and walking away from it.  She keeps taking my brother to court (she literally makes up a situation and then she and her friend and mother get up on the stand and lie about it to get my brother in trouble for things he's never done) just to try to hurt him and exert control over the situation, and the she puts on this crybaby act and the judges give her pretty much whatever she wants.  What can we do to bring justice to this liar?

Furthermore, they gave me cheque which is less than what they owe me. If I cashed it, will that construe acceptance of the terms?

I am afraid with all that hatred the cop will go after one of my kids. Can I sue for harassment, libel? anything? I dont want money just to be left alone.



I guess they think making us look bad makes their child look better.

Hey there, first and foremost has these allegations had a direct influence on your job, your child's environment, school, etc?  If it has had  some sort of influence you can absolutely take legal action.



Secondly, allegations like these need to have evidentiary support to make them valid in any court of law.  This would be a civil matter of good old fashioned feuding neighbors and I actually went through something like this when I was a teenager, and believe me it was no fun.



Has this person put these allegations in writing?  Does this family live close to you?



Have you tried resolving this on your own?



One ace that you have in the hole is that you know that the father in the family is a cop.  What is being done to you could be considered profiling whether it's racial, religious or whatever you want to classify it as.... Police officers can get fired for profiling you see that stuff on the news all the time... as an officer of the law they are supposed to treat everyone the same....



I suggest going straight to his superior and let that person know what is going on... does this help?  Is there anymore info to this story that might help with providing an answer?



I hope this helps,

You best chance would be to get sworn depositions from the parties that heard any libelous statements, they would have to hear it directly from the family you spoke of or it is considered hearsay, and would not be admissible as evidence in a court proceeding.  Unless you are being harassed by them either by phone, mailings, or face to face confrontations, a harassment suit wouldn't have too much merit either I'm afraid.  Libel is not not a criminal matter, so you would need to obtain a attorney that specializes in civil matters.  Usually you need to prove that you were damaged in some way over the libelous statements.

Prisons serve several functions:



1) Rehabilitation.
2) Punishment for crimes.
3) Protection for non-criminals.



Many people argue against number 1. But even if they are completely correct, number 2 is important, and number 3 is critical.

Do you real want criminals out in the public with you?  The reason crime rates have gone down is because the repeat offenders are locked up.



Now if by getting rid of prisons you mean execute all those in them and future offenders then you might prevent the onslaught of future crime from releasing these people.

However, his partner has hit him before and they have both injured each other.  Is this domestic violence?  What can he be convicted of, or more importantly, how can he get off for it?



Also, he worked for the city police department and the DA has filed a charge that he can't carry a firearm for 10 yrs.  Needless to say this will ruin his career.  WHAT CAN HE DO???

Yes, in my opinion it should.  I personally do not want to suffer, if I ever have a terminal illness or a degenerative illness of some kind, etc.  I would like to be put out of my misery so to speak.  Also, like yourself, I do not want to sit and watch loved ones die from a slow painful death, when they could have a peaceful way to die of their own choosing.

All you can get is a personal view, mine is definitely for it, look at it this way, if you had a terminally ill dog that was in pain and distress with no hope of survival, you could be prosecuted for cruelty for keeping it alive in that state, yet people have to go through it, it makes no sense, I know that large and possibly lethal doses of morphine are given every day, by nurses and doctors who are putting their careers on the line to do the compassionate thing, and people are having treatment and food and water withdrawn to end their pain, but if it was legal and the patient wanted out, then it would be easy and painless just to administer a dose of something to let them slip away without having the long agonising days of pain and fear.

I watched my Mother die a long, painful death.She was in the hospital for 4 weeks. The toll it took on our family and on her finances was devastating. I hope that when I am dying, I have a choice. We treat animals with more dignity. Living wills are helpful, and your Doctor should be aware of the "comfort measures", you prefer. Some hospitals will discontinue a therapeutic dosage of pain medication if it slows pulse or respiration, and this slows the dying process and increases the level of discomfort. Shameful.

Yes I think euthanasis should be legalised. I also believe that anyone diagnosed with a terminal/degenerative disease should at least have the option of creating a sort of living will, with releveant health workers and those nearest and dearest involved , so that when the time comes everyone is as clear as is possible on the wishes of the individual concerned. I believe it is vital that people in this sort of position can have the reassurance that they can choose to die with dignity.

Someone is using pictures that I have taken without my permission. What can I do?



I took pictures for someone's website while I was working for them. I was not paid for my time or compensated in any way for my work. This was not part of my job, but something I did on the side for them because they asked a favor of me. After the employer "let me go" from the job, they kept the pictures up on the website but removed the credits from the bottom of the page. This has been going on for almost a year now, and I've already asked that they remove the pictures if they are not going to cite that I was the one who took them (especially since they are using another photographer now, professionally, and it looks like that other photographer's work instead of my own). I asked them to remove the pictures from their website, but they are ignoring me. What can I do? What rights do I have as the person who took the pictures?

Ask him to produce the document.  He probably forged your name on it.  I'd also ask him to produce the receipt, money order or canceled check showing proof that he paid it.



The best way to do this is to go through a lawyer, though.  A friend of mine signed something similar to that, under duress, because her ex wouldn't give her back the kids for a Christmas Party she had going on with her family.  A good lawyer had it overturned.

According to an election law (sponsored by McCain), clothing cannot be purchased with campaign donations if it could be considered for personal use:



"...used to fulfill any commitment, obligation, or expense of a person that would exist irrespective of the candidate's election campaign or individual's duties as a holder of Federal office, including--



`(A) a home mortgage, rent, or utility payment;



`(B) a clothing purchase;



`(C) a noncampaign-related automobile expense..."



However, I believe the money comes from the RNC, not the campaign directly, so this would not be covered.

If it isn't on the endangered species list and it was humanely killed then the only thing the person has done wrong is parade his offensive yobbishness on facebook.



If he went to the local park and snared it or bashed it with a blunt instrument, kicked it to death or the like then those things would be illegal, causing unnecessary suffering.



It's more than likely that the person bought the duck from the local butcher then posed for the picture with the head. However, you say you know the person so it's your call.



Since there is unlikely to be any evidence now, the facebook picture isn't, then there is nothing you can do about it.

Well there are actually many alternative sources for a severed ducks head. Chinese food includes a lot of ducks, and there will be farms that have ducks.



As far as I know chopping of a chicken or ducks head to kill that animal is not illegal.



You don't have any other details, for example it is easy to by chicken and ducks heads from a chinese butcher.



However if you believe a crime has been committed just call your local police station and report the matter. They will then pass the matter on to the appropriate authority in the UK.



You could also write a letter to the local paper and try and get some media attention.

I believe that rather than religion, the first form of law was social contract, like Laughter was saying.



A bully that beats people up all the time is detrimental to the survival of a group - so a group consensus that beatings are bad would have been the first form of formalized rules.  Same goes for the person in charge gets the best cut of food when dinner-time comes... it's all social agreement.



Religion came along later.  So instead of US saying that beatings are bad, it's the Divine Order saying that beatings are bad.

You don't have to be a part of your child's life if you don't want to.  You can sign over rights and visitation if you want (and with your attitude, it may be a good idea).



You WILL still have to pay child support though.

She's probably applying for state assistance, and the state doesn't want to help if there is an able bodied parent that can pay child support.



No one says you have to see your child, but I'd think of the repercussion of the child, before I'd actually decide to do that.  It wasn't this child's fault that he was brought here.

Well "beth", you are being ordered to take a paternity test. The results will decide  if you are the birth parent. You will then go to court, if it is your child, and be ordered to pay Child Support. In the future, there may be a chance to avoid paying, if she marries and her new partner wants to adopt the child.

There is nothing that anyone can do to MAKE YOU VISIT THE CHILD....If the child is your (paternity test) then yes you will have to pay child support until the child is 18 and even longer in some states if the child is full time school student and legally resides at home...

There is no requirement that you see this child, whether yours or not.  Thats first.  On a more fundemental level, you do have a duty to pay child support for a child that is shown to be your legal offspring.  DNA testing cannot prove that the child is yours, all DNA can do is rule you out as a possible parent.  If you choose to go that route, your call.  If the mother should get with someone who wants to adopt the child, then you have the option of signing away your parental rights in return for a release of liability on the support claim.



One word of advice: if you come off in a courtroom as the heartless uncaring jerk that you did here in this forum, I wouldnt count on a judge being to sympathetic to you.  After all, the child didnt ask to be born into this melodrama.  If the mother is wrongly naming you as the father, if she is that promiscuous that she may not know who the father is, maybe you need to be a little more selective of your bedmates in the future.

Often times, especially within the upper classes, it is customary for mothers to give their maiden name to their sons as a middle name. Say your last name is Martin and your married name is Jones, you might name your son, John Martin Jones. It is even done sometimes in the case of a girl.



As in John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Fitzgerald was his mother's maiden name.

Not necessary. The anticipated name structure is Given name, Middle name, Father's name. The middle name may be your maiden name but does not have to be.  A hyphenated last name is also allowed, however it is considered pretentious.

Small claims court:being sued "road Repairs on private road"?Neigbor is suie ng me for " road repairs".?
There was little repair , most went to widen a spot which I didn't want widened and the rest went in the guys pocket. Usually I fix potholes near my house and never asked for a dime. No one owns the road and my deed has nothing about maintain any portion just a right to pass. The guy is a low life creep extorting money out of the neighbors for profit and I said I would pitch in to anyone but him. I got no benefit from the work.So I am being sued Even though there is no written or verbal contract or obligation. What do you think ?

I am fairly certain this will not go very far, and if he wants claim that he has rights to the private road and the repairs you made were against his wishes he will than have to explain why he did not maintain the road. If there is no HOA that requires you to maintain this road it is not your responsibilty. No judge in his right mind would penalize you for not maintaining the road which is not owned by you.

You need to prove that you created that song on a certain date.  And on that date the music was automatically copyrighted. Put your music or song in some tangible form - a piece of paper, a CD, a floppy disk or written as sheet music or even on a napkin. Just remember - it HAS to be in a tangible form. Also include a copyright notice at the end of your work. The proper format is: Copyright or ©, year you wrote it, your name, ex: © 2000 John Doe or Copyright 2000 John Doe.



Then you have to find a copyright office, Google it with your state and city, and they will give you a process to go through.

It all depends on what happens. The fact that some people actually win ticks me off.  I am not an advocate in any way however, we know that we take risks when we eat food that we don't cook ourselves.  We know that it's unhealthy as he*&.  We know that the ingredients are...ain't no tellin' what.  One example of a jacked up lawsuit is the McDonald's woman who actually won when she spilled coffee in her car and burned her dumb a*&.  Duh...coffee is supposed to be hot.  Now...if someone finds a rat's nose in their burger...they may have a case.  The restaurants should be cleaner.  But overall, we know it's risky.  You don't know if the workers are spitting in your drink, digging in their nose and putting the boogers in your burger bun, pasta, meat, salad...digging in their butts pissed off at the world, including you, and touching your food.

<question>



Is Mike Vick getting "over punished"?



This is a quote from today:



“I’m not trying to make him suffer,” Commonwealth’s Attorney Gerald Poindexter said in a telephone interview. “I’m just trying to make him account for what he’s done.”



Account for what he's done?  He is in Federal prison and has gone bankrupt and lost his job.... and he never hurt any person.  These are DOGS.... and not just any dogs, PITT BULLS, an animal known for mauling children!!!!



Now, I am not condoning animal violence, but Good Grief, don't we think that the PETA pleasing Government has gone a bit far here?  People who get DWI and kill innocent people are not hung out to dry this bad.... Heck, some spousal abusers, too.



He should have been fined and been on probation, and that's just for the dogfights.  He also lied, but so would I if I knew my life was going to end due to a viscious animals death.



What do you think?  Am I way off?

A pit bull can be a wonderful dog if properly treated.  What Micheal Vick was doing was barbaric.  How you can defend his actions by saying it's just a dog and a vicious animal demonstrates that you have as little concern for living things as he did.



You are way, way off.  What he did is serial animal cruelty for his own enjoyment and profit.  Not a respectable or understandable thing in the least.

Pretty much everyone convicted in the American justice system gets over punished. That's why we have the largest prison population of any country in the world. Our sentences are about 8 times the European equivalent. Not that Europe is the pattern we should follow but it should stop and make you think.

Yes you are off. He didn't just go to the animal shelter and get spare Pit Bulls. He was BREEDING them. He was BREEDING THEM TO FIGHT. Imagine if one got out. What if it mauled a child? Would you have a problem with punishing him then? Knowing that he was responsible for the dog being alive. Also he didn't "kill" dogs. He TORTURED dogs. Not only the brutal way he killed them, but also the fact they were malnourished. The lucky ones were the dead ones. To be honest to fairly compare what he did to a DWI driver killing someone, the driver would have to die as well. Either that or they'd hit the person and put them with in an inch of their life, so the person suffers every second they are alive for the rest of their life. Seriously look up what he did to the dogs. Look at the number of dogs that the Govt admitted to finding BURIED. We aren't getting in to the ones still alive that were likely put down.
Oh and one more thing torture of animals is usually the first sign of someone who will abuse people. As to Simon I don't care what you people fight, but in the U.S. we don't fight C0CKs or Dogs. At least not the civilized members of this country.

I haven't been following the story, but it seems like he raised dogs to fight and be violent and then the dogs mauled a child, possibly killed a child.  If that is correct, then he might as well have killed the child himself.  Pit bulls can be very gentle animals if they are raised right.  Their reputation comes from their size v/s strength.  They are no more prone to aggressiveness than a german shepherd.

What he did was horrendous, he deserves all he gets. What he should do, if he has any true remorse at all, is dedicate a portion of his time to  animal rights and become a repentant advocate.

How can Catholics be pro-choice? Are they 'listening' to the pastor like Obama did for 20 years?



Obama says he went to Rev. Wright's church for 20 years and never heard the anti-American, anti-white, anti-anything that is not against blacks come from his mouth.  Is this similar to Catholics who claim to be pro-choice?  Killing an innocent life is basically like condemning yourself to hell if you're a true Catholic believer.



I would never have an aborition myself but I am pro-choice as I think if women make the decision to have an abortion, it should be up to them and their conscience, not the government.

Sounds like the Child's father needs to grow up. Teach the kids respect for other's property. Teach them that if they keep letting balls go in her yard they are disrespecting her. I think it is stupid to charge her with anything. Is her yard public property? I highly doubt it. So that implies, to me, anything like that that goes in her yard becomes her property. If the kids had a little respect they would have apologized and ask for the ball back, and then made sure it stayed out of her yard.

Depends how many times the ball landed in her yard and whether it hit windows, etc.  Depends on the kids behavior too.  Are they disrespectful?  Many things could lead me at 45 to not give the kids ball back as well.

Isolation in schools, torture? is it legal? ?



Hi there,



Well i am in year 10 ( 15 years old ) and we do have a isolation policy in school ... to get into "iso" is fairly simple .. miss 3 homeworks you get a after school , for every 3 after schools you will be put to iso from 7am until 3:15 ... You can get afterschools for MANY other things, lateness and so on and on.



Before i start, yes i do underestand its a punishment and please do not say "Just do you work and dont woryr about it" ... Yes, i will do my work but when i see everyday they are +20 people in iso, i like to think there is a fault in the system! ..



So whats this iso? they have made SMALL woody rooms with a chair. 1 table and a chair. it is so small that you have to go in sideways and cannot open your arms more than where your shoulder is. you cant stand. you do not have ANY break times or lunchtimes and will be allowed to go to the toilet once for 5 minutes .. So thats +8 hours of pure torture ... You cant do ANYTHING other than having a book! .. you cant even stand up to rest your legs! ... i  honestly go crazy when im in iso and after 5 hours i am just neally to punch the walls off ...



Whats the laws regarding to this? Where can i find them??

The laws regarding school discipline vary from state to state and sometimes from county to county. If it's a public school, you could go to the local city or state government office for the laws regarding this. If it's a PRIVATE institution, then it is very likely only covered by state or even federal law.

I got caught smoking weed at college; does anyone know what the legal consequences might be?



Myself and some friends decided to have a spliff at college (I am aware it was a stupid idea) and did so successfully...
Until we were called to the reception. Staff supposedly saw us smoking it on the CCTV that operates around the site. They saw my friends



smoke some but they didn't see me take any..we were questioned, asked to write statements, searched, and given a fixed term



exclusion from the campus. It turns out, all four of us handed in completely different statements telling a different story! I have been accused



of possession, although I didn't admit to it and they found the Rizla and lighter in my bag. The school is a non-smoking campus & obviously marijuana is illegal. I've never been caught smoking



pot before, and I'm not going to quit, but is it possible for the school or police to charge me with anything?

I unwittingly bought bootlegs on ebay...?



I honestly did not know they were boots.  I plead sheer stupidity that I believed Disney made all region DVDs in a glorious box set of 110 classics for foreign markets.  My question is, what now?  I face quite an ethical dilemma because



1. These are illegal and 2. I know that these are illegal but I still want to keep them.  They are obviously counterfeit, but they are still good for my purposes, still a good deal, and surprisingly sophisticated for fakes.



Ethical dilemmas aside, could I somehow be criminally responsible for this purchase and owning them, even if initially I was ignorant? These are all over ebay right now and over the past several months and they seem to be okay with it?  I'm sorely tempted to keep them.

What is the North Dakota penalty for marijuana paraphernalia possession?



Someone I know was just arrested for having a marijuana pipe in his carry-on bag at the airport. He has never been arrested before and has no criminal record. I'm trying to find out what the consequences are likely to be. There were no drugs and no other contraband or crimes committed, just the pipe itself. He's intending to plead guilty, apologize, and say he just wants to go home (if that has any relevance to likely sentencing.) Do you think they'll take it to trial? If they don't, what's likely to happen? Will they just set him free? Will he be in jail overnight or will he be processed today? (He was arrested around 9 AM or so.)



I've been able to determine that possession of marijuana paraphernalia alone is a class A misdemeanor, but I can't find any information about what the sentencing guidelines for this particular crime are. Thank you in advance for any information you can provide.



Or, since it was at the airport, is it even going to be considered a North Dakota crime or will he be taken under Federal law? I don't know and I need to find out. Again, thank you in advance.

<answer>



Class A misdemeanor, for which a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment, a fine of two thousand dollars, or both, may be imposed.



That is if you correctly found that this crime is a class A misdemeanor.



Keep in mind these are MAXIMUM sentences.  This is often left at the discretion of the judge whether or not he simply fines "your friend" or even sentences him to any jail time period.

Unfortunately the law as it stands at the moment wasn't written with your kind of situation in mind, however the law commission has made proposals to change that. There are however a patchwork of legal tools that can be used in your situation. Firstly I would need to know if you made a contribution at the time of the propertys purchase whether it be to the deposit, or right to buy or assumption of responsibility on the mortgage (which clearly you dont have). If you have one of those you have whats known as a direct contribution which will make establishing a trust over the property easier. In trust law an express common intention constructive trust (ECICT) may assist you. You need evidence of an express understanding, agreement or arrangement that the property is to belong to both of you i.e. did she at any time say anything to lead you to believe that the property was as much yours as hers? If so there must be a detrimental reliance on that understanding. This reliance must be something which cant be attributed to mere love and affection, so for example redoing the kitchen or some other form of home improvement.



If there is no express common intention, there may be an inferred common intention constructive trust (ICICT). With an ICICT a common intention can be inferred by direct or indirect contributions. Direct contributions are explained above and require the contribution to be made at the time of purchasing the property. However it would appear to me that you have made indirect contributions which are generally any other contribution to the cost of living. As one judge put it in Le Foe v Le Foe, it is an arbitrary measure to draw a distinction between direct contributions and other contributions which free up the partners wages to be used on the mortgage. So your contributions to the mortgage even though you havent assumed any liability under it should provide you with a share in the property, the size of which will depend on how much you contributed. Do not misinterpret though, this would give you an equitable interest in the property i.e. it is held on trust for you, not an interest in the property itself.

Marriage and Union are technically the same within common law. For example, two people living together for 7 years are therefore considered legally married. The time until this "legal marriage" is considered union, or cohabitation - depending on where you live, the term is different. It is only common belief that marriage is legally different than union, as while there is some difference, the law approaches both the same. A great example of this would deal with domestic violence. In a case of domestic violence, one person could be given a protection order against the other, however, a protection order is only possible under law if either the two people are married, lived together, or were family. So technically speaking, and to hopefully make sense of this, your relationship with your mother, in law, is considered a union, and obviously you shouldn't be married. The two terms are basically used to determine the status of two individual people, even though the two terms are used in conjunction with one another.

Simply put, a marriage is something that involves a religious ceremony, and is a religious right. This is performed by a pastor, preacher, minister or priest, etc.



A union is a civil ceremony, and does not contain the religious portions of the marriage ceremony. This would be performed by a mayor, judge, magistrate, ship captain (in international waters), etc.



In the end, the result is the same.

What is the legal timescale an employer has to answer and complete a grievance hearing?



Took a grievance out for bullying and harassment last October, I am still waiting for this situation to be resolved.  Both parties have had the hearings yet no resolution.  I have been signed off by my Dr for a year, even though I asked my employer about working in another department.  I was told this was not an option yet they managed to place one of my colleague in another department after she went off sick for the same reasons as me.  I have been on half pay since March 08, this has now finished.  I now have no income nor savings as bills still have to be paid.  I don't want to claim job seekers allowance yet I am not at liberty to look for other work as I am technically still employed by them.  Any suggestions?  Also I would be interested to know whether any other people have been or are going through the same things, especially those in the employ of local government or NHS.

Our govt's job is to make sure to restrict who gets to vote because they really don't want anyone to vote, they want you out of the way because all they do is support the ruling rich elites who are their puppet masters and who don't vote, because they have lobbyist to bribe congress and the prez.

Convicts on death row...?



why does it take so long to execute them? i am watching americas toughest prisons and one guy has been on death row for 23 years....why? i understand not doing it within a few weeks, the chance for appeal etc, but 23 years? is it to prolong their agony (not knowing when they are going to die?) or for some other reason?

gingersexbomb....i understand the new evidence thing..but surely after 23 years if the convict doesn't appeal or has pleaded guilty...then why wait 23 years?



agghh!! lol i didnt want a debate on whether the death sentence is right or wrong...thats a WHOLE other question, the one guy on here has been on death row for years and he has pleaded guilty to killing his ex wife her brother and sister and is still waiting to be executed...is it just about money?



emaryl  - as i said he pleaded guilty..so no appeals to exhaust



lksprood - i didnt mean it to sound as tho i felt sympathy with them it was a turn of phrase!



jack - its not me giving thumbs down..you are right we will all die...but they know their fate is coming sooner than it may otherwise have done!



blaze - they have already gone to court, some have pleaded guilty and accepted their fate..my wqestion was why do they have to wait for their fate for so long...DUHHH read the question!!!



and for the record i never said i felt sorry for them or thought this was wrong...i voiced no opinion whatsoever..it wasa simple question..why does it take so long to execute a convict esp when they have pleaded guilty!!

Why don't we join the rest of the western civilized world and abolish capital punishment.



It only would work if murderers were capable of rational thought instead of being motivated by alcohol, drugs and testosterone.



Do away with it entirely and spend the savings in ways that prevent murders. Most of the expense is up front at the investigation and trial stage and serves only to let grandstanding prosecutors pander to the public by showing how tough they are.



The death penalty isn't even a blip on the criminal radar screen and hasn't been significant for over a century. During the last 100 years, the most people executed in one year was 198 in 1935. For a nation of 300 million people that is statistically zero and the 50 or so in 2007 is statistically 25% of zero.



The expense of keeping capital punishment is enormous. For example, the state of Maryland figures it has spent $37 Million EACH for the executions it has carried out since reinstating the death penalty. When you look at the costs, this is a criminal waste of the public's money.

I think until they can make sure the person that is being killed did the crime and  they stop putting people in jail who don't belong there. they should not execute anyone.They are still finding out people are in jail for YEARS that were wrongly convicted. To me that just is wrong. They should charge police who plant evidence and prosecutes who knowingly suppress evidence too. THAT IS MURDER! Even Jurors who convict people to get payed  off or anything like that should also be charged too. Until the judicial system is fixed and fair they should not kill anyone! With all the technology they can do a better job now than any time in history!

The American legal system is pretty complex. Killing someone does not come easy especially with lawyers involved. The prosecutors have to take the exact and correct steps and even then, the execution itself is kinda expensive.

After watching the Green Line I wonder if death row is a solution. If it is then it should be done quickly. Having to wait that long, 23 years only proves that it is better and a much severe punishment.

The free online forms DO NOT meet the requirements of any state.  You can purchase Divorce Forms online from http://www.uslegal.com for a very small fee and print them off.  They are made by a group of lawyers and are drawn up according to the laws of each state.



We bought the estate forms package from US Legal and they were accepted by the Court in our state to Probate a Will.  The complete packet (about a dozen forms) cost us $39.95.  If we had used an attorney it would have cost us $2,500.00.  The divorce forms probably won't cost you as much as ours cost us.



A note of caution, your must TYPE in the information rather than print it by hand or the courts may reject it.



I hope this information helps.

<question>



Is torrent piracy really a crime (without trying to deny that legally it is) ?



Like I said, I'm not denying it being breaking the law with big trouble for you if you spread copyrighted stuff via BitTorrent for instance, but in your opinion how much harm is it?



Let's put it this way - I once knocked onto a forum, where a certain program was discussed and somebody asked for help about it while somehow mentioning that he had torrented it. One of the honest buyers immediately stormed him with "...torrenting it is just like stealing it off a store shelf." Now everybody ought to understand that even if you did pirate a program , NEVER mention it on a forum ;), but I should point out that it isn't exactly like stealing it off a store shelf in the sense that all he got was an exact copy of an online store item which many others have downloaded after paying and no box material or transportation fees ever went into that exact copy specifically.
This is where I'll point out that of course somebody needs to get payed for compiling the program (which is far from an easy task) and if everybody just pirated it , the maker would just go bankrupt. But, if you think about it, isn't buying a non-material form of information, like a movie or something , online simply getting it free and donating the price to the makers to fund their continuous work? What if even without it being available as a torrent, I wouldn't buy it no matter how I wanted it and simply got it this way because it was free? It'd mean that I wouldn't have payed anyway, but didn't cause any material damage by getting it this way either. You heard of this Deviance thing going on around torrenting sites? It's this group of computer users who release free torrents of games while always adding this message to a readme file that comes along - "After playing it, buy it. We did." And that's the golden truth - if you want the makers to make a good sequal, some other good product or improve the existing , go ahead and pay them! They need it to continue work, bring the bread on the table and pay their bills ;). But if you just get a copy like in the instance afore mentioned, is it bad? Better yet, what if the program has an active online community going about it and by getting it this way you simply start actively taking part in it, contributing to it aso. while not having enough money to buy it in any imaginable closer time? I mean software isn't food - you don't NEED it, so pirating it can't be called disrupting the economy of highly necessary goods. In fact making it is just taking the risk of no-one bothering to buy it anyway, unless of course you're fulfilling the people's hidden desires and cutting a buck of of it ;), which of course isn't part of the overall economy's backbone. So, yeah.
If you read all the mumbo-jumbo above, you probably understood that I'm not trying to initiate some crazy revolution against copyright but just squeezing out your opinions ;). So, who's first?



</question>



<additional details>



By the way, I'll note that in a broad sense I only meant entertainment based stuff. I just didn't want to put the word "game" everywhere so's you'd think I'm a big Quake junkie X).

My opinion is that if you have to go through all of this rationalizing to justify an action in your mind, then it's obviously wrong.  The product isn't yours, the people who produced it put time and effort into it for the purpose of selling it, and it is their property.  If you take it without paying for it, it's theft.

Obviously it's a crime in most western countries, so I assume we're talking about ethics here.



You approached it in almost a Kantian way, I'd look at it from more of a Marxist perspective. The question is, does the creator have a right to the exclusive ownership thing that she created? If she does, then yes it is unethical for you to download a torrent, because that infringes on her right to share it with you on her terms. You'd have to read some Marx to decide what you think about that. I won't get into it, suffice to say I'm not so sure she does have that right.



I'm in two minds about this. On the one hand, the Marxist in me thinks it promotes a sense of communal property and free exchange of ideas, and so I think piracy's good. On the other hand the polite me feels a bit wrong for simply taking from the creator who does not share my views. A decent enough argument can be made for why the creator of the film/music/game has the right to distribute it as she pleases, who am i to simply decide she is wrong without debate?



I tend to decide though that the polite me just has a hard time comprehending sophisticated philosophical argument, just like the ironically named gentleman above.

No the owner could not be sued for slander as that is oral as opposed to libel which is written.



Apart from that, if the things written are true then there is no libel and the owner could not be sued for that.



As it seems this is a U.S. Site then as their laws on publication of pictures/videos are different then the owner could be sued for invasion of privacy or some such rubbish.

What is the legal timescale an employer has to answer and complete a grievance hearing?



Took a grievance out for bullying and harassment last October, I am still waiting for this situation to be resolved.  Both parties have had the hearings yet no resolution.  I have been signed off by my Dr for a year, even though I asked my employer about working in another department.  I was told this was not an option yet they managed to place one of my colleague in another department after she went off sick for the same reasons as me.  I have been on half pay since March 08, this has now finished.  I now have no income nor savings as bills still have to be paid.  I don't want to claim job seekers allowance yet I am not at liberty to look for other work as I am technically still employed by them.  Any suggestions?  Also I would be interested to know whether any other people have been or are going through the same things, especially those in the employ of local government or NHS.

Any copyright laws against song covers?...?



So, lets say if I were to make a cover/parody of a famous song, BUT made my own music. I plan on using the lyrics, and general melody, but with a different sound to it. I'm not selling it or anything, nor am I taking credit for the lyrics. Would this be illegal?

You could either call the state attorney's office for that state, or try doing a search for "how to find warrants in state xxxx". With so many things being on the net now, you should be able to find a site where you can enter in your first and last name to determine if you have a warrant.

If the warrant was issued for a crime OTHER THAN a misdemeanor or vehicle violation, personally, I wouldn't contact anyone except a lawyer.  If the warrant  WAS/IS for a misdemeanor or vehicle violation, the contact the state in which it occurred.  For example:  If your violation was in NY, they have an 800 number in which you give them your ID (over the phone) and they check it out and tell you if anything is on the computer.  They also tell you how to alleviate the problem.Good Luck.

You need to find the key(s). You probably signed something at some during your hiring that says they can hold your last check until you return any of their property you have.

If you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint an attorney to represent you.



Do not rely on the advice of strangers online.  Listen carefully to your lawyer.



And, if you choose to represent yourself, check with the jail to see if they let you bring your own toothbrush.

You're better off getting an appointed attorney if you can;t afford one (are you sure you can't afford one rather than not wanting to pay?)  Sure you might get some good answers online, but only a lawyer will stick around to see the consequences of those decisions, so he's got a stronger motivation to give you the best advice.

The old saying is "the person who represents himself in court (without the assistance of an attorney) has an idiot for a client".  GET A LAWYER IMMEDIATELY.  If you go into criminal court without a lawyer, you will get buried.  Guaranteed.  Get smart. Get a lawyer.  Get a court appointed lawyer.  DO IT.

It's purely down to company policy. If your company doesn't have a sickness scheme then yes, SSP will have been paid and this is correct. Although having been there for 7 months you should really have made yourself aware of the company policies before now.

I have a protective order against my babys father. Recently him and his mom filed for her to get visitation?



During the court hearing i tried to tell the judge its not possible because i think they live together. Which he had the whole time he had visitation. But the judge decided to take another route and said as long as they came up with an address of where he lived SHE could get visits. Now I appealed the case before I investigated the situation. Turns out the address they gave in court doesnt exist. I'm scared for the saftey of my daughter and me she is 3 and unfortunately they havent even been in her life a whole year yet. they havent seen her in six months and obviously they lied about the address for a reason. do I allow her to go and risk her being kidnapped or worse? Or tell his mom to kick rocks because I dont feel comfortable/safe with her going?Or wouldnt either way in the courts eyes I'm wrong? I really need help I already turned his mom away last week and she said if she dont get her this week shes gonna take the neccesary actions. Thanx!!

don't give in.  When you go back to court show the evidence to the judge that the address given is a fake.  You should have a lawyer go probono.  Judges do not like to be lied to.  You can also ask a police officer to verify the address in a police report, judges trust the law enforcement agency.  Don't give up your daughter and when she shows up tell her to take it to court.

If you're in the UK, there are centres set up especially for parents to drop off their kids so the non-custodial parent can see their child under supervision, but they can still do normal parent things, it's like a supervised day care centre.



Look into it and see if there's one if your area.



Your other option is to talk to a legal aid/solicitor and see where you stand. If the dad is as bad as you say he is, no judge would let him near his kid. The fact that the judge allowed visitation for the grandmother makes me think we're not getting the whole story, either because you don't want us to know it all (which is fine, we have no right to know anything) or because there is stuff the judge knows that you don't know.



Good luck, and just do what is right for you and your little girl

Lying to the court is a crime, perjury. Notify the prosecutor, and make sure your attorney (you have an attorney, right????? This is your kid, it's important, you'd better have an attorney!) knows so he can bring it up in court.

What an *** of a landlord. Just because you pay the rent does not mean a person can talk to you like that. I'd move. If you don't want to move, you can threaten your landlord with a lawsuit for not taking care of the property. You pay the rent every month and the property is not your's. The upkeep of the property is the landlord's responsibility. If the upkeep of the property is negatively affecting you and your family, it could be room for a lawsuit. However, before spewing all of that into your landlord's ears, I'd try sending your landlord a letter of complaint and always make sure you keep a copy. If the other tenants are having the same problem, encourage them to do the same. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING with dates and so on. That way, if anything happens, the proof will show with all of the letters of complaints from the other tenants. If that person tries to evict you for some stupid reason, then I'd take that person's *** to court.

What should I do about maybe being sued by rehab center that deceased father was a resident of for money owed?



Background info:



I am a 20 year old college student who does not have a job and don't work during school. My father was diagnose with cancer in 2004 and have been struggling with it and later passed away on september 6. He was in and out of the hospital but later after getting better went to a rehab center.there he stayed for two months and then went home while home his blood pressure went low and he was back into the hospital and was there for 4 months. So from march to april:Rehab and from end of may to September hospital.
Problem: My father and mother is not married and my father came to the point where he couldn't sign documents allowing the nurses to give him medicines and allowing the doctor to come in and check in on him while he is there. The person who would have to sign for him would have been my oldest brother who is in the military and was in iraq so the next would have been me. So I go up to the rehab center and talk to the person in charge of the matter with my mother and she explained to us that if something would have happen I would not be responsible for any money owed to them if there was... all I was signing was consent for them to give medicine and check him into the rehab . He had medicade and medicare at time of admittant, so that was suppose to pay for everything.
A few days ago I received a letter from them stating that I owe them over 4,000 and they need payment promptly.  I was in shock and I don't actually know what to do. At the bottom of the letter it state that if payment or contact is not made within 10 days than they will have a lawyer to contact me, also on the letter it state that I was the resident agent of my father. So my questions are:



1. What is a resident agent?
2.What should I do about it? Let them keep on sending letters until I go to court?
3. Get my own lawyer?
I don't know just need some advice on this matter.

He was charged, but those charges were later dropped. The government said it was for "national security" reasons, but the generally accepted theory is that the evidence against him was inadmissible.



In the late 60s and early 70s, the FBI did a lot of bugging and wiretapping without benefit of a warrant. At the time, judges were sympathetic to the government and would admit these as evidence. That changed in the early 70s, and government prosecutors often found themselves with cases that were completely built upon non-admissible evidence. That's most likely what happened with the Ayers case.

It wasn't a technicality. That does not even come close to giving it justice.



First, let's put this out there: Ayers is a lunatic, and does not deserve the freedom he has. The irony is that the reason he has freedom is because the government he protested against actually worked the way he demanded it should.



What people are calling a technicality is known amongst legal scholars as COINTELPRO. It was a practice of illegal actions by the FBI that make the shady nature of the patriot act look transparent and noble. These actions were akin to the modern raping of the Constitution by men who were drunk on power. They violated the constitution on a daily basis, and they attempted to usurp many of the freedoms we have fought and continue to fight for in the world.



Nearly all of the evidence against Ayers was obtained through this practice, and as such it was tossed. The government corrected itself, and in the process, had to let a terrorist go free.



It is actually a thing of beauty, that our country is so dedicated to our ideals that we will let scum like him go. I know, it makes ya sick that he walks free...but man, this is one helluva place to live when we are so dedicated to our freedom that we won't give it up for anything.



People who call this a "technicality" are simply not informed about the facts. There wasn't a wrong address on a warrant. This was using the Constitution as toilet paper for nearly a decade.

He was not prosecuted because the wiretaps used to gather information against him were done without a search warrant.  Therefore any information including the evidence against him was fruit of the poisons tree and could not be used against him in court.  In short the prosecution really screwed up and made a huge mistake.  Because the wiretaps were no good, they had nothing to corroborate the eye witness and informant against Ayers and could not prosecute him.

Under Age Laws Destroying Our Community?



I'm mad about the under age law, who made that law? the devil's worker?
You see these kids just can do anything they want. They throws lots of eggs at my house and
other people's house before halloween, the worst thing is they gang up, screaming outside of the



street, throwing fruit at people's head. They got away fast, and even laught about it then pull their pants
down to show on the public streets. ofcourse we called the police, and police can't do
anything about them.  Before one of them was arrested for beating up another kid and threatend
the kid for money.  what happen to him? well he's back walking on the street with his gang.
Our communtiy was also mad, they causes lots of damage to our property. I'm very tired of this.
What in the world this features has becoming?I read many news ariticals about under age 10,12,
kids killing , robbing, beating, gang up on people and they found not guilty. There was 12 yearsold girl



who was raped by 3 other 10,8,9 yearsold boy. she was afriad to tell her mom. Her mom found out bloods
on her panty and that's when the police arrested the 3 kids. What happen to them? You know the answer.
I believe there are many crimes out there involving with kids under age, it's happening in school, on the street
and many other places. I also believe there are many crimes that are not been reported. The statisti show
on police records are not actual. The crime rates are growing, people can see that!
About the kids in my community, what should we do? Find out who's parent they were?Consult their parent
and files Bad Parent Profile on Them? Well, The true is their parent were these kind of people when they
were teen and they probally got away because of the Law. Now they telling their kid to do whatever they
can to bring $ into their pocket.  we all hate to see our world sink into the age of darkness. I and you need help,
how can we bring down the under age protection law, just like the death penalty on NJ. We should go on strikes?
If so. we need everyone's power to bring down this devil's art.

I don't think you can change that law. It is written as such because the brain is not fully developed, and the center of the Brain that helps with making the right choices is one of the most underdeveloped at that time. I would suggest finding a way to fight back. Spray them with a hose if they are near your property. Find an athletic kid who is a good boxer and pay him to beat them up.

It's unfortunate that there are so many juvenile delinquents who get a sense of power from destroying other people's property.  However, there are laws on the books covering it.  But can you imagine the size police force and judicial system it would take to prosecute all of them?



If possible, find out who did it and take them to civil court.  A few multi-dollar judgments against their parents would make a big difference!

Sue the parents of those kids, and press negligence or contributing to delinquency charges (very hard to prove, though). Write your representatives and ask them to change the law so that these hooligans can be prosecuted.



Otherwise, get your neighbors together, and go to the houses of the troublemakers with shotguns, tar, and feathers...run them out of town.

Since children are so impressionable and the parents are the main and largest influence in the development, I would say that if anything it's the decline in parenting that causes juvenile delinquency. If you want to get the facts, try the crime reports from FBI.gov. They don't really show this trend that you are talking about so maybe it's a community problem?

Exoneration through DNA?



Does anyone know where I can look to find out approximately what percentage of prisoners have been exonerated since DNA became a tool in identifying rape/murder suspects? Specifically those on death row. If no percentage, an actual number would do.



Thanks.

&gt;&gt; what percentage of prisoners have been exonerated since DNA became a tool &lt;&lt;



Such a question cannot be answered. Percentage requires a fixed population & a fixed definition of "exonerated."



If you want to know absolute numbers you can Google the "Innocence Project."



But they may have a vested interest in definitions that would be most expansive.

Pot has proven medical value for some uses, such as to relieve the suffering cause by chemo-therapy.



I see no good reason to keep pot illegal for those purposes.



But, I really don't see any compelling reason to legalize the general use of it.

yes. Marijuana was made illegal in the 8th year of the great depression  by Harry Anslinger's efforts and help from the R. Hearst under the guise of it being evil. However, within a year, Anslinger got congress to put all hemp under the authority of the Marihuana stamp act. Whereas Hemp was poised to re-emerge on the textile market at a very fragile time in our economics it would have devastated to southern cotton industry. it also benefited DuPont (makers of nylon) and those invested in timberland (such as Hearst and himself). All the propaganda used to justify this act has since been proven false.
Additionally, now would be an excellent time to legalize and give us a plant that we can actually use to produce serious amounts of ethanol (unlike corn), add to our tax base, decrease the demand put on law enforcement, give us a new textile to grow & process to create jobs and provide control over the "good bud" so we can make a real effort of getting it out of our grade schools. Business people, with licenses to protect, will care about who they sell to as opposed to dealers who only are concerned about the cash.

Can i Put a restraining order on This guy?



so there is this guy who i helped out in the past. i met him at work. he is 23.



when he got evicted from his apartment he asked if he can stay with me at my moms. i said sure. we got an apartment together. then he decided to move to Mexico after a month. which was good because i noticed he was psycho! we took his name off the lease and my sister moved in. now he is back because he ran out of money and didn't have a place to stay in Mexico.
he needs a place to stay. i told him i dont want him to stay with me. or at my moms. but he keeps showing up at my moms! he leaves for the night, then in the morning he shows up. he scares me. he has never done anything threatening but he is bi-polar and taking no meds.

He is not a legal tenant of either place.  By turning up at your Mom's on a daily basis, I'm assuming that he gets fed and watered every day; thereby, like a lost kitten, your family is encouraging him.  You probably don't meet the criteria a restraining order requires because he isn't doing any "harm".  Someone in your family, preferrably a large male, needs to get firm with him and tell him that, if he returns, your Mom will ask for assistance from authorities to have him removed.



Another thing you could do is call his family ... if you lived with him in the past, you must know how to contact them, right?  He should be their problem, not yours.

I think it is possible in certain circumstances. If you are Canadian I know people who have been detained upon return until they paid fines like speeding tickets they had not paid.

Why in society is there so much resistance against punishing people who commit a violation against society.?



In my perception society tends to focus it's sympathies, interest, and concerns more on the perpetrator than the victim.



Is it that we're so frightened of punishing the wrong person, or to the wrong degree, or creating a misjustice that we'd rather not have to decide? Or is it that we identify with the perpetrator more and are frightened of having too severe punishments in case we or one of our family members inadvertently finds themselves a perpetrator next? Or is it that we see punishment as totally a rehabilitation thing, rather than also as a example to others?



I'd just like to hear opinions.

It's the swing of the pendulum operating, as it does in all walks of life.  Years ago, we put people in prison and fed them bread and water for stealing to feed their starving families; today we hardly punish people at all.  It will change gradually until the pendulum hits the other extreme and back it will travel.  Because people have such a short lifespan, lessons are never really learned.

One reason is because politically correct people are too stupid and naive to know what is in theirs and societies best interest and the other reason is that our political leaders are too cowardly to do that which is clearly required.



For serious criminal offences like theft, shoplifting, stealing cars, burglary and violence etc we should do the following.



First offence, cut the man's penis off.



Second offence, cut his head off.



Third offence, will not happen.



If these measures were taken 99% of crime would disappear overnight.  It would achieve more for crime reduction than every measure that every government has ever taken in the entire history of the world.



If this was done and we also properly addressed the unequal distribution of wealth, education and opportunity, then we would all live in a paradise where police, prison staff, court staff and social workers could be reduced by at least 90% and put to work doing something constructive.



We would no longer need locks on our house and car doors.  We would no longer need to pay expensive insurance against theft.  People would actually begin to respect each other and start the task of building a civilised society.  But before that can happen we must first remove the social cancers from society.

To my knowledge (as I have rented under similar circumstances), the property owner has to provide you with another place to live and give you 30 days notice if she is going to fix the problem. And keep in mind, though she is threatening you with eviction often, the fact that you have a child guarantees you a 30 day notice (whether your lease says it or not). Landlords are supposed to be able to maintain your properties, and if it gets as far as court, that's the way the judge will see it, too. Stand your ground and if it gets too far, you always have a right to a trial. Best of luck and congrats on the baby! (6 months late. :)  )

Each state has different landlord/tenant laws.  Your best bet would be to contact your local legal help office.  They will help you find someone who can answer your question properly. Check your phone book, internet or you can look at the legal ads in your local newspaper normally at the end of the ad they write the legal aide's office phone number.  You can also contact the Your County or State's Bar Association.

Ex going in military to avoid paying child support - help!?



My ex and I have been divorced for 3 years.  He had another child with another woman since then and is currently paying her $400 per month.  He has decided to rejoin the military to decrease his pay and therefore pay less money to each of us.  We came to an agreement between us 3 years of $350 per month, but it's not enough!  I am asking the court for an increase in child support, but we don't get a court date until Dec.  He will have shipped out by then.  His plan is to have a family member stand in for him in court!



Can he do this?  He plans to show that his income is going from $48,000 to $24,000 therefore owing less than the $350 that I currently get. How does it work with military?  What an *ss!  Any info would be appreciated -

From my understanding, child support is not based just on what you make.  They also factor your POTENTIAL earnings.  heisnt the first dead beat to think that that would work.

If you get a ticket for traffic violation and you have 21 days to pay it.?



Is it 21 business days? Or does include weekends?

</answer from>



<answer>



Most tickets have the date due on them. They also have a court date if you wish to contest the ticket. I would guess, if it said 21 days, it is 21 total.

<question>



Could this be parental kidnapping? What should we do?



So monday my kid brother went of to school. My 16 year old brother, and our mother went to pick him up. But they said my father signed him out already at 2:30pm. We've learned a day later, he was taken off to GA. Another day later enrolled into a new Middle School. My brother has already expressed he doesn't want to be in GA. He'd rather be with us, mom, myself, and our brother & his friends here in FL.



Mom and I aren't sure how to go about this issue. Due to the fact my father has challenged her mental state. She isn't sure if she goes up there to get him herself or even if he learns that my mom is in the state, he my try to have her committed there or Backer ACT or something.



They aren't divorced yet, just separated. Though she's working on getting a divorce so he can stop attacking her mental state. And trying to have her put away. (Anxiety Attacks, and her want her committed) But he took my brother away anyway.

because they are not divorced and because neither has sole custody with any sort of legal binding ruling of visitation or whatever, it IS NOT KIDNAPPING.



i would question that anxiety disorder would hardly justify involuntary committment.



they both have equal custody and as of now this is a domestic dispute. from your description, no crime has occurred.



it is not a crime for a father to take a child out of state without telling his wife.



no judgement has been entered regarding her mental state and your description did not even mention evaluation by a competent mental health professional.



just because he says she's crazy doesn't make it true. its called psychological abuse.



now if the father or mother just disappeared with the child and the other spouse had no way of knowing at all where the child or other spouse had gone... missing persons, yes....



if the mom runs with the child, it will further substantiate the fathers claims of psychological illness to the point of endangering the child. if the mother and child run without the father knowing where they went or when they would come back, i can't think of too many psychologists that would testify that she was competent to care for a minor, and the act of suddenly disappearing with the child could be grounds to demonstrate psychosis- paranoid delusions, delusions of persecution, and blatant disregard for the best interest of the child.

If he doesn't have full custody of your brother he can't take him and yes it is parental kidnapping, but if your mother has been diagnosed mentally incompetent to care for her child and has no custody then it is a matter whether she has visitation permission or not. You should go to the police department and tell them about the situation.

What your mother and you are going through is not that uncommon. All your mother has to do is to go there and hide in a place where would not be expected, grab your brother and run. Once she gets him, legal custody papers must be filed immediately. If she does not get this settled now, she will crack. I know, I had two babies and went through the mental games with my ex. If you and your mother keep  your mouth shut about when you are going there to get your brother, nobody else will know. She must do it.



There are Women's Right Organizations who would love to help her. Look in the Yellow Pages for Women's Right Organizations and call whatever organization that even has a tinker of a look that they fight for women.
Lawyers must do a certain amount of free legal services per year. It is extremely important that you guys gos through the Yellow Pages and find a lawyer to help. Lawyers do free phone consultations. Don't be afraid to call and look anywhere and everywhere for help. If you don't look for help, you won't get help nor your brother.

As long as alcohol is legal, then absolutely, to outlaw one drug but not another with worse consequences(i.e. alcohol) is just hypocrisy. Besides, alcohol required a constitutional amendment to become illegal, all drugs outlawed today are only illegal by act of congress, which I find highly suspect. If One drug(alcohol) needed a new amendment to the constitution to prohibit, why not others? I'll tell you why, because the government wants more and more controll over us.

Alcohol and cigarettes are legal, I don't see why marijuana shouldn't, besides I don't see alcohol and cigarettes having the potential medical benefits that marijuana can give.



If you learn from history, marijuana was actually banned because of race. Mexican laborers would smoke it, but with a downturn in the economy they used marijuana as an excuse to kick the Mexicans out of the country.



As for the first post, automatically identifying something as good or bad without learning the facts can be dangerous. It leads to very ignorant generalizations about things.

If this is a U.S. question: You don't have to take a drug test unless it is court ordered or you are on parole or probation. You never have to take a lie detector test, although if you are applying for certain jobs, i.e. in law enforcement, you will be required to take the test to be considered for the job.

Those are two different tests with a variety of purposes. Some job applications may require both. But there are other situations where you would only take one. Probation officers give drug tests, for instance. And police interrogators may use lie detector tests on suspects.

Obviously not, prisons are getting more crowded every month.



The problem isn't that we don't have enough prisons, its that once inmates go into the outside world they have no job or future, and don't anything other than to be in a gang or deal drugs to survive.



Justice system should focus more on rehabilitating prisoners so they have a job once they get out, instead of keeping them locked up.

This begs the question: What do you want the criminal justice system to do?  If the answer is "reduce crime", then no it's not working at all.  Prison dooms people to a life of crime.  I just moved out of an area with a ton of revolving-door criminals and know from firsthand experience that the conditioning you get in prison, the rapes, beatings, and willingness to kill over any disrespect is totally incompatible with life in a civilized society.  Or america.  If, on the other hand, you presume the purpose of the criminal justice system to be to keep the population cowed and afraid of the government, then it's working just fine.



If you view the CJ system as broken and want to fix it, there's an obvious answer.  Legalize drugs.  There's no need to turn a pothead into a violent person, but that's what prison does to a million americans a year.  I'll get up on my soapbox for a bit here.  Think about this--instead of all the money we pour into cops, courts, and prisons, we could spend a tenth of that maintaining crackhouses.  I don't just think crack should be legal, I think it should be free.  It's a self-correcting problem.  Just wheel in a cart of crack at night and drag out the bodies in the morning.  It's not real compassionate, but neither is the current system.  This would be a lot cheaper and you'd have the same end result.

What is the CA wage penalty?



On my check stub, there is a section titled CA wage penalty. I thought this section had something to do with a person working more then 5 but less than 6 hrs with out a lunch. I used to get extra hours on my check because of this, but they started subtracting hours to make up for the ones they gave me. Now, my job is just taking extra hours out of my check and charging me this penalty. What did I do?

They can't do that. the "law" says they either have to pay you or let you take a 1/2 hr. lunch after 5 hours of work, plus a 10 minute break (paid) during those 5 hours.



And, they can't deduct money from your check cause they f''ed up. They have to get your approval before hand.



Talk to a labor lawyer. look them up on the net.

Yard man steals drinks from my fridge.?



My mom will not fire the yard man, so don't even mention. We've used him for over 10 years. He used to be a cop, chief of police somewhere, so definitely knows right from wrong. He and his employee come in the side door of my garage and were taking beer. Sometimes my mom would give the employee 1-2 and then they would end up taking 2 more. Now, he just rang my doorbell to tell me he "took a bunch of water for his truck". We have talked to him about it before. I try locking the side door of my garage, but I think his employee stole a key before cause its always open.

I know you cant fire but threaten him and tell him that if takes any more he will be fired and start keeping track of the beer. And see if there is any one you can report him to. Also if he has a key you should probably change the locks because that could be dangerous if he has a key. and if you change the locks they can't get in the house

Quit stocking the fridge for a while they will quit looking after a while...buy a little fridge for your room for you if mom wants to supply the guys with beer let her...You will have your own.
Also, keep tally of the beer he takes and when he gives you the bill to pay deduct the beer from his pay. Write on the bill -$20.00 for beer under his amount  then subtract it from his total bill. Give him an adjusted bill with his pay. I bet you that will cure him from taking your beer if he is paying for his and his crews beer.

Approach him peacefully and tell him you can't keep just providing him drinks anymore as it's taking a toll on your family's budget.  Ask him for his input on what he thinks a fair amount would be to charge him for each drink.  *Don't* get combative.



Whether or not that works, I'd add a deadbolt/second deadbolt to the door he's been using.  It's just not safe for a thief's employees to have access to your home.

owning a Lawn Care, Tree Work, and Landscaping company myself I would NEVER let my employee's do that.  Hire a LEGAL company who is licensed, insured, and PAYS TAXES and this wouldn't be a problem anymore.  i am sure all your mom cares about is hiring the cheapest guy but something bad is probably going to happen, it happens here all the time.  I get calls from people all the time telling me their story but then I give them my prices and they say, "Oh, I'll just stay with him then."

It doesn't sound like she's in trouble, but they want to get her statement because she was present when it happened - so she is technically a witness.



Tell her to relax and tell the truth - if theres something going on that she is trying to hide, she is almost gauranteed to contradict herself, or give them other indications that she is lying.



Good luck!

For a start I'd post on here which shop it was, so that we all know to keep well away! Secondly I would definitely write and complain to their head office with a copy to the store manager. Don't let them sweep this under the carpet. They were quick enough to accuse, so they should be similarly quick to apologise.

Letters usually give more credance to a complaint.  People realize that "hey someone to the time to write out a complaint"  This also usually gets peoples attention because now the incident has been documented and could be used in court if it ever goes that far.

forget writing them the letter, if they wanted to apologize nicely, they would've done so already ... instead, write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper ... and make sure it's the local paper, not a national one, since local papers are usually free, or given out on a complimentary basis by local businesses ... and read by local residents, also that shop's customer base ...  they'd be bound to lose a few customers that way, i'd say.

What are you on about?  You were not "accused" of anything.  You were asked a simple question and the situation was dealt with immediately.



You totally need to let this go - by "marching up to " the girl, you probably behaved the worst in this situation.  Shops are private property and are allowed to protect against theft.

i know how judges think  because i've been around lawyers and judges my whole life;  the last thing, the ditching school obviously wasn't as bad as stealing. So, if you could show up with a parent, I think the judge would be more likely to give you a break.  He will watch to see if you are respectful of your parent or if you back talk or have an attitude.  The most important thing for you to do is be humble, and let the judge know that you will not do it again.  He will want to know if your parent gives a crap and will be watching and may perhaps talk to him or her. i don't know your age, but the closer to 18 you are the less nice he will be. After all, you're not starting adulthood out on the right foot. And grown up jail isn't any joke. You have to fend for your life in there./ oh yea,... don't try to make an excusefor your absence  to the judge. If he asks you why you did it you can give him one sentence, but don't go into a long scenario about how it wasn't your fault and you couldn't help it. That's the worst  thing you could do because it looks like you don't handle responsibility well. Just tell him why it happened and let him know that your education is important to you, and it won't happen again. Then say to him that you would be very gratefull if he  would give you the chance to show him.  Say "Your Honor" . Lots of people don't do that any more and it burns them up. It's disrespectful.Good luck.  I'll be thinking about you.

I think you ought to consider living a life without crime.  If you are on probation it's possible you'll spend some time in jail seeing as how you failed to obey the judges' sentences.  Go to school.  Get a diploma.  Or don't, then you won't get any decent jobs so that you can lead a without crime.  Education is the only key to get you out of the cycle you are now in.  End of lecture and good luck to you.

<question>



I am being charged with theft by shoplifting in Georgia, what will likely happen to me? What should I plead?



I was talking to a friend of mine and told her that I was going to a certain store. She told me that she knows a a young man who works there and can get me a 40% discount off of regular price items and that I'd just have to give him something like 20 or 30 dollars depending on what I buy. Each week the store offers half off different sections of the store. So if I saw something that wasn't half off she said he can give me his discount.



I thought it was a good idea since I was going to spend about 250.00. Well when I got to the store he knew who I was cos she had sent him a pic of us through her phone. When I arrived at the register he rung all of my things, there was a lady standing beside him at the register (another employee) which I thought was ok since he was giving me a discount. I gave him my debit card because the machine was at the other side of his register. He told me that my purchase was half of what I'd expected to pay without his discount. When he gave me the receipt to sign it said 8.00 and I was thinking it would be around 160-175 with his discount. I was scared, people were behind me in line and I didn't want to ask him anything. So I left and called my friend. She says that he must have put the wrong amount mistakenly and not to worry about it. Five months later I was visited by a detective that showed me a tape of me shopping and leaving the store. They said that I am apart of a shoplifting ring. My friends sister and grandmother was also visited. I didnt know this was going on. They took out a warrant for my arrest because they say that I didn't cooperate. I didn't tell them what happend, I just stated that I dont know the guy, which was the truth.



Now I have to go to court. What is going to happen to me? I am 29 and I've never been in any trouble. My husband recently was laid off and and I am a realtor. I can't afford a lawyer right now due to market situations. I told my husband what happend at the store when I got home and he told me just not to go to his register again if I shopped there again. I have kids and I dont want to go to jail or have a criminal record.



When I received a copy of the warrant it said that I allowed me to undering my own merchandise, I've never worked in any retail store. The warrant is wrong but I still turned myself in. The guy had underung over 10 people in two days!! I honestly didn't have a clue.



They stated that I am being charge with a 700.00 felony which is not true, I had my calculator while shopping and I was prepared to pay the full price incase he couldn't give me a discount which was well under 300.00.



Please advice, thanks.

There B.S.ing, trying to scare you, you didn't tell them that your figures didn't match theirs, did you? that's almost admitting guilt, They have to prove you broke the law, you mustn't admit anything.Don't talk to them without a lawyer, they HAVE to provide one, if you can't afford one. And, if they had any thing on you, they would have processed you right then, the "warrant" thing is whack. And, since when do stores let you "ring up" your own stuff, just say you never worked one of them ca-shy things before, but you'll get better. But, if they have "video" of you "shopping and leaving" it's kinda hard to "prove" you rang up your own stuff if it's not on the video. Even actual close up video of you leaving, doesn't prove nothing. And what were the two employees doing while you rang up the stuff and when he told you it was half off what you expected to pay, wouldn't you have known that if you rang it up? And why did it take them 5 months to contact you?
DEFINITELY  don't talk to them without a lawyer.

Does the Landlord have to correspond with the tenant before taking the guarantor to court?



I am the ex-tenant of a flat (just me) and left without paying the last months rent, knowing that the landlord (agency) would be charging me the earth to update the flat (they had been doing it to all the flats that have been vacated in the block). Therefore, they can keep deposit.



However, they have contacted my mum as guarantor and said if she doesn't pay within 7 days they will be taking her to court. Not my intentions!



They have sent a list of damage to the property and put a number at the bottom with no breakdown, invoices or photographs. Things like cigarette burns in the carpet, which i had found under the rug some weeks after renting the property but didn't report to the agency. On the inventory that i signed at the start there were notes saying that the carpet was damaged beforehand anyway with an iron mark etc. am i liable to pay for replacing all the carpets?



My biggest concern is of course getting the agency to solely deal with me and no my mum, is this possible?

If you found some damage that wasn't your fault then you should've reported it. But if you haven't then they might think it was your fault. I don't understand why you didn't pay the last month rent knowing that it would cost you the earth to update. Go see a solicitor they are expensive but are very helpful.

That's what a guarantee is for, I'm afraid. If you don't pay your rent they are entitled to call upon your guarantor.



The best you can do is pay up now, before they continue with enforcing the guarantee.



Regarding the damages, if you didn't report them at the outset of course they'll hold you responsible. In this respect, you need to take advice, either from the CAB or a solicitor.

You'd have to find a career or "paid" fire dept which are found in metro cities or populated areas. Most fire dept's are volunteer based and all of the firefighters there have other jobs and they just carry a pager/radio and listen out for calls/dispatches then go to the FD and roll out to the call.

Different types of courts and cases?



I need to watch a couple of cases in court but my guidelines are from an Australian university so obviously things are a little different here.



First I had to see a summary court hearing which I did in a local magistrates court.  This was the defendant's first time there and he pleaded guilty (they asked right at the beginning how he pleaded).  I was told that I went to a sentence case not a summary hearing.  Confused on that...can anyone advise?



Now I need to view a criminal jury trial at a higher court.  Isn't this likely to be really long and over a few days?  What would be this court in either West Sussex or Surrey (if possible).



Also a higher court plea of guilty and sentence hearing.



Any words of wisdom greatly appreciated.  Eg. where to go, what in UK terms I should be looking for and how long its likely to be.  Thank you!

Support Enforcement not cooperating with disabled non-custodial parent - ADA violation?



I am the non-custodial mother of two teenage boys, who is compliant in her child support payments.



I am also on social security disability.  On June 2nd, I went to court in the state my children live in (800 miles from my own home) to have a modification made to my support payments based on the change in my income.  My modification was approved.



I have been trying since then to have the order modified with the people who pay my disability.  State Dept. of Child Support Enforcement has to file the paperwork with the company that pays my long term disability, but has not done so.



First they said they never go the new orders.  I called the courthouse, and the courthouse sent them copies.  The replied that they still had not received them.  I had the courthouse send a second time.  Finally, in September, I received a letter from the enforcement office that they'd received it, and sent me a copy.  Still no changes were made to the order.



When I called, they said they had no record of my new orders - despite the fact that they sent me a copy, including a letter on their own letterhead.  I faxed this to them, and received no reply.



Last week I again contacted their office, who said "I have no idea why this was never sent, I'll send it right now."  When I contacted the enforcement officer about this, she replied "I have more cases than just you, you know!" and proceeded to inform me that the overpayment from the last five months (Totally around $600) will go towards my arrearage, since it's already been sent to my Ex.



Upon calling two days ago, I was informed that the company that cuts my checks still has not received the new orders.  Next week it will be five months.  Here is my concern.



I am now on social security disability.  The hoops they are making me jump through to get this updated are insane, and making my life nearly unbearable.  I only bring in, after my payment to them, $537 a month.



Can their behaviour and attitude towards this situation be considered a violation of the Americans with Disabilities act?  I get sick with panic attacks every time I try to call them, and the stress they're putting me through is insane.



If I were to contact a lawyer, would I have a case?  I'm not sure what else to do.

What does the Vatican have against genetic modification?



I admit I am not religious, and I have nothing against those who are, but I think the Vatican is going a bit too far. I found that a few months ago, they introduced the following mortal sins.



The New Mortal Sins



1.) genetic modification



2.) carrying out experiments on humans



3.) polluting the environment



4.) causing social injustice



5.) causing poverty



6.) becoming obscenely wealthy



7.) taking drugs



I take some objection to the first two. Genetic modification is something most modern agriculture has come to rely upon. And human experimentation is necessary to introduce any new drug, or research diseases in hopes of curing them. Further more, I doubt genetic modification had been foreseen when the bible was written, so I strongly doubt it conflicts with anything in it. What is the Vatican trying to do here? I am hoping I am overreacting here, and that these sins are not meant to be literal and concrete. If so, any catholic on medications had better give them up in order to save their souls thanks to number seven.

1) genetic modification is dangerously close to "Frankenstein"  Taking on Gods powers is the height of Pride one of the original 7.



2) Mostly refers to prisoners and those in Africa ( The Constant Gardener).



7) Refers to illegal aka street drugs and recreational use of prescription/over the counter medications, not the legitimate use of prescription drugs.  This is The Roman Catholic Church, not the Jehovah's Witnesses or the Mormons.

It's probably up to the judge.  Did he have a good reason to leave the house?  If he couldn't hack it the first time, then  I doubt that judges will let him do it again, especially since he is essentially "escaping" his punishment.

No, he's going away and for probably longer than if he just took the time in the first place, cause now he gots, "tampering", "evading/eluding", the "violation", and the original sentence, that was waved for "house arrest"
It really pisses judges off when people "cut" their stuff off, so he might get "contempt" too.

Most Americans are afraid of paying higher taxes.
The sad part is, if they did the math most people would actually pay less for universal coverage and never be turned away.  We are slowly moving in the direction though it will probably be 10-15 years before we get there.

Socialism.



The concept of Medical Insurance in American has made medical care a privatized business.  It's not something the government generally provides here, you're usually insured through your place of employment.  If for some reason you're not employed (a student, on disability, or a non-married partner) and uninsured, most of the time, you're just out of luck.



I've been uninsured for nearly three years.  I have an ex-boyfriend who is almost 32, and he has never been insured in his life.  It's a sad and sorry state of affairs.

Because you are wrong.  There is no such thing as "free" medical assistance for everyone in a country.  The medical care is paid for with tax dollars.
In the US we have the freedom to choose.  We can buy or not buy health insurance as we choose.  When we pay our premiums direct to health insurers, we know what it costs us.  Do you really know how much you are paying for health care?

My two teen sons and I were given 20 days to get out of our apartment before eviction occured.?



Question:  The reason given for this by the resident manager was that my boys had too many friends coming to visit our apartment, that our apartment had become a teenage "hang out" and that was breaking the lease.  They sited making too much noise after hours (before 6am and after 10pm) as the lease breaking point.  But I never ever got any warnings from anyone and the resident manager said it's your son, he is the one that is the cause of all of this.  Isn't this breaking Federal Law?



</question>



<additional details>



There is a Federal Law that says renters cannot be discriminated against because they have minor children.  There is nothing in my lease about having too many visitors.  I asked my neighbors and none of them said that we disturbed them.  There was one person who works for the resident manager that hated my 17 year old son because my son told him to turn down his loud music after 10pm because his mom was trying to sleep.  My son is outspoken and frankly has an attitude, but I assure you that he did not do anything that warrented us having to leave.  The Resident Manager said I would have to continue to pay on the lease agreement until it is over in Feb of 2009.  I am already in a new apartment now.  It will be a cold day in you know where before the Resident Manager of the old apartments gets ANY more money from me!

You must read the terms of your lease carefully.  It should outline things such as visitors, noise, animals etc.  It could be that the manager may not be required to issue warnings ; a simple breach of contract might be enough to justify eviction.



Naturally, you are protective of your boys, but you must ask yourself, in all honesty, if they really do have too many visitors and if they do make too much noise.



Perhaps you could let a lawyer look at your lease and advise you accordingly.  I hope you can resolve this amicably.

Honestly, I'm not that informed on which cases are and are not Federal Laws. But, I'm pretty sure that you are supposed to get a warning and if you didn't they are being major assholes. Excuse my french, but that's ridiculous. The best advice I can offer is that you should get a lawyer and look over this; or go talk to someone that is higher than your resident manager. I hope and pray that everything works out for you!

Landlord tenant laws in Michigan?



I moved out of my apartment in August.  My lease was completed at the end of August 1.  The rent was paid, yet my landlord came over at 10pm on August 28 beating on my doors and windows and threatening to use his key to come.



I didn't know who it was at first and was scared as I'm a female and live alone.  I held on to the keys until September 2 because I was not finished moving and wanted to clean the place up as specified in the lease.  By the september 1 my landlord had broken into my apartment and changed the locks.  He then sent me a bill for 1105.60 claiming the apartment was abandoned.  My question is this- Doesn't he have to legally evict me and what if any legal recourse do I have?  I'm in Michigan

Different types of courts and cases?



I need to watch a couple of cases in court but my guidelines are from an Australian university so obviously things are a little different here.



First I had to see a summary court hearing which I did in a local magistrates court.  This was the defendant's first time there and he pleaded guilty (they asked right at the beginning how he pleaded).  I was told that I went to a sentence case not a summary hearing.  Confused on that...can anyone advise?



Now I need to view a criminal jury trial at a higher court.  Isn't this likely to be really long and over a few days?  What would be this court in either West Sussex or Surrey (if possible).



Also a higher court plea of guilty and sentence hearing.



Any words of wisdom greatly appreciated.  Eg. where to go, what in UK terms I should be looking for and how long its likely to be.  Thank you!

The four basic types of court cases are civil, criminal, juvenile, and traffic.



A civil case is a disagreement between two or more people or businesses. Examples of a civil case include disputes between a landlord and tenant, divorce actions, small claims cases, and a case where one person is suing another for damages.



A criminal case involves a person who has been accused of committing either a misdemeanor or a felony offense.



Generally, a juvenile case usually involves a minor who is under the age of seventeen. Juvenile cases are heard by the family division of the circuit court. The three types of juvenile cases are juvenile delinquency cases, child protective hearings and traffic cases.



Finally, the most common type of court case is related to a traffic violation. A traffic violation may be either a civil infraction or a misdemeanor.

Just the luck of the draw, really. Defendants are always asked how they plead right at the start of any court case; if they plead guilty the court will proceed, having heard any evidence about the seriousness of the case, directly to sentencing. Sometimes, in a Crown Court case, the judge will adjourn to receive reports on the defendant before sentencing.



The system is that summary cases are heard in the magistrates court, unless the magistrates consider that it is too serious or the sentence that might be given is beyond their powers.  In that case, they will send it to the Crown Court, which is the "next one up".  Sometimes the defendant can opt to go directly to Crown Court.



Crown Court trials are heard before judge and jury (unless there's a guilty plea)



I'd suggest you try for another magistrate's case and see if there's a not guilty plea.  In that case, you'll see the whole thing in operation.



Regarding the Crown Court, speak to the court staff and explain what you need.  They're invariably helpful, though they'll not be able to say with any accuracy how long the case might go on.

My friend just died. The Family vultures have swooped in. What recourse does his loved one have?



My friend passed away on Sunday. He was a wealthy man. By the next day, the family, mainly the brother and sister were already inventorying his studio with a complete lack of respect or notice of his grieving loved one.



His girlfriend was left with a will but it wasn't notorized. It's Thursday now, the house is being cleared out of his expensive material possessions. I'm not sure how long his loved one will beable to stay there for, and I don't think there was a lawyer for her to go to. She is still grieving and there hasn't even been any mention of funeral arrangements yet. I'm aware that the brother and sister shouldn't have even been let in the house initially. The brother was morbid enough to say "Now I am Greg." that was caught on tape.



At this point what recourse does she have if any?

Her attorney can explain all her options to her.



If persons, even siblings, take was is not theirs, that is called theft.  Until the matter can be handled through probate, the deceased property remains in his estate.  The executor or administrator of the estate will have a responsibility to recover property that has been taken and otherwise to protect the assets and value of the estate.



Even if there is no will, the surviving spouse or partner or other person may apply to the probate court for authorization as executor or administrator.  That person will have consulted an attorney prior to taking action.

A fact of law: if you do not have a will, even if you do and it is not notarized it is not valid. The procedure for distributing an estate vary but are generally the same. It starts with the closet relative, usually the wife, then kids of the deceased, siblings and so on.Just because the person has a boyfriend or girlfriend doesn't mean anything. Unless they were common law. Even with a will and an executor, that doesn't mean everything is going to be easy. The executor has control and can dispose of the estate as he sees fit unless it is spelled out. For example: if a free and clear car is involved, unless it is spelled out on who gets it, the executor can dispose of it for a price he determines. He is under no law , rule or obligation to sell it for market value or a second offer. All he is bound to, is to deposit the proceeds in the estate account. You as beneficiaries have every right to contest a will. But keep in mind, you can not use the estate money to do it. But the executor can use the estate money to defend himself. And if there was no will, the relatives have first crack at anything involved and they have every right to give the deceased girlfriend or boyfriend what ever they fell is fair or unfair. Unless she or he has receipts for what they bought that is in the house. Death and divorce bring out the worst in people.

Do you think this will be a good law?



For the fathers responsible and want to see their kids if the mother refuses and only wants child support, to stop child support until the father see the child in a regular basis with out problems, and for the father that does not pay child support and wants to force the mother to see the child for them not to see the child until they pay, i think this is fair.  I am married and have a child with my husband but i raise my oldest alone and the father paid child support but never worried in visiting them until they were older they suffered a lot but now we have a good relation ship with his kids my kids and my daughter, i think is healthy for the kids to know all the aspect of extended family. in my husband case is different he never sz his daughter pays child support regular and the mother of the child is contempt by court in not letting him sz the child you think that is fair.

For mothers who want child support but do not want the father to see the kid, I say laws should be passed that he should be able to see the kid, or not have to pay a single dime.



If a father has to pay child support, as long as he makes a conscious effort to pay, that is what counts.  What if said father lost his job and cannot pay, but does his best in the process, I do not think he should lose any rights to his child, nor should he have to go to jail, because I firmly believe most who can pay, will do so when they can.



If a father wants absolutely nothing to do with the child, then he should be by law, forfeited of any custodial rights, but should have to pay support.



I also believe that every single penny of child support, should be accounted for!

I think visitation and child support are two different issues that should not be tied together. Visitation is a right and can be taken away for certain reasons (abuse, for example). Child support is not a right, but an obligation to help financially raise the child.



It should be left up to the courts to decide if a non-custodial parent is allowed visitation or not, based on all the details from both sides.

Do unions fight for their memebers rights and benefits?



Yes, and no.



Yes, they can shut down a plant by organizing a strike . . . . cool.



So they demand higher and higher, and HIGHER wages for their members, . . . . cool.



Now, in Detroit, Michigan, . . . auto workers putting one part on a car make a GREAT living . . . . cool



Only . . . their inflate salaries (for a job a well trained monkey could do) has driven the cost of a car so high that . . . . the plant is now going to close.



So . . . all of them are . . . . out of a job.



I believe unions did serve a purpose back in the day when there were no labor laws or agencies to protect worker SAFETY . . . but driving the salary higher and higher can effectively make the product being made too high, so, demad falls . . . . and all the people on the assembly line are OUT OF JOBS.



If you think I'm kidding . . . check out what is happening with auto workers in America.  (I take it you're in England based on how you spell "labour.")

tho im not personally fond of unions my parents however are. dad was union president for like 5 years and my mom has been the treasurer for like 2.



i get to hear about it everyday go me.



but, what its designed to do is not just negotiate wages, and strike. theres a whole contract they have to do every year or so. and thats when it gets stressful, because once they expire the company could potentially say screw you all... were going to mexico!



anyways, this contract has things in it that range from work safety (what happens if someone is hurt) to their benefits, to their work day (when each shift starts) and also in the event that the company does infact have to lay off some people they are bound by that contract not to hire anymore people after that. but, they could however, give a former employee a call back but not to do their old job... to do what the company needs.



also majority of the time they base things off of senority too. say the plant decides to consolidate their facilities and move the 3 plants into 1 building obviously there will be job cuts. now who stays and who leaves is loosely based off that.



i guess if the person has been their forever like my parents then it pays off because now they have a LITTLE bit of job security. however, what i think is that if a company doesnt wanna pay you then they will get rid of you and HAPPILY find someone who will be willing to work for 8 dollars an hr as compared to 17+



hope that helped haha. i know i got long winded.

I am in your shoes, and I voted Yes on 8.



The no crowd is trying to make this about equal rights or mask it as a civil rights issue, it's not.  Under Clifornia law they already have equal status and equal rights.



There is this notion that voting yes is dicriminatory, again this is a false notion.



So look at this from a practical point of view - currently the rights of the traditional and religious population, as well as the right of the 61% who voted for prop 22, have been silenced and ignored.  Is it right to silence the rights of a majority for an activist minority?



I've been discriminated against, my rights as a parent have been squashed by those wanting to legislate a form of morality taht I don't agree with; I want the equal rights that I had prior to this court reversal on state law.



I'm out waiving signs, attending rallies, and doing all I can to allow myself to preserve the traditions of my fathers and my religion.



Please, please, vote yes - that is the only vote that won't cause anyone to loose rights!

If you believe in equal rights, then vote YES on Proposition 8.  If that law is defeated then the people of California, and eventually the country, will be forced to accept the homosexual lifestyle in schools, churches, etc. or be subjected to lawsuits.



It is already happening in Massachusetts where homosexual marriage is legal.  Pastors/Ministers will no longer be able to teach the biblical implications of homosexuality without the threat of being sued for "hate speech" and nonsensical accusations by the homosexual community.

This prop isn't about equal rights.  Gays already gets all their rights from the law on civil unions.



But, if it becomes law, it affects our public schools.  Gay lifestyle and marriage will be taught in schools starting at age 5.  It is already happening in Massachusetts.



Also, churches will be forced by law to marry gays in their churches.  Refusing sets them up for law suits and for losing their tax exempt status.



Don't let the "NO" people fool you.  This isn't about rights, they already have those.  This is about churches and kids.

Defying prop 8 will in no way impact or hurt traditional marriage, why would you be concerned about it? The only people interested in passing prop 8 are conservative politicians afraid their secret boyfriends will demand diamond rings and out them in front of their families and church. Prop 8 supporters are in no way different from Nazis.



Oh, yeah - I am straight & married, with no personal interest in promoting gay marriage other than being an intelligent, educated, open-minded and self-confident human being.

I would vote no on 8 because the oppression of any person is the same as oppressing yourself. Take away one groups rights and there is nothing saying it won't be yours next. You can still have a traditional marriage if you want one, allowing gay marriage in no way hurts that. It is merely offering the rights we should all have to an oppressed population.

I believe in equal rights, but the sanctity of traditional marriage has to be preserved. It's not only about them, it's about society and how it's going to affect others including children. Think about what would happen if society keeps accepting "unusual" behaviors, which I believe is a choice. I'm not hating on homosexuals, but I'm opposed to gay marriage.

while it's true that homosexuality is not "normal" and that gays can be disgusting freaks, that's not a good enough reason to make gay marriage illegal.  "i don't like that" or "that's disgusting" just isn't a good enough argument.  what would freedom say?  freedom would say let gay marriage happen.  be an ally of freedom and let it happen, or someday someone is going to find what you like to do disgusting too and make that illegal.  there's too much stuff that's illegal now anyway.  freedom!

Taditional marriage is great.  the prop will not affect that or diminish it. The right for Gays to marry has already been in force in many countries and they havent dissolved into anarchy.
My partner and I have been together for 24 years. If he were to get sick and unable to speak for himself, in theory his family could step in and freeze me out. If the house were in his name I could lose that.
All we are asking is the right to  have the same advantages you have.

I don't live in CA, so my personal opinion won't be expressed in the election, but I still support it. Current CA law already gives homosexual couples in a civil union the EXACT same financial, legal, and social rights and obligations as a heterosexual married couple. Rights have nothing to do with the item on the ballot. Gays already have those rights.



It's about a label-- "married"-- that homosexuals have decided is the cool thing to have.



"Marriage is a gift that society bestows on its next generation. Marriage (and only marriage) unites the three core dimensions of parenthood -- biological, social and legal -- into one pro-child form: the married couple. Marriage says to a child: The man and the woman whose sexual union made you will also be there to love and raise you. Marriage says to society as a whole: For every child born, there is a recognized mother and a father, accountable to the child and to each other."



This is a quote from a great article that was in the LA Times about why Prop8 is a good idea, regardless of civil rights. It's in the 5th paragraph.

Protecting marriage to protect children
By David Blankenhorn



September 19, 2008



I'm a liberal Democrat. And I do not favor same-sex marriage. Do those positions sound contradictory? To me, they fit together.



Many seem to believe that marriage is simply a private love relationship between two people. They accept this view, in part, because Americans have increasingly emphasized and come to value the intimate, emotional side of marriage, and in part because almost all opinion leaders today, from journalists to judges, strongly embrace this position. That's certainly the idea that underpinned the California Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage.



But I spent a year studying the history and anthropology of marriage, and I've come to a different conclusion.



Marriage as a human institution is constantly evolving, and many of its features vary across groups and cultures. But there is one constant. In all societies, marriage shapes the rights and obligations of parenthood. Among us humans, the scholars report, marriage is not primarily a license to have sex. Nor is it primarily a license to receive benefits or social recognition. It is primarily a license to have children.



In this sense, marriage is a gift that society bestows on its next generation. Marriage (and only marriage) unites the three core dimensions of parenthood -- biological, social and legal -- into one pro-child form: the married couple. Marriage says to a child: The man and the woman whose sexual union made you will also be there to love and raise you. Marriage says to society as a whole: For every child born, there is a recognized mother and a father, accountable to the child and to each other.



These days, because of the gay marriage debate, one can be sent to bed without supper for saying such things. But until very recently, almost no one denied this core fact about marriage. Summing up the cross-cultural evidence, the anthropologist Helen Fisher in 1992 put it simply: "People wed primarily to reproduce." The philosopher and Nobel laureate Bertrand Russell, certainly no friend of conventional sexual morality, was only repeating the obvious a few decades earlier when he concluded that "it is through children alone that sexual relations become important to society, and worthy to be taken cognizance of by a legal institution."



Marriage is society's most pro-child institution. In 2002 -- just moments before it became highly unfashionable to say so -- a team of researchers from Child Trends, a nonpartisan research center, reported that "family structure clearly matters for children, and the family structure that helps children the most is a family headed by two biological parents in a low-conflict marriage."



All our scholarly instruments seem to agree: For healthy development, what a child needs more than anything else is the mother and father who together made the child, who love the child and love each other.



For these reasons, children have the right, insofar as society can make it possible, to know and to be cared for by the two parents who brought them into this world. The foundational human rights document in the world today regarding children, the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically guarantees children this right. The last time I checked, liberals like me were supposed to be in favor of internationally recognized human rights, particularly concerning children, who are typically society's most voiceless and vulnerable group. Or have I now said something I shouldn't?



Every child being raised by gay or lesbian couples will be denied his birthright to both parents who made him. Every single one. Moreover, losing that right will not be a consequence of something that at least most of us view as tragic, such as a marriage that didn't last, or an unexpected pregnancy where the father-to-be has no intention of sticking around. On the contrary, in the case of same-sex marriage and the children of those unions, it will be explained to everyone, including the children, that something wonderful has happened!

My opinion is that if people had a little bit more knowledge about a specific doctrine that has been lost to most churches, that it would be easier for every single person to stand up for traditional marriage as being the ONLY kind of marriage there is. However, as a Mormon returned missionary I also know that most people do not understand this doctrine unless they are willing to stop and ponder and consider it. This doctrine is called the doctrine of the pre-mortal life. To put it simply, every living human being who has ever existed was first a spirit child of God. We already had a specific gender in that time. We also had Heavenly Parents, both a Father and a Mother--and let me be clear about this--these were a male Father and a female Mother who were married. This has always been the divine pattern of marriage. It does not leave any room for other versions of marriage, no matter what people say. "Equal rights" is actually not a valid term for this conflict of what is going on in the world today. It would be more correct to say, "I believe in the free agency of all human beings, to choose between correct principles and incorrect principles." However, there are certain blessings associated with living the laws of God, and no matter how hard or how long people try to live in an "alternative" way different from those laws, they will never be able to receive those God-given blessings which can last forever. That is what is really at issue here--that people are trying to say, "Well, the original rules don't apply to me." They do apply. The consequences for those who choose to stray into homosexual and lesbian behaviors and of trying to interpret God's original pattern in an absolute reversal of what He Himself commanded may not be readily apparent at first. Maybe all that can be noticed is that the spiritual light in someone's eyes seems less distinct than before. Maybe they seem to focus on the word "I" more often than they used to. But trying to re-interpret God's laws to provide for more immediate gratification of supposed "needs" is not ever going to provide true and lasting happiness. These so-called "same-sex marriages" may stave off some type of loneliness, but loneliness is often the inspiration for great, creative works and achieving other kinds of goals and does not need to be eliminated in the way they have chosen to do. If I were to ever vote for "same-sex marriage," I would immediately feel as if I consented to someone having the "right" to strap a radioactive boulder to themselves - that it was a relationship which would only lead to spiritual degradation as well as physical degradation. What kind of a law would that be? They are actually postponing or eliminating true happiness with an eternal companion of the opposite gender--if only they had waited and trusted in God's plan for them, in my opinion. They have fallen for a counterfeit form of "happiness," one which is inspired by the enemy of God, or Satan. So maybe this will serve as an example of why we ought to stand up for traditional marriage and not waffle or wonder if what we do is right. Have a happy day, and I send you a virtual gummy bear.

A federal firearms license allows a person to buy guns online, and sell them at a store right ?



Well what about the people buying the gun from the person with the F.F.L. - What would I have to show them, just a simple i.d. card ?



There use to be a pawn shop that sold guns, I don't think much was required besides a driver license, or i.d. card.



Then again, I'm not sure.  Wow ...



I didn't think it was too hard to get a brand new legal gun, until I tried ordering, and on sign out they said, " They'll ship it to someone with a F.F.L. blah blah blah !

Well I'm not sure if this is right, but it might help. I think that if you are a seller then you probably need to have a selling license for guns. To buy one, some places sell them to someone with a drivers license and some want to be more thorough and sell them to someone with a ffl already. Online seems like it would be easier, but they are online and can be tracked so they might be more uptight about it. You might want to check out a local gun store if you don't have a ffl, or you might just want to get one.

Because law is NOTHING like television.  I have to explain this to non-lawyers approximately 5x/day.



Also, 90% of law is not common sense (unless you're a lawyer, in which case it is!)

It's really a bad idea to be your own lawyer where a criminal trial is concerned.  However, this isn't necessarily the case where misdemeanor charges are concerned that don't require anything but a bench trial before a judge.



I should have been a lawyer because i've made some prosecutors with those big fancy law degree's look pretty damn stupid in 4 cases i've had in my past.  I beat every one of those charges.  Even picked me up a $20,000 out of court settlement from a county in utah for false arrest and imprisonment for 24hours in jail.

You CAN be your own lawyer, but you will have to spend a lot of time studying the case, observing trials, learning the rules of the court, and so on.  It's not realistic for most people.

judges have to follow the law, so if your upset by the way people are sentenced you need to take it up with people who make the laws, i.e. the government. how do you think it helps society to send people to prison for armed robbery anyway? if sending people to prison worked surely crime rates would be dropping and people wouldn't re-offend once they got out. yes some people need to be separated from society. but being in prison doesn't inspire people to inter grate themselves back into society once they are released. it segregates them and enforces the idea they don't belong. why would anybody try and be a part of or have any respect for something that does that to them?

Don't know about Scottish law, but I do know that judges under English law are often frustrated by the rules about what sentences they can give.  I was reading only the other day about a judge who had gone public (most unusual) about how furious he was in having to give a relatively mild sentence to someone whom, given the choice, he would have put away for much, much longer.

I don't really see that anyone has answered your actual question yet, so...



All judges are reviewed by the Judicial Commission and the Bar Association for where they live, and must adhere to both agency's rules as well at state and federal laws. When a judge passes sentence it must be in accordance with Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Should a judge do any act of misconduct, it can be reported to both the Bar association and the Judicial Commission, which will the review the data and investigate and determine a reprimand, if any at all.

You may be interested in this article, which examines the situation of the judiciary around the world http://law.usc.edu/academics/assets/docs...



Judges are carefully appointed by the Judicial Commission and once a judge is appointed, he can only be removed if they are guilty of bad behaviour ("dum bene se gesserit" - While he shall conduct himself, during good behaviour). The only real protection against arbitrary decisions is the right of appeal and the fact that in the highest appellate court there is a panel of judges (five in the House of Lords) sitting on each case, so that if one judge goes out of line the others can out-vote him.



Judges are required to follow the law and to sentence in a way which is in keeping with previous sentencing for similar offences. They are also required to take account of mitigating circumstances, having far more information available to them than is available to the public at large from the various reports placed before them. However, there is no doubt that some decisions are surprising.

Yard man steals drinks from my fridge.?



My mom will not fire the yard man, so don't even mention. We've used him for over 10 years. He used to be a cop, chief of police somewhere, so definitely knows right from wrong. He and his employee come in the side door of my garage and were taking beer. Sometimes my mom would give the employee 1-2 and then they would end up taking 2 more. Now, he just rang my doorbell to tell me he "took a bunch of water for his truck". We have talked to him about it before. I try locking the side door of my garage, but I think his employee stole a key before cause its always open.

I know you cant fire but threaten him and tell him that if takes any more he will be fired and start keeping track of the beer. And see if there is any one you can report him to. Also if he has a key you should probably change the locks because that could be dangerous if he has a key. and if you change the locks they can't get in the house

Quit stocking the fridge for a while they will quit looking after a while...buy a little fridge for your room for you if mom wants to supply the guys with beer let her...You will have your own.
Also, keep tally of the beer he takes and when he gives you the bill to pay deduct the beer from his pay. Write on the bill -$20.00 for beer under his amount  then subtract it from his total bill. Give him an adjusted bill with his pay. I bet you that will cure him from taking your beer if he is paying for his and his crews beer.

Approach him peacefully and tell him you can't keep just providing him drinks anymore as it's taking a toll on your family's budget.  Ask him for his input on what he thinks a fair amount would be to charge him for each drink.  *Don't* get combative.



Whether or not that works, I'd add a deadbolt/second deadbolt to the door he's been using.  It's just not safe for a thief's employees to have access to your home.

If you scared somebody so bad and resulted in their death, do you think you would go to jail for it, even though it was meant in fun and games? And if so how long and what would the charges be?

Well, you you scared them by shooting a bullet into him or her, you might be eligible for jail.



But being scared is not a usual cause of death for an autopsy.



If they charged you, they would need to do an autopsy, and what would be the cause of death? Heart attack? Stroke? I don't see how anyone could prosecute because of that.



To be prosecuted for premeditated murder, you have to intend to do it, and the state has to prove that you intended it.



Lesser charges of murder or manslaughter have lesser penalties.

If they could prove it somehow, you could be charged with Manslaughter.  Can't get you on first degree murder unless you actually meant to do something that would result in his death.

Manslaughter probably. You caused them fear and alarm intentionally and this unintentionally led to their death.
