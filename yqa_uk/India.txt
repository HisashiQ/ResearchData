if the salary is in Indian Rupees, consider

180,000.00 INR = 2,858.71 EUR
1 INR = 0.0158817 EUR



1 EUR = 62.9654 INR

i believe you should just stay in london..because that amount is too less...because thats 15000 rps per month..and it is too little for even food!!.. In this pay you would be considered poor...since the rent and food etc costs incredibly higher then the pay itself.. so its basically impossible..
its hard to explain but the salaries in india are not accoding to the lifestyle etc of the place or even affordability...

A lot of people actualy take bribes thats why they seem to have a lot even thought they might get the same pay as you!!...bribe is EXTREMELY common in India/pakistan...



@ JEFFERY: Its 180,000rps per anum ..meaing the pay will be 2 thousand something euro in one year...

I would sugest do not even consider UNLESS you wil be taking bribes...

180000%12=15000 per month that will be just for you to live over in India. If you don't have family accomodation then the monthly rent it self will be around 7000 to10000 rupees in big cities.

Rs 1,80,000 per annum(Rs15,000 per month) is not the sort of salary these days in which you can live comfortably in a big city like Delhi or Mumbai or even Chennai, Pune, Calcutta or Bangalore.

But you say you are a trainee and probably never worked before. You i assume are single. If you are happy with a simple life in a tiny room in a big city but lousy area, with no frills( T.V, fridge, A.C etc) and are willing to use public transport , cook basic food to survive. You could do it.



Remember Mumbai and Delhi are the worlds 50 most expensive cities in the World. If you are paid Rs,15000 p.m its considered lower middle Income group.

But for that money , heck no wouldn't train in India if i lived in London.

There cannot be a more expansive heart than mine, they can't find more.  This was the remark made by Anna when EVK Sampath's exit.

Anna was neither God man nor film star.  Yet his record funeral cortege illustrated how his triumph was collectively savored.  ironically, as a young boy, the crowd-shy Anna would prefer the quiet in kancheepuram.  A magical orator and compelling writer, Anna's gifts were greatly accentuated by the kudumba paasam or family affection he breathed into his environment.  politically, Anna stood for federalism and democratic socialism.  in this regard, the inability of all india parties to form govts without support from regional parties, and economic liberalization and its attendant foreign direct investment and privatization have indeed brought in a semblance of decentralization on the ground. Anna exhibited maturity and responsibility as chief minister.  He made pre university education free education free for all without sufficient mean.  Initially, their principles are ''no God'', but later Anna changed it as ''one God'' formula.  He initially fought for Dravida nadu, but later he left the dravida naadu principle and worked in the welfare of india.

There are just too many great places in India. I love the hill stations of North India, be it Kashmir. Ladakh or Manali. 
Goa has great beaches, while Andaman and Lakshdweep are have their own charm. 
Then their is Kerala, Khajuraho, Taj Mahal ... the list is just endless. 
I think you should find out a destination on what interests you the most. I just go to http://www.mustseeindia.com/theme-travel to find out where I would like to go next.

never been but i doubt it'll be hard. no matter where you go and ive been to quite a few different places theres always accomodation available.. go for it if you're brave enough. Personally I'd book 2 nights in a hotel or something first just to give me chance to find somewhere.

south goa yes - but in high season xmas new year short supply.
in north on mandrem beach there are a few.
the facilities are really basic shared toilet and shower.
for the same price in the north you can rent a basic room from a local
family near the beach, even at christmas, this is normally built on the side or top of there house. therefore private. you really wouldn't want spend two weeks in a hut, two or three nights maybe.

palolim beach, in south goa has plenty of beach huts, but shared out door showers and toilets. best to find a good cheap guest house, and then find your nest in the day time @ a beach shack. the huts give no room for privacy, only bamboo canes with bicycle locks on the door for safety. better a brick built. just in case a few wolves want to blow your house down

The MTC does have a grievance cell where road-users can lodge complaints against drivers. The number is 9383337639. Harassed commuters and angry road-users could also turn to 103 - traffic helpline, if need be.

Good luck with that buddy
MTC and these drivers are the alpha-vehicles in Chennai City roads. No action will be taken against these guys. There have been cases when these drivers have driven over people, killing them, still they are riding the roads. Sorry for being pessimistic, but that's the reality.

Its better you go by bus because there is no train to Velankanni because of track expansion work is in progress.You will have direct bus to Velankanni from CMBT or by private bus.



If not you can go to Nagapattinam, from there you can get to Velankanni.Its only about 20kms from Nagapatinam
