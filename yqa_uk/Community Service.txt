Will anyone be willing to help donate?



My friend has recently been in a car accident and it came very unexpectedly.He unfortunately did not have insurance at the time and his injuries put him out of work.
The hospital is asking for astronomical amount of money and its putting him in a very difficult situation. Please message me if you are capable of helping- a_mitchell999@hotmail.com
I will try my best to help him and I hope you all will as well. He is a very kind hearted and giving person. It came as a huge shock to his friends and family and I am worried that he will loose everything.
I am preying that I will find a way to help him make it through this situation.
Thank You and God Bless you all, I hope we can do our best to help.

He needs to talk with hospital social service or patient advocate re: indigent care (Hill Burton program) and about making payments a little at a time for what that doesn't cover.



This is exactly what those programs are for and every hospital that gets federal funds even Medicare and Medicaid payments is required to have such a program.



Tell him not to panic.  In almost every state they can not take his home, one vehicle, up to, $2000 or more in savings.



They can not attach disability pay.  They can not force bankruptcy over hospital bills.



If they turn it to a collection agency or credit bureau he is allowed to put in a statement telling his side.



If he feels he is being unduly pressured or harassed and wants an affordable lawyer pls email me and I will tell you how he can get that.

This happened to my brother between insurance companies. The hospital staff may give him all types of forms to fill out for grants and help. Fill them all out! If they know he does not have insurance, they may tell him about these programs. If they do not, ask. My brother did most of his while he was recuperating in the hospital and one or more of them came through to pay for his hospital stay.

Care workers mainly work in care homes for the elderly or go out to elderly peoples houses to care for them and do things they may not be ables to do.  Wash dishes, cook etc.

Support workers work usually with people in supported housing and support with things like mental health, forms and legalities and offer support in many areas.

Hope that helps.

What's the youngest age for volunteering in england?



does anyone know of volunteering opportunities for families with kids? My son is 12 and I'd like to find something we could do together. There seems to be a lot of opportunities for young adults 16 yrs and up, but I'm having trouble finding projects for children or families in england.
Thanks

You just have to know where to look. If you are volunteering as a family, there are a ton more opportunities for children than if they were working alone. If I were you, I would try a local soup kitchen or retirement home. These kinds of places love when families come to help out. If none in your area accept young volunteers, there are ways to volunteer at home. You could raise money/ make baked goods to take to people that need them/ spend some time helping elderly people in your neighborhood. There are a million ways to volunteer, and once you start asking yourself "how can I help people?" they will become clearer. Good luck! I hope you find something!

I would ring social services they are not allowed to ignore a complaint and have to follow it up and u can remain completly annonymous and they will just check the situation.

Call social services, or social care as they are now called, it's best if you leave yr name as they get a lot of spiteful/vindictive malicious calls so if you leave yr name they are less likely to treat it that way. You could call the police but unless it's happening now they're unlikely to do much as it's yr word against the abusers.
here's a link to find yr local social services
