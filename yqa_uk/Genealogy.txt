Rank or Profession = Gent?



I have just received a marriage certificate, and it lists the groom, his father, and the bride's father as being "gents". Does anyone know what this implies, other than a middle/upper class living? It seems quite vague...



It also lists the couple as living in "Upper Chelsea" (London, England) in 1863. Is there anywhere that tells me about the area during that time? Perhaps it would give a clue as to their living situation, because as far as I was aware, they were all labourers!



</question>



<additional details>



I'm not sure they weren't gentlemen, it's just that they're labourers in the censuses, so it doesn't make much sense for them to be "gents" during the marriage.

Much as now, there are times when you put forward your better side, and I have a similar instance in my tree, where someone described themself on a couple of occasions as Gentleman. He clearly wasn't landed gentry, but may have owned a property.



I think the Gentleman in my tree called himself a Gentleman because he was self-employed, dabbled in a few bits of business, I'm not saying he was Arthur Daley, but I think that's the kind of person to think of.



There was certainly no formal restriction on describing yourself as a Gentleman, only the opinion of the vicar or registrar who was responsible for what was put onto the form. If they saw no harm, I can believe that they would allow someone to describe themselves as Gentleman. In their eyes it may have made the certificate look better.

The term gentleman, I understand, in Great Britain often times implies a certain social status. one that doesn't work with his hands etc.



In the U.S., we call any man we feel is extremely courteous as a gentleman, irregardless of the social class. He can be the man that picks up your garbage but if he has a certain manner of behaving, especially toward women, they would be called a gentleman. A gentleman holds doors for all women (whether they are pretty or not you might say).  He doesn't use profane language among them and watches what he says about them. He is honorable in his dealings with his fellow man.  They are qualities what I would really call manliness. It doesn't have all that much to do with social graces.



There are men in all social status, some have manliness and some don't.  A man's manliness or gentlemanlyness is usually a reflection on his father or a father figure.

If you are absolutely sure your relatives were labourers,it sounds as if you have been sold a marriage certificate for another person with the same name. This can happen,you have to be very specific in the details you supply.Accurate names that you are certain of and an address at the time of the marriage for at least one of the parties,ages etc.
There are a great many people with the same names. The information you have been given does sound like as you guessed people of some personal means. If you can look on the free BMD in marriages,it will give you an area also the years quarter & volume no.& page no. this is really what you need if your reasonably sure you have the right person.

Where can I find out where my parents are buried?



My parents died in the early 1990's in England. I had been estranged from them for several years but would like to visit their grave. I have no contact with any family still alive and so it is a solitary search with no access to relatives. I have found out the month of their deaths via online ancestry sites but have no idea where to start searching for burial details.
My mother died in a hospital and my father in a care home.

Is there a central point where i can find out their location?



</question>

Tried the two sites mentioned but they are not listed.
My family come from barnsley in South Yorkshire. My dad died in 92 and mum in 94.

Hi, it appears the England obituaries on Ancestry.com are only very recent ones (2004-2008).

Both www.findagrave.com and www.interment.net have English gravesites by city, cemetery, person's name, etc.  You might try those to see if your parents happen to be listed.

Depending on where they lived, you could check the local newspaper archives for obituaries or death announcements.  Many newspapers do not have archives online for the early 1990's, but it's worth a try.  Some newspapers have an archive index online, where you can find out on what date, section, and page a person's obituary was printed.  With that information, an obit can then be either ordered online or a copy of that day's paper can be purchased from the newspaper or found through a local library.

If you get stuck, please consider posting or emailing their names and approximate birth dates and locations.  There are several of us here who enjoy helping others find the records they need.

I, too, am very sorry you are disconnected from your family.  I cannot even imagine how rough that must be.

If your mother died in a care home, it is quite probable that someone from the Home went to the funeral.  If that Care Assistant is still working there then she may remember your mother and place of burial.
Also, another point of contact could be the Family History Society of the County in which your parents lived.
I belong to 3 Family History Societies - Bristol, Somerset & Dorset and the Devon Family History Societies;  members are very helpful at ferreting out info in their particular area!  Some of the Societies have a band of volunteers who collect details of Memorial Inscriptions for publication.
Be prepared to find that there is no actual grave - they may have been cremated, but the crematoria have "Books of Remembrance" which contain details of all the folk who have passed that way.
If you can edit your question with more details of the probable area in which the burial took place, someone here may be able to help further.  I'm hoping that one of my very knowledgeable contacts will pick this up.

It is specifically a data file, which is used between one genealogy program or another.



You can download a program called Personal ancestral file from www.familysearch.org  for free.  It is a great program, easy to install. You install the program, then use the "import" option to pull the data in. 
The usual format is charts.. family group, and pedigree.  It WILL output a text based "book" file that you can read.

GEDCOM is a type of file, like .doc or .xls and it needs software to open it.

So, you can either buy some genealogy software that does this or have someone else do it for you.  Most software comes with the ability to run a report and export the report to another format, such as .rtf (text).  But you need a starting person to run the report on.
Walmart used to sell a program called Ultimate Family Tree, which I loved. I switched to FAmilyTreeMaker because of various reasons.
Check with Walmart and you might be able to pick up software for less than $10 (well thats what is was when I bought it back then). It will be worth it, especially since you can build on the gedcom you received.

If this is a one-off. i.e. You don't want to buy expensive genealogy software just to read one file, then you might be interested in a program called Ancestral Author which you can download for FREE.



Ancestral Author will let you create an easy-to-read PDF document from a GEDCOM file.  You would have to install it on your computer to use it - but you can delete it when you're finished.



However, AA puts a watermark on each page until the program is registered and paid for.  If you print the document, the watermark appears on each page, but it doesn't prevent you from reading what's on the pages.



So, if you only want to READ it, then no problem!

it is quite unusual, it is a surname from friuli, north-east italy, could come from a place called bulfons, near udine, but might originate from the german Wulf (wolf). might be italian for wolfgang. the same in italian:
Bulfone, abbastanza poco comune, è tipico friulano, della zona tra Tavagnacco (UD), Fagagna (UD) e lo stesso capoluogo, qust'ultimo potrebbe derivare dal toponimo Bulfons (UD), ma più probabilmente derivano tutti da una modificazione del nome germanico Wulf (lupo), Bulfone è da intendersi come italianizzazione dialettale del nome germanico Wolfgang.

Pallot's isn't really the right index to be looking in for marriages.  It is mostly marriages in London - very very few outside the capital.  The best marriage index to look at is BOYDs - they have far more extensive coverage of most of the country, but this is still not 100% complete for all parishes and years - and this is one index you won't see online at Ancestry.

What county is it in?  I've got the Bertram Merill's marriage index for Cheshire on CD if that is any help.  Other people on here might have other CDs for other parts of the country.

In the meantime, if you want to try searching the Boyd's marriage indexes, I suggest you purchase a few credits at http://www.originsnetwork.com and see if you have any joy there.  You could also try the Federation of Family History societies databases at http://www.familyhistoryonline.net/ to see if they have been transcribed there.  Their Cornish records are especially good.  They also have the National Burial Index up there as well which is well worth a look.

Never never never restrict yourself to membership of just one website.  There are dozens of good websites out there who all have different records.  Ancestry does not have it all.  That is one reason why I wouldn't pay them £85 a year, because I know I will need to still buy access to a lot of other websites as well.



And of course you should bear in mind that the record you seek may not be online at all.  A lot of records aren't.

It's I : Potter, possibly Independent Potter, you will notice the next entry down is Ind : short for Independent and normally meant that the person was of independent means, so maybe I : Potter was a self employed potter, the entry at the bottom is I : Painter, presumably an Independent Painter ?

Edit : If it is a J and not an I it might stand for Journeyman !

I see that it's an 1841 census - Abbreviations were used in the 1841 census more than any other.  J means Journeyman (meaning time-served/having completed an apprenticeship) and Potter.  So this person was a Journeyman Potter.

"J." is always short for "journeyman" - basically someone who has completed their apprenticeship but isn't yet a master of their trade with their own premises so they work freelance so to speak, hiring out their labour where they can.  The "jour" in "journeyman" actually is French for "day", as in hiring out your labour by the day - that's todays useless piece of information for you.  I've got a lot of "journeyman blacksmiths" in my tree - only in later censuses were they recorded as "blacksmith (master)".



The second word is potter.  Self-explanatory really.

I would say that the letter before potter is most likely an 'I'or possibly a 'J',the 'N' in the little box to the right means that he was not born in that town. I think possibly others may be right in guessing it means either independant or a journeyman.

Since it was recent, this is what I do.

Go to www.google.com

put in the first and last name of your individual and the word obituary.  This might get you part of the way.  You can also try the local newspaper online. If it was a tramatic death, there might be an article.

Another is to find your school's reunion page on the internet and ask another friend.  If they stayed in the area, they would have heard the gossip.

Another way is to go on myspace or facebook and find another school mate and ask them.

Sorry for the loss of your friend. We don't have enough of them and to lose one, is disheartening.

Start with the obituary. It's not that uncommon for the obit to say, "Mr. X died Sunday after a long struggle with cancer" or "John died suddenly in an auto accident."

Otherwise, your only option is to ask around. Don't be surprised if his friends know and are more open than his family. The family is probably pretty devastated right now.

Can any Irish Genealogists help me please?



I am trying to trace my Irish grandparents and further back if possible.
My mother, Mary Paget was born at 37,Cumberland road North in Dublin on 21st may 1924. On her birth certificate her parents are Robert Paget (Labourer) and her mother was Kate Rohan.
My mother was the second youngest of 9 children.

I am guessing that her parents were born around 1890.
Her father died when my mother was 14-about 1938.

Could anyone please find the date of the marriage between my grandparents so I can work my way back?
They were an Irish Catholic family.
Thank you very much

I'm currrently trying to do a family tree of the Nisbet Family. I know so far that my family came to Tasmania, Australia from Scotland in 1857 on a ship called Great Tasmania. But the problem is that I do not know their names. all i know is that there was a male and female and thier son who's name was William Nisbet who is my great great grandfather. I also know that he married Fanny de feure in 1901 here in tasmania. 
if anyone knows who those unkown people were or anything about the nisbet family in scotland please answer

like finding a needle in a haystack, you need to find ship passenger lists- if they exist! on the 1851 census there are 1889 nisbets in scotland 6 years before they left for australia

I found this for you.
Surname: Garaway
Recorded as Garway, Garaway, Garraway and possibly others, this is an Anglo-Welsh surname. It is locational from a place called Garway, some seven miles from Monmouth, formerly the capital of the county of Monmouthshire, but now sadly part of Hereford. The place was first recorded as "Garou" in the Ancient Charters of Monmouth in the year 1135, as Langarewi in the same charters for 1199 and as Garewi in the Charter Rolls of Herefordshire in 1227. The place name means "Guoruoe's track", with Guoruoe being apparently an Old British and Welsh personal name, with the second element of "weg", meaning a road or track. The surname itself first appears in records in the late 13th Century, (see below), and other recordings include Alis Garway, the daughter of Henrie Garway, who was christened at Staunton on Arrow, Hereford in 1560, whilst William, the son of William and Anne Garraway was christened at Aston Ingham on January 12th 1842. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of John Garewy, This was dated 1292, in the registers known as the Placita de Quo Warranto, during the reign of King Edward 1st, known to history as "The Hammer of the Scots", 1272 - 1307. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. 
Hope this helps.

This name is undoubtedly French.  There are several hundred births recorded in Marne, France, from the 17th century on.

Early arrivals (3 in 1850)  were from France.

The Surname sites throw up their hands also.

From Nova Scotia:

MORELOT, Morlot, Mourlot: Morelot is the diminutive of Morel, very frequently found in our ancient lists of names. Morlots from Fontenoy-le-Château were at Chagey about 1586; Nicolas and Joseph Morlot founded a forge there. From this family came the Morlet surgeons and physicians at Montbéliard from the 16th and 17th centuries. We had indigenous Morlots earlier than that. From 1489 they were at Vieux-Charmont; then we find them at Audincourt, Bart, Bethoncourt, Nommay, etc. Numerous Morlot and Mourlot belonged to guilds in Montbéliard; the Pays counted several pastors of the name in the 17th century: Léopold-Georges, Jacques-Christophe and Hugues Morlot.

If you can find the volume and page numbers from the BMD index on www.ancestry.co.uk you can order any certificate on there going back as far as 1st July 1837, right through to the 31st December 2005.

Europe:

Czchecs.

Polish
Hungarians

Germans
Noregians
Spanish
French.
Greek

In american continent:

USA
Argentina
Venezuela
Mexico
Brazil
Canada
Colombia
Peru

Remember that 3 of the 5 finalist of miss universe contest in the last 2 years have been from Mexico, venezuela and Puerto Rico (that belongs to USA).

Talking about men... I will give you my top ten in general:

Italiy
Spain
Greece
Portugal
Ireland
Czchec rep.

Almost universally certain feminine physical characteristics appeal to men (with regional and ethnic variations, of course).  Similarly, women around the world appear to be attractive to men with certain physical characteristics.



Men are attracted to women with
---symmetric facial features
---full lips
---a low waist to hip ratio
---youth
---a clear, smooth skin
---clear eyes
---lustrous hair
---good muscle tone
---large breasts (although some cultures prefer full hips)
---tall, but of a smaller stature than men
---with pedomorphic (childlike) features

Women prefer to mate with men who have
---slim waists
---broad shoulders
---muscles (but perhaps not as muscular as men imagine)
---a v-shaped torso
---a strong brow
---a large nose
---a high forehead
---height (obviously, a relative characteristic)

Men's Health has determined that the Aussies are the healthiest nation on the planet, the Dutch both the most physically fit and the tallest (along with the Danes), the Spanish the most relaxed, and the Portuguese the nation most concerned with a healthy diet.



Meanwhile, Latin America has the most beauty contest winners in the Miss Universe contest.  Given this research, the best-looking nationalities would probably include

1.  Venezuela
2.  Puerto Rico
3.  the Netherlands
4.  Denmark
5.  Australia
6.  Spain
7.  Portugal
8.  Norway
9.  Sweden
10. USA  (I'm from Texas, so allow me this chauvinistic entry.)

you need to look at census records

they tell you the names of every person living in the same house and the relation to them.

Look for census records, birth or death records.  Also, be flexable in the spellings.  William might be under Wm or Wlm. John might be under Jno or they might be listed under just the initials.  I like using the wildcard *.  So if I'm looking for Johnson, I might just put in John* or Johns* and this will find the names with John or Johns in the front and many characters at the end.  I will also search an area, putting in just the last name and country and state.  This also helps find mispellings.

The best way is to look in the census's, when your gt. grandfather was young ( they are at 10 year intervals)
Say he was born in 1860, if you look at the 1861 census it will show his parents, siblings etc. also it will show where they lived and occupations!
If there is quite a few, make sure you know where they lived, you may need his birth certificate to confirm this-these are available though Ancestry, you will need to fill in the online form with a debit card.The certificates cost £7.00.
Hope you enjoy your experience-Its addictive!

You can come up with candidates for his family from census (depending on when he was born) but for confirmation you need certificates from the GRO.

Agree the key is in the census returns . Remember on ceyou have located the area in which he was born and baptised , home in on the parish . Remember in England and Wales statutory records started in 1837 but in Scotland it was not unrtil 1855 . Also note that census  in  Scotland on Ancestry are not digitised as in England and Wales but are transcriptions and  are somewhat error strewn . Yes you have to send off for the actual cert for England and Wales bit if in Scotland you can access the cert on line through Scotlands People .

It's possibly a transcription error - there are lots of them on Ancestry...

Is it on the actual image or is a transcription?

For instance I found an ancestor in a census on Ancestry whose occupation was transcribed as "Olkin Cradermonstyn" - I couldn't even begin to guess what that was!!

You don't say what sex the person is - but could it be an abbreviation for sister in law or sister??

I think the first posters answer is correct excepting the age, I think the transcriber has misread the age as 53 when it is almost certainly written on the original page as 63, the checker has drawn a line through the age, as they do, and it has been mis-read as 53 !

Marriage and birth laws? in 1888?



ok my great great grandparents, married in 1888, ages are 18 and 26

but they lied her birth certificate shows she was only 16 when married, that's my first question, did she lie because at the age she needed parents consent? or was the age limit to marry 18?

next question, when she had her first child 1887, on his birth certificate it doesn't have a fathers name but the child has the fathers last name.

to have your child have the last name of its father, havent the father got to be present? or has he only got to be present to say he is the father? no matter what name?

Where did all this happen? Every country had different laws back then, and even in the US and Canada laws varied widely. She may legitimately not have known how old she was. She may have lied. She may have been bad at math. You may have the wrong birth certificate. There's just not enough information to draw conclusions because so much information is missing. But you have to start with telling us where they lived for anyone to help you figure out what "the law" was at the time.

At that time, he could not be entered as the father unless they were married. Nothing to stop the child having his surname though.



fibbing about ages at marriage is frequently found, particularly on an 'immodest' age difference. Saying that, I've seen 13-y-olds in that era getting married as '18' with a (widowed) mother as witness, so pragmatics may also play a part.

England

In England and Wales, the Marriage Act 1753, also called Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act (citation 26 Geo. II. c. 33), required required that if both parties to a marriage were not at least 21 years old, then consent to the marriage had to be given by the parents. Even with consent, parties were not allowed to be married unless the male was at least 14 years old and the female was at least 12. Previously, people could be married at as early as seven years of age, but until the participants reached the age of consent of 14 and 12 years, such marriages could be voided easily.

There are many instances when the age was "massaged" to make it a little more palatable! Brides who were older than their grooms often "lost" a few years or grooms who were younger "acquired" a few. Some people genuinely wouldn't know precisely how old they were.



Unfortunately some marriage registers simply state "of full age" which tells you nothing except that the bride and/or groom were aged 21 or over and could have been anything from 21 to 80+ - not terribly helpful. It was always possible for a bride under 21 to add a few years if she thought she could get away with it so that she did not require the consent of her family.

In the past, at the age of 21 a man or a woman was considered old enough to give their own consent to their own marriage. Under that age, the consent of the parent(s) or the legal gaurdians or the court was required. Parents of people under the age of consent were notified separately that a notice of marriage of their child had been taken - giving them time to object to the marriage if they should wish. If one or both parents objected and stated so (no reasons need be given) then the marriage cannot take place until the bride or groom reaches the age of their own consent. Technically, a marriage of a couple who should have had consent of parents and have married without it is not legal.

The age at which a person could marry and at which they would require consent has changed since 1837. Then marriage could be at 12 for a girl and 14 for a boy, but consent of parent(s) was required for both up to the age of 21. In 1926 the age of marriage for both parties was raised to 16 but consent for both was still required until 21. Now, the age at which people can marry is still 16 but the age for consent has been lowered to 18.

The only exception to the requirement for consent was for a second marriage before the age of 21 ie if a bride/groom had married once with consent of parents and had been widowed they could marry the second time without consent of parents. I thought that the logic of that was - if they had tried it once and still wanted to do it again....! but in fact it stems round the fact that once a woman has married, her father no longer has legal status with regard to consent, and so she can give her own consent to her own marriage.



Marriage before the legal age is invalid.

And no, the father doesn't have to be present. The mother names who the father is and it goes on the birth certificate.

Although the age of consent which you can marry without parental consent is now 18 (the minimum age being 16), in the past the defination "of full age" meant over 21.  Although girls could marry as young as 12 in the 1800s (and boys at 14 - don't ask me what the logic of that is) they were supposed to have parental permission until they reached the age of 21.  This limit wasn't lowered until well into the 20th century.  Claiming to be 18 doesn't really mean one thing or another - parental permission would have been needed regardless.  It's more likely that the bride simply tried to up her age to something a little closer to the groom to make the age gap a little more palatable.  She'd have added on what she thought she could get away with.  Unlike today, people didn't have to prove they were who they said they were or how old they were.  People just didn't bother that much with things like age.  Without things like the old age pension to fall back on, there just wasn't any need.  Ages are always the first thing to change somewhat randomly up and down on census returns and certificates as the occasion demands.

The second part of your question sounds intriguing.  If she was married, then the certificate should name her husband as the father - he doesn't have to be there - it is assumed that he is the father.  If it doesn't appear on the cert then that is very weird indeed.  The child would take whatever surname the mother was using at the time.  If the couple weren't married then the only way the father could appear on the certificate is if he registered the birth as well at the same time and admitted paternity. You've got me stumped with that one.

Hi, the death certificate itself will be the best source of information for you.

Many states have a death records index that you can search for free - - for example, Minnesota:  http://people.mnhs.org/dci/search.cfm?bh...
 Once you find the right record, you can order the actual death certificate.  This is normally a 1-time fee, and you do not have to join or subscribe.

I have found some (VERY old) death certificates online, or by emailing the county recorder where the death occurred and asking them to look up the cause of death for me (I have gotten a few of these look-ups for free).  Depending on the date of death, you may be able to try Googling different combinations to see what information IS available online - - sometimes you can find the burial information, a family story online, the funeral home that did the arrangements, etc., and one of those findings may lead you to an answer available by phonecall or email.

If you like, you could post the information you have and several of us would be willing to help you look (many of us already joined and are paying).  :o)

I hope that helps, good luck!

The county recorder did a free lookup for me when I explained there were two conflicting stories about my great-grandfather's cause of early death:  either he was struck by lightning, or he died of tuberculosis.  As it turned out, he was "struck" but only by tuberculosis.  Mystery solved!

It does not matter. 
You may not find your family on ANY one website, if you are not familiar enough to know what you are looking for. Family research isn't about finding your family tree somewhere.. that only happens IF someone else has researched, and posted it.  Your ancestors may still be on the internet, in thousands of places, but not "pulled together" in a ready made tree. If genealogy.com concentrates on US records, that will not help if your family comes from Germany, etc. 
Close your eyes, and identify your own grandfather (he is one person of 4 grandparents, each will be unique). If you know he was born in Georgia, you want to find birth records in Georgia. If his wife's parent's died in Missouri, you may need an obituary from St Louis. 
You define what you want. What you want might be a site to type in your name and find your ancestors. Most people who want that, wind up being disappointed.

Give out the name, birth certificate details, census details and anything else (marriage & associated info from that ) & see what someone else can come up with.



EDIT:What about the "Hearnist Jones" in the 1861 census on Ancestry?.Age 1 Boarder with Thomas & Charlotte Stock at "Cottage" Churcham Gloucs
There is also a  23 year old daughter Eliza in household.

If you need further help, then use www.rootschat.com, giving all info, including census transcripts and references.

One of the family trees posted by another subscriber of Ancestry shows that Ernest's mother was Emily Brown, born 1849 in Gloucestershire (which made her just 10 or so when he was born?!).  It has her parents as Joseph Brown (1811-1873) and Mary Dubberley (1812-1898).  Unfortunately, it shows no name or details on Ernest's father.

Another family tree shows Ernest's birth date as June 3rd, and shows his marriage to Agnes, but does not show information for either of his parents.  It does show Agnes' parents, however, as George Barnes Smith (born 1839) and Sarah (born 1842).

Please note that these are necessarily factual, but might give you something to go on.

I hope this helps!

Family Tree websites?



I'm new at this, as you can probably tell from my numerous questions in this category.

On a site like genes reunited where you can allow other people to view your tree, is it frowned upon to copy information from someone else's tree to your own?

Be careful of those websites. I uploaded my family tree, someone copied it to theirs and changed things so it would fit. Then uploaded theirs. I think it is ok to look, even copy but verify it first before you call it truth. I also naively put my tree up on a site that would merge your tree with others of the same line. In other words it made a mess of the information. So now I wonder who has found that info and thought it to be true, and worst of all my name is still attached to it. Personally I think it started out as a great idea and way to connect families but by having no one to verify the information sent to the website it is a very poor source of information. Use it to find others researching your line to get the most from those sites.

people have to request to see your tree and then you give them access.

The idea of genes is to share information.

im re-searching my family tree,  on my nans side i am back to 1814 and my grandfathers side 1740.
I have found reletives in USA, and even some living just down the road and we all keep in contact  now.

so good luck and enjoy

I felt it was better not to do this, at least not without asking the person's permission or acknowledging them as the source in the notes section.  I just said in my notes to look at the other person's tree if they had permission, which they probably would have anyway if they are in shared trees, or you can say if they have put the tree somewhere public like RootsWeb. I'm not too bothered if people take things from me, but I had not researched as extensively as that person, and it would have been very time-consuming anyway for me to have entered the whole thing.

You need to define the word "copy".



The one biggest risk is that until you have some experience.. if someone SAYS that so and so are the parents of your ancestor, how do YOU know that it is right?  ESPECIALLY if that person does not indicate if they got the date from someone's birth record, or if they copied from someone else's file, and THEY don't know how anyone arrived at the date. 
This has been a growing problem for many years, in research.. it was pointed out years ago, but many people ignored it.



Most people today, don't give credit to who did the work. Let's say that you spend 5 yrs putting together a family tree.. including spending your money to travel somewhere to find original documents, that no one else knows about; subscribing to a service to find the census (or .. the old way.. hour on hour of searching through microfilm, with no index, on a hand cranked machine).  You post it online, with the intent of sharing (which, in truth, means someone else contributed to the labor).  The next week, you find a distant cousin posted all the information, claims it as her work, and you recognize a fact that only comes from a family Bible..sitting on your desk.



Bottom line is the Golden Rule. If all you did was find a tree online, it isn't your work, and you should not pretend it is. If there are no sources for the info, you need to learn WHAT THE SOURCE IS, and decide if it is correct.  I admit that I have downloaded files.. but I keep them separate from my own database, and only enter what I have confirmed, AND make note of who/where I got the information.  Most of the time, they are references only, for me.

No . Remember that quite often they have made mistakes in their research ( it is not a competition to get the most names ! ) .Genes Reunited is a super site but always make sure that you double check the info on it and then and the person to your tree .Slower but correct . People  especially distant relatives are usually delighted to hear  from you . Good luck !!

some people are funny about sharing info that they have researched, my opinion is that you use any info as a guide or reference and than conduct your own research.

i found a cousin that had conducted a lot of work, but i still did my own and proved by allowing them access to my own research to prove i had'nt copied- its worth doing coz you will always end up finding things that they have missed.

its always best to visit the relevant records office in person

Generally speaking if you open your tree on GR for someone else to view, you are actually inviting them to copy your tree. 
Sadly there are many people that don't bother to check your information then they go and plaster  the thing all over the WWW, right or wrong they don't seem to care at all - someone else finds the information and also takes it for gospel and so on etc etc.

Genes-reunited is an excellent tool for finding others researching the same families, I have had so many contacts, as close as a second cousin, whom I never knew existed.

The way I use GR is once I have established that there is a genuine link I send them a modified word pad of the family concerned, that way we are still sharing our information, sources etc and are open for correcting mistakes and adding aditional info.

It works much better this way.

Build a solid portfolio of work. Become a credentialed genealogist. Set a rate structure and create your corporation. Then shop your Curriculum Vitae to attorneys throughout your area. You simply need to get started and get your marketing plan in place. Advertise often, send out newsletters that will be of interest to potential clients (attorneys) and do pro bono work with the local court to get yourself in front of attorneys so that they can watch your work progress and decide for themselves if you're an asset to their estate/probate work.

I'd imagine you're going to outgrow the binders soon enough. I'd invest the $30 in a 2 draw filing cabinet and break it up into lines so that you can store everything safely and keep yourself organized. This time of year, you can usually also find a used cabinet at a garage sale or on Craig's List for super cheap.

First thing to do is talk to all your living relatives and find out what they know.

Next would be just to do a Google search with people of the same name. Find out if the town where your parents were born have records of births, deaths and marriages. Quite often you can download original copies of these documents and so find out more details.

Anyone ALWAYS starts with the most recent information, and uses that to lead to the earlier. 
Since you say that the grandparents were the actual immigrants, then there will be some record in the location of death. I assume you are in the US, since you did not say otherwise.  If you know when/where they died, you need to access death certificate, obituary, etc. Persons who were in the US pre 1930, should be on the census, which will also give info on the approx date of immigration.  If they became US citizens.,. you will be able to find their applications for that.  What I am saying, is collect ALL info from "here", which will often (not always) give the place of birth, and perhaps names of relatives in the old country.  Generally, it is possible to do it yourself, as long as you think about 2 ideas-
1-  you will not find all info at one time. One record LEADS to the next. 
2- You can find a lot online, but expecting it all online is a mistake.



If your needs fall between the 1930 census and late 1800s, then ancestry.com is very likely to have this.  It is not free, but if you post name/dates/ location.. most regulars here will do courtesy lookups for you. 
ps- gee, you look young to be retired. *smile*

Firstly speak with all the family you can and start charting the information you find, this will also give you an idea of where the gaps of knowledge are and some possible dates for beginning your search.

It is much easier if you get over the 100 year past hurdle, as censuses are held from the public for 100 years after their collection. This is to ensure that when the information is released  it will not reveal any sensitive information about living people, however it does make things more difficult for the researcher if they do not already know as far back as this.

If you get stuck in this first hundred years you can start to look for births marriages and deaths and also local council and parish records (although some opt out of this so it may not contain all details). This is where the family tree you already have written out may come in useful, to suggest  dates and names to start looking for in concrete "evidence".

A website like www.ancestry.com is very useful for listing censuses available and birth marriages and deaths, although the physical locations in which you search may be well or less well transcribed, it is a little pot-luck as to which.

Another website is http://www.familysearch.org which also has transcribed information going back to 1100 (a i have found, maybe earlier). Also check local and church records in person if you can as often information is not on the web, or can even have been transcribed wrongly causing some confusions.

Looking at Censuses will show you the addresses people lived at, who was living in a particular house and how they were related, ages and also jobs and occupations. Cross reference this information with births marriages and deaths, maybe newspaper articles from the time and you start to piece together the information.

It can seem quite confusing at first but the ways or referencing and researching soon become clear, and it can also become very addictive!

The First thing is to write down everything you know, every little detail.  Even if it doesn't seem important to you.  Start by talking to Mom, Dad, Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles etc.  A tape recorder is wonderful.  Check out family bibles.  People tend to put obits, birth announcements, & marriages in them.  Find out what year they immigrated and start checking ship records.  Several Immigrants came through Galveston, Tx, Ellis Island, New York & the Carolina's.  Check with the family and see who has the old family Bible.  Birth records are the best source of births before 1900.  Never give up.  Just when you think you have hit a brick wall, it will tumble down.  You will love finding family that are unknown to you at this time.  Good Luck

It takes some time at first but since you are retired, this will be a fun project for you.  You are also the right age to know some of the basic facts to get you started, not to mention it's a great contribution to your family.

Here are some charts to get you started:
http://genealogy.about.com/od/free_chart...
On the link Free Family Tree Charts, The Free Interactive Pedigree Chart is good.  The link Filing Out Genealogical  Forms is good with tips and such.  You will want the Family Group Sheet.
You go on the far left, your dad the next block to the right on top and your mom on the next block to the right on the bottom.  Next row of blocks is their parents, with the male in the top block.
Gather your supplies, one binder for dad's side and one binder for mom's side.  If you can afford it, get a subscription to www.ancestry.com. It's about $33.00 per month for the whole thing, newspapers, immigration records, etc.
So you've put your information down and your parents down, now you want your grandparents. If you can get to 1930 you will be doing good as you can find them on a census record. Some census years asked what year they immigrated so that will help you narrow down which ship manifest to find.  You probably can find their immigration ship manifest on Ancestry or maybe Ellis Island if they came through there.  Also, don't be strict on your spelling of names, first and last.  The census taker or port authority might not have understood what they said and wrote the names as best they could. 
www.familysearch.org is another good site to find other country records. They are adding new records, such as death certificates (the images) and it's in a beta area right now but worth the look. 
If you want to talk to others with a certain surname, go to www.genforum.com and put in the surname, upper right block.
Get stuck, come back and ask us.

Try the Irish section on www.cindislist.com
There is a useful section on adoptions. I know the law has changed in Ireland to allow adopted people to trace their families. It wasn't the case before. You should google on the internet for the names of Irish adoption laws and agency names.  Good luck.

If you can get organized early, like you are trying to do, is wonderful.  Eventually you might be like the rest of us and have piles of documents:)

1) Have a good genealogy software program where you can enter information and produce reports (I use FamilyTreeMaker)
2) Be diligent when you enter data and put your source (you will be asked for it)
3) Buy a file cabinet just for genealogy.
4) Make a folder for each family surname
5) Make a folder for each country/state (for general information)
6) Make subfolders on your PC for each surname (when you download or create a documents so you don't have to have a print out and therefore have to find a place to store it.
7) try to be as paperless as you can, by scanning non-original documents and putting them in your subfolder on the pc
8) BACK UP YOUR DATA (I lost pictures because I put them on a CD and the CD went bad)
9) Your genealogy program should have the ability to make a back up of its self. Do this and put it on a disk to store elsewhere.
10) Make a binder of your family information, instead of having folders, then store them on a book shelf.
11) Upload your genealogy data (GEDCOM) to an online site, such as gencircles or Ancestry.  This way, they backup the data and you have an alternate site with your data.
12) Try and stay organized throughout your research.  This way you don't get the inevitable "Piles" of information that you have to dig through when asked about it.

Good Luck and welcome to this great hobby.

Named as one of Time.com's 50 Top Websites of 2008, I would suggest visiting http://www.geni.com. This free site gives you the basic tools for diagramming your ancestry, and it also lets you invite others to contribute. If you're serious about tracing your lineage, you should probably stick with Ancestry.com, Family Search and the USGenWeb Project for their vast digital archives, but Geni makes it easier — and more fun — than ever to create and share your family tree.

Yes I have a lot of notebooks but if I want to go somewhere to research I only have to take one or two notebooks with me. I also use acid free covers for documents and pictures to protect them.

Ah, the paper monster can be very challenging, best to get a filing system early on in your research.

There are many different methods of organization for genealogy.  You will have to decide which method best fits you.  A filing cabinet is definitely in order.



Here is my system as an example:

SURNAME FILE:



I use an expandable file you can get at Walmart and write the surname you are researching:  ie SMITH.  Since you will be researching many diffferent surnames, I recommend a color coded system.  You can get those folder labels with the different color stripe on top.  Colored markers work well also.  Assign one color to each family.

INDIVIDUAL FILES:  Then using regular manila folders, start a folder for each family.  Again, keep the color system going throughout.



Husband last name, first name
Wife maiden name, first name

Children to these parents get there own file, you could indicate a number on the label pertaining to their birth order.

Place all pertinent material in their respective folders.

Creating an index of your material in each folder can be helpful as well, make a master file on your computer.

I also create folders for the location I am researching and folders for genealogy forms so they are handy when I need to grab one(Family Group sheets, etc).  You may be entering this information onto your computer, but a print out in your folder is good if  you are bringing your files to the library.

You will find that these files will begin to fill up very quickly and then your next dilemma will be what to take on your next research trip to the library.

I created a Research Binder with tabs for each surname.  I put blank paper in each tab or typed on the computer what I was missing and put that in the binder.  I would print out a report from my genealogy software for each family and put in the binder so I could refer back to it while researching.  Taking just the binder to the library is much better than lugging all your files around.  Then simply transfer the information you found at the library to your folders(after entering into your software program) and cross off your "finds" for the day.  Of course, you will probably add more items as well!

Now onto the computer files.  You will probably want to create subfolders on your PC according to surname.  You will find that you can scan documents that create a .pdf file(Adobe).  Scanning your documents contained in your folders is good back up system in case something ever happens to your hard copies.  Any files you create or download from the internet can go into these computer surname files.  Purchase a good backup drive.  You can get the flashdrives up to 4mg or higher at any computer store or Walmart, they hold a lot of info and are easy to carry with you, but keep in mind, anything electronic can fail, so it's good to have at least 2 backup systems.  Especially scan the old photos, you can do much with them once they are in electronic format.

Good Luck!

Kelly, this is totally standard.  NO one believes what you will accumulate, when you start researching.  I use 3 ring binders for charts (one book for a surname?), or "core" notebook for a standard 4 generation chart.  I build off that chart... with a new notebook for the gr grandparents who have enough info.  Letters and bulky things don't work well in binders.. those go into files.  Stick with surname/ alphabetical.. it gets confusing if you try some elaborate system.  As long as you stick to STANDARD FORMS (family group sheets), it can always go alphabetical, either in binders or manila folders. 
How much do I have???  uhh... 2  4 drawer cabinets, 5 or 6 milk crates, and then the stuff floating around, we won't talk about.



My goal this year is sifting through and getting more into binders. I bought a scanner/printer, to scan the real DOCUMENTS (not all my notes), but the scanner isn't scanning.



Let me yell this... ALWAYS ALWAYS back up your computer files, and store copies at a place aside from your house.  You can email a copy to yourself, if you use yahoo (it is stored on their server). Pretend you are going to have flood/fire/tornado/earthquake, and lose your paper copies and your computer.  I lost all my work, when a tree fell on a main power line, 200 miles from my house, and the surge fried my computer.



Do I have all of this done?? No.  I spend time here, more fun to chat with you guys.



oh I forgot... thumb drives are great, I have one that hooks on my keychain.  If I have to evacuate, I won't go anywhere without keys to drive.

If he is your biological child, and was given your surname at birth, and furthermore that you still have rights to the child: then yes, she would require your consent to effect a legal change of his name.

You should consult a lawyer to ensure she doesn't begin proceedings, if this is not your wish. As long as you maintain your rights as the father, she has no right to change his name without your consent.

Again, you should consult an attorney to ensure that the laws in your area are consistent with this.

I could be wrong but I don't think she can change his name without your permission. But as you've both moved on and found other partners and she is raising your son with this man, would it not be nice for your son to share the same name as everybody else in that household? - especially as she is getting married to him and they might have more children one day. If you really don't like the idea just tell her no. But think about what is best for your son, don't try and cause any bad feelings just because you can. You've moved on with your life - your ex has the right to move on with hers. :-)

In reality, most individuals who are of European descent can often be traced back to Charlemagne. (He was quite a prolific fellow with many wives and mistresses and fortunately for all of us, he kept good records of all his off spring.)



To be authentically connected however, you need to have documented proof.  Try to obtain as many copies of the various documents that prove your relationship by looking for birth, death,census and/or land documents and/or certificates.  Just keep working your way backwards.  Once you trace your lineage back to Europe you may find that foreign countries, such as Germany are very willing to help you.



We were able to trace my husbands family back to Charlemagne as well.  His lineage came through William the Conqueror  and yours may also. In my husbands case. most of the connections were through the women, and that is sometimes a little more challenging to identify.  Good luck,  who knows you may be related to us!!!

How did you find out you are a direct descendant of Charlemagne?
Was it via someones research; an on-line family tree or a published work?
If so, and, if you haven't done so already, obtain a paper copy of the tree/work, which should give you enough leads to make additional searches via those persons listed in the tree(s).

Search for Mountford's from Smallthorne, Staffordshire



I'm trying to research my family tree.  If anyone has information on...
Samuel Mountford = Sarah Ann Ferraday
Thomas Henry Mountford (1883) = Mary Ellen Heath (c1886)
Samuel Mountford (1909) = Nellie Dutton (1909)
...or any of their relations.
They originate from the Smallthornes area of Staffordshire (Moorlands, Leek, Norton le Moor)
Any help would be gratefully received as I live many miles away and cannot get to see the records.
Many thanks.

You are looking for information that is protected by privacy laws and which is not easily accessible. But you could access birth records and a staggering 1 billion records on-line if you have 50 bucks to spare to join.

Which family tree site is the best?



Ive started my family tree on genes reunited and I have about 500 names in it.  I'm thinking about becoming a paid member on there.  But that got me wondering which website is the best value for money.

I don't really want to pay loads, £20 or under would be ideal but I would go up to £30 at the most.

Obviously it would be easier for me if i didn't have to copy my entire tree from one site to another but I would do it if I can get more for my money!

I researched (successfully) for over 20 years, before I ever subscribed to ancestry.com (US), but finally did, for the census and other records there. I can't comment on what genesreunited has. 
I will comment on your other part... your family records are yours, can be stored on your own computer at home, and don't need to be online, anywhere, unless that is your choice. Having watched information copied, altered, "taken", etc.. I personally feel more comfortable not placing my database anywhere. 
This does not limit me in ANY way from sharing my information with relatives, either on an individual ancestor basis, or emailing them a gedcom of my file. I think long and hard on the second..because nearly 20 yrs of work, WAS taken by another person, not a relative, and blatantly ignored a copyright that was shown for the benefit of the family association. (the info was not from a gedcom but a printed book/draft). 
Research is based not in your tree or someone else's tree.. but the actual documents that are the core source of the facts. The value of any subscription service is those records. Posting your tree is an option, not a necessity.

Looks like you are getting into the search so I would buy a genealogy program and keep my complete records in it.  If you buy one like Family Tree Maker, you can upload it to their site.  Make your changes on your local copy and reupload the current data.
This way you have it, it's backed up, its yours and you can enter a lot more information in the program than you can keep with the online ones.

I would have saaid that your best bet would be  to use a genealogy program like Family Tree Maker , Roots Magic or Family Historian . You can then research usiung  on line sites such as Genes Reunited or Ancestry by submitting your tree as a gedcom . You cazn also submit to Rootsweb World Connect using your gedcom . You then control it yourself .

ask family first off, get as much info from them, mum and dad, and grandparents if they are still alive, write it all down, and then see how far back they can go. Dates for birth, marriages and deaths, if they know. Then sign up to sites like Genes Reunited and go from there. PLus all town halls have record offices i believe on Births, marriages and deaths certificates. which are useful because for not only dates, but what that person did as work, plus Genes reunited you can look at the census records and they can go back quite a long way. Beware that they charge so also look up genealogy sites that might not.

Like Conan Doyle writing a Sherlock Holmes book, start at the end (with yourself) and work backwards.

Then to each of your parents, and their parents. Hopefully both your parents and all 4 grandparents are alive to assist. They will remember their parents (your great grandparents) and maybe they also are possibly still alive and can tell you about their parents (you great great grandparents) and here you will most likely hit a brick wall and there will be no survivors of this generation. You need the info from your grandparents and great grandparents birth certs to help you. These are recorded on a local basis, so the place of birth recorded will give a clue where to look. Look also for marriage records to help.

As others suggested start with yourself and siblings, parents and grandparents.

I'd suggest getting a family tree software. There's a good free one available at the LDS website. http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default....

Contact your local genealogical society or LDS church (Google search). The LDS church has a complex archive and family research libraries with professional librarians and genealogists that will give you advice.  Most will offer classes and seminars on a semi-regular basis or have meetings you can attend.  This is an invaluable resource for learning the how-to's.  Your local library may also know of some workshops.

They will give you some ideas on how to get organized. Having an organized system will be very important for storing your documents. Very quickly you will have too much to keep track of in your head.

Kelly, sweetie, can we help you in your research?
Questions like these don't have a right or wrong answer are are just conversation.
There's a geat site for you called www.genforum.com. When you get to the first page, look near the top right and put in your last name. This will take you to a "board" concerning that surname and you can ask away all you like, maybe even finding a lost relative.

I have my grandmother's birth certificate.  It is thin and fragile.  She was born in 1903.  It gives her father's occupation (coal merchant) but not her mother's.  When I look at it and move it slightly, it crackles a little.  In a brown envelope I also have her wedding ring.

This isn't particularly old, but it's worth hearing:

I was accidently registered as Chinese when I was born. My dad only realised his mistake a year and a sodding half later and so on the 2nd of April 1987 I became British.

I might not have very old certificates, but I do have two of them.

Kind of tricky here... our buddies in the UK have an advantage on us, since birth/deaths began to be registered in 1837 (?).  Many states in the US will not have anything like this, since they were not required until after 1900.



Story about ex's mother- in the early part of the century.. persons in Oklahoma were called "Okies" which was derogatory.  Grandma actually gave birth 1927 at her parent's house in Oklahoma, on visit there. And has certificate.  When grandma went home, to Denison, Tx (a border town), she fibbed and said the baby was born at home, there in Denison.  Thus, there were two certificates.

I have two birth certificates, mine and my mothers.  My birth certificate - which is getting pretty old - 43 years.  The original (or first obtained certified copy) is quite ugly but I also have one the hospital made for my folks with little prints of my feet on them.  Then I have my mothers.  Hers is 65 years old.  It's black and white and not very fancy either, as most aren't.  It was folded up and kept in an old envelope made out of acid paper so it's very browned and creased.  Since it has such sentimental value, I adore it.  I've scanned it in my computer for attachment to my family tree so other members of my family can treasure it as well.  Someday, my mother will leave me my grandparent's marriage license and her marriage license as well.  I do have scanned copies of them at present.  They are also attached to my tree.

The best sites depends on where you are and who you are. No sense sending you to Cherokee.org if you are Chinese. Libraries are ALWAYS useful, especially if you live in the county your great great great grandfathers settled in 1842. Here is my stock answer:

There are over 400,000 free genealogy sites. I have links to some huge ones, below, but you'll have to wade through some advice and warnings first.

If you didn't mention a country, we can't tell if you are in the USA, UK, Canada or Australia. I'm in the USA and my links are for it.



If you are in the USA, 
AND most of your ancestors were in the USA, 
AND you can get to a library or FHC with census access, 
AND you are white
Then you can get most of your ancestors who were alive in 1850 with 100 - 300 hours of research. You can only get to 1870 if you are black, sadly. Many young people stop reading here and pick another hobby.

No web site is going to tell you how your great grandparents decorated the Christmas tree with ornaments cut from tin foil during the depression, how Great Uncle Elmer wooed his wife with a banjo, or how Uncle John paid his way through college in the 1960's by smuggling herbs. Talk to your living relatives before it is too late.

You won't find living people on genealogy sites. You'll have to get back to people living in 1930 or so by talking to relatives, looking up obituaries and so forth.

Finally, not everything you read on the internet is true. You have to be cautious and look at people's sources. Cross-check and verify.



So much for the warnings. Here is the main link.

http://www.tedpack.org/yagenlinks.html

That page has links, plus tips and hints on how to use the sites, for a dozen huge free sites. Having one link here in the answer and a dozen links on my personal site gets around two problems. First, Y!A limits us to 10 links in an answer. Second, if one or more of the links are popular, I get "We're taking a breather" when I try to post the answer. This is a bug introduced sometime in August 2008 with the "new look".

You will need the tips. Just for instance, most beginners either put too much data into the RWWC query page, or they mistake the Ancestry ads at the top for the query form. I used to teach a class on Internet Genealogy at the library. I watched the mistakes beginners made. The query forms on the sites are NOT intuitive.

Here are the prices of Ancestry subscriptions.
Monthly - $19.95, or $239.40 per year.
Quarterly - $50.85, or $203.40 per year.
Yearly - $155.00, saving $84.40 over monthly per year or $48.40 over quarterly per year.
Ancestry owns Geneology.com (a paid site) and rootsweb.com (a free site).

Advantage of going to the library: Using their subscription is free.
Disadvantages of going to the library:
Your library may not subscribe to a genealogy site.
You are limited to a certain amount of time on the computer.
You have to pay for copying documents.
You have to pay for renting any Census Records the library does not have on hand.
You have to leave when the library closes.

Of course, you can travel to the various locations to research your family history.
How much are you willing to spend on travel expenses?
Flying/driving, motel, gas, food, boarding a pet, all cost money. 
Can you afford to take that many days off from work?
Are you willing to give up your vacation time for family history research?
Your family will love sitting a boring motel room while you're in the library doing research.

Been there, done all of that and will not be doing any of that again.

A paid subscription is the best way, for me, to do research.
I can research in the comfort of my own home, in my old granny looking housedress, if I like.
I can stay up as late as I want and research any time of the day or night.
I have access to Census, birth, death, marriage, immigration records, as well as, other subscribers trees.
And, my family vacation time is reserved for a family vacation.

I tried a few "free" sites and found them to be lacking in on-line resources.
I'm very happy with Ancestry and feel it is a good investment

I don't work for Ancestry, I'm not promoting my own site and I'm not trying to sell you anything.
I just thought a few facts would help you make a more informed decision, concerning subscribing to a paid site.

check all of the newspapers near that area for that time period.  Trains were a new kind of transportation and big big news (like space shuttle big) and an accident would have been widely reported.  The local paper would most likely have more details about the victims but you may be able to at least confirm the event in neighboring papers.

Your local library should be able to help you get in touch with other libraries if traveling to the library where the event took place is not possible  or they could suggest alternative sources for you.

researching genealogy is often times a long and slow process and occasionally you won't see results for a long time and then suddenly you get hit with a bonanza of info and all of your hard work pays off.

enjoy the adventure of the search, we don't always complete it when we expect to.

there are a few places on the web but i cant find any links at the moment. 
its all due to your family's occupation many years ago or where they lived mainly.
E.g if your name was baker or cook, your ancestors were bakers. so the villagers would say 'the bakers live there' for example.
you can see a link with most names.
or if your surname is little, your family was a short family.

do you see where im going with this?

sorry for my crap explanations.

by being a little detective you can do this to a point, facebook is good as you can limit your search to maybe several people, dont just go for the end product as that is difficult maybe search the group of friends and / or family names you remember and get closer to finding that someone, depends  why you are searching , if the person is in public anonymity laws, etc very hard but possible with good work, i bet i can find anyone in public, within reason. Friends reunited although that's struggling (personal opinion, due to facebook) final put the person name on things like this, if allowed)

Ancestory - how do you research your family tree to before records began?



I watched something on tv some time ago , thee was a guy on it claiming he was some distant descendant of william tell so we are talking the fourteenth century!
another claimed he was a descendant of einstien, and there were several others - all descendants of famous people in history , some going back as far as  the twelth century or 3oth descendants etc 
now iv been doing my family tree and most online records only go back to the 17th or 18th century , i may be wrong but i think birth records also only started 100 or so years ago , 
so were these people lying?
how can anyone researc ancestors from hundreds of years ago - even professionals - where would they find the information

In general you can't go back before written records, although written records go back further than you'd think .. the doomsday book for instance. Royalty can  determine their ancestors for far longer than you and I, because most of us are descended from 'nobody's' who lived out their lives in relative obscurity. The good thing about this is that unlike royalty, our ancestral brothers probably never slept with our ancestral sisters. It's bound to be easier to find your ancestors when they all slept in the same bed !!

Some researchers are name collectors.  They do not research or get documentation and use others' family trees that may or not be accurate.
Generally, if you have English ancestors, the research is easier than, say German ancestors, because there are more records available.

Almost all my ancestors came after the Civil War, so records before the trip across the pond are hard to come by.

I guess the point here is, make your tree as accurate as you can and take those with Alexander the Great as an ancestor with a large grain of salt.

Birth records are handy and one of the most definitive tools in the genealogists toolkit. But they aren't the beginning of written records. Before birth records there were lots of other written accounts of families, depending on the time, place, and status of the individuals.  Parish records and family Bibles can be quite helpful. People in certain occupations had accounting, trade, or guild/union records. Muster rolls, land records, and court documents can be helpful.  Some areas had censuses. For royal bloodlines those records would have been meticulously kept.



But yeah, there's a lot of misinformation out there too. Not everyone that says they're related to so and so has actually done the research for themselves and verified it.

No way are all records online.  Documentation is very important in genealogy.  Some family lines are better documented than others.  There are courthouse records, cemetery inscriptions, historical libraries, church records, etc.  If you pay for a subscription to Ancestry.Com to obtain records, what you are paying for is a convenience.  It saves you from traveling all over the country and obtaining those partiular  records yourself, paying for hotel or motel expense, eating out expense and gasoline expense.  Since they are not all online, you have to do some traveling and letter writing.

However, you are corredt at being skeptical when a person makes claims without documents to back it up.  Thirty years ago I felt it was great that so many people were getting into genealogy. Sharing of information would help everyone.  Although the internet has been helpful in providing a lot of documents it is not the only source of documentationl.  People have been doing genealogy long before the internet. Also, too many people think the family trees submitted to various websites are gospel fact and they are not.  There are errors in online submittted trees. You might see different info on the same people from different subscribers.  Then you will see repeatedly the same info on the same people from different subsribers.  That is no guarantee it is correct. A lot of people are copying without verifying.

You can make up a family tree and it will be accepted by any of the family history websites, free or not free.  Those websites have absolutely no way of verifying all the information in family trees.

Yea, I've seen some trees that go back to Adam and Eve.

There are various reasons why they might have been able to trace their line that far back. The main reason is that their ancestor was famous.  Genealogy has been around for hundreds of years, though the start of it was to keep track of royal blood lines.
Einstein wasn't really that long ago.  William Tell though would take some heavy research.  It's possible that someone did an ancestry on William Tell, even 100 years after his death and it survived.  Heraldry was in the olden days as genealogy is today.

It all depends on which country your searching in.  For example, I have researched my father's family back to 1720 and have found documentation for births, marriages, deaths and land holdings.  My 6th great grandfather was born in Germany in 1720 and I have a copy of his baptismal records from Germany which also list his parents' names.



Generally, before the 1780's you must rely upon church records and family bibles for documentation.



Land holdings are also a way to trace people back to the 1600's and early 1700's as land purchases were recorded and often families would "gift" land to their sons when they were married and these would also be recorded.  It's interesting to note that although births, marriages and deaths weren't recorded, land holdings were recorded because they were taxable.  So, if your family owned property you can almost always find them.

Aristocratic families have pedigrees going back centuries, so if you can link on to one of those your ok. Many simply find a tenuous link and go with it regardless of how accurate it might be. I guess it makes them happy, even though it bores the breeches off the rest of us LOL

The "will date" is the date the will was signed. Until the will is filed, it's just a piece of paper. But each will replaces the ones written earlier. So when the will it is filed it will say "The Last Will and Testament of John Doe, dated whatever date, as amended on suchandsucha date". If someone comes up with a will with a more recent date, they can contest the one that is filed and it will be known by its date. That's how the Court keeps track of all the disparate pieces of paper and knows which one is determinant.

Pack Name Meaning

1) English (Kentish): from a medieval personal name, Pack, possibly a survival of the Old English personal name Pacca, although this is found only as a place name element and appears to have died out fairly early on in the Old English period. The Middle English personal name is more likely to be a derivative of the Latin Christian name Paschalis (see Pascal).



2) Jewish (Ashkenazic): metonymic occupational name for a wholesale trader, from German Pack ‘package’ (see Packer).



3) Anglicized form of Dutch Pak.

Theodore

English: from the French form of the Greek name Theodoros, composed of the elements theos god + doron gift. The name was popular among early Christians and was borne by several saints. Cognates: French: Théodore. German: Theodor. Dutch: Theodoor. Hungarian: Tivadar. Russian: Fyodor. Jewish (Aramaic): Todos.

In the I Book of Chronicles Jabez is a well-respected man, an ancestor in the lineage of the kings tribe of Judah whose prayer to God for blessing was answered (1 Chronicles 4:9-10). Moreover the author paused to give Jabez a place of honour in the long list of Kings and lineage.

"And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, 'Oh that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!' So God granted him what he requested." (NKJV)

The name Jabez sounds like the Hebrew word for pain, and was given to him because of the pain his mother suffered while bearing him.

Is this girl my relative?



ok i think im prob in the wrong place but 2 years ago my family had a call out of the blue from a girl aged 23 saying that she was a long lost sister of my mum and aunt (my grandad it seems had an affair with his Nigerian maid) everything seems to add up as he was away at the time the girl was concieved and born however as my grandad has passed away and he is the only one with the answers 
i dont know where to turn or where i can obtain her birth certificate or something  to prove my grandad is the father.
The girl still hasnt sent any documents over after a lot of promises so this is stopping my family welcoming her as our own obviously being Nigerian you hear of these scams so we are all on tenterhooks but feel there is def truth in the matter.

I would treat this with a great deal of suspicion, Gemma.  Unfortunately Nigeria is the source of a great many scams, some of them very original.  I have heard of some of the scammer's using genealogy sites to ingratiate themselves with their victims by matching data up.  If you are dead set on exploring the possibility I would be asking her for all possible information.  e.g place of conception, how they met etc etc.
You didn't mention as to where the affair may have happened.  If it was out of his native country perhaps you may be able to check his passport to see if he was in the specified location at the time.
I would be wary of accepting any documentation such as birth certificates that she may provide as the scammers are very good at creating these things.
Of course if she starts to ask for money to "assist" her to prove herself then I would definitely run a mile.

Then I would be asking her if she would be prepared to submit to a DNA test.  A comparison between your mother and her would soon show if they had a common paternity.

If she was born 23 years ago, she'll definitely have some paperwork, even in Nigeria!  If she's really sure she's a relative, she should be able to supply some documentary evidence to support her assertion.  Sounds to me like she's trying to either scam you, or fraudulently get British citizenship, so I'd be extremely wary of her.

What an awful situation to be in. This happened to me, my dad was serving in egypt. The "sister" was born and I met her 50 years later. I cant prove or disprove if she is my sister as my dad died. Fortunately I spoke to her mum, who had her adopted. She had nothing to gain by claiming to be my sister so I welcomed her to the family. I Cant say I have family feeling for her but I do feel sorry for her. Anyway with your situation the only way to find out for sure is a DNA test. If you cant afford one perhaps you could try one of these chat shows that will help. Besta luck what you do. These men have a lot to answer for.lol.x

Scam.  It's a scam.  No doubt about it - it's a scam.

Get her to fax over copies of her birth certificate, and any other paperwork - don't pay for copies - she's the one with the claim - she can pay.  If they all look genuine - then she can pay for a DNA test to prove her links to your family.

But it won't get that far - she'll ask you for money to clear up some legal stuff in Nigeria - about £20,000 would be about right.

I would contact this website & ask for their advice - they bait the scammers.

a birth certificate may not provide the documentation you want.  different countries have different laws concerning naming fathers when the parents aren't married.  So it's possible that he may not even be named.

one way your family can be sure is to do a dna test of your mom and aunt and this woman.  DNA will tell you if she shares a parent with your mom and aunt.  Of course this would only work if your mom and aunt are their father's bio children.  I am assuming that they are.

Until this woman is willing to provide proof then your family has no obligation or reason to welcome her into their lives.

Time and travel.  Research is not simply opening any book in the genealogical section of a library...it's time consuming.  I have spent hours, days, weeks...yes, years, searching out certain of my elusive ancestors.  If a professional genealogist has to travel, say to the Library in Virginia...it's costly.  Documented records are essential, you'd not want some back-door 'genealogist' to whip out your pedigree. In other words, you pay for what you receive.

Serious genealogy involves a lot more than searching a few internet sites. We have to search in archives, travel to courthouses and libraries, send away for records, hire translators, pay for researchers to help us in places where we can't travel...and we still try to make a living from it. It depends on how remote the location is, but when you start looking at the former communist countries in Europe, it gets very pricey. If we offered "cheaper services", what would you want from us that we don't already do? Every genealogy is "custom" because every family is unique. We go where the records take us and charge accordingly. You pay by the hour because that's how we work. There are no guarantees and the harder the search, the more we earn our salaries. It's not the last 200 years where we earn our keep, it's the 700 years (or more) beyond that.

If it were all that easy, everyone would do it. This is a specialized field and it requires a lot of education and experience. If you chintz, you get what you pay for.

I think the price is for the extraordinary access to indexed documents that they have. Ancestry.com pales next to what a certified genealogist has available. I honestly think they are cheap compared to other professionals.

My mechanic charges me $80/hr, my doc charges $110 for 5 min. Genealogists average $29/hr (see source), mine charges only $10/hr. and she is certified. She does several people at the same time. She has access to obscure courthouse, newspaper, and cemetery records that genealogists share among themselves. When she goes on a trip for a specific job she copies and indexes the records there to share with other genealogists.

Genealogists lecture at genealogical society meetings. Genealogical societies publish hundreds of well researched reports each month. My genealogist volunteers at a local family history center (Mormons), so I can ask her questions when I find the time. Free! She doesn't charge me for whatever I find on her advice so long as I mention the record is already discovered, in my next request.

it takes ages and all the costs involved are time,, travel, subscriptions, effort, eye strain (!), record keeping etc etc. ive been doing mine for over 3 years now and in all that time, the furthest back ive got on any of my branches is late 1700s and even that hasnt been properly confirmed by original records, only internet ones. so imagine the effort involved in researching fully, it takes ages

Like anything else.. you get what you pay for.  ANYONE who is a professional genealogist does so, because they truly love the challenge of what they do, and are more interested in doing it well.. instead of making lots of money.



You also have to have a good understanding of what is involved. Anyone can pull up websites, look up other people's published "trees", etc. The problem with this?? It is fast, but a high percentage of what is found this way, is flat garbage. It is also true that a very high percentage of factual records (wills, court records, so forth) are NOT online.. the only way to get them, is going to the courthouse, in person (meaning..time and expense). Last.. there may be records of 4 John Smith's.. and it comes down to knowing how to interpret them. 
The internet fools a lot of people into thinking it is easier than it really is. And.. yes, GOOD genealogists will find things online that the novice won't even think to find, even if they are there. 
It does take time and effort to be a GOOD researcher. A GOOD researcher can find things faster if they know the best places to look, that someone without skills won't find.  IF you think about it.. there are times when that would actually save you, against what you would spend to find it yourself. 
Bottom line- good ones are worth it.

How do I find if our family is entitled to use a coat of arms?



There are two different coats of arms for our family surname, but how do I find if my family line is entitled to use which, if any, of them.
I have looked on the website of the college of arms, but they don't seem too keen on people tracing their family history (unless of course you are stinking rich).
Most of the websites that offer family coat of arms searches are useless, they show a coat of arms but, it may not be related to your particular family.
If anybody knows of a more historically accurate site I would be grateful.

The college of arms has extensive genealogical histories which they do not share. Some have been published in books that modern heralds collect, there are hundreds and the accuracy is questionable (Burke's General Armory is one that gives a short descendancy with most arms). The college used to have visiting heralds tracking the descendancy of armingers but now there are just too many. You must trace your ancestry as far back as you can and submit it with the application fee (about $4,000. for Americans) and hope it connects with their records. The arms you entitled to may not be the ones from your surname.



Ancestry.com's Family Tree Maker CD# 368 "British and American Coats of Arms" has 7 indexed books with descendant histories for the armingers including Burke's General Armory. I can't find that CD for sale right now on ancestry or family tree maker, watch for it on eBay.

there's a web on heraldry somewhere but it seems to me that every surname has a coat of arms.

I am glad to see that you understand that just because a coat of arms was granted to someone with your surname that doesn't mean it has anything to do with you.

The only thing you can do is to trace your family tree.  If you find you are directly descended from a man that was granted a coat of arms, you can send your family tree to the College of Arms and they might grant you one. Only the oldest son is entitled to his father's.  However, all the sons are entitled to one but with some differences.

Actually, you might find more than one in your family tree. That doesn't mean you are entitled to any one of them.  It just means that if you have a book printed or even published on your family history, it would be quite legitimate for you to put pictures of your ancestors' coats of arms in your book.

If you are an American and you have any English lines that goes back to early colonial days in the American South, you have an excellent chance of having several in your family tree.  The Jamestown colonist, particuarly, mostly came from titled families.



That's probably why is takes a backseat to the later settlement at Plymouth Rock. Jamestown had a hard time getting off the ground.  Those gentlemen were not as adaptable to hard work and hardships that the Mayflower colonist were.



Actually some in the South have the ones their ancestor brought over from England 300-400 years ago and they aren't those dinky little walnut plaques.  As a rule, they don't display them.  Afterall, they aren't the least bit good for buying groceries or GASOLINE.

find out to whom those two coats of arms were granted (who they were given to) and then do your family history and see if you are descended from either of them.



DO NOT TRY AND CREATE A CONNECTION.



To be able to CLAIM a coat of arms you have to be able to PROVE legally that you are a descendant.

I found this for you,
Surname: Bown
This unusual and interesting surname has two possible origins, the first of which is Norman, French, and derives from a nickname for a "good" person, from the Old French "bon", good, from the Latin "bonus". The name was introduced into England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and may have been bestowed in a complimentary or ironic sense on a "good" person. The second possible source is also from a nickname, of Anglo-Saxon origin, which is found recorded mainly in the north of England, as "Bain", and was given to an exceptionally tall, lean person. The derivation is from the Olde English pre 7th century "ban", bone, in northern dialects the long "a" was preserved, whereas in the southern dialect it was charged to an "o" sound. The modern variants of the surname from both sources include Bone, Bunn, Bonn, Boon(e), and Ba(yne). One Roger Bone is recorded in the 1273 Hundred Rolls of Kent. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Edward le Bon, which was dated 1204, The Oxfordshire Curia Rolls, during the reign of King John, known as 'Lackland', 1199 - 1216. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. 
Hope this helps.

This will be easier if you've seen how a film camera or a film projector works. If all you've ever known is digital and VHS, bear with me.

A microfilming service lays a document - a newspaper, for instance - out flat, then takes a picture of each page. Then they make positive copies of the negatives and roll them up on a spool.

You go to the library and ask for the microfilm for the New York Times for Jan 01 - Jan 15, 1957. You put it into a microfilm reader, which works like a movie projector, except the "screen" is much smaller and they don't sell popcorn in the library.



Some microfilm readers project onto a white desk top, some onto a glass screen. Either way, the projector makes the newspaper page big enough to read. Most readers have an attachment that lets you print the portion of the page you are reading onto regular office paper (8 1/2 x 11). Some of the early microfilms show you a black background and white text.

With microfilm you can get about a thousand pages into a roll of film that fits into a box 4 inches square and an inch wide.

If you've seen film negatives, you know they are small, but you can have enlarged prints made that are 8x10 - or 20x30, if you are a commercial photographer. Microfilm is the same idea; small original, but you can enlarge it to look at it.

Microfiche is the same idea, but instead of a roll of film you get a collection of "cards" with 20 - 40 pages per card. Most, not all microfilm readers will read fiche as well.

The census taker could have misspelled his name. He could have been registered with his middle name and not his first name. The person who transcribed his name from the census into the Ancestry data base could have misspelled it. He may not have been living with his family. All sorts of reasons he doesn't show up. Keep digging.

Your great grandfather's obituary would most probably appear in a newspaper, but whether it actually mentioned suicide or some phrase like "self-inflicted gun shot-wound" would depend upon the practices of the particular local newspaper in which the obit appeared as well as what your family was willing to say about the incident.



Case in point: during the early 1980s, I was a young general assignment reporter for a small daily newspaper in Texas, so in addition to my usual police, school, and business beats, I  occasionally pulled duty at the obituary desk.  Most obituaries were written by the families of the people who died unless they were very prominent, but a reporter also read the material and occasionally made additions and corrections as necessary.  I particularly remember my first obituary assignment--trying to gather information on a woman who had killed herself.  The newspaper's policy at that time was to write that suicides had died "after a short illness", a phrase meant to spare the family additional pain.



In case the Tredegar Library doesn't have microfilm of newspapers dating back in 1965, you might also bookmark the following web page, which has links to all Welsh newspapers and media outlets:

UK answer.
You would need to contact the local newspapers archive library, situated in John Frost Square in Newport, the phone number is 01633 656656, they have the information. I have just phoned them for you and they said that is the only place that you can access the archives for the newspaper. This is the web site for the local newspaper that I contacted for you.

if he was a public figure or well known in the community it might.

Suicide was considered very shameful and if he was a religious person then the family may have covered it up so he could have a funeral service.  Even in 1965 many clergy would refuse to have a funeral for a suicide.

otherwise look for obituaries, not news stories and don't expect suicide to  be mentioned.

Most genealogists, and certainly the top 10 on this board, are warm, wise, witty, well-read and, above all, devilishly handsome.



There are a couple of trolls lurking about who are frigid, stupid, ignorant and, above all ugly; ugly in mind, body and spirit. Some of them are so ugly they earn beer money by posing for the masks you see in the bargain bin at Halloween. Their only pleasure comes from trying to annoy their betters. So, they give thumbs down whenever they can.

Just ignore them. We do.

Once in a while a teen, who has been misled by the ease at which he can download a music file or find a picture of Paris Hilton naked, thinks there is a magic web site that will let him type his name, then give him a 12-generation pedigree chart, complete with a family coat of arms for each surname. When we tell him that genealogy doesn't work that way, and that you have to research to find your family tree, he gives a thumbs-down out of frustration.

Once in a while it is because the answer is wrong. I used to give thumbs-down to wrong ones when someone asked about cousins. If the correct answer was "first cousin once removed" and someone answered "second cousin", I'd give them a  thumbs down. I've stopped since the troll patroll started giving thumbs down all over the place.

I get tons of them, but I believe it is from those who are less educated than me on the subject or, from those who cannot accept the truth.  My responses may not always be the most tactful, but they are factual.  Some people just cannot handle the truth, or just don't like the truth because they feel that something should be a certain way just because they want it to be that way.

their answer may not be complete, it may not be wrong but it may not be entirely correct either.  or it may contain misleading info along side a correct answer.

the people who gave a thumbs down may not like the answer given or may not know the real answer but think they do.

some people when they answer a question give thumbs down to all other answers.

don't let the thumbs down bother you.  If you gave what you believed was an honest and factual answer then you did your best.

http://www.seanruad.com/  shows 5 townlands called Lissaniska and 2 called Lugaphuill in Co Mayo.  Both names feature in the Castlebar area, in the civil parish of Drum, barony of Carra.



http://gov-reports.net/database-access.p...  tells me Marriage Records Available for  Luke Madden from Castlebar, but there is a fee to join.

Castlebar library is closed on Mondays, but I will phone to ask if there is any more information there, on Tuesday. They have old newspapers on microfilm, and it is possible they have copies of parish records too.

update:  Castlebar library don't have birth/marriage/death details before 1837, but there are various documents which may not take you much further back, but may add details to what you have already.  Lissaniska and Lugaphuill are adjoining areas on the map of  Belcarra (6 miles from Castlebar.  In the library, they said that people back then mostly married within 5 miles or so of their home, so we looked up Lynch within the parish of Drum, and there was a James Lynch of Roslahan Lower who may have been Margaret's father.  There were Maddens in the parish too  -  Stephen in Corrabaun, John in Drumcorrabaun, Martin in Elmhall and Laurence and Thomas with separate holdings in Lissaniska. It is possible that all of these were brothers with land subdivided from the farm of their father. I have details from Griffiths Valuations 1855 showing how much land there was in each of these allotments, the rent they paid etc.

I went to Elmhall cemetery, and any legible gravestones were of other families.  There were a lot of stone markers showing where a grave is, with no engraving, just a stone.  I feel these date to famine times when there was no food and no money.  I have spoken to someone who knows where there is a list of everybody in the graveyard, and she will check for your family names.

You do not allow email, but if you email me with contact details, I can let you have what I have found already, and what may be found yet.  There may be parish records or even school records available.

It can depend where you area of interest is!

If you join a family history society they generally have forums you can join.

The Rootsweb mailling lists can be very busy depending on your county and there are some general ones for England, Wales and Scotland. Even though the UK is 'one' country -  genealogy in Scotland is quite different to that of England.
