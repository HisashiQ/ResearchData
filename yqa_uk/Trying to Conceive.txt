Unfortunately I can't tell you the answer to this because AF's have a mind of their own :-( They come when they want to, when we are just about getting our hopes up that this is our month then the wicked witch comes. If you've been tracking your ovulation then you can expect your period 14 days after that. This may help to give you more of an idea when AF is going to arrive. Baby dust to you and me :-)

The withdrawal method can work. There is only going to be sperm released with pre-ejaculate IF the man has had an orgasm a short time ago and some sperm have survived in his urethra, this is unlikely since a man will normally pee by then. The withdrawal method when used correctly can be effective, most of the time when it fails it is due to the man not pulling out in time.

And yes, I have done my research.

If you read their other questions, you will see that the are actually ttc.
you will also see that their on average 16 years old, been with their boyfriend a few months and what they really want to know is



"i want to get pregnant, will my boyfriend pulling out stop me from conceiving?"

of course not always the case, but nevertheless there usually always stupid.

Hi! First off, just relax. you stressing can and will make your period late. how old are you? your stomach would not be growing yet. take another test it usually takes closer to a month of your first missed period to be able to tell if your are pregnant. but when you take a pregnancy test the most accurate time is to take it in the morning when you first go to the bathroom. if your test still comes out neg and you dont get your period go to the dr and let them know whats going on. i hope this helped.

if you were pregnant you wouldn't be showing so early.
i'd wait until you were two weeks late and then do another test, if it is still negative and your period doesn't start within a couple of days go and see your doctor.
a lot of things can delay your period, even if you are regular there can still be times when you are late for no apparent reason.
most home pregnancy tests can now be preformed at any time of the day and as early as the day your period is due, they can give false readings sometimes, so do another one just to clarify.

Hi,



It could have been that the test you used was too early to detect the pregnancy hormone that was in your system.



I would try testing again say first thing in morning or buy a test tomorrow and test tuesday morning.

If that comes up negative then go to GP and ask him to give you a blood test.

Good luck!

Your period can still come, sometimes it's late even 7 or 8 days. But ther's a test they I 've heard it's very good that you can see results as early as 8 to 10 days after conception. check earlypregnancy.com and if yu don't want to wait a blood test will show as early as 5 days!
I hope it helps!

samantha you post this question EVERY night.
i don't want to be horrible but we are not online pregnancy tests, nor are we psychic.
I have read that you are in a long distance relationship with someone you met online and that you are still a teen, may i suggest you see your Gp. Get a blood test to check fr pregnancy, then get an STD test. sexually transmitted infections can cause brown discharge and cramping. I really don't think you are ready to be a parent.

just go see your Gp for answer theres nothing we can tell you

About getting pregnant?!!! ?



Well, to start off i have a off track period and i get it like 4 or 5 times a year and i never know when its coming and also it stays for a month or so....but also i just bleed out of the blue, like if i wasnt on my period, i would just bleed. this sucks because i never know when im getting it. Also, when having sex with my husband it will bleed...and now we are trying to have a baby and i am 24 yr. old and him also, but its not working. Do you think it has a lot to do with my period? Also, if helpful, i have no children and i use to be on the birth control shot, which is called the "Depro Vera" but that was like 5 years ago and i only was on it for 1 year. Thank you all! God Bless! xoxo

I'd see ur doctor. You could have a hormonal imbalance that causes you to have funny periods. The bleeding during sex doesn't sound normal so I'd definitely get that checked out.

Some people have bad reactions to that shot. It sounds like you are having issues with hormones. I have that problem the only hormone that is normal is my thyroid. It can be difficult to conceive and carry when you have problems with hormones. But it can happen. It took me almost six years but now I am 25 weeks with a healthy baby boy. Get checked out by your Doctor to make sure everything is ok. If it doesn't happen right away try not to get discouraged, it takes some people longer than others to conceive. Good luck I hope it happens for you soon.

You will need to discuss your problem with a doctor, because if you're not getting periods, then your system might need 'rebooting' as it were :) The b/c pill is not good for regulating your cycle, so you should stop taking that and perhaps ask about Provera from your doctor. Also, get them to run some tests which should be covered by your insurance as they are 'diagnostic'. The first few tests to do would be: FSH, Estradiol and Progesterone, and maybe TSH too.

Ovulation is always around 14 days before your period, and if you Google 'EWCM' then maybe you'll be able to chart your cervical mucus patterns. EWCM appears right before ovulation, so that can be very helpful. But you should talk to your doctor for sure. Good luck!

Implantation bleeding typically occurs 6-12 dpo.  It is typically much lighter than a normal period lasting typically 1-3 days in is brown or light pink in color.  I would go ahead and test to be sure.  Good luck!

if it was just light spotting, rather than a normal "chunky" (ew) period,  it could be implantation bleeding, i had it for a week with my first (and thought my period was early) and 15 days with my second.  It tends to occur around a week after ovulation!

Fingers crossed for ya!

i had an implantation bleed and it was kinda like a period to be honest. well in all honesty i thought that it was a period. i suffer from poly cyctic ovaries and was told i would not be able to get pregnant so when i did i did not know for at least 9 week. my bleed was very heavy for the first day with period like symptoms but the day after it was very light and almost gone. then about 2 week later i found out i was 9 week pregnant. if you are having very bad pains or very heavy bleeding then i would suggest a trip to the hospital just to be on the safe side.

Ovulation test strips?



I have ordered some ovulation test strips as my periods are very infrequent and I have absolutely no idea when I am ovulating. Doctor has said everything is ok with my test results etc.... what I want to know is, do I test once or twice a day? morning, night or both? Are they reliable?

They say to take them after 3 in the afternoon. I would get a basal thermometer and start taking your temps upon waking in the morning. Also pay very close attention to your cervical mucus that will give you clues to when your getting ready to ovulate. They have a book out called Taking Charge Of Your Fertility. Awesome book. I got mine yesterday and it is really informative.

They say afternoon is best.  I, on the other hand, test a few times a day or I miss the surge.  I also am one that gets light lines prior to when I get a positive so I know a + is coming.  When I was only testing once a day I missed it.  The +'s have been in sync with my CM  and cervical position and a few days later my temp will go up so I know they are accurate for me.  With the internet ones, keep in mind only part of the line has to be as dark or darker.  Sometimes mine resembles a rainbow (if that makes sense) and as long as the darkest part matches you are getting a +.

If you have not got the faintest idea you should start using ovulation tests from the day you stop your period. I buy bundles of 20 every month from www.babymad.com for like 7 quid and they work excellent!! I take 2 a day morning and night to find my surge! I also Monitor my temp and my cervix (should be SHOW: Soft High Open and Wet) and my Cm as well.

I have heard women with erratic periods using the clear blue fertility Monitor to help them conceive and say its worth its weight in gold. New they are 100 quid but seen them on ebay for 40 quid.

Brown dicharge for over a week!?



hello everybody, im just wondering if anybody can relate to this, my periods have been pretty messed up these past few months and range from between 28-48 day cycles, this week was around 40days when i started getting spotting/brown discharge which means i will start bleeding within the hour, it started off pinkish brown then turned to a brown/ cream for 8 days now!!!! im am TTC#2 so i though for the first few days 'yes this could be implantation bleeding' but its lasted so much longer than ppl have said, my periods usually only last 4-5days, im not on any birth control and havnt been for over 2 years, what is this 'bleeding' if anybody has had it before, this has never happened to me before instead of a period!! help!!

Brown discharge could be an anovulatory bleed, I had this when I was breastfeeding my son last year, because I wasn't ovulating I didn't have a "proper" red bleed-period, just a little bit of brown spotting once a month.

It might be worth having your hormone levels checked (with a blood test) as that might be why you're not getting positive OPKS - you're not ovulating.  If this is the case there are medications like Clomid which can help.

You need to think about what would happen if either one of you or both met and fell and love with someone, where would that leave the baby? How many parents can one child have? Will your respective partners be able to deal with the situation? I think you should sit down and work it out very very seriously

Wow. Well I dont know how old you are but if you are on the younger side then this might not be a good idea. You have plenty of time to find 'the one'. What if he comes along after all this? What will he think? A lot of people wouldnt be ok stepping into this situation. You will have a baby, but could be causing future relationship problems down the road. If you are serious or on the older side and dont feel like you have much time left to have a child, this might be an OK solution. You should definetely talk to a doctor or a specialist first though. This could be much harder to do than you think. Will you live together? Who gets all the rights? Lots of things that could cause problems in raising the child.. Think of the child. Not you.

i think its a nice idea in principal. love is love. friendship is always the best place to start anyway. the problem is that its impossible to predict how Future complications may ruin things... but that's true of any relationship in any case. so maybe if its feels right go for it! if it feels good in your heart and you have really thought it through.... when something is right, you know it. but do it the natural way definitely! you never know how you may feel afterwards. maybe something will blossom from your friendship. my husband and i were best friends for 2 years before something 'blossomed' shall we say....good luck! =)

I ended up marrying my best friend!! The way i see it is people who are in a relationship, have children and then break up. You will have an agreement between the two of you before it comes to that situation.

Its really up to you how you become pregnant, remember it may take a while to become pregnant and then you would have to have sex more than once. If you had an insemination kit would it feel a bit clinical?



Considering you are 35 this may be your only option to have a baby, i say go for it what ever way you use.
Good Luck

i have four parents as my 'real' parents split when i was young and both remarried - my step parentsw are as good (if ot better, certainly easier to get on with) than my real parents!  i figure the many-parent things is pretty much the norm now isnt it.  ignore the abuse.  just make sure you're both in it for the long term.

on a practical note, we are TTC at the moment and we have been told by the clinic that sperm will live inside you for up to 5 days whilst your egg will only last a day. so as long as you have a regular supply of sperm around the time you ovulate it doesnt really matter how you go about the business.

Does anyone else feel like their heart has just been ripped out?



I really should stop venting about the negatives of ttc, but this week has just got to me.  4 pregnancy announcements this week alone!  I really do feel like my heart has been ripped out at the moment, I also feel guilty for feeling this way too.

I am extremely happy for those that have conceived, they all in their individual way deserve the blessing they have received.

I felt the pain in my heart ache tonight when I got the news of a close friend of mine.  I just wish I knew of a way to stop obsessing so much.  I already know that it doesn't do any good to stress over it.  After 2+ years it's beginning to become unbearable.

I either have to isolate myself from everyone or just give up and start taking birth control when I'll know there will be no chance of it happening and then just MAYBE I might be able to stop obsessing so much.  It just feels like I'm going out of my mind.

Thank you all for listening/reading  I have no one else to talk about this with, and I already appreciate all your answers.

I'm deeply sorry for your loss Red.  I won't know your pain, but I too have lost my father.  God rest his soul.



I'm so sorry, I should have mentioned that I already have children and this is why I feel so guilty.  But just because I already have, it doesn't make this pain any easier.  Thank you all for your kind thoughts and words of encouragement.

Yeah, everybody does. It's perfectly normal. I wouldn't suggest giving up or going back on birth control. It's just going to delay it more and more.. I hope you get your little bundle of joy soon! **baby dust**

I can't have children and many of my friends are new parents or expecting children. Don't begrudge them their happiness just go on with your life and enjoy the things they may be missing out on (long lazy mornings in bed, poop free outings, romantic meals - the list is endless!) When you start enjoying what you do have and stop obsessing over what you don't you may find that things will happen in the conception area for you too!

I can relate though I can't understand completely as I have not been trying for 2 years. In the last 3 years my BIL has had 3 children with different mothers, cousin in law just had baby at 21 not knowing who the father is, other cousin in law just had abortion at 19. 
Here I am wanting a child and can't.
It isn't fair and I don't understand why it works this way.
Maybe we can't get pregnant right now because there's special babies who aren't ready to be conceived yet.
Hang in there! I know it's hard and you can't think about anything else and hearing everyone else's news is a slap in the face. 
Sending lots of baby baby dust your way!!!

I know how you feel exactly.  I have had so many people that are close to me get pregnant while we have been ttc.  This is our 26th month ttc.  A few of these people had "accident" babies to top it off.  A real hard thing to deal with is I recently found out that 2 of these people (1 is my cousin) are now expecting their 2nd babies and I have yet to have my first!!!  It is so hard at times.  I have had 2 cousins, 6 friends, my doctor, my nurse, my boss's daughter all conceived within the last 12 months.  Most didn't try longer than 3 months and one was on the depo shot.  Crazy!!!  It is so hard but I get through knowing that soon everyone will be celebrating my pregnancy and baby.  I have total faith in God that it will happen for me.  So try to stay positive God is watching how you react to everyone else's joy.  It is ok to be sad but remember to not let it get the best of you.  Best wishes!!!!

It is generally 14 days before your next period.  My best advice, try every other day starting on day 10-22.  I kept trying to figure it out, when I finally gave up and tried every other day it just happened.  Come to find out I was ovulating later than I expected.  Good luck.

Ovulation is a single act that takes minutes for your ovary to release an egg.  Usually only 1 egg is released per cycle and it lives less than 24 hours.  Most women consider themselves fertile for 5-7 days around ovulation.  You want to try to start having intercourse about 5 days before you expect to ovulate and continue until 2 days after just in case your ovulation is delayed.  Sperm can live 3-5 days inside you so that helps add to your fertile time.  Having intercourse after ovulation yields little to no chance of conception.  Studies have shown that the day before actual ovulation is the highest chance to concieve because the sperm are fresh and have made their "journey" and are there for when the egg is released.  Read the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" to learn more.  My doctor recommended it to me and it is a great book.  Best wishes!!!

Normally you ovulate 14 days before ur period. So for an average 28 day period it would be day 14. Your best bet would be to buy some cheap ovulation strips online and take these daily from the day after your period stops until you get your positive ovulation test. Once you ovulate you have a 12-24hr window to fertilise the egg!

And yeah you can fall pregnant anytime of the month (even some people during their period.. but i think that's due to how long sperm can live in the womb)



Goodluck TTC

Hi has anyone been ttc for two years or more?



Hi all , have been trying to conceive for two years now, I have a son of 9 but my partner doesn't have any.  I know this doesn't mean it's his fault. Was just wondering if anybody fell pregnant after this long . Was trying to forget about it each month and think if it happens it happens, but it still hasn't. I am 40 this year too so dont know what to do for the best, Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Well, it's recommended that anyone over 35 should see a doc if they've been unable to concieve after 3-6 months.  I would head in and find out what's up.  They are going to be able to tell you if you can or can't and what you can do to help increase your chances.

My cousin has been TTC for around 2 years. She was on clomid for a few rounds and she just got her BFP a few weeks back. It can be done. She had to go visit some fertility docs. She wasnt ovulating on her own hence the clomid. Since you are past 35 I would seek a fertility specialist to see if you may need assitance in becoming pregnant again. Good Luck to you!

I have been trying for 2 years but my DH just found out he has Obstructive azoospermia :( so its IVF for us!! Maybe you should get a semen analysis done to rule out the possibility?? Its not unusual to take 2/3 years tho... you only have a 25% chance every month. i dont know how much that decreases as you get older though

Drop in E2 but endometrial thickness good?



I am going through my 1st IVF cycle.I started with Menopur 225iu but then it was stepped up to 450 iu.Currently i have 5 follicles growing but my E2 level has dropped below what it was on Day1.I am also taking injection to suppress ovulation and my endometrial thickness is 9.5 mm.My question is can E2 drop or be very low even if ET is good?



I thought E2 was directly proportional to how good or bad ET is.

It doesn't matter so much about these things! Sperm can be different consistency depending on what they are eating. However if it is really watery it can be considered to thin! It more matters if they have sperm, how many they have, how they move and if they swim well! The only way to know this is by having a sperm count done! You can talk to your doctor who will give you a prescription for the test. You go to the clinic and they give you the container to put sperm in. It must be turned in with in 15 min of ejaculation to be correct. From this test you will know if your guy has swimmers or doesn't! You will also know if his little guys swim the right direction! My husband did this test and it was weird for him at the clinic so he brought it home. Then we had to rush back with in 15 min. To get a accurate test! Long story short his swim just fine and not but two months later we are pregnant! Good luck!

ok to be crude (but factual) thick semen is a sign of a lot of sexual activity (maybe because you are trying so hard?) The more watery the semen the less often it is being ejaculated. HOWEVER, neither thick or thin semen affect the ability of the sperm to fertilise an egg it is merely a carrying base to transfer it to the woman. There is a school of thought that says the watery the better to help the sperm to swim but that is unproven as yet.

On ejaculation the sperm will be gel like and stringy but after about 10 to 20 minutes it liquifies (becomes more fluid), this information is useful if you are self-inseminating because it needs to be liquified to draw it up the syringe, I don't think it matters otherwise. If you are haing sex i presume it liquifies in the fertile cervical fluid.

Hope this helps!

Metformin is supposed to work for many women to regulate their cycle. I actually just went to the doctor today and he prescribed it to me and said it could take a few months to work. The next step would be clomid but it's best to try the Metformin first. Good luck and baby dust to you!!

If you get pregnant whilst breastfeeding, do you still get sore boobs?



I'm still breastfeeding my toddler and ttc #2, but having no luck

When I got pg with my son 2 years ago I had really sore boobs before I got my BFP.



Actually, I always had sore boobs just before my period but this time the period didn't come and the boobs stayed sore, which made me realise something was up, lol.

Anyway, since my periods have returned I haven't been getting sore boobs at all.  I'm in the 2WW now and desperate for any signs but I've got nothing, no cramps, no nausea, no sore boobs, so I guess we failed again this month.

Is there any chance you can be pregnant without the sore boobs if you are still breastfeeding?  Or is that unlikely?

Well it is really up to you.. I have seen positive (faint) but positive as early as 10 dpo..but this does not happen for all.. some take longer their HCG levels to be high enough to detect..So if you know your body than you can base your decision on that. But since you are not wanting to waste the money to test, than i would say wait until your period is due and if no show than take a test than. BUT if you are really curious than pick up the DOLLAR tree Pregnancy test and test everyday from 10dpo tell your missed period.. it will be about the same cost for one test.. plus it detects 25ml of HCG hormone which is about the same as the other name brands..GOOD LUCK!

From what I read it is recommended to wait to take a pregnancy test the first day of your mised period. Sometimes if you test to soon your hormone level is not high enough for the test to detect. I would take a test on the first day of my expected period.

i'm a week late and still testing negative. sometimes it can take four to six weeks to show up. sometimes longer with a urine test. sometimes people never get a postive with a urine test.

i would wait until after you miss your period, see what it says, if it's negative and you don't get your period for another week, then take another, if it's still negative, go to the doctor for a blood test.

you don't want to waste a bunch of money taking a test too early.

I would wait until after you miss your period because, from my expierence, the more negitives I get the more frustrated and upset i get about the whole process of even trying. I dont want you to get discouraged, I know it's hard but just try to hold off until you miss your period and enjoy the thoughts and imagining that you are. That really keeps me going month to month.

find the exact day that your period was due and if it doesn't come then do it the day after, That's what i would do it gives you time for your period and time for the hormone to show on the test.

it's a bit tougher to figure out ovulation when your periods are irregular...try talking to your doctor and something like clomid could help you ovulate regularly and make ttc easier, another way to be covered is to hve intercourse every other day while TTC, you can also ask a fertility specialist online for free for advice, try fertilityties.com
good luck!!!

If implantation bleeding is only a light pink or brownish stain, then why do so many women...?



confuse spotting for a "period"? I'm confused. I myself would notice a difference between a regular period of mine and "spotting".

P.S. I think I spotted. It's been 1 month since I last had sexual intercourse. I had a light period for two days and at the end of the second day of my ?period? I would wipe and it was light pink. My periods are ALWAYS heavy at first and last 5 days with painful cramps! This is my first ?light period?. I felt no cramps THIS TIME. Could this have been "spotting"? It was yesterday when my period stopped. And last month I had my period Aug.18-Aug 22.(heavy period, cramps)...does this describe spotting what I had this month?

If your period is very different than what you're used to..lighter, shorter, etc... then it could be spotting.



I had brown spotting that lasted about 3-4 days when I was first pregnant. I thought it was my period starting..but knew something was up when it went away.



Some people who have light periods might get them confused.

I've been through IVF. Basically, they put you on a drug (Gonall F for me) and stimulate your ovaries to produce more than one egg. Then they go in surgically and remove them (like a pap smear), fertilize them with your husbands sperm and then put a few back in. IVF has a fairly high success rate :) Good luck and Baby dust!

You need to speak to your OB/GYN about this. they have your medical background and know if it's possible for you. It won't have anything to do with your tubes, it's going to be whether your uterus will carry an embryo full term.

What upsets me is girls or boys who think they are old enough to have sex, but dont think about the fact that they may be creating another life.



If you are not prepared to be a parent, why are you taking the risk ?



It is not something to do when you are 14, 15 or even 16, just because you think it will make you be more grown up.



There is a HUGE responsiblity that goes along with sex.



If you are not financially and mentally responsible to raise a child then wait .  Abstinence is the only 100% effective birth control.

how many times can we read on here, " oh, I think I might be pregnant, how will I tell my mother ?"



Think about that the next time you think about having sex.  Think , What if ?

I almost want to get drunk, smoke a joint, buy a pack of cigarettes, a 12 of dr. pepper and a bag of pixie stix and go to a party and have sex with some random stranger....I'm totally just kidding I would never ever do that but it's just really upsetting.

All I can think of is why can't it me be? I want to be pregnant so bad and I can't. Well, I wish you luck and hope we all get our wish soon.

I think that's why people say "quit trying" and it will happen. Would you rather be in your situation where you are prepared to bring a child up and the right time will come when it does or in that situation? Just be happy it's not you at 16. I'm all about ignoring it anymore

Yessssss!! I'm 23 years old and had a miscarriage almost 2 months ago. I took good care of myself, but it just wasn't enough and I miscarried. Then over here there are girls that I know getting pregnant in high school, partying, not even taking good care of themselves but yet there they are with their baby! But God does things for a reason, and all those young moms will later want to go out, party it up, and won't be able to do it. At least us that are married, already had our fun and are ready to settle down without regrets. Good luck to you ;)

I haven't ever used one. It wouldn't hurt to use one for sure.. you'd probably get a positive anywhere from 4-10dpo depending on how fast your hcg levels climb.

Yes, I've used them loads and they work very well. They are more sensitive than a lot of shop brands.
I got a positive with one at 10 dpo but that will vary for each woman and depends a lot on when the egg implants. But you can expect a positive from 9-12 dpo in most situations.

Good luck!

I have used these and the ovulation ones although i have never had a positive pregnancy test, i think the ovulation ones are great!! the pregnancy  test ones claim that you can use 5 days before your period but the differs in every woman to be honest, from my experience it is best to wait until after you due date and test although this is very very hard if you are like me!!!

Good Luck and i really hope you get the answer you are looking for!

Do it. I don't think you are increasing your chances, but I don't think it hurts either. Almost the same---just make sure to inject shortly after so the sperm don't die. It's not going to hurt you. I've heard some people do this.

Yeah you can get pregnant any time sperm come into contact w/ the vagina.



Note: They have to be fresh - semen is no good once it dries.



You'd want to make sure that the item you use is not contaminated...you don't want to end up with an infection.

I'm sure it could work, although the chances of it working compared to having actual sex, I'm not sure.



But just as a future note, it's recommended that you NOT have sex every day if you are trying to have a baby. The guy needs time to build up his sperm, so it's recommended that you have sex every other day.

Get an ovulation kit at the drugstore.  Follow the directions and it will tell you when you are most fertile.

On average, ovulation occurs around day 14 of your cycle (day 1 being the first day of your period).  But this varies from person to person and from cycle to cycle.  The most fertile window is about 2 days before to about 12 hours after ovulation.

But really, I suggest a kit.  It'll take the guess work out of it.  Good luck!

If he has low sperm count or other abnormalities i would bd every other day from the day you finish your period.

I'm on my 26th day of my cycle. I got them irregular, usually between 33-37day.I'm ovulating today.I have started look for any sign that my body is giving me for the last 3 months.Me and my DH got unprotected sex since my second day of my period till 10 days before me ovulating(7th of sept).Today I'm having a pain -period like cramps (because of o.)and those 2 other sign that I don't know why there here: a lower back pain and going to the toilet very often. 
my question is : does any of you got the same problems during ovulation or it could be some health issue with my body?

When ever I ovulate I always have to use the bathroom a lot more then when I am not ovulating for a while I thought I was pregnant but since it has been every month for the last 9 months around ovulation I know that it is just a symptom of ovulation. 
I don't get the lower back pain though, you could have just slept wrong, it is too early for pregnant symptoms. Good luck and I hope this is your month.

Implantation bleeding.....?



I wonder if someone could help?
My last period was on 31st July, the one before that was 24th June and the one before that 2nd June! Before that was 3months ago, I came off the pill a year and a half ago and had been having long cylces and irregular periods but since I have now had 3 periods in a row I thought my body was back to normal.
But still no sign on AF...

On monday I did a test....BPN but after I tested, I wiped and saw light pink blood on the tissue (sorry tmi) and looked in toilet and saw a very small trickle of blood running down....so I thought it was the start of my period.
Went toilet an hour later, again, only when I wiped I saw pink on the tissue as well as a lot extra mucus than normal.
Went toilet again and no sign of any blood at all but to this day I am still getting really heavy mucus when I wipe and also in my knickers!!!
Really strange, is this implantation bleeding? Or could it be anything else?
I am really not sure what else it could be. Because I have had funny cycles, I thought maybe this was a long one and I ovulated late?

I have been feeling sick but not throwing up, twinges in my belly, pulling sensations, belly hurt after I had caffeine, very gassy, lots of headaches, lower back ache, belly bloated and I'm going for naps in the early evenings which is not like me at all. I have also become incredibly spotty and I normally only get 1 or 2 spots on day of AF but this time there is so many. I am also extremely emotional and crying at so many things, and I really am not a crier!!

If anyone could help me it would be most appreciated!!
Basically I want to know if the tiny bit of blood and pink on tissue after wiping I saw could be anything else apart from implantation bleeding?

Thanks!!

Well it wounds very like implantation bleeding, although it could be ovulation bleeding? All the signs point to pregnancy tho :)

I got all the signs and the bleeding at 8 dpo last month. Never got my period only brown/creamy cm (sorry tmi) but no BFP either!!



I hope all your signs are good ones and you get a BFP. The Dr can do a wee blood test if your really going insane about this. Dr tests are very rarely wrong x

Pregnancy question?? really confused xx?



Hi Guys. Well I did a test a couple of days ago and it came positive. about 20 mins later the second line has disappeared. I thought i would test a couple of days later. As promised to myself i tested this morning and it was negative. If i am pregnant i have worked out i will be 3 weeks and 5 days.



I have a few spots round my chin and on my forehead, i feel tired all day and have lower abdominal cramps but still no sign of period.



Me and my partner are trying for a baby but we dont know whether to celebrate or what?!?! we are really confused

can anyone please advise if the pregnancy test would come positive this early in the pregnancy ??



thanks in advance xx

well i know after about 10 minutes most hpt are invalid. So i wouldnt worry about that test. You can get false negatives because the test may not be picking up the hcg in your urine yet. I would wait until you would be 4 mos. and 1 day and try and take a test then. Lots of baby dust to you!!

I know the frustration you must be feeling, but it's important to stay relaxed.  It took me over one year to get pregnant, so the best advice is to stay positive.

That being said, HPT are not valid after 10-15 minutes, it's pretty rare to get a false positive, it's more common for false negatives to occur.  I would wait 3 days between tests and if the third test is positive then call your Dr. to get a confirmation, and if you're not taking a prenatal vitamin, then I'd go to the drug store and get one.

One of the first "signs" I noticed was hard ummm breasts and really blue veins in them.

Take another one. Is there any chance you used a test that wasn't as sensitive as the first? Or did you not empty your bladder before you went to sleep? If you don't then your pee may still be watered down from drinks the night before. I false negative is much more likely then a false positive. I think you can celebrate. You're pregnant!

I assuming that you have a regular period. You can't really calculate to the exact point because you don't know when you began conception and implantation. I would suggest to either get a blood test from the doctors or get a early detection pregnancy test once you know when you were due for you upcoming period. Lastly, if your period is already late your hormone levels can be low so take a early detection test because they are more sensitive in detecting traces of hormones and you may be able to get a better reading. good luck
