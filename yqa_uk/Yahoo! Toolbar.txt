Start menu, control panel, add/remove programmes, then locate Yahoo toolbar and click on uninstall.

In future whenever you are asked to download any toolbar always say no. They are just a pain in the butt

Don't just untick it in View menu, remove it

Try this, click on view, toolbars, yahoo one will have a tick against it, click it to remove the tick and it should go off your screen............. Or click start, click "set programme access and defaults"  click "change or remove programmes" the toolbar should be there to remove!

click on settings tab, scroll down to &gt;Help,click it and on that menu is the uninstall yahoo toolbar option. I have not used it from there but it should work IF going to the add/remove options isn't working. My yahoo programs are at the bottom of the page below all the security updates and other programs so it should be listed there. The removing the checkmarks will remove the display but not the toolbar itself.

Firefox has a built-in pop-up blocker.  That is why Y! does not provide a pop-up blocker button on their toolbar under Firefox.

Click on Bookmarks & add to bookmarks is the easiest way, then you can find them easily without cluttering up your toolbars or you can add them to "Your Own Button" on the Yahoo toolbar..
