Byron W. couldn't be more wrong, yes there is such a thing as HD audio, but it's not possible with an Optical connection. It is only possible to transfer HD audio via HDMI.



If there is no such thing as HD audio, then why there be surround sound formats like Dolby TrueHD? DTS MA is another HD audio format. HD audio is full 7.1ch lossless(uncompressed) audio. And as I said earlier, can only be achieved with an HDMI connection. your equipment must also be capable( ie: 7.1ch receiver w/ HDMI, a HD DVD or Blu Ray player, etc.)



Optical sound is good, but not HD(the best). Optical and Coax max out at DolbyDigital 5.1 surround.

you're comparing apples and oranges. HD is a name that is used by television and broadcast companies to describe a 1080i or 1080p signal. Your computer may be fast, but you would be ignorant to think that it has a supercharger. To answer your question, digital optical is a great type of connection, and when set up properly delivers great sound. but since it does not display video at over 1080 interlaced lines at 60 fps, then no, it is not HD.

I've seen a few manufacturers claim their receivers can do "HD audio" but to be honest, I've no idea what that means.  It's either digital for dolby surround (5.1, 7.1, etc.) or it's just analog for stereo.



As far as I can tell, the whole "HD Audio" thing is just marketing baloney.



That isn't to say switching to optical or digital co-ax isn't a good thing.  Using one of these cables is the only way to get Dolby Digital Surround from your system - assuming you have at least 5 speakers and 1 subwoofer connected up and the thing you're watching supports surround sound.  Most TV signals, and DVDs of old TV shows are only in stereo, so you won't notice a difference here.  However, a more modern movie will be using surround sound which will be quite noticeable.

Of course the choice for the DVD player would depend on the TV you have.
If it is an HDTV that can display either 720p, 1080i or 1080p, then an Up-converting DVD player will be the right choice. Also look into Blu-ray.
In any case it's OK to buy a better player, so you will have what you need, the day you buy a better TV.

Blu Ray subtitle question?



How come most Blu Ray movies don't have a wider range of subtitles? My family do not know English very well, and it's a pain having to translate everything when they ask.
Iron Man does not have Croatian subtitles, and I even looked on the Blu Ray live content, but nothing was there.
It would be a good idea to at least put the subtitles on BD Live.

My advice is that you start with a subwoofer kit before going onto stereo or 5 channel speakers. The subwoofer is a bit bigger and more complex, but you only have to build one.



You can buy a Kit from places like www.partsexpress.com which has a bare wood enclosure, crossover, amp, drivers, etc and you assemble it yourself.



Or you can search the internet for DIY speakers and learn about driver options, enclosure volume options, baffles, etc and put together your own.

That question obviously depends on a lot of factors. Your computer most likely has a DVI output. So it depends on whatever the input on the receiver is. Many newer high-end TVs have DVI inputs, or you could use a DVI-HDMI cable if you have an HDMI input.

A reciever and speaker seperates are a good bet but your budget might be a little tight, problem you might have with a one box system is ensuring that you get full decoding from all of your sources. To achieve that you you will need at least two optical inputs. otherwise you will have to change cables everytime you change xbox to ps3 or settle for lower quality stereo analogue inputs. I have both consoles, and have an onkyo Cinema Reciever with HDMI inputs and single output to tv, allowing easy electronic switching between the two. This is a more expensive solution than your budget at around £400 plus speakers but the extra cost is well worth the money.

Does BluRay movies makes difference to DVD movies?



I know that Blu-Ray can save more files, it can record very clean from TV shows, more pixels, but if I were to watch this only for movies, will it makes much of difference, only if I look close and very deep in to the screen to make the difference.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Bluray movies have higher resolution which allows more detail.  Bluray does look better than DVD, but the only way to see a difference is to have an HDTV the right cables.  Otherwise you probably won't see any difference.  Some people still don't see it even with all HD components.  Also, the display size may affect.  You can clearly see the difference on a larger tv as opposed to a smaller one.  But, if you compare DVD movies and BD movies side by side, you will see it.  Color depth is much higher in BD as well.

Hey FF, First – you need a step down transformer that reduces 220 to 110, but please do be very careful on the Ah part, from what you have mentioned its 110V7A which is 110 Volts at 7AH.  Please do not use another power rating as it would fry your system. You need to be very careful – DONOT use a underpowered or over powered system

I own a 5 year old 51" Sony WEGA rear projection HDTV w/ 1 DVI outlet.  I've got a HDMI/DVI adapter that I'm currently using for my cable box.  I'm willing to connect my cable box via component cables to free up my DVI outlet for an upconverting or Blu-Ray player.

wait for the prices to come down or get a ps3.  an upconvert willnot produce that better of a result.  you may just want to wait and see what happens.



the ps3 works great as a blu-rayplayer and you can play videogames or surf the web with it.

no. you can't use RCA (red/white cable) to support 5.1 to your amp.



you need this set up. xbox-digital cable-amp-speakers.



If you have that set up, then yes you can produce 5.1 surround, but only if you have that setup and if you have the correct speakers. Plus your source (game, dvd, etc) has to be 5.1 sound.

No.



You need to feed the Logitech system DIRECTLY from the xbox with an optical cable.



You run digital through the amp so it can power it's own speakers. It will not pass the signal along to the Logitech system.



You essentially have 2 amps: your 5.1 amp and the Logitech system with a built-in amp.  They are not designed to feed each other.

i doubt it for a couple of good reasons.



1. the difference between the quality of dvd compared to blu-ray is not that much. you need some very expensive and fancy tv/dvd setup in order for blu-ray to be seen as better. If you don't have that kind of gear (which most americans don't) then it will be perceived as not needed.
Where as the difference between dvd and vhs is huge. Everyone can clearly see the advantages.



2. the cost is not worth it. When  you can buy dvd's at walmart for 5 bucks, versus the same movie in blu-ray for 25. Most people will not pay the premium for something that is only slightly better.



Unless there is a major shift in hdtv adaption, and dvd players dont' exist. Then blu-ray will probably always stay a niche market.

Yes, Everyone seems to be using their PS3 for blu-ray.  Toshiba has already announced that they have stopped making HD DVDs. In february, the blu-ray technology won against Toshiba Corp'sHD DVD. Blu-ray discs can store 50 gigabytes of data, about six times more than conventional DVDs. Now that all the major studios have moved and support Blu-Ray, all movie dvds will be available only to Blu-Ray format.

I have to agree and disagree with Nathan.



DVD's will be around until 90% or more of the public have switched to HDTV's. This includes the US, Europe and Asia.  (If the market is there - they will still sell the movies)



BluRay might actually disappear if all the Video-on-demand services that are going to be the "next big thing" take off.  Verizon Fios, AT&T UVerse, Apple TV, Zudo, Netflix on-demand, XBox LIve - all of these are trying to offer on-demand streaming HD movies so you never have to buy a disk.



The difference in the 1940's video on a DVD vs HD video from a BluRay is dramatic even on a small screen. If you dont see the difference - you probably are not doing an A/B comparison, or you are watching a poorly mastered BluRay disk.

I hope so - because I love the quality of Blu-Ray - but I don't think so.  I think the future is in downloads/streaming.  It will take over very physican media format - just like MP3 are taking over CDs (just as unfortunate, because MP3 quality sucks!)

You use a lot of marketing terms (which are used to imply more than is actually present.)



I suspect you should do an internet search for BluRay Profile 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.



These 'profiles' are Sonys attempt to get early purchasers of BluRay players to buy new players by offering new 'features' that include:



- Internet connectivity so you can access internet 'extras' based on a movie.



- Picture in picture feature. This allows you to watch the commentary (or behind-the-scenes extras) in a small window while watching the movie.



I suspect Samsung is just saying their new players are adding some profile 1.2 features, but avoiding using numbers because:



- they feel their customers are frightened by numbers.
- it would commit them to being totally compatible with un-tested features

Your first problem is you are feeding the modern HDTV with standard def video that was the height of technology back in 1950.



Standard def video looks horrible on a HDTV and there is just no getting around it.



Hook up an antenna and have the TV scan for channels. You will be shocked at how good that TV looks when feeding it more modern signals.



Type your address into www.antennaweb.org and it will show you where the TV towers are around your home and it will recommend a size of antenna you need.



Or upgrade your DirectTV service to a HD receiver. I strongly recommend the DVR/PVR receivers so the box can record your shows while you are away and they are just sitting there waiting for you to come home. It is actually easier than a VCR to use. (Trust me on this).



Antenna: if you are lucky enough, the Phillips Silver Sensor - Classic is a $25 indoor antenna that is very good at picking up signals.



Cables: if you need a HDMI cable - you can spend $100 at the store for Monster, or $30 at www.bluejeanscables.com  I have used BlueJeans for years and they sell real good cables for budget prices.

You are wrong, The Samsung  HT-Z410 is a 1080p upscaling DVD player, and the video's look just fine, asfaras Direct TV goes, it will be history in 6 more months, maybe sooner if I chooseto pay the early cancelation, witch I'm strongly leaning towards. I have a DVR, hardly ever use it.

First of all your question is really vague. Ok let me ask you some stuff, the panasonic home theater system is the type with the amplifier in built into the control center? If yes, then you will have a huge problem. Those speakers are passive speakers and will require an amplifier to power it up. if no then they are active speakers, you should be looking for RCA inputs to connect to them.



Remember the tv output will connect to you speaker input.



However, one bad news, I think your speakers are passive. Thus it is not worth the effort getting an amplifier for it, its cheaper getting a whole new system....

For the sound the first post is one way to go, although you may experience some odd sounds.  The best way to go is to install a digital output on your tower.  This is a fairly inexpensive add that will let you use not only your sub but the rest of your speakers in 5.1 or better surround.  This will allow you benefit from the digital surround sound available from movies and many games.

Yes you can, as long as you have a compatible surround sound card in your computer.Sure it may not sound as good as a true home theatre, but it is still good.

I have a lcd 32inch tv and a rca dvd sound system and I need major help getting audio to work for everything!?



Magnavox 32MF337B 32-Inch LCD HDTV - tv description
RCA RTD217 5-Disc DVD/CD Home Theater System - dvd sound system
we have checked online and the manuals and even called magnavox !  We need help!  Is there anyway to hook up the surround sound to the television with out the optical cables so that the sound works for tv channels(digital antenna not cable box or satelitte just directly connected with a coaxcable), our ps3 ( hooked up with hdmi cables), and the dvd player(hooked up through the avi1slot.



The problem is that it works fine with the dvd player but how can we hook it up where we can get sound for everything?



There is no optical cable spot on the dvd player but there is on the tv.  It is the only audio out besides the normal avi1,2,3 and the 2 hdmi ports.  You cant play the sound from the ps3 or the tv channels unless it is just through the tv since you have to switch the source to get to the audio on the dvd player surround sound.



Any suggestions would help !



I really dont have the option of ugrading our surround sound we just bought this one and cant take it back very disappointed it didnt have the optical port on the back only the rca type connections.

According to the owners manual, digital is your only option for getting audio out of the at model.  There is a solution:

This will allow you to convert the digital audio coming form the TV to an analogue right and left signal that you should be able to plug into to home theater system into any input not labeled phono.

What is the difference between home theater system and a HIFI music system with 5.1 channel?



I found different options by different vendors on home theater system and HIFI music system. Both have almost same price and both capable for playing dvd and giving 5.1 channel output with equal number of speakers. Then why it is categorizing as home theater and home music system. Appearance is the only this i could make out.

For all intents and purposes, probably none.



Some home theater certifications require that speaker exhibit certain dispersion characteristics and amplifiers be able to meet a nominal performance standards.  This is usually different level equipment and applicable to the average home theater in a box and other one box solutions.

Hi-fi stands for high fidelity. A true hi-fi system with have only two speakers! these are usually towers with passive bass woofers. That said most of us can not afford a $200,000 stand alone hi-fi stereo. Most higher end and some medium manufactures understand this and they make receivers and preamp/processors capable of rendering good quality sound for both. Typically 'hi-fi' systems are two channel only - with dedicated components , cd player, turntable, 2 speakers, possibly a pre-amp and seperate amplifier or integrated amp. - made for listening to music through.
Home Theatre systems are geared towards watching movies and have complex internal components to decipher 5.1 surround info, multiple internal amplifiers etc..

Hi,



It's a bit difficult to answer this question without knowing the setup and options of your amplifier.



You mentioned that you have a subwoofer.  I am assuming that this is connected to an amplifier.



Does the amplifier not have connections for Left / Right audio?  If so, this should be where you connect your other speakers.



If you connect the two speakers to the same connection as the subwoofer, here is what would happen:



•	The subwoofer connection on a amplifier is only passing low frequency audio, not the full bandwidth.  Even if full-range speakers are connected to a subwoofer connection, you would not have full-range audio.
•	By connecting additional speakers in-line or in parallel to the subwoofer, the load on the amplifier may be outside acceptable limits.  If the load is too low, you risk burning up your amp.



To get an idea of the load, first you’ll have to determine how you will be connecting the speakers.  If you daisy chain the cables (similar to how you would connect Christmas lights), this is considered a series connection.  If you connect all gold/black cables together and all silver/red cables together, this would be considered a parallel connection.



To calculate the load, you’ll need to find the impendence of each speaker.  This is generally printed on the jack panel of the speaker or listed in the manual.  Look for something that says x ohms or x Ω.



For a series circuit, add all the individual loads for your speakers.  For example, if the subwoofer is 4 ohms, and each speaker is 8 ohms, then the total load in a series would be 4 + 8 + 8 = 20 ohms.



For a parallel circuit, the calculation is a little more complex.  The total load will be 1 / [(1/L1) + (1/L2) + (1/L3)] where L1 is the load of the first speaker, L2 is the load of the second speaker, and L3 is the load of the third speaker.



Notice that for a series circuit the total load is bigger than the individual loads.  For a parallel circuit, the total load is smaller than the individual loads.



Once you’ve calculated the load, look at the jack panel on the amplifier that the speakers will be connected to.  There will be an allowable range.  If the total load is outside of this range then the setup will yield problems.  Too small of a load will cause your amp to overheat and potentially become damaged.  Too large of a load will require more power than normal to drive the speakers and sound may be inaudible.



If you want to post an update indicating the outputs you have on your amplifier, I can try to provide a more precise recommendation for your situation.



Thanks.

Do not buy those $399 'systems' that come with a skinny receiver and a DVD player built in.  They are sold by Sony, Samsung, Phillips, etc., and are just cause for grief later.



Here is what I would advise if you were my sister:



- Onkyo TX-SR505 or 605 or 705 receiver. Prices start about $380
- Energy Take speakers and subwoofer. Prices from $300-$600
- Sony PS3 for the BluRay player: $340



This will give you a system that you can hook lots of other things to (Cable box, Sat box, iPod, XM Radio, etc.)



Note: the speakers are the big variable. There are lots of other speakers from real speaker companies (Definitive Technology, Energy, Paradigm, Boston, Klipsch, etc.) for a huge variation in prices.  So dont be afraid to shop around.



You do not need audiophile grade speakers for a home theater system. As long as they are all from the same set so they tone-match, and they come from a real speaker company (a company that only makes speakers), you will be fine with a $500 set.  Look for bookshelf sized speakers with a self-powered subwoofer.



Good Luck.

Setting a budget you can afford and then doing a little due diligence is your first step towards finding your best home theater system. I think Yamaha rx-v361 is good. This not only has excellent Yamaha quality, but it also has a boat load of features, high sound quality, high picture quality, surround realism. This receiver sounds really awesome and you can hook up all your stuff to it like your DVD player or your game systems. Personal choice is what it's all about. The best home theater system on the market, taken literally, will set you back thousands upon thousands of dollars however, choose what's best for you and your budget.

Hey Spunky,
Go to a high end audio store and listen to their top end system.  Decide how much you can afford (and don't be blown away by big prices). Then tell them what you can afford and ignore their "disdain".  Find something you like and can afford... then go somewhere else and buy it.

Hi G£thyn,



The Optoma PRO100s is a great value projector and is fully compatible with PS3.



The lamp on the Pro100s will last in the region of 3000 hours which is prolonged by simply cleaning the bulb and fan regularly. In the unlikely event you do need to replace the lamp, it would cost in the region of £100-200 as this is one of the more expensive projector components.



As you have pointed out though, a projector can be a fantastic way of viewing a very large picture in high quality, at a much lower price than an LCD/Plasma TV. Therefore this makes it an ideal choice for gaming and movies.



If you are willing to stretch your budget slightly, High Definition Projectors allow you to view in a higher (720 pixel) resolution. This means your picture will be much sharper and details will be clearer [Especially helpful when reading writing on a projected image].



HD Projectors, like the Optoma HD700x start from around £430. It is HD Ready, has a lamp life of 3000 hours, a contrast ratio of 3000:1, which means you get a greater range of colours and can create a 7.7 metre High Definition image on your wall. Impressive!



Hope this helps, and that you have your Home Cinema up and running before you know it!

You may use the best software I have seen AVS Video Tools. It can convert to/from all key format, upload video or DVD directly to key portables like iPod, Sony PSP, Archos, Zen Creative, and mobiles.
It can capture video from DV or webcams, TV tuners, DVB-T, DVB-S, transfer VHS tapes to DVD, remove commercials, edit video, copy and burn DVDs and video files: AVI (DivX, XviD, etc.), MP4, WMV, 3GP, 3G2, QuickTime (MOV, QT), SWF, DVD, VOB, VRO, MPEG 1,2,4, MPG, DAT, VCD, SVCD, ASF, H.263, H.264, RM, DVR-MS.
