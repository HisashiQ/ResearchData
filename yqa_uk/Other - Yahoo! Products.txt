Ordered something off the net, they sent wrong product, I sent back but they say not received, what can I do?!?



I ordered an fm transmitter for my ipod off the net.  They sent the wrong product so I contacted them and they agreed to refund when I sent it back.  I sent it back via Recorded Delivery and even though the proof-of-delivery is on Royal Mail's website they are saying they haven't received it and will not give a refund!  What can I do to force them to pay up??  I am in the UK and the company involved is based in the UK.  Put in Yahoo Shopping as I couldn't see any other shopping categories.  Nothing to do with Yahoo though!  The item involved cost roughly £50.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



if the tracker on royal mails website said it was received, it was received, they are lying to you! Recorded Delivery items require a signature to be received!



go to citizens advice bureau or at worse seek legal advice! print out the page on the royal mail website as u may well need it! and keep ur proof of postage receipt!

Go to your profile, click "edit my info", set up a 360° page, load up a pic (it has to be a .jpg, preferrably 48x48 pixels), mark "set as primary", click "preview" and then "okay"! If you don't know how to resize a pic, don't worry, Yahoo will still show it in an appropriate size.

If you prefer a Yahoo Avatar go to the link below to create one. Next go to your profile, click "edit my info", click "use my Yahoo avatar", click "preview" and then "ok".

Well I'm in the UK and if I click on the US flag I get the US site, but it's quite normal to get American answers on our questions because people in the US have the option to choose "All English Questions".

If you only want to see American questions choose "Show &gt;USA Questions" from the drop down menu.

&lt;&lt;Did you know that your pics are all over bubbleserve.com (or other sites)?&gt;&gt; That's a message which many MySpace users have gotten, supposedly from either a relative or a close friend - so far I've seen reports on YA from:

azurebuzz.com, azurezoom.com, coralpad.com, crimsonopia.com, deesphere.com, dynatoken.com, flapset.com, getemset.com, gingersphere.com, hazelpad.com, heycode.com, iconnik.com, phototradingspot.info, scrality.com, snapnik.com, tradepicsnow.com, ubzunit.com, wackset.com, wackstate.com, wareate.com



and a couple of others. When you follow the link included in the mail, you'll be led to a site which asks you for personal infos like name, mail account, passwords - you get the picture? Right, the site which supposedly has your pictures displayed, never had them, it doesn't even exist! The whole thing is just a phishing scam! And when you ask your contact, you'll find that he never send you the mail! After doing a lot of research, I found that a single guy is behind half of the addresses listed above. I suggest to forward such a message to the links below:

phishing@cc.yahoo-inc.com
http://www.spamcop.net/
Federal Trade Commission spam@uce.gov
Treasury Department 419.fcd@usss.treas.gov
http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/re... - this site contains links for various countries

Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously.

OKAY,  THAT IS JUST A SPAM WEBSITE AND IT IS NOT REAL.  YOUR FRIEND DID NOT E-MAIL THAT TO YOU.  YOUR FRIEND ACTUALLY HAS A SPAM THING ON HIS/HER PAGE AND THAT IS WHY IT CAME TO YOU,  IN FACT, IT WAS SENT TO EACH AND EVERYONE THAT IS FRIENDS WITH YOUR FRIEND.  I WAS JUST LETTING YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO ME TO.

Here’s how to do it:



1. Click Options in the upper-right corner of your Yahoo! Mail page and select Mail Options.



2. Under “Management”, click General Preferences.



3. Right at the top, in the “From name:” box, enter your name how you’d like it to appear in the "From:" line of your outgoing messages. Example: “Sally Tiptoes”.



4. If you want, you can also adjust the email address to which people send messages when they click “Reply”. If you leave the “Reply to:” field blank, your Yahoo! Mail address is the return address. Specify a different return address by entering it after “Reply to:”.



5. Click Save to put your new settings into effect.

Is there not room in Cyberspace for Yahoo to allow words to be added to their dictionary such as names etc ?



It's annoying if, when I'm being polite and use my name(Elric(it's picked it up again)) to have it come up as an incorrect spelling and who the hell is Alric???? I've never heard of him.

That is but one instance but there are many more, some of which are discrepancies between American and Her Majesty the Queens English

Kind regards

Take it to your Cellular provider.
They usually have a technician in back that can do simple fixes while you wait.
They usually "flash" the memory.
I did the same thing and it sends all your settings back to default.
I'm not sure what it does to your sim card though.

My account was suspended with out any reason? can anyone tell me why?



i mean i use this yahoo ID for half my life and they just say you violated the rules and deleted my account.
heres the deleted question "From which country is this phone number? +79132617216?" 
and they say i violated :Community Guidelines and/or Terms Of Service Violation
and then moments later another mail my entire account suspended is this fair just because of a single question i lose my account. there was a valid reason for asking that question also. the owner of that phone has been calling me lately. when i asked the local authorities to which country the number belongs to they said they dont provide information about another countries. and so i had no other choice but to post it here and find out.
and i did send the yahoo Customer Care that may be that did it by mistake and the they send a mail saying "We reviewed your case, and 
decided that your account is not eligible for reinstatement."
is there anyway i can get the account back. ok if without content also i only want the same ID
im sure this question and this account also soon will be suspended

It's not cool to post people's phone numbers on Y!A.  While they might have gone too far, next time just google "country code look up".

If the account is ineligible for reinstatement then you just have to wait until the screenname becomes free again.

Live and learn. Simple minds on these Y! boards. IMO the home-schooled are the most inhibited and show off their inter-personal skills by reporting trivialities. I lost a level 7 and a cool screen_name with no explanation given. I don't care, but I was using my User Account to save links.

You can rant to Account Services but the Yahoo! robot emails won't change a thing.

As far as the phone number, you could have looked up the country code in wiki.

Your giving out the telephone number violated the "Privacy Act" that is being so strictly enforced.
To YA, that's the same thing as giving out someone's Social Security number.
They are very strict about giving out personal information on this website.

Perhaps you can find the area code in the front of your phone book or call telephone information to get your answer.
You have to be very careful about what you put on any website, because everyone is really tightening down to assure that all clients/customers/members are protected in the "Privacy Act".

Hopefully after you appeal your case to YA, they will understand and allow you to reinstate.  Just tell them that you were unaware that you were breaking a rule.  Good Luck!

There are no human being running Y/A. Everything is automated. Maybe one out of every 10,000 question tha get taken down a day 1 get restored. This is Y/A tries to be ultra politically correct and will try to hard to please anyone. All it takes is one asshole with multiple accounts to have questions removed left and right.

Y/A is a computer, automated. Your appeals will usually never be seen by human eyes. It's all automated. I have had plenty of question taken down for "not a question or answer" when they were in fact legitimate questions. I think it was how I asked it. I know for instance I had a stalker whom tried to report all my questions and that made me privitise my answers.

Disable/hide Yahoo public profile?



Hi,

When you open a new account or sign up for email with Yahoo, they automatically create a public profile for you, like this:

http://profiles.yahoo.com/YOUR_YAHOO_ID

This is public - and spammers can easily harvest your user id, which is the same as the first half of your email.

Is there a way to hide/disable the public profile?
Thanks

Because you need to maintain actively in those categories you were the TC at. You still need to keep answering questions in those categories and get best answers from there to maintain your TC. Of if your best answer percentage has dropped down to 10% or below, you'd just lose your TC badge right the way.

Thank you Alex.  As long as there is a good reason for being removed, I do not mind.  I just didn't know what the reasoning was.

Degree of participation(answers only), and number of best answers, determine the TC's.



You can ask all of the questions you wish, but they do not contribute: you loose points, and are given no credit for their quality, number of responses engendered nor stars received.

Maybe you should change your security settings. This should stop certain unwanted or possibly dangerous pop ups. If you use MS internet explorer this is how you do it
Open the IE window through the start menu, the quick start menu or by double clicking on the Internet Explorer icon.
Step2
Click on the “Tools” menu at the top of your screen or hold down ALT and hit T on your keyboard.
Step3
Select “Internet Options” by clicking on it or by pressing the up and down keys until it is highlighted, and hit ENTER.
Step4
Click on the tab at the top of the pop-up menu that says “security.”
Step5
Move the slider at the bottom of the menu up for a more secure setting or down for a less secure setting. The setting that you are at is displayed just to the right of the slider.
Step6
Click the OK button to save your settings. 
If you use a different browser just pop your question into the Yahoo search bar(short form) and you should find more links
