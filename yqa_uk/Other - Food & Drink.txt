Approximately how much does a big bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures cost?



I recently moved from the USA to Australia, and unfortunately, we can't get Reese's products here.  I was contemplating asking a friend of mine if he could send some out if I pay for them and postage, but was wondering how many bags to ask him for.  Could someone give me an idea of how much the Miniatures cost, along with Reese's Pieces and various other Reese's products?



Thanks in advance.

At the grocery store they run about 4-6 US dollars for a 20 oz. bag (roughly 70 miniatures). I'm not sure how big of a bag you are talking about, but a quick search on ebay gave alot of results like 6(12oz) bags for $7 (240 pcs).

In Alabama where I live, they had large bags of the mini peanutbutter cups for 4.98 at Walmart. They were the halloween version, but I'm sure you could get them all year round for about the same price.

Can anyone help me with a quote from Nigel Slater's Appetite?



Hi,
The passage I'm after is about ingredients that go together and why they go together.  It was a reading at the wedding of two 'foodie' friends of mine and I want to have some of it engraved on a cheese board for them.  I'd be verrryy grateful not to have to surreptitiously scribble it down in WH Smith's!



Thanks.

In Hawaii they serve rice in restaurants for breakfast every day- white rice. It was kinda weird seeing that at the buffet tables but a lot of their tourism comes from Asian countries so I guess they offer it for their benefit instead of the traditional western style breakfast. They even serve rice and noodles in McDonald's over there. Over here though I've had white rice with milk and sugar. Yum.

Cannibalistic societies that used to, obviously, eat people have been quoted as saying that pork is the closest flavor to human flesh. Apparently, humans have a "sweet" taste.



Interestingly, pig organs are also favored for human transplant as opposed to those of other animals.



For one of my sources, I've included a link from a contemporary (albeit insane) German cannibal who is on a video expressing his opinion that human beings taste closest to pork.

Hambone has it right.  29.6mL make 1 ounce.  However, mL is a more precise way of measuring.  If your recipe calls for mL and you're changing to ounces, you might be adding too much or too little liquid, especially if you're baking (where every measurement has to be precise).



However, if you're changing from ounces to mL, you should be fine.

But I think it's natural coz most women I know whether fat or thin eat too much nowadays so you needn't worry that much. You are not alone.

Everyone has a different metabolism. I don't think anything is wrong with you, and heck, there's nothing wrong with eating food. It's better to eat than eating nothing at all! But there should be a good balance. Try the following:



When you eat, try chewing slowly. It's supposed to make you full - faster !



When you eat, try eating healthy food. Sometimes when we eat junk food, our body has that sense of 'well, let me keep eating more junk food! '. And you're actually introducing more fat.



If you want, try eating small portions of every meal. Remember we can eat 6 times a day! That's breakfast - snack - lunch - snack - dinner - snack. So, there's plenty to eat! In snacks, it's best to eat 100 calorie foods.



Always drink aprox. 8 glasses of water every day! Water actually makes you full every now and then. And - it's healthy. The more water, the better. Because you're actually cleaning your system.

Of all the natural sources of Vitamin C the kakadu plum and the camu camu fruit have the highest concentrations with about 3100mg and 2800mg per 100g respectively... Orange (commonly known as a source of Vitamin C) on the other hand only contains about 50mg per 100g... Strawberries are about 60mg and Blackcurrant is about 200mg!

Every day is different- when I don't like who I am working with- I will have an asiago bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and red onions- everyone stays far away- on happy days I like the cinnamon crunch bagel with strawberry cream cheese- when I don't care that I am overweight- I get a steak bagel without egg from McDonald's

Unless they are made right, bagels are just bread in a different shape.  The best bagels I've had are made in Raleigh, NC by a family that moved from NY.  They even had an autographed photo of James Gandolfini on the wall!  They were great, I miss them now that we have moved to Pittsburgh.  I cannot find a real NY bagel here at all.  Real NY bagels NEVER have chocolate chips in them!  I just like the plain high fat cream cheese on them.

I can't see anything wrong with that. I've often wondered what cat meat tastes like. I also think a cat skin hat would look rather fetching.



Heres a receipe for you:
BEER ROASTED CAT
1 cat cut into roast
1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup
1 cube of beef bouillon
1 clove of garlic
1 Fine Irish Stout, a lot like a popular dark Irish Beer®, but NOT that brand at their lawyers' request. They alledge this article, educating others in the legal eating habits of over 100 million people world-wide, and specifically in rising East Asian markets, is "highly offensive."



Cover and soak cat roast in salt water for 24 hours. Drain water and then cover and soak in beer for 6 hours. Drain and place in crock pot with your cans of soup. Add a clove of garlic, and a cube of beef bouillon. If you start to slow cook your cat in the morning with your George Foreman Cooker (or it's ilk), you'll have finely cooked feline in time for supper.



If a slow cooker is not available, a cat can be baked at 350 degrees for 2-3 hours in a conventional oven and still come out pretty good. Beer Roasted Cat is fantastic served with mashed potatoes, collard greens, and fresh, homemade egg rolls. When planning a full meal just remember- cat is a course best served hot!



Cat may not be the most glamorous, or tastiest of game meats, but with a little thought and preparation, Baked Cat can make the belly of the persnicketiest diner glow with home baked goodness.

Yes that definitely sounds like a case of food poisoning.  That has happened to me 3 or 4 times from different restaurants.  No need to go to the emergency room.  You should feel better after a day, unless you have a really bad case of food poisoning.  Be sure to drink a lot of water to replace the fluids that you lost.
You might want to report that Taco Bell to the Health Department.

Yes. Unfortunately, you have to let it take its course.  Slowly sip a good quality ginger ale (schweppes), but let it go flat (no bubbles) first.  When you can eat again, try plain toast, rice and bananas (to restore the potassium that you lost while vomiting).  Eat slowly.  Feel better soon!

Time to see a Doctor! Luckily you've been noticing what's going on with you and are learning what may or may not work...now ask someone who's seriously educated about these things!  You may be pleasantly surprised -there are lots of medications and other healing methods out there that work for many -unlike a few generations ago. Take advantage of all that and go ask a professional or two. When you reach a solution you'll be glad you went -and I mean just glad...not kissing the sky glad , all heart in your mouth happy, just normal happy, which is good!  Take care of you!

Your growing up.  We all have to learn and continue to learn how to control our emotions as we get older.



We all have "Pet Peeves" I guess you could say.  The only way to work through the emotions is to face them and ask at that time "what is it making me have this emotion".



More importantly, most emotions are determined by the environment you put yourself in.  Such as going to a club although you know it makes you feel uneasy, or watching a movie that makes you look at yourself in a bad way.



Its always great to have someone you can talk to about your emotions too, your not the only one that is going through what your going through.



In the future be more specific about the mood your questioning.  The answers get better.



Lastly are you out of shape, believe it or not most people go through mood swings when their bodies aren't happy,  Try eating healthier, especially veggies, you'd be surprise.



Have you ever seen a mad vegan.

Do you all agree that the U.S. made chocolate now tastes terrible because of corporate greed?



From Hershey to all of the other U.S. candy manufacturers, they have ruined the taste of chocolate in their candies. All because of corporate greed. I would rather spend an additional .20 cents on a candy bar that is made of real chocolate, not that fake chocolate taste we have today.



Do you all concur?

Example: Back in the 70's Balmer Gold Brick Eggs were made from excellent tasting chocolate. Today the same candy tastes waxy and lacks real flavor.

There are real chocolate makers out there, you just have to spend more.  People who don't care have the option of spending less.  Welcome to capitalism.

I completely agree with you on that.  Most chocolate nowadays (especially during Easter season) taste like cardboard.  I love Godiva, which has actual chocolate products in thier store.  I even had a friend from abroad say that the Nestle crunch here in the States tastes horrible as compared to the same candy that she gets in Russia.  It is so sad that chocolate isn't even really chocolate anymore.

I don't think that Hershey has significantly changed their chocolate.  I suspect, rather, that you have been exposed to better chocolates and now taste Hershey for what it is: cheap chocolate.  Once you get used to better, it is hard to enjoy what you thought was bliss as a child just because you didn't know better then.

It has always been sub par compared to chocolate from over seas. Growing up my grandparents always brought us chocolate back from Germany when they went to visit family. They were born and raised in Germany coming here after they were married and were appalled when they bought their first American chocolate bar. They still have chocolate shipped from germany monthly.

You need vitamins and minerals, otherwise you'll start looking like an old lady when you're probably very young.... and you can wave goodbye to your fertility as well



Edit... and oh by the way excess water (eg if you're having way too much water) in the system can actually give you permanent brain damage, as it dilutes the salts your nervous system needs. Please read the link below

People who experience food cravings should not fast. Fasting is for experienced practitioners. You must meditate to extinguish desire, free yourself from craving... then you can try fasting. Even then, 15 days is far too long. Fasting is for cleansing, not for self-abuse.

Yes you can eat the skin on mackerel, especially if you grill it as it will become lovely and crispy. I don't think it's bad to eat it 3 x a week but i would go with fresh mackerel rather than smoked packet type.

Typically a compartment in the refrigerator door is for dairy foods that you want to keep slightly warmer.  Butter and cheeses are good examples of this.

cereal with vanilla soy milk, toast with pb or jam, several companies make breakfast bars...try a special k vanilla almond bar (they're delicious) or odwalla bars (chocolate chip peanut is the best...and loaded with protein to keep you full!!) or a fiber one bar.  You could have a croissant, muffin, bagel, pancakes, waffles, french toast (easy and delicious).  If you want to stay full till lunch...make sure whatever you eat for breakfast has a lot of protein and fiber...that'll keep you full!

it annoys me how every year rich people try to get people worse of than them to give money to charity when if they just gave some of their money they could stop children starving in 3rd world countries. (i'm not complaining about giving money to charities)

mmmm I'm eating a bagel with herb a garlic cream cheese on it right now.  Also cheese cake is made with cream cheese, and that really yummy nacho dip with the sour cream mixed with it.  Also my friends made this insanely good tater tots meal once!  It was tater tots, loaded with grated Cheddar cheese and cream cheese with seasonings and bacon bits and all kinds of fun stuff~!



Also you can use it as chip dip, or the inside of those jalapeno poppers, they are filled with cream cheese.  Sometimes in my house we will mix cream cheese with sour cream and use that for our porogies(spelling?).  Cream cheese it wicked and could pretty much go good with ANYTHING lol

Is it okay to drink milk after it's been frozen?



My boyfriend, for some reason, turned up the refrigerator last week and everything in it froze. I had a unopened gallon of milk that completely froze, would it still be okay to drink after it thaws?

Yes , entirely. It may look weird , kinda yellow. That's the fat and water separating , but when thawed it will be fine.
I had a girlfriend that was on WIC , and we had to freeze it on account of the ridiculous amount they required you to take. we told them we had too much , but they said it's all or nothing.

Yes you can drink milk after it is frozen... in fact lots of people freeze milk if they can't finish it before the use by date.  That way they can use it in recipes and such.  Now as far as taste goes... I don't know if it will taste any different.

is it a meeting for adults or for children?



you could always make something easy like rice krispy treats or brownies. or get a veggie or fruit tray to take.
or you could be creative and make some pumpkin dip since its the fall time and serve that with ginger snaps (i have a recipe if you want ill post it)
you can really make anything. i guess it depends what kind of meeting it is and who will be there.

i hate it when people suggest "a nice nutrient bar", or yogurt bar, or some kind of health bar. they don't fill you up that much.



i usually like to take cheese/ham crackers, juice (skip the soda just for dance rehers.), pizza bagels, hot-pockets, and other mini foods.

Both.  It's a root vegetable.



Herb, according to the all mighty wikipedia:
An herb is a plant grown for medicinal value or for flavoring food



It's used to flavor food and it has medicinal value.  But it's related to an onion, which is a root veggie.



So, yea, both.

Cole slaw has a base of cabbage and carrots with vinegar and mostly mayonnaise taste and has a sweetness to it.  Sauerkraut has the base of cabbage and has been in a vinegar brine, like pickles and is very sower.  If you love dill pickles, you will like sauerkraut, although sauerkraut is stronger in taste than dill pickles.  Cole slaw is served cold.  Sauerkraut should be served warm.

In case you're unaware, the 23 flavors that comprise the Dr Pepper recipe is a supreme secret of the Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages (CSAB) group. Depending on which account you trust--there's no official word from the company--either only a very few people know the Dr Pepper recipe or, in the slightly more extreme version, a few people know half of the recipe while a few others know the other half.

Maybe your mouth is too big?
Try eating slower and take smaller bites because it's healthier.
If this eating method is too uncomfortable, then maybe its time to get a new cereal?

You know those lovely French pains au chocolat that look like a chocolate sausage roll? My favourite way of eating nutella is to recreate them by cutting a slit in the top of a croissant and inserting a spoonfull or two inside, then microwave for 10 seconds. That's breakfast.



Then pancakes - About a half pint milk, 4 tablespoons flour and a couple of eggs, fling together in jug. Beat. I'm a bit vague on quantities so add more flour if mix looks too thin. A couple of spoonfulls fried in hot olive oil, flip, cooked pancake onto plate, filled with nutella and rolled, Greek yoghurt, sliced banana and golden granulated sugar on the top. Or skip the yoghurt and banana. That's lunch.



Something green and healthy for dinner. Then half melted icecream and nutella folded through for pudding.

Heat your water to just off the boiling point.  Use good water.  If your tap water tastes bad, use a bottled water you like.  Green tea has a delicate flavor and bad water will affect it's taste.



Pour hot water into a cup or teapot.  Add your tea.  Steep (usually) for 3 - 5 minutes.  Longer for stonger tea, shorter for weaker tea.  Drink and enjoy.



The below link has a lot of information on brewing tea, if you want to really get into it.

If you're not concerned about calories, have ice cream with malted milk(essentialy a milk shake).  If you are looking for a healthy snack try  apple slices, peanut butter & raisens or nuts, raisens, sunflower seeds.  Let me know if you would like anymore ideas from me. Enjoy! :)

It's not okay because if you do it to much, your stomach will hurt a lot. What i suggest is take the garbage can with you when your eating strawberries and when you get up to the leaf, toss it in the garbage can.

Milk sold in supermarkets is pasteurised and does not need boiling.  You only need to boil raw milk (from your own cows/goats/sheep or a farm you trust).  Too much heating destroys vitamins so if you want a warm milk drink just warm it, don't boil it.

I you live in a country that pasteurizes milk then you are wasting your time it is unnecessary (as long as it remains cool aka. fridge). Boiling it kills off bacteria and keeps it from spoiling but if it is pasteurized then it normally can be drunk before building up any noticeable amounts of bacteria.

Other than potato chips and peanuts, here is a list of High Sodium Foods:
A cup of canned soup has 1,000 mg of sodium, a cup of chili has 1,200 mg, a typical TV dinner has 1,150 mg and a slice of pizza has 900 mg. One hot dog has 900 mg of sodium, 1 oz of parmesan cheese has 500 mg of sodium and 3 oz of ham has 1,100 mg. Other high-salt items you might take by mouth include alkalizers, cough medicines, laxatives, mineral waters and pain relievers.

Beans grow in pods, like peas (lots of them side by side in a long sheath).  Some beans are harvested green (immature), such as French or runner beans.  Most other beans are left to mature on the vine, dried then hulled (dry sheath removed).  If you want to plant beans, put some dry beans in the ground in spring, about 10cm apart.  Once seedlings appear they will need a support to climb up.

They grow above ground on vines.  If you want to see one grow, get a couple of dried pinto beans.  Put them between several damp paper towels, of wrap the towels around a clear jar.  Put the beans between the towels and the glass so you can see them.



Keep the towels damp. Put in a window, but not in direct sun.  The beans will sprout in a few days.  You'll even get a little bean plant if you keep the towels wet.

Why the hell would they stop making them when they were by far the best product Hostess ever offered?  Cinnamon globs on yellow sponge cake, three to a pack.  Where did they go and why???

apple juice mixed in equal parts; with clean / filtered water is best.
look for juice with no preservatives & no added sugar.

most sodas (even lemonades) contain caffeine, so avoid them.



to begin with, make the decision to stop buying it. you may find the going difficult for a few days, but it is easier to resist the product at the store, than when its sitting in your house!



as a former smoker i know that i cannot have just one cigarette.
out of necessity i assumed the viewpoint of extremes (with nothing in between) of either smoking a pack a day, or not smoking at all, because of the escalating nature of addiction, in which; the more the substance is consumed, the more it is craved & so on..



it is important to keep this in mind once we are clear of our addictions, because dangerous thinking can lead to a pitfall.



the confidence that recovery builds can give us a false sense that we have conquered our addictions in such a way that we can toy with them.
can you just drink one? if you cannot control it, its better not to have it. ever.



if you must have caffiene, try making a refreshing iced tea with lemon & honey, to gently wean off it.
..or try 1 Tblsp apple cider vinegar with honey mixed in water; it is a very healthful drink-it will give you more of a buzz than any soda pop!



you may also benefit from buying a urinary alkaliser such as citravescent, which contains baking soda, (available from chemists) to regulate the acidity caused by excessive amounts of sugar (which can rob calcium from your bones). these drinks contain electrolytes, like gatorade (but minus the testicle-shrinking brominated oils lol)



but the apple cider vinegar will help reduce acidity also.



even if you cant kick your habit, you can minimize damage by steering clear of artificial diet flavours, as the chemicals can be very harmful.



also, take a look at how your addiction developed. do you watch a lot of tv? when we watch tv we open ourselves to being programmed by the will of advertisers.



dont forget the most important aspect of life is to look after your soul, which never dies.



make sure you have a good relationship with the Lord :D
ask  Him for help. it was He who helped me quit smoking.
Glory to God!

Approximately how much does a big bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures cost?



I recently moved from the USA to Australia, and unfortunately, we can't get Reese's products here.  I was contemplating asking a friend of mine if he could send some out if I pay for them and postage, but was wondering how many bags to ask him for.  Could someone give me an idea of how much the Miniatures cost, along with Reese's Pieces and various other Reese's products?



Thanks in advance.

A saltine or soda cracker is a thin, usually square cracker made from white flour, shortening, yeast, and baking soda, with some varieties lightly sprinkled with coarse salt. It has perforations throughout its surface, to allow steam to escape for uniform rising, and along the edges, as individual crackers are broken from larger sheets during manufacture. It has a very dry and crisp texture, as it is made with less shortening than varieties such as Ritz crackers.



Some familiar brand names of saltine crackers in the United States are Nabisco's Premium and Keebler's Zesta. Low-sodium saltines as well as unsalted-top versions are commonly available. Also available in stores are whole-wheat saltines.

A chef is a person who cooks professionally. In a professional kitchen setting, the term is used only for the one person in charge of everyone else in the kitchen, the executive chef.



A cook follows the instructions set forth by the chef.  In the case of a diner or a place like Denny's, there is no chef, all are cooks usually called "short order cooks"

I guess it varies from place to place, but in all the places I've worked a chef is a person who has chosen to make a career of cooking and is passionate about food.
For them, being a chef is a profession and not just a job.



A cook is someone who comes into work and does whatever they're told for the paycheque at the end.

Well as a career Chef....i think the term Chef applies when someone has taken the time to go to university/further education to study.
Perhaps also specialising in aspects of cookery which their are many ie,master saucier,baker etc
*grins* many people in the trade are self taught/called Chefs & some are naturally brilliant but i think its fair to give some bias here to those that have sort formal academic recognition.

Why should you laugh. They both tasted completely different. I like liver pate but I don't like fried liver. Some people don't like Cheese but like melted Cheese. They again taste different. People all around the world like different cooking methods, different textures, don't mind it if it's in a sand-which or on a pizza but otherwise hate it. People tastes whatever they may be should never be laughed at.

I can understand it.  Fried liver can be dry and quite bitter depending on the source of the meat and the cook.
Liver pate is usually much creamier and more digestible.
I don't "hate" fried" - if that is what is on offer, then I will eat and enjoy it.  Given the choice, I'd go for a well-seasoned pate, perhaps on hot toast.  My husband cooks a mean chopped chicken liver pate which he learned from his mother; he has the Contract in our house!

Bread is delivered on regular basis. Each day has a different color twist tie. They are:



Monday- Blue
Tuesday- Green
Thursday- Red
Friday- White
Saturday- Yellow



So today being Tuesday, I want a green tie - not red which is Thursday (almost na week old?)

The tabs if you notice are colour coded by when the bread is going to expire.



For example all the blue tabbed ones might expire on Nov 10 and all the pink ones on Nov 12.



Do you mean tabs or twist ties?

Place whole, unwashed peppers in a sealed plastic bag and refrigerate for a week or more. Beware of any excess moisture in the bag that could cause peppers to spoil. Red, orange, and yellow peppers are fully ripe and need to be eaten sooner. Peppers store best at 50°F.

Place them in the veggie bin or draw.  I store all my seeded veggies together and the unseeded ones in another area.  I have heard this is the best way to make them last the longest.  Also if you have to many than seeded them and freeze them and use them to cook with when the prices during the winter are to high to buy them.  They freeze very well.

China & the melamine problem.?



With all the stuff coming out of China, food in particular is what I am asking about.  Do the labels for food sold in the U. S. show SOMEWHERE, on that label whether the food is produced/made/ingredients from China?  The milk was bad enough, but now there is candy out there etc.,  can any of you inform the rest of us how to check and look out for this?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Well, starting today, the USDA is making it so that retailers have to put stickers on foods (meats, veggies and fruits) showing where they originated from. Some retailers will have that on packaged products but I guess we will have to see how that works. I couldn't tell one how to look for melamine tainted products because those recalled items were simply contaminated. Melamine would never make it on an ingredients label. This has been going on for about a decade with recalled items leading back to China. The only thing I could suggest is to look at the labeling and if it's manufactured, processed or originating from China, find an alternative.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Thanks. I knew they wouldn't list melamine on the label, but just hadn't/haven't paid attention as to country of origin or country for ingredients.. and didn't know if that was/would be listed..Thanks again!

The answer is yes and no. We may not know where all the ingredients come from. But if the food or for instance toothpaste is processed somewhere so the country of Origin is listed on the packaging. Food since it is processed on such a large scale these days is a crap shoot anyway. Let see lettuce, sprouts, apples, apple juice, hamburger, jalapeno pepers and even fresh tomatos.

A sandwich is the best thing to eat. It has meat, cheese, bread, and veggies. That's four out of five food groups and they taste slam-in. At least I think so.

A sandwich is two pieces of bread with something in between them and used for mainly a snack or lunch.  Now can you explain your question better if I have not answered it properly it is because you did not write it properly.

Am I going to die now :S  / Cadbury's Recall!?



ACK! My coworker told me yesterday there is a recall on Cadbury's chocolate; so this morning I decided to do a search on it. I assumed it was chocolate bars; and I happened to be eating one of these (which I just removed from the candy dish) when google provided this lovely link.

</question>



<additional details>



I'm in the US too, but I bought these eclair things at Cost Plus World Market...already ate half the bag; but won't be eating anymore...that's for sure :)



You'll have to get in line for the dogs M.M. :) They've got quite the following :D



The part that was crazy was I had one in my mouth when the article popped up...



btw: I didn't really think I was going to die...just being dramatic. The Cadbury's website issued a statement saying that Only Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Australia were affected and no other countries need to worry. Regardless...I will be tossing these; I don't want my coworkers eating them.

if you read the article through and through, it says you would have to have consumed a LOT.  The babies got so sick because they are small and their immune systems and stomachs are still weak.



You should be fine.  Stop eating them (like you have) and just relax.  Get your mind off of it.  Also, 32,000 chinese babies got sick from this milk, but only 4 (even though it is terrible) died.  So you will not die.



But isn't great when you have lunch and realize that what you just ate may be contaminated with something?  God, the panic it sends me!  I'm OCD so a lot of times I check around to make sure none of my food has been recalled.



You'll be fine, and just get your mind off it for a couple days and you will find that you didn't get sick.

In mexico we have used Lemon Grass for many centuries.



We use it as a tea; you boil it in water and  drink it you can add sugar if you like.



We often use it for problems with the urinary system. Like when you have pain when urrintaing. It is highly medicinal.

Edible Arrangements, Fresh Fruit Bouquet Company, Fruit Flowers are dangerous? Avoid?



For all of you that have order and paid the crazy over priced money for fruit arrangements.  They are dangerous!  I was at a party and the children came a running to get a fruit skewer filled with grapes.  Parents thinking oh great they are eating fruit and not cake.  Wrong there is not a 7 inch long pointed wooden spear in the middle of the cake.  Not to mention these skewers splinter.  Stay away.  Plus who would want fruit that is uncovered that others have been touching and in contact with.



Yuck.  Germs people, this is open fruit sitting around for who knows how long.  I am sure a law suit has already been filed for the youngster that got stabbed in the back of the mouth, or eye with the wooden pointy stick.

True, but that is why you should ask people to wash their hands, and I don't believe they meant it for children to eat, but rather for adults to enjoy.  For children that do eat it, it is the parent's responsibility to either remove the skewer for younger children, or observe middle-aged children.



If you're going to freak out about stuff like this, than please do not drive.  What if the next driver falls asleep at the wheel?  What if you hit a patch of ice?  What if you fall asleep?  What if... what if... what if...

Well lets face it anyone knows to watch their children and the host of the gathering should also be aware and making noises of being careful. How else would the fruit stand up in a bowl....some serious common sense should be taken when ordering these types of fruit bowl.Beautiful and  decorative as they may be CAUTION should be taken. Bamboo scewers do splinter and children should be taught and reminded often about that. AND YES CAKES CAN and DO CONTAIN SCEWERS TO HOLD THE LAYERS FROM SLIDING. Just so you are aware of that. Also, all food service people are supposed to wear gloves to maintain sanitary conditions. And if you are skiddish, don't eat it....but don't flap the lips before you have all the facts.

That could be true, I don't know. I'm only answering this to say that if you don't smoke cigars but want to try them, smoking this cigar won't do much for you. Visit a tobacconist (a quality one) in a cigar shop and have them make suggestions. They should ask you questions on the kinds of things you like to eat, tastes, etc.

Well, they say that people who fidget, who just can't keep still, that even when sitting may be swinging their foot, actually burn up energy and are less likely to be overweight. Chewing obviously will burn a few calories, but perhaps the best benefit is that while you are chewing gum, you are not feeding your face.

When you're hungry you can chew gum instead of eating and yes it'll make your body think you're eating. But don't worry because gum only has usually 5 calories or less. For added benefits, chew trident to whiten your teeth while at the same time keeping yourself not hungry.

Geez, I don't know why people get on here and just throw out blind guesses at answers.  This is a good question with a lot of stupid answers given.  Here are the facts.



Chewing gum can make you lose weight, not because of the negligible amount of calories it burns though.  Your body sort of has a mind of its own if you will.  Hunger is a very complex reflex, and you can trick your body into thinking you are not hungry anymore by doing certain things.  One of those things is chewing.  In fact, when you sit down to a normal meal, if you chew your food more, you will find that you will eat less.  So, chewing gum can actually trick part of the body's hunger reflex into thinking you are not hungry, so as a result you will eat less and lose weight.



However, like I said, hunger is very complex, so there are many more factors that come into play such as smells, calorie intake, sugar intake, physical exertion, etc.

Starbucks information?



Hello, every1. I nd ur help badly. I need to understand Starbucks products to do my assignment. This their website: http://www.starbucksstore.com/products/s...



Hope you can assist me to these questions.
1. In flavors, Starbucks categorise their coffee as



&gt;Mild
&gt;Medium
&gt;Bold



&gt;Extra Bold.



Their difference is in terms of what?



2. For Bean Preference, they hv
&gt;  Whole
&gt;  Ground
&gt;  Pods
&gt;  Filter Pack
&gt;  Portion Pack



What does each means? I'm not a coffee lover, so I don't quite know the difference.



3. I've been searching everywhr for the price of the products Starbucks sold in Malaysia. I need their products pricing in ringgit. If you can provide me with the website, I'll be very thankful.



Thank you so much for your assistance.

<answer>



1. The roasting process determines the flavour. Mild is lightly roasted
2. Whole: whole beans. Ground: pre-ground coffee which can be put straight into an expresso machine/plunger. Filter pack- could be in a filter, so you can put it into hot water, like a teabag?



Not sure about the rest. I'm not sure, just making it up, but I work in a coffee shop (not starbucks though, we only have whole bean coffee)

Hi Niamh,



I wouldn't say it has goodness like an orange has, I like drinking it as I find it refreshing especially with a slice of lemon, you can drink it hot or cold.
It helps you to feel relaxed and aids sleep so go ahead and try some you may become hooked.
Bye.

I love it. If you buy the dried flowers instead of the teabags, you get a much fuller flavour and I find it's more effective when it comes to helping with sleep or relaxation.  Just use a little sieve or filter as with tea leaves ect...

You need to read up on what Veal really is.



It's not the fact that it's a young cow.



Veal calves are immobilized for the entire period of their life. They are often kept in very small boxes to prevent them from ever sitting down, turning around or moving. They are typically kept in the dark and fed with a feeding tube so their neck muscles don't start to toughen up.



If they're not in a box, they're chained to the floor where they cannot stand, look around or move.



Lambs, however, are allowed to frolic free in a field with their herd. They're not restrained and confined. They're not tortured just to keep their young meat tender.

People have put a lot of effort into dirtying up the word 'veal' by connecting it to sad images of lil' baby cows unable to move and slaughtered young.



Where as the same connotation hasn't been placed on the word lamb, or heck, young lamb.

Good question, I never thought of it that way.  I have heard that the baby cows are made to stand in one place and are force feed before they are killed, lambs are blindfolded and given a cigarette before they are killed.  I guess that is more humane.  "It's ok to eat fish cause they don't have any feet" Nirvana

Just try not to over stuff the taco when you make it. I know they are messy and I think that's expected so don't worry about it too much. Just don't chew with your mouth open or slurp the sauce off the side of your hand when it runs out of the taco.

Well popcorn of course! But if you don't like popcorn, maybe you could do fritos or doritos or lays or cheetos. Anything from the fritolay company! Maybe if you have a sweet tooth, you could do marshmallows with chocolate dipping or ice cream with any flavor syrup. i just love watching movies at home!

Coke Zero is sweetened with a combination of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K). Coke Zero is the same basic formula as classic Coke while Diet Coke is a different formula completely. Diet Coke is sweetened with aspartame only. There are unsubstantiated theories (at least by Coca Cola) that the unsuccessful release of Coke Two or new Coke was actually the formula for Diet Coke, just sweetened with the classic sugar combination.



Also, Coke Zero has 0.5 kilocalories per 100ml while Diet Coke, oddly enough, still contains one calorie.



One other rational for the Coca Cola release of Coke Zero is that men are reluctant to buy diet coke because of the association with dieting and women. Much of the marketing of Coke Zero in the US is directed toward men and activities often associated with masculinity.



On a side note, in many european countries and pan american/south american countries, Coke Zero is released as Coca Cola Light.

1 pound bacon, diced



2 cups diced onions



1 tablespoon chopped garlic



1 pound dried navy white beans, soaked overnight and drained



1/2 cup Steen's 100 percent Pure Cane Syrup



1/2 cup light brown sugar



2 1/2 cups ketchup



1/4 cup yellow mustard



Salt and black pepper



1 gallon chicken stock



2 bay leaves



Directions
In a large pot, over medium heat, add the bacon and render until crispy, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the onions and continue to saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the garlic and beans and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the cane syrup, brown sugar, ketchup and mustard. Season with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly. Stir in the chicken stock. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook the beans for about 4 hours, or until tender, stirring occasionally. From time to time, one might need to add a little water at a time if the beans need some to prevent burning.

you should be fine.  I would suggest putting it on a plate before putting it in your fridge.  once it starts to thaw it can be a mess.  depending also on how big it is, you may get a better result eating it tomorrow night.  Sometimes meat can take two days to defrost completely

Gonna do exactly this, checked the steak, and its much too frozen for tonight... so im gonna cook it tomorrow nite! wish me luck!

So let me get this straight - you opened a package of steak, cooked half immediately and then froze the other half, uncooked - right? In that case, yes you can thaw the steak in your fridge, assuming that you bought it fresh and it was never frozen, or you bought it frozen and it never thawed the first time.



What you should NOT do is freeze the meat, thaw it, and then refreeze it without cooking it.



However, if you thaw it, cook it, and then freeze it again, it's ok.



That said, depending on the size of the steak, one day in the fridge might not be long enough to thaw it - but give it a try! You can also defrost it in the microwave, or in a plastic bag (like a Ziploc) in hot water.

But the quicker way to thaw is put it in Ziploc and then melt it in hot water . Keep check water to make sure it aint cool or getting cold. Some people defrost it in Microvaw but I don't because once people defrost it in microvaw , streak will turn brown and then they will think it means it is done! lol...it is wrong. it is at least an hour of cooking.

well, if it was already open it is not recommended to refreeze,



step 1 : keep meat in freezer
step 2: thaw in refrigerator
step 3 : if a portion is left uncooked leave in refrigerator covered in plastic or aluminum until ready to use again

that is actually the safest place for you to thaw any meat. left on the counter top it is exposed to all types of bacteria that are just waiting to share that steak with you.

yes. As long as it looks good, no brown spots or mold, and it smells ok, then yes. Just cook it real done. Next time, make sure to wrap your meat really well. Good luck with the steak tonight.

At some places the cones are. But what they mean by small and medium is the amount of ice cream. There should be more ice cream on the medium than small.

Yes - it was very nice too! Here's a recipe:
Ingredients
450g/1lb sloes
225g/8oz caster sugar
1 litre/1¾ pint gin



Method
1. Prick the tough skin of the sloes all over with a clean needle and put in a large sterilised jar.
2. Pour in the sugar and the gin, seal tightly and shake well.
3. Store in a cool, dark cupboard and shake every other day for a week. Then shake once a week for two months.
4. The sloe gin will now be a beautiful dark red and ready to drink, although it will still improve with keeping.
5. Variation: make blackberry brandy in the same way, substituting blackberries for the sloes and brandy for the gin. Blackberries do not need pricking.

I like Chocaussie because of how how easy/fun it is to pronounce. But if I were you, I'd give it a name that sounds Aussie, but doesn't actually contain part of the word "Australia". In that case, it would be Chocmate.



So in conclusion...... Chocmate.

Just think ALSO about the following:-



Patrick Wall, chairman of the European Food Safety Authority, recently asked whether it is "morally or ethically correct" to feed grain to animals while people starve. Rearing animals for human consumption is a shocking waste of resources: 16lbs of grain are needed to produce just 1lb of animal flesh. The world's cattle alone consume the same amount of calories it would take to feed more 8.7 billion people – that’s more than the entire human population on Earth.



Some more statistics for you: ninety per cent of the agricultural land in the UK is used to raise livestock, but still we do not have enough grain and so we import 46 million tonnes annually from developing countries. These are countries which not only suffer environmental degradation as a result but, in many cases, cannot afford to feed their own people. Every day, 24,000 people die from hunger and hunger-related causes; 75 per cent of them children less than five years old. Meanwhile, millions of tonnes of grain are being siphoned off to feed animals destined for the already groaning dining tables of countries with the fattest populations in the world.



Factory farming puts a serious strain on our water supplies too. While millions face drought, much of the world's water supply is diverted to animal agriculture. A study this year by the Stockholm International Water Institute, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Water Management Institute found it takes up to 4,000 litres of water to produce one kilogramme of wheat but up to 20,000 litres of water to produce one kilogramme of beef. A totally vegetarian diet requires 300 gallons of water per day, while a meat-eating diet requires more than 4,000 gallons of water per day.

From an ethics point of view the average chicken is probably the worst thing for you, as a vegetarian, to eat. Only if it is a free-range bird can you have a clear conscience.
From a purely medical point of view then introduce it slowly and make sure it has been WELL cooked.

You won't become physically ill. Our bodies can digest animal just fine, we evolved that way over thousands of years, it doesn't change over the course of 20. I'm curious why you want to start eating chicken though. A vegetarian diet is healthy and fulfilling, we don't require animal flesh to be healthy.



***EDIT*** I had that problem too. If you're in or near Canada KFC has a vegetarian sandwich that you cannot distinguish from their classic sandwich. Every time I bite into it I get grossed out for a second and need to pick at it with my fingers to make sure it has the right "feeling" for the veggie one and not the meat one ;)

Not at all as long as you have a 3 or 4 ounce portion and do not load it down with gravy you should be fine.



Remember you can enjoy all foods in moderation.



You can have a slice or two, just do not eat the whole thing and you will be just fine.

Do you go to the same store all the time? If you do then I would check around. I've found that different stores carry different kinds. For example, I used to be able to find their Won Ton soup anywhere, but now I can only find it at one place. Your store might have dropped it.

Take a left at the texaco station, go straight until you see a man in a yellow raincoat, his name is Aco, He'll guide you to an underwater tunnel that will lead yo to the outskirts of cambodia there you will find the mystical peppercorns of King Leon.

How many hamsters to make "hamster burrito"?



Hello friends



Where i originally come from, great nation of Turkmenistan, we eat something that you call "hamster." You know, the small fun creature that tastes succulent. Anyways, in my time here in USA, i have come to know tasty treat known as "burrito." So, now my question to you is, how can i combine my special snack with tasty burrito treat? How many hamsters do you American chefs and cooks put in burrito? For maximum taste that is. I really would like to tell. Thanks!

I'm just trying to picture how you would prepare them in Turkmenistan?  There really can't be much meat on them!  Please elaborate...
And as for the burrito - try it the American way and leave those pets to the six year olds....that old saying "when in Rome do like the Romans...." I think applies here.

Depends what the liquor is.  If it's rum, it will last forever (unless I get to your fridge first).



Otherwise, about 3-4 days. Longer if the container is sealed.

Green tea is supposed to help speed up your metabolism..
(hopefully that will help me lose weight faster!!)



I used to guzzle Diet Mountain Dew until I just heard on CBS morning show that diet soda can "make you fat".... cause it's got ASPARTANE in it, an artificial sweetener that SLOWS metabolism..



I'd recommend UNSWEETENED green tea , with lots of lemon,
or the 64 ounce plastic container of Arizona diet green iced tea with Splenda...(hopefully Splenda is not as bad for us as Aspartane!!)
it's got ginseng in it, too, and tastes delicius..



Green tea has oxidants in it, supposed to fight off cancer, etc!



Good luck to us!!!!!

Green Tea in general is good for the immune system, heart, and almost every other organ. Tea when it isn't sweetened or added to milk is very nutritious for you, it provides plenty of vitamins, nutrients, minerals, antioxidants. Coffee when not loaded with sugar and creamer is also filled with antioxidants. Please don't cut them out of your diet. Coffee should be 1-3 cups a day and tea should be 3-5 cups. If you were to cut anything out I would suggest pop, juice (contains a lot of sugar unless you make your own), sugar, alcohol (if you drink yet but 1 oz. of red wine is good for the heart.)

I have a pint of blueberries frozen in my freezer in a little bag.  How much yogurt do I need for a smoothie?



I'd like to just use the whole pint.  Do I need to thaw them?  If I then put the blender pitcher in the refrigerator, how long until it's not good anymore?  I was hoping to have it for breakfast for maybe 2 or 3 days, and just blend it again quick each morning to fluff it up.  But not sure if it will seperate.  I've never made smoothie's before.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



No need to defrost them. One glass of milk or yogurt with one glass of fruit will make a nice sized smoothie.



I would advise you make it fresh each morning as the fruit will maintain allm of its goodness while frozen.

I looked at the sugar puffs and the packet had been left open since yesterday and it put me off.  So I plumped for toast with real local butter and slithers of onion (I know, I know weird) and a cup of oat-so-simple in the microwave with the milk.  I is 'appy agen.

Slow cooker is useful for a lot more things. Pressure cooker is only really good for things that take a long time to cook, like dried beans or squash. Slow cooker you can do meat...vegetables...lasagna...even dessert. Plus you can start something in the morning and it's perfect and ready for dinner!

Try sucking on a peppermint.  Apparently that scent will help curb your hunger.



Alternatively, try distracting yourself with another activity.  If you're not physically hungry (stomach growling), then if you do something to take your mind off food, maybe that will help keep you from feeling hungry until it's mealtime.

Real strawberry chunks vs. little red dots?



Why are the food companies trying to play with our minds?  Take strawberry muffins, for instance.  They don't have real strawberry chunks, like you would make them with, but instead, little red dots that are supposed to be strawberry.  That doesn't make it strawberry, people! It's just not grand....

When I'm going to be home late, and in a real hurry.

But often they are sooooooo expensive, for the size you get.

I have found a better way is to get roast chickens which cook in the microwave. They are usually the same price, but much bigger, and they turn out BEAUTIFUL

note: i didn't believe my Friend when she told me you could cook a chook in the mike, until i saw one and tried it myself-

I would say, overall, yes. But, I just get some organic foods that I think are the best to get in organic. Like, cereal. I don't like eating things that are preserved in BHT, in longterm studies that has been show to be a cancer causing chemical. So I like Kashi or orangic cereals.  Any pre-packaged snack foods I also try to limit and I buy Kashi products or other healthier alternatives that don't have a lot of preservatives and chemicals in it.  It is healthier for your body and years of eating this way will pay off.

I buy all natural peanut butter, but regular smuckers jelly, I buy regular fruits.....only some things organic, like cereal and snack foods.

Depends. If they're organic/you're sure there are not that many chemicals on them, you can just scrub than. If they're supermarket ones, you need to peel them as all the chemicals that are used to keep them so pretty usually accumulate in the skin.

If they are baby carrots then then should be fine without peeling but you will notice some can look quite wrinkly and stained so they are best peeled.

Never carve meat straight from the oven..allow to rest for a while for the juices to settle before carving. Then pull the skin back from the breast and it should be easier.

Let it sit at least 20 minutes lightly covered to let the juices reabsorb into the meat.  Cut the skin between the leg/thigh and body and break the thigh from the body.  Cut this off and separate thigh and leg if desired.
cut and pull wing away from the body as much as you can (doesn't have to be totally removed yet) Start slicing the breast with a cut just above wing running all the way down the the "fanny" end.  Then cut the top of the breast downward toward the first cut moving the knife along the ribs to get the most of the breast in one slice (this takes practice).  Repeat other side.  After you have 2 "slabs" of breast meat, you can put it on a cutting board and slice it into serving size pieces (or if you're like my husband, he'll take the whole thing!!)



Good luck.

If I eat lots, then, most probably I'd be sleepy... but if I eat something light and sweet, like chocolate, probably I can do more work :)

Super Noodles or Pot Noodles are pretty good for quick sustenance.
They also make all manner of pasta pots and a just add water cous cous which albeit a bit boring is cheap and very filling.
Snacks too, pringles, etc. 
Cereal bars are better than cereal as you dont have the milk issue.
I would reccommend taking lots of packs of tissues as opposed to full loo rolls as you tend to find that you use them twice and then leave em out in the rain. but NOT kleenex balsam.
There will be plenty of food stalls around, but they can be a bit pricey, if money is tight try going for a vegetarian option at the food stall, will be cheaper.
Also remember plenty of mixer for the J.D they will charge over the odds on site.

Have a fab time!!

I have 2 that I really can't choose between and both come from my local butcher (so I know the quality of the meat)
He does a lovely Pork and Apple - just perfect, grilled and served in a toasted bun with some caramelised onions
Or the Beef and Guiness - sauteed with onions and served with mash potato and gravy.

I also enjoy plain old pork... in a sausage sandwich with ketchup

White Chocolate Cake



Submitted by: VanDerStad
Rated: 4 out of 5 by 68 members 	Prep Time: 20 Minutes
Cook Time: 35 Minutes 	Ready In: 55 Minutes
Yields: 12 servings
"This is a very heavy white chocolate cake with a white chocolate frosting. It is a family favorite that is requested at every family gathering."
INGREDIENTS:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 (1 ounce) squares white
chocolate, chopped
1/2 cup hot water
1 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 cups white sugar
3 eggs



1 cup buttermilk



6 (1 ounce) squares white
chocolate, chopped
2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose
flour
1 cup milk
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
DIRECTIONS:
1. 	Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sift together the 2 1/2 cups flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
2. 	In small saucepan, melt 6 ounces white chocolate and hot water over low heat. Stir until smooth, and allow to cool to room temperature.
3. 	In a large bowl, cream 1 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Stir in flour mixture alternately with buttermilk. Mix in melted white chocolate and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.
4. 	Pour batter into two 9 inch round cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
5. 	To make Frosting: In a medium bowl, combine 6 ounces white chocolate, 2 1/2 tablespoons flour and 1 cup milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is very thick. Cool completely.
6. 	In large bowl, cream 1 cup butter, 1 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla; beat until light and fluffy. Gradually add cooled white chocolate mixture. Beat at high speed until it is the consistency of whipped cream. Spread between layers, on top and sides of cake.

Are you kidding me. They actually have Cheese and Garlic Flavor Ice Cream?  Well when you say they don't have these flavor anymore, that means they made it before. Maybe because those flavors of ice cream wasn't such a big hit. That is why they don't make it anymore

Green Tea is a SUPERFOOD!! It tastes great and has many health benefits --
*It is traditionally used to alleviate stomach problems, vomiting, and diarrhea. 
*It's also been found to reduce blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blockages of the blood vessels in the heart that can lead to heart attacks. 
*Herbalists claim Green Tea also has powerful anti-cancer properties and believe that it is also useful in treating some bacterial infections.
*The May 2008 issue of the American Thoracic Society's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine reported that green tea polyphenols (GTP, for short) actually helped in reducing the memory loss and inflammation that afflict sleep apnea sufferers.
*Studies in Japan have shown that people who drink five or more cups of green tea each day are sixteen per cent less likely to suffer from coronary artery disease.
*Green Tea may also be good for people who want to lose weight. It is a natural diuretic.
*It also has cosmetic benefits – Green Tea extracts help the skin to reduce wrinkling, leathering and premature skin aging.



As for drinking it in a citurs flavour, I think it should be fine. In fact scientists have discovered that mixing green tea with other substances, such as citrus juices, vitamin C and even soy milk and rice milk, increases the amount of the antioxidants that can be absorbed by the body!

Happy drinking!!

I am a former chef and the people who have suggested Digestives or Mc Vities Biscuit are correct any wholemeal biscuit or sweet tea biscuit, processed in a food mill or MagiMix to crumbs is fine and if it is for cheesecake or a pastry base, just melt some butter or marg and a bit of dark brown sugar, and mix it like sage and onion stuffing to a meal and press it into the cake tin for baking.

I made an American style cheesecake for my friends in Liverpool and now that all they make for guest at tea or over for dinner.

Ritz crackers are not the same as graham crackers.

Graham crackers are a bit sweet.  They are light brown in color.  You may call them biscuits in the UK.  Another way I think of them as is a healthy non frosted cookie.  In the US we eat them plain or often crush them and use them with a little melted butter and sugar to press into a pie tin for a crust.  Cheesecakes often have this crust.

blend at least a pound of frozen blueberries, berries or fruit in the blender, mix with yoghurt for a smoothy or rum for some fun and just wait. repeat as necessary. rum mix easier and more pleasant to get down.. laxatives take at least 12 hours sometime so dont be taken by surprise.. ;)

you are retarded, sorry i dont usually say that but yeah.

you cant even choose to go bulimic in the first place. and it wont make you "loose a little fat" it will just make you barf up the last meal you ate. and by doing this your body will go into survival mode and start eating itself and make you fatter, unless you do it long term.

Good luck! : )

Yeah, that doesn't work but if you just stop snacking you will loose a lot of weight ~ if you must snack pick one favorite and eat a couple of bites in the morning is best but that is it



Have an apple everyday because it makes you less hungry and eat breakfast you will loose weight pretty quick

You will not lose 'a little fat' through making yourself sick.  You will damage your throat and teeth from the acid that you bring up in the vomit though.

The only way to burn fat is through exercise so that means working yourself into a sweat for 40mins 5 times a week.  And no fingers down the throat required.



Oh, and making yourself sick IS the start of bullemia.

If you want to "lose a little fat", try a lobotomy and stop asking for advice on how to do a completely, unhealthy, disgusting act. Do you know that the acid in your stomach will rot your teeth over time? Yeah, that's really attractive. A bony chick with rotten teeth. How about putting down the brainless, unrealistic glamour mags and buying a book on self esteem so you can accept yourself the way you are and realize that men are attracted to ALL body types of women? In fact, every man I've ever talked to has said that they find nothing attractive about bony women. Don't be a fool.

If you want to lose fat cut the carbs, cut the calories, and workout.  Look up an ideal wieght for your age and height and use that as your guide.  It is not a good idea to try to throw up.  Those who do, they start with the same ideas about losing body weight and when they don't get results right away they get even more obsessive about it until it becomes an addiction.  That is when things get dangerous.  The best and most effective way is watching what you eat and exercise, it improves more than just body fat issues, it also improves the health.  The healthier you are the better you will appear

What can i use for a bread substitution?



i am trying to lose about 10-15 pounds in the next 2 months. i'm working out 1-2 hours a day cardio and weight training. i've already lost some weight in this past month so it is doable. i was just wondering what would a healthy bread substitute be, i notice that i eat a lot of carbs, that is the only thing holding me back from losing more weight. i like sandwiches for lunch, veggies, fruits. blahblahblah



</question>



<additional details>



okay yeah i'm just going to be anorexic AGAIN no thanks, stupid answers. people are so rude! 
yes i love brown rice! but i meant for making sandwiches and things but i can just cut it out and use lettuce instead which would work in a way? kind of messy haha. maybe pita bread or something? i just need to cut back on the carbs

I like to bite the top off and try to eat the white and yolk separately, then the chocolate.  My wife likes to just eat it regular style (with a glass of milk on the side).
But I also do that with reeses peanut butter cups.  I eat some of the outside "ring" of chocolate, then bite the peanut butter part, then I finish the chocolate.

It depends on how much you're willing to put into it :]
Anyone can set a timer and walk away, but it takes a good cook to sit there and watch their meal.

Usually you can find cooking classes at your local Community College.

Good Luck!

go to foodnetwork.com which is of course the website for the food network. They have plenty of recipes and healthy recipes that you could try. When you ask how hard it is to learn to cook it depends on what you mean. To prepare already created recipes its not too difficult, but if your talking about professional chef that takes years. I think though you are referring to the former thing though. Just make sure to follow the recipe and give yourself plenty of time for prep and cooking because if you arent familiar with cooking it can take longer and you dont wanna rush it. Just have fun and the more you cook the better you become.

cooking comes form the heart.

So if you have the desire and passion to please someone by cooking for them or just for you. you can do it.

A few tips
1, get a good resource for the recipes you are looking for. The internet has some cook resources. BE careful, some internet recipes don't work. a library will be a good resourec for good cook books.
2. tools and equipment
Make sure you have the right tools and equipment.
Example; if the recipe calls for a cast iron pan, get a cast iron pan.
Sharp knives also help the preparation
3. Ingredients. 
Fresh, fresh , fresh and preprae your food so it is ready when you are ready to eat.
4. read the recipe 2 times. make your grocery list. 
read the recipe before you start cooking.
5 Then follow the recipe.

Host can be a general term for someone who's hosting a party, a program, or the likes. It's someone who entertains guests either at home or elsewhere.

Synonyms:
entertainer, toastmaster, master, mistress, hostess, talk-show moderator, master of ceremonies, mistress of ceremonies, M.C., emcee

Hostess: same definition, but specifically used for a female host.

I'd have kippers with salad, but for breakfast, I think people who do actually eat them at that time of day (if you could stomach it first thing), eat them on their own with some butter on top and perhaps a round or two of wholemeal toast?



Personally, I couldn't eat them at that time and would prefer to eat them later in the day, as lunch or dinner (teatime).



Just found a nice recipe which you might like.  Link below.

Enjoy!  :)

Grilled with a buttered knife wiped over them.A poached egg on top and
toast or soft bread.Like grilled Mackerel.They are nice between bread.If
you don't eat much fish.Mackerel is the best.You can do rice with peppers in it and take the skin of Mackerel and roughly cut it up.Drain
excess water from rice and add Mackerel.It heats from the rice.Or do
Pasta.When done add tin of tomato's and chopped Mackerel with what-
ever.A touch of Oregano is good.Lots of ways you can eat it.Add it to
mashed potato.

As we appear to be on the brink of a global food crisis, is it time to rethink farming methods? How?



Given that we appear to be on the brink of a global food crisis, should we be making the world's farms even bigger and more efficient, or should we be making them smaller? Is it time to dismantle the industrial food machine, or should we be cranking it up to the next level?

Whatever is most efficience

In theory large scale farming should produce economies of scale , but if you're continually farming land you need to replace nutrients  by whatever methods are available.

While small scale / allotment farming should be encourage to supplement peoples larders , I dont think this is the answer . It may ease the situation but is not a solution

Hopefully we wont have to go the "Soylent Green" route.

I believe that in considering the global food shortage governments/corporations are looking at the wrong side of the equation.
On the same side of this equation is a shortage of fuel, most commodities and even water. Add the pressure on public services and infrastructure and one sees that the problem is the other side of the equation - too many people. Rather than control population, governments and greedy corporations requiring more retail sales have heavily subsidised the production of people in the lower socio-economic groups.
In the West, this has been the cause of housing shortage, over crowded roads, poor public services, over working of many who are employed and the creation of a consuming but non-contributing underclass. Population control will solve world commodity shortages and improve the quality of life for the majority of people.

Specifically on farming, I favour minimum dependence on imports, to be effected by subsidy at the point of production rather than guaranteed sale price which can create unwanted surpluses. Subject to these controls, let the market determine the most effective production methods. 
On GM crops: why risk letting the corporation that inspired 'Silent Spring' become the architect of 'Mutant Millennium'?
GM has its place - in the laboratory. We should try to move away from high dependence on agri-chemicals, possibly balancing lower yields with the reduced production costs.

I agree that we need to look at how we product food, but more so on how we use the food we already have.  So much food goes to waste, there are countries with food mountains that they are now having to pay money to dispose of - yet there are countries whose food supply is far too low for the consumption they need, let alone the luxuries that we privileged have.

It seems to me that growth is the answer. One draw back is that Farmers are badgered into cost cutting by big store chains, so do they really want to expand in a low profit industry.

It seems many countries are guilty of throwing away tones  of food each day. Could be given to poor countries but costs too much for transportation, so I'm told. Surely if all countries put their heads together, I believe they could come up with a plan of transporting surplus foods to where they are really needed.

Mmm.. In my opinion,  we probably should be going for more local farms, although with the effects of scale, these will not be sustainable below a certain size.



However, this will result in a much larger food bill which will be very difficult in the current economic climate. This will also have an effect on any 'Fair trade' system and third world development as transport, environmental issues and cost {not just economic costs} will have to be taken in to consideration.



The next problem is to convince the general public to accept a reduced 'seasonal produce' rather than the range of goods currently available.



In reality, I think the only way to remove the problem is to make the whole environment more local. This would require that we break up the unsustainable mega-cities and distribute the population away from the south east {look at the pressures on not just supplying food, but also water and transport}. Of course, we would then find it more difficult to support luxury services, like celebrity chefs {sorry}, but the infra-structure and supply of basic amenities would be simpler and more uniform.

Farming methods have nothing to do with the level of hunger in the world. We already create more than enough food for every single person on this mudball to stuff themselves until they drop dead from overeating. The U.N.'s Population Reference Bureau is quite clear that the main cause of hunger in the world today is poverty. In their landmark study on hunger, “Population, Food, and Nutrition” they don’t even consider increased food production as a possible solution to the hunger problem. Hunger still exists because many poor people around the world lack the resources to buy enough food. In other words, people are starving to death (more correctly, being starved to death) through poverty, not though lack of food. It's pointless trying to work out why poverty exists in the world,  but considering the money thrown at the problem – the G8 summit increased aid to Africa from $25 billion to $50 billion US in 2005 – it is certainly an intractable one. What desperate sinkhole of poverty couldn’t be cured by fifty billion dollars?

The fact remains that we produce enough food to supply all six billion people on this planet with a massive excess left over. There is so much food available, in fact, that everyone who can afford it has a plentiful supply. This is what the United Nations has to say on the subject:

“... Despite the dire predictions that the world’s population would soon outstrip food production, it has been the other way around: food production has risen a full 16 per cent above population growth. The American Association for the Advancement of Science has noted that 78 per cent of the world’s malnourished children live in countries with food surpluses. Clearly, this condition indicates a need for a keener social conscience and better political leadership ....There is enough food to go around now and for at least the next half-century. The world is not going to run out of food for all.”  (http://www.goveg.com/worldhunger)

It is not a matter of making more food. We don’t need to. We already make more than enough. The problem is with food distribution. Food surpluses in Europe and the United States are either suppressed by subsidies to farmers who agree not to grow certain crops during periods of overproduction, or they are destroyed. They are not loaded into bulk grain carriers and shipped to areas of the world blighted by famine. If they were the problem might be solved. Might.



How can we have a net surplus of food in the world while a significant proportion of the human population is not merely undernourished but starving to death en masse? Given that it is true that "Due to advances in agriculture of many countries, there is now a substantial world surplus of food"  (Abelson, P.H. (1972). World Food. Science, 236,9.)  how is it that “more people than ever before are undernourished or malnourished”. (Curtain, M.E. (1985 July). Development and food. Inter-American Development Bank News, p. 3.)

The standard economic definition of surplus is not just ‘too much’, as you would think it might be. Economists can make anything more complex than it needs to be, that’s why they have a Nobel Prize just for them. “Surplus” is defined as a supply situation where buyers do not exhaust available supply while still paying a unit price acceptable to sellers. Right. Glad we got that sorted out. Used in connection with world population and their food requirements, the words "food surplus" are worse than misleading. Only from food producers' point of view is there surplus. From many potential customers, there is shortage. There is widespread famine even in countries that are net exporters of food. (Poleman, T.T. (1969). World food: A perspective. Science, 173, 510-518) There is surplus largely because millions of people in these countries simply don’t have the financial clout to create an economic demand sufficient to interest suppliers. (Wortman, S. (1980). World food and nutrition: The scientific and technological base. Science, 209, 157- 164.)



For example in India the National Institute of Nutrition estimated that as many as 50% of rural households and 55% of urban slum households do not have enough food to meet daily energy requirements. Yet India exports massive amounts of food and makes huge export income as a result. The food has been distributed out of the country and away from starving people because they cannot afford to buy it, and consumers in other countries can. India exports rice, wheat, sugarcane, tea, cotton, jute, cashews, coffee, spices, “other vegetables”, melons, sorghum, millet, corn, barley, chickpeas, bananas, and mangoes, all of which are desperately needed by their indigent, underfed people, none of whom can afford to pay the prices we Westerners can.

We make enough food for the entire population of the world. Food shortages are caused by poverty and inequitable distribution of food, not the lack of food supplies.

I think we need to change peoples eating habits, that will bring about a change in the production methods. 
People used to shop locally, local farm shops, local butchers etc. which were usually supplied by local farmers. It's all just on too large a scale. Why do we ship meat in from abroad? We have some of the most humane animal farming methods in the world. If people were more aware of the food that they are consuming, I am sure they would make better choices.

I don't believe a blanket policy is the way forward.  Each method has its pro's and cons and one method might be more beneficial to the others but only to a specific situation.

Perhaps large scale farming should be prohibited to treat problem areas and everyone else should either be served by local small holdings, or even their own, individual produce garden.

I think we need to get back to smaller scale farming, run self sufficiently. That is, you rear your livestock free range, you use their waste on the land, and the produce of the land to feed both you and them.

That is the ideal for me anyway. The problem is getting there and making it succesful enough to feed an entire population. The biggest problem will be to wean farms off chemicals. Chemicals cause all kinds of problems with the soil, problems that are alliviated with yet more chemicals until, with out the chemicals, the land is useless. All this land would need to have lots of natural fertiliser and manure put into first, but whilst that is happening where do you crow your crops. You could do half your land at a time I suppose but the shortfall in produce would have to be made up by imports, leading to all sorts of financial headaches for the farmers, which would either have to be propped up by susidies or simple left to go bust under pressure from foreign competition.

Self sufficient, natural, clean farming is a wonderful idea, but there are simple too many mouths to feed in the world and too many desperate countries willing to fill them with cheap and nasty produce.

Personally I grow my own, not enough to be entirely self sufficient, but enough to not have to rely too much on Tesco's. I think if we all did this it might put enough pressure on supermarkets and farmers to produce affordable (let's face it, it not cheap) organic fruit and veg at least, if not ethical meat.

PS: I really liked your elderflower champagne recipe. Unfortunately it exploded all over my shed:) Still, what was left was quite nice.

In countries like the UK, so much is wasted.  I don't really think we have a problem, especially if people would stop throwing out perfectly good food.  By making the farms here even bigger we'll just all end up eating bendy luminous carrots with no flavour, and put many more already struggling farmers out of business.

Globally, farming methods need to be improved.  For example using simple fertilisers on the soil to increase productivity, introducing more cooperative farming groups and diversifying the food that is grown might help to alleviate the threat of famine in developing countries.  Additionally I think that inter-country trade could be improved to help small scale farmers who might want to grow some cash crops, and also to diversify what is available in the market place for people to buy.



The market place in developing countries just isn't good enough at the moment, and those who can and/or want to sell extra food often don't have access to the demand for this food.  Currently, so many small scale farmers who have the potential to increase their production have no motivation to do so, as they don't have access to the market place where their excess produce is really needed, and so they stick to subsitance farming.

Given the context of rising global food prices, and how that's affecting the poorest people on the planet, I think the answer to your question would need to take into account what would most benefit the most needy people.

Small, local farming is all well and good in developed nations that can support them with, say EU farm subsidies, but isn't always the greatest way of feeding the most people.

For example Chairman Mao forced the Chinese people to return to small, subsistence farming - totally losing the benefits of economies of scale.

But as we know, scale isn't always good - just look how the EU uses its size and unity to unfairly bargain with Africa.

I'm not an expert in this field (sic) but think there must be a way of more efficiently producing food for those who need it most...

I think it is a disgrace to see land just left and not used and then to import food from miles away to meet demand... I would love to see more people growing their own and I think that this will happen as food prices become higher and higher. The need for people to grow food themselves seemed  to disappear when supermarkets expanded and pushed down prices by importing from poorer countries and our own farmers were pushed to the brink and many gave up or went into other avenues of work.
The older people will remember  the "Dig for Victory" campaigns... when people were encouraged to grow food in the smallest of spaces to help meet demand ... now I am not suggesting that we all grow certain crops .. wheat for example is large scale and intensive so lets leave this to the farmers but vegetables and fruit why not?
I would suggest eating according to the seasons a bit more.. we never used to expect strawberries in December but we appear to nowadays... farming even small scale needs to be encouraged especially on a more organic basis....

The answer for now would be to throw away less.

The amount of food past its sell-by date which is skipped is scandalous.  So too is the amount left to rot unharvested or undistributed.  And that too many modern housewives (does such such a beast still exist?) have forgotten the art of using up leftovers imaginatively.

With escalating transport costs, it must mean that food consumption must be closer to the point of production in future. If this means digging up "amenity areas" outside tower blocks and by roads and planting veggies and keeping the odd cow, then why not?

We need varieties of food crops with a long harvest life for amateurs without a lot of time to harvest a crop in one go, nor the facilities to store a year's harvest.  Better kept in the ground and taken when needed.

I don't think the size of the farm is as important as the welfare standards inside it. As illustrated by the Middle Ages, battery conditions encourage disease. Therefore, in theory, a bigger farm could afford to give more room to the animals and from there better welfare.
Bigger farms may become necessary as large swathes of land are bought up for housing and farms find themselves hemmed in by housing estates anyway. Climate change will also have an effect as huge areas of land become suitable for crops while others turn barren.
Farms will also need to become more power-efficient and offset their gas (both carbon dioxide and methane) output. This may be possible through use of solar and wind power and prolific use of flora and fauna.

I think that agriculture, at least in developed nations, is changing for the better. Probably at the pace that will be least jarring to the markets.
Agriculture in some developing nations, due to the good work of NGO's, individuals and education, is also changing for the better. But far too slowly.
That said, in an ideal world, I would advocate the total overhaul of food production and distribution. But we live in reality.
Vast areas of pre-farmed arable land exists in Africa, which would benefit from a stable, safe economy. I believe that NGO's could make a difference in these areas before conglomerates get wise. 
We do not have a lack of arable land, or food.
What we cannot sustain, is farming for fuel or the wastage that we get from exported mono-cultured food products.
I realise that your particular ethos involves smallholders, in small co-operatives, where everything is self-sustaining. All well and good, but we also need to apply these techniques to larger co-operatives on a commercial basis. Especially in areas of minimal development. Maybe some small compromises will be necessary (knowing mankind), but I think it could be done better with re-learnt techniques rather than newer ones. But the test must always be that it works best.

As we appear to be on the brink of a global food crisis &lt;snip&gt; Given that we appear to be on the brink of a global food crisis &lt;snip&gt;

Now that's quite a statement to be saying that and I'm not sure what evidence you have to back up that. But leaving that aside, there's a couple of sayings that spring to mind - one man's meat is another man's poison - horses for courses.

There's no one recipe for how a farm should be run and whether it should be big or small. Farms need to be run according to the local customs, traditions and community. The state of a farm in America is not going to be suitable for a farm in Africa and vice versa.

But I'm not convinced we're on the brink of a global food crisis and even if we were, what's that got to do with farms? You need to lobby your local MP and the government if you want to change things. The CAP needs more reform and the G8 need to write off more debt - restructuring farms isn't the answer.

Things like this are an example of exactly what I'm talking about - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/... here are no easy solutions otherwise the problems of the developing countries would've been solved by now. But initiatives like this are what's needed, we just need more of them.

You haven't asked a question, is it what???
If you want to know if they are the same thing, the answer is no, miracle whip is a chemical soup where as mayonnaise is made with natural ingredients, eggs and oil, usually with a little sugar or mustard powder for flavour. Miracle whip has a lot less calories though. Can
t think of anything else, as I don't knwo what your question was, so I hope this helps! x

Thought of an idea to sell ice cream?



I'm already working full time but need extra cash!!! Can get off my butt and put in the hours. Does anyone know the regulations around setting up an ice cream round and what a van should cost that is kitted out? Do you have to have permission or a licence if you own the van and where would you source the ice cream. I know of a few places you could source it from but is there a reasonable rate/percentage you would expect to pay? for the ice cream? What wouldyou pay for an ice cream by the way?

You'd need to do the legal paperwork to set yourself up as a business (set up a corporation).  I have no idea what it would cost to buy an ice cream truck set up with freezers and so forth; maybe you can find a used one somewhere.  You'd invest money in the corporation to buy the ice cream truck and the truck would be in the corporation's name.

As for licenses and permits to operate an ice cream route, you'd need to check with your local town or municipality. I'm assuming you're British (based on your spelling and vocabulary), I have NO idea what the laws are there, so check with your local authorities.



You'd have to find a local ice cream manufacturer and set up an account with them to buy their products on credit.  There are no rates or percentages.  You buy the ice cream for so much per gallon (or liter or whatever unit of measure) and sell it for so much per cone or cup or scoop or whatever. Its up to you to figure out how much you need to sell your ice cream for in order to cover not only the cost of the ice cream but the cost of owning and operating the truck (gasoline, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, etc), and paying yourself a salary.  Do some research and find out what local ice cream shops and restaurants in your area charge for ice cream.  You might be able to set your prices a bit lower since you don't have all the expenses of maintaining a building and paying multiple employees.



Everything is done through the corporation, recording and tracking the sales revenues, paying the operating expenses of the business, and you pay yourself a salary or wage as the corporation's employee (so you'll have to be sure to pay all legally required payroll taxes like Social Security and so on).  The idea is that at the end of the year, the corporation's legitimate expenses should more or less equal the income, so that there is little or no profit to report and pay corporate income taxes on.



Of course, you as the corporation's employee would be responsible for paying personal income tax on your earnings as an ice cream sales person.

i believe killing isn't wrong. you kill for a meaningful purpose. we kill all sorts of things to survive. for example plants are living things and we still kill those for food and etc. murder is a bad thing. murder is meaningless. i believe you should continue to eat meats. if you still feel bad become a vegetarian.

It's good to care about this, because nobody should want to cause undue suffering and death to any form of life in this world.  Our survival depends on all sorts of living things, from plants and animals to bugs and bacteria.  The whole biosphere deserves our nurturing and respect.

First, come to terms with the life you've received: human biology is equipped to be an omnivore (e.g. eyes in front of the face, teeth for eating both plant and meat).  It's consistent with human nature to eat meat, and many anthropologists credit a diet rich in animal fats for the development of sophisticated frontal lobes in the brains of early hominids.

That said, it IS possible to buy meat from animals that are raised and killed in ways less-inhumane than factory farms.  Whole-foods markets and specialty meats outlets can help you find what's right for you.  (I've seen cage-free, range-fed, organically-raised meat and dairy products in some local stores.)

Mmmm... I love tiger bread!
The topping is a paste made of rice flour and water, painted on with a brush after the bread has risen and just before it goes into the oven. 
The heat of the oven makes the paste dry out and also causes the bread to rise a little more. That's why the crust separates into that lovely crackly pattern.



Tiger bread's yummy flavour comes from sesame oil, which is mixed into the dough with the flour, water, yeast and sugar. Most bread has some fat in the dough mix -- olive oil in ciabatta, for instance, and butter in breakfast rolls. It gives it flavour and helps it keep better.



Aargh: no way of buying tiger bread now till tomorrow morning. *whimpers* ;D

Just dropped my only meal I have left on the floor,?



Yesterday the cat had a massive diarrhea shite on the floor where I have dropped my powered mash potatoes and cheap Nato beans. Would it be still be OK to eat, I did put tesco's cheap thin bleach to cover the cat shite after she'd done it. Would it be safe to eat. Normally would just pick it off the fllor and eat it but am unsure this time. I have nthing to eat know and am really hurgry. What would you do?

I don't think it would be good to scrape the food off the floor because of the ecoli bacteria that could kill you.  I would suggest that you sell your computer and use the money to buy to groceries.

It is never a good idea to eat something off the floor. Even if it is clean. Germs lurk all over the place especially on floors.



You could bake a potato in the microwave or ask someone (a nice boyfriend) to treat you to a meal.

my friend doesnt eat meat or animal products. so basically, shes vegan. she does this because she doesnt believe we have the right over animals. she doesnt eat animals that have been bred to die eg. cows, sheep. but if her dad randomly goes out and shoots a kangaroo, or catches some fish she'll eat it, because its purpose wasnt 'to die.'

I'm no vegan but there are benefits from cutting certain meats from your diet. Red meats attach themseves to the inside of your colon if not passed later they become pallops and cause many health problems.  Pork and Chicken cain the highest amounts of sodium which may raise your risk of high blood pressure. Fish you catch outside caontain uncertain mounts of mercury. Mercury is bad for us. But the fish raised on farms don't.  Turkey I'm not sure of...



But like the other person stated... People where hunting and eating animals way before doctors and scientist ever told us they were bad for us.  Besides... I get tired of eating beans and nuts.

Meat builds protein which is needed for healthy muscle tissue.
meat gives you energy that last.  It takes 8 hours for a piece of meat to digest.



Meat keeps you from getting hungry as often as you would on a vegen diet. 
Meat is good, when cooked properly.
Meat has enzymes in it that help promote healthy hair, skin, nails, etc. 
Pork is the Other white meat.  Healtier than beef, but some people do not like it as well, like myself.

Any meat is bad for you if not properly cooked.  Do not eat it raw, medium rare, or rare.



you want your meat (beef) medium well to well. 
Pork, always, always, always well done. 
chicken the same way.  always well done.
fish contains oils essetenial for your body. In fact, adding lemon to fish brings out a chemical in fish that is necessary in the body.



i do not discourage from Vegen diets, but do recommend that you don't try it.  too many vegetables can hurt your stomach in the long run.

We are carnivores so we need to have meat that is over one million years of evolution demands it of us. What you need to pay attention to is the fast food not necessarily meat eating since fast food is just sick especially all the extra junk they put into it. Anyway up to you, but if you suddenly find your immune system is weakened, you energy is lower, your sexual drive is almost totally diminished and your health generally deteriorates then you know why.



Just as a point. You see those two most prominent front teeth you have they are for tearing flesh the eyes are at the front of your head because humans are hunters. Rabbits etc... don't because they are vegetarians and need to look around. The very way your body is developed is around the hunt and eating of meat.

They both have alot of preservatives in them.  It would depend what type of ham you get, but usually you can find very lean ham, so I'd say ham.  Black Forest ham would probably be the very healthiest too, although a genuine Honey Baked Ham (from a Honey Baked store) is absolutely the best tasting!



You should also be able to find turkey pastrami at the deli, and it's very good

The meat in a Butchers is fresh that day but the corned beef and ham that you get in a supermarket has been sitting on the shelf foora couple of days.  And it has probably been sitting somewhere for a day or two before that

It would depend on how the ham has been processed, but if you mean the fat content then corned beef has more.

If you are watching fats ham is definetely your best choice.
Can you ever feel a greasy feeling in the roof of your mouth or on your teeth after eating corned beef?  That is nothing but fat.  Usually if it tastes heavenly it's not very good for us:)

I can not see any major nutritional advantage to either..
"More Healthy" is a stupid statement what does that mean what standard is being used to judge any quality 
both are processed and spiced or brined 
I think it is a matter of taste, flavor and cost..
Subway and Quiznos both have $6.00 sandwiches
99¢ at Mc D's,,☺ Nutritional value  Who cares,, You and I don't even know what we need use or store??  how many millions depend on low cost food

Breakfast maybe a low calorie cereal...e.g cornflakes with skim milk, oats, wholegrain toast with margerine and tomato, an egg?

Lunch maybe a salad or a soup (low cal)

Dinner protein and salad or vegies...avoid heavy carbs like pasta, rice, etc.

Hope I helped!!!

The key is to watch what you snack on...I like vegies with dips, rice crackers, fruit etc.

Eat a good breakfast if you're active early in the morning and right into the day. Breakfast should include a whole grain food like oatmeal. Eggs are ok. Wholewheat or multigrain bread is preferable. Include unsweetened orange juice if available. If you're inactive early in the day, a cup of hot tea and some crackers with peanut butter or a small bowl of oatmeal should be enough. Lunch should include a healthy portion of salad alongside the typical hot lunchtime meal. Add fruit as often as possible. Keep a rather modest to low calorie dinner with low carbs and fats, since this is your last meal and you add weight mostly while sleeping. And try not to eat for 2 hours before bedtime. Some exercise will also be necessary; good dieting is never enough. Keep it simple, go for a walk twenty minutes every day. Don't include stopping to talk in the 20 minutes! Best wishes.

Keep up some regular exercise and try to follow this routine as best you can:

In the morning have a substantial breakfast: either Cereal or a Boiled Egg, Beans, Toast and Fruit Juice.

Allow that to settle and digest, for about 2 hours, then go to the gym, do some jogging, swimming, push-ups, sit-ups, cycling, anything physical, but in general have a good work-out then go and have lunch. Preferably something healthy and fairly light. Either a salad, fruit or sandwich.

After that, you can rest for awhile however, if you're really determined to get fit, do something constructive. Perhaps you can go for a walk around the block, and once that is done, have a good dinner. Preferably a variety of veges and some meat for protein. Try to avoid baked, fried and high cholestrole dinners. Another night you could boiled rice and a stir fry, but if you want sauce in your stir fry make sure it has no MSG.



Just remember, "no snacking on sweets and chocolate." This just makes all your hard effort disappear into thin air.

Hope it helps!

This is a silly question, but I'd like to know what everyone likes the best.  Jack in the Box Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger with curley fries, and a dr. pepper?  Or a Wendy's Baconater?  My personal opinion is going to have to be the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger.  Wendy's fries are horrible, and that destroys everything.  Lets here it!

What do Hershey's Candy Corn Kisses taste like?



The taste is so specifically familiar, but I can't place it! It's not candy corn, that' s for sure. It's delicious! is it white chocolate? 
It brought up this vivid memory of a tiny town fair I went to as a kid, which I'd forgotten about. Weird. 
So far I'm about half and half: people who like them and people who don't.
What do you think?

I must admit, they’re lovely. The wrappers are silver, yellow and orange with little flags that say Candy Corn.



Upon opening the bag I can only say that they stink to high heaven, like fake butter flavor!

Unwrapping the foil, they are super-cute layers just like candy corn. Wider on the bottom than normal candy corn, the proportions may be a little squat, the colors are also rearranged, with yellow on the bottom and orange in the middle, instead of the reverse. I can see why they did it though, it is a pleasant combo.



While I enjoy candy corn that has a slight honey or caramelized sugar taste to it, these go for the buttered corn flavor. I know that the Buttered Popcorn Jelly Belly is one of the most popular, but it’s never floated by boat. Same with this one ... a little caramely white chocolate would have made me very happy. This doesn’t. The fake butter just turns my stomach when I smell it. If I don’t smell it, then they’re not bad, not too sweet with a light little hit of salt.



Unlike many of the other white confection offerings from Hershey’s, these are not white chocolate (which has a cocoa butter base). The ingredients go like this:



Sugar, Vegetable Oil (Palm, Shea, Sunflower and/or Safflower Oil), Nonfat Milk, Lactose, Reduced Minerals Whey (from milk), Milkfat. Contains less than 2% or less of Natural and Artificial Color (Yellow 6, Yellow 5 Lake), Soy Lecithin, PGPR, Tocopherols (to maintain freshness).



I think the idea is cute and I could actually see these being a great cookie decoration (as suggested on the package with a peanut butter cookie recipe). Other than that, I’m going to just admire the photos and the idea and keep the package way from me. I couldn’t decide what rating to give this, mostly because my personal revulsion to fake butter flavor (it actually gives me a headache when someone makes microwave popcorn) is, well, a personal thing. The product is well executed ... I just wish they called them Butter Kisses and made them like real candy corn, not that Milk Maid Caramel Candy Corn. My nose said give them a two out of ten. But looking at the photos, I can’t help but bump it up to a four out of ten ... what can I say, I’m a sucker for design!

I buy the spiral ham from Costco but they have them at any market.....make sure it is bone in..NOT HONEY  glazed

I also do not use the glaze that comes with it....

I bake my ham with Colemans mustard & brown sugar..

AFTER I take it out of the oven I heat up cherry jelly or blackberry jam(actually you can use any flavor...I add 1 TBSP sugar and bring it to a boil...
I pour it over the ham very slowly...it hardens into a shiny glaze....sprinkle with a little finely chopped parsley and it is very pretty.

Any brand of ham will do Farmer John's is a good brand...but even the Kirkland brand from costco tastes great..

And please do not buy canned ham....fatty & nasty.

It all depends on how long it's been sitting in the pot.  If they do a brisk business, it shouldn't make any difference.  If they put it in the pot a few hours ago, you might want to request fresh from the kebab.

There are 4 cups in a quart. If you are making lemonade from the little containers where you just have to add water, add about 5 cups of water to the container.  I find that the containers are usually too dense and too sugary for only 4 cups of water.

Add steamed broccoli....that will make it a really meal.

The other thing you could do is chop up the chicken, and make a fried rice dish....add green onion, egg, a pinch of black pepper, (I put in 1/8 - 1/4 cup of peas) and that too is a meal.

Can't stop myself shoplifting.?



I have not purchased any food in months becuase its so easy to steal it. I walk into my local small supermaket and fill a shopping bag up with meat, cheese, beer, well all sorts really. I can stealing upto £70 a week in that store and they just don't notice I'm there. I'm really good at it and do it right in front of the staff when they turn there backs. Should I stop or carry on still I get caught and pay the £80 fine. What would you do.

i think you have to realize that you are not invisible, or invincible. everyone gets caught eventually!!!!!!!!!!!!! How oculd you think so highly of your mortal-self to feel like you will never get caught? i'm not saying that you do, I am just saying that if you keep doing it its because this isn't phasing you. Look up the punishment for shoplifting in your area. First realize the consequences before doing something like that, and ask yourself if it is really worth it!

There's a difference between your not being able to stop & not wanting to stop.
I think you ought to stop because you are hurting the shop owners because they lose money....maybe they are really good people & feel sorry for you that you're so poor or something.
I would stop.  It's not a matter of getting caught for me, but a matter of self esteem.

Okay folks...I'm gonna attempt to answer this extremely gay [pun intended] questions.  Okay..here goes.  Does anyone here know that there are male and female plants?  There are!! Believe it or not.  And I am really serious here.  I had a spider plant at work and it never grew what is referred to as babies.  You know, the little sprouts that start growing off of the bigger vines like a whole other plant starting?  Well anyway, someone told me to put my spider plant next to theirs (which according to them was a male) and it would start growing babies.  After about 3 months it had babies growing all over it.  I was totally freaked.  This person explained that their are male and female plants and when near to each other they cross pollinate.  I know this sounds like a really stupid joke, but it isn't.  I did some research on it, and low and behold she was right.

So given the theory that their are male and female plants, wouldn't the logical hypothesis be that their are male and female fruit?  And if so, who's to say that plants and fruit of the same kind could be for a lack of a better word GAY.  If this sounds crazy to you...go on any cannabis website and you will see that their are male and female seeds.  Better yet, do an experiment.  Set a male spider plant beside a male spider plant, or vise verse, and see what happens.  NOTHING.  I tried it just out of curiosity.  Your probably asking yourself...how can you tell the difference.  I ask the same question.  The male spider plant does not have a white stripe running through it and by coincidence it also has a sharper point to the end of the leaf.  The female leaf is much rounder.  This is really freaky....I know.  I mean it's not like they have brains and can decide for themselves whether their gay or not, it's just nature and all the mysteries that surround it.

Please do not take my word for it...research it yourself if your willing to give it even a nano second to think about it.

Well I hope this helps either giving someone a LOL or at the very least satisfied someones curiosity.  You know...like the people that sit around and think of such GAY questions to ask.  And I guess you all are also thinking...she's as bad as he is.  And you would be right, I guess.  I just thought I'd give everyone a little FYI while answering this GAY question.

Scallions and green onions generally refer to exactly the same vegetable.
With scallions, you’re generally using the attractive green leafy part of the plant (although the white part closer to the root tastes fine as well); it’s only the very bottom inch or so of the root part of the plant that you won’t use for cooking purposes. Still, don’t throw out those nubby remainders – if you pop the roots into a pot of dirt, and give them sunshine and water of course, the scallions will keep growing, and you’ll have access to fresh, free scallions whenever you need them.

What's the difference between Olive Oil and Olive Pomace oil?



I know what olive oil is but what's the other? Is it worth buying as a substitute?

Pomace is the solid left behind when you remove juice from a vegetable/fruit.  Often there is still significant amounts of juice left behind that you can extract from the Pumace.  If you then extract juice or oil from it you have pumace oil or pumace juice.  In most cases they are labeled the same because there is only minor differences in the oil/juice so you will never know.

Succinct, informative and helpful. I think I may convert, though according to the other contributor it is blended with another oil after. Still, many thanks for your knowledge.

I recently asked my local store about pomace. They told me Pomace is good for cooking, and it is. Ordinary olive oil tends to burn at a lower Temperature. Pomace is also cheaper.

The second fellow has it surrounded, I ama former chef and toured a Olive Oil production plant in France, it is as he said the reminance of the Olive oil process, they take that mash and introduce a neutral oil, in Europe, soya, safflower or groundnut oil and agitate the mix as it settle the oils combine and it is syphoned off and the remaining mash is sold to farmer for livestock, like pigs and cattle, it is rich in iron and nutrients, I have had real kobe beef in Japan and they feed the cattle sake mash, give it gin massages and rub downs before they end up on the dinner table.

Where can I buy goat meat in or near Nth Cornwall?



Have found a great recipe for curried goat...and would love to try it out...if don't know where to get the goat, suggestions for alternatives? Lamb, mutton?

Also if know where can get, how about other recipes for goat?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Try a halal butchers, or ask at your local butchers for mutton. It needs more cooking than lamb and has a stronger taste than lamb so can take on stronger spices without losing the taste of the meat.

I guess we're talking about alcohol here. I like Bazooka Joe shots: Shot of 99 Bananas with a splash of grenadine floating on top. Drop in a glass filled with Red Bull and shoot it down. Really tastes just like bubble gum.



I also like Lemon Drops, which are fairly common: Shot of Absolut Cintron (you can also use any lemon-flavored vodka or straight vodka), with a sugared lemon wedge on the side. Shoot the vodka and follow immediately with a bite from the lemon wedge.



Bloody Marys are also lovely and you can find a recipe for them anywhere so I won't bother posting one here. I like to substitute a dill pickle spear for the celery stalk, omit the olives and rim the glass with margarita salt.

Samicluans German beer is by far my favorite. It's brewed once per year on December sixth, and is similar to wine in three aspects: a. It has a vintage date on the label b. It gets better with age c. It is 14% alcohol. Unfortunately it is also very rare and hard to find.

Pork roast cooked in a dutch oven.  Essentially my own BBQ sauce (brown sugar, mustard, chili sauce, etc.)...but bright flavors, not warm flavors.



I served that on cibatta bread, so they ended up being pulled pork sandwiches.



Served it with mashed potatoes and salad.



I am actually embarrassed, I usually do something better, but I had a lot of work today.

Raw pumpkin seeds good for ?



My daughter carved a pumpkin 6 days ago.  I sat the raw seeds in a bowl of salt water and forgot about them till today.  I've boiled them for 10 minutes, but before I go to the trouble of roasting them, I'm wondering if they will still be safe (after roasting) to eat since they sat on the counter for 6 days.

After soaking for that long they will be woody and not worth eating.  Not dangerous but not worth the trouble.  Been there - done that.

I did it, they weren't woody but did taste weird.  Probably safe like you said, but not worth it.

Well they are good for putting in home made soups like lentil / broth that kind of thing don't drop too many in though just a small hand full they don't add any flavor to the soup just make it a bit crunchier great if you like you vegetables big and chunky in your soups.

What's the deal with recall on Halloween Candy 2008?



I just checked snopes and found the sherwood brand pirates gold milk chocolate coins that were sold at Costco on their sight and something about Candbury chocolate eggs but, that's all I saw. My neighbor mentioned something about a discrentalled worker messing with candy. That I should not take my son out tomorrow. Any truth to that rumor They said it's been on the news/online but, I can't find anything other than the pirate coins thing. HELP PLEASE AS I'M TAKING MY SON OUT FOR HIS FIRST TRICK OR TREATING EXPERIENCE. SCARED MOM!!  Thanks in advance.

Now then, Is it burnt baked beans on toast around here or a fry up around your place?



While you are doing it I'll sit by the fire, have a cup of tea and a smoke and tell you what we'll be doing over the weekend.

What Is The Worst Thing You Ever Tasted?



Well I'm wondering what the worst thing you've ever eaten is like maybe an over cooked meal? a burned meal? to much pepper? to much salt??



You can have a limit of 10 if you can't put 10 then go with 5 :D and if you want to put in when you had the worst thing you ate or tasted by all means  go for it :D



Mine are:



1. Apple and Cinnamon Oatmeal (I was sick a while back and my oatmeal came back up and it was totally nasty)



2. Chicken (I ate chicken from our local super store and it might of been cooked wrong because it came back up that same night)



3. Mac and Cheese (My dad made it with so much pepper that it looked like there were burned pieces everywhere and you couldn't eat it because you were so busy sneezing)



4. Teriyake Steak ( my uncle added so much sugar it was so sweet my teeth started to hurt and my whole family shuddering from eating it)



5. Pork Rhine's (I had a bag of them once and it was totally gross to the point that even my cats outside didn't want to eat them &gt;.&lt;)



Thanks, Mel :D

Norwegian gammalost (literal translation - 'old cheese')



It tastes as though someone has buried a batch of cottage cheese under a compost heap and left it there for a year or two, then dug it up and served it as a delicacy.

What a fun question!



1. My dad made hot dog spaghetti when I was a kid, chopped hot dogs in tomato sauce with pasta and nutmeg!



2. Havarti cheese, it tastes as bad as it smells.



3. A piece of octopus sushi which looked fresh but it wasn't. I bit into it and it felt like things were crawling all over my tongue along with a very foul taste .



4. Meatballs in some sort of jelly at a work pot luck... not good.



5. Pad Thai from a "Thai" restaurant run and owned by a Vietnamese chef that used way too much Nam Pla (fish sauce). Nam Pla has got to be one of the most rank food ingredients I have ever come across. It's made from fermented sardines and anchovies. I imagine it probably smells worse than a corpse or at least just as bad.

Mistaking olives for cherry peppers.?



Yesterday as I was working as cashier, someone had bought olives that were encased in a transparent plastic container with not label. At first, they looked like cherry peppers. Can olives look like cherry peppers at all or was i just out of it?

If they were packed in oil- you probably only saw the smeary bits and took it as olives- honest mistake.

It depends on how healthy you want to be.  Anything fried in batter is bound to be loaded down with trans fat.  With breadcrumbs I would never fry it,but would bake it instead.  That is the ultimate healthy way to eat fish.  So i like breadcrumbs too, but baked.

Satay is correct. The other person is wrong about the capitalization. You'd capitalize it if it's part of the name of the dish and yu're capitalizing your dish names. Example:Chicken in Peanut Satay

Are the Willy Wonka chocolate bars still being made?



I'm not talking about the original Wonka candy, I'm wondering about the 2005 remake candy, in particular the "whipple-scrumptious fudgemallow delight". I loved this bar and I've been googling all day to no avail. [I'm not the best with a search engine, I have to admit!] So, does anyone know if they are still being made, and if so, where can I get one from? (:

Why is it I can't handle it anymore?



When I was younger I used to drink... but now, I can't even stand the smell of alcohol.  I don't understand.  It doesn't really bother me... but I'm studying to become a chef.  And it's kind of annoying when your recipe calls for a 1/4 cup of wine and you can't even pour it into the sauce because you're trying to concentrate on not tossing your cookies.



My boyfriend is against alcohol.  Especially since I'm only 17.  Is the reason I can't stand the scent anymore because of him?

Partridges in Sloane Square is the place to go. www.partridges.co.uk  If it's in London, they will likely have it, otherwise you are out of luck. They have welchs grape jelly and fizzy water (soda)



There is a Costco in London, you might try there as well.



You can get other things like American sweets ("candy") by going to Cybercandy (www.cybercandy.co.uk) in Convent Garden.

other than as gritty taste in your mouth and teeth, it may cause you to get a stomach ache, or  jitters. It may in fact make your nerves bad and make you do even poorer on your exam, why not just drink some Gin-sing tea, it has a memory boosting vitamins in it and gives you Natural energy, or just grab a red bull.

Carbohydrates are foods that turn to sugar inside the body. The carbohydrates that create the highest amount of sugar very quickly are called high glycemic and are sugar and carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, potato, and rice. Other foods such as vegetables (apart from potatoes), nuts and lentils turn to sugar very slowly and are called low glycemic.

So that people know what they are putting in their stomachs as some additives and preservatives can cause some side effects. Also, so that people will know that junk food is not healthy at all as it can cause obesity and if it is salty, it can cause hypertension  or if it is very sweet, it can cause diabetis.

I don't think all "Junk food" should have health warnings.  They already have nutrition labels and people need to learn how to read them for themselves.  Health warnings change often.  For example, sometimes eggs are bad for you and now (at least the last I heard) eggs are ok again.  The FDA approves health warnings for packaging and wouldn't be able to keep up with the changes that the scientific world issues.



And don't forget that we consumers pay for all this labeling.  People need to educate themselves and not rely on health warnings on food products.

interesting.... you could try making a melt in the middle type pudding, which is basically chocolate sponge with hot chocolate or melted chocolate in the middle. if you find a way to thicken the hot chocolate, you could use it as a filling. for recipes just type in chocolate melt in the middle pudding.

You could add it to ice cream & milk in the blender to make milk shakes. Or try adding a small amount of hot water to make a syrup to top ice cream. If they like oatmeal & cream of wheat, add it to that.

Hot Chocolate S'mores Cookies
adapted from Land O Lakes, found at novice-baker.blogspot.com
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup instant hot chocolate mix [any flavor works, but dark chocolate has been my favorite]
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
about 24 marshmallows, cut in half crosswise
about 3 full graham cracker rectangles [I hope that makes sense]



Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa mix, baking soda, and salt.
In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until creamy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until well combined after each. Mix in milk and vanilla. Add the dry ingredients and mix just until combined.
Using a teaspoon or a teaspoon cookie scoop, drop the dough onto parchment lined baking sheets. Bake until the cookies are set [when touched lightly, and indentation remains and the cookie does not spring back], about 7 or 8 minutes. Remove and carefully place a marshmallow, cut side down, in the center of each cookie. I ended up cutting both ends of the marshmallows and then cutting down the middle, which provided me with a sticky surface for my graham cracker crumbs. If using the cracker crumbs, sprinkle on top of the marshmallow halves after placing them on cookies. Place back in the oven and keep baking until marshmallow begins to look puffy [about 1 to 2 minutes]. Remove from oven and let cookies sit on the cookie sheet for 1 minute before removing to cooling racks.



you can also use it for arts and crafts if you have kids... dirt/sand on a picture or fuzzy hair on a person.

What I like is to put some in a cup and pour hot coffee over it - you end up with sort of a mochacino latte drink.



If I am somewhere like a conference where the coffee is bad - I find putting a package of hot chocolate in makes it drinkable.



I am a pure black coffee drinker but I like this too.

Sorry, no- one of the things you need from the fruit is the fiber- not just the juice.

5 a day is 5 portions - a portion is not necessarily a whole apple or orange but I think to add a small amount of roughage i.e. a piece of fruit or a handful of raisins would be better

People have asked me this question. It does count as your 5 a day as each fruit vitamin, as told by the Discovery Team in London, is counted as 5 a day on each one you have so be healthy and eat and drink those fruit and fruit drinks on your question now!

It would be 3 of your 5 DIFFERENT a day.



1 Pineapple counts as 1
1 Mango counts as 1



1 Orange juice, 1 apple juice and 1 grape juice combined count as 1



Although you are eating more than 5 portions of fruit or vegetables you are only eating 3 different.



My advice to you would be to cut down on the quantity and increase the variety.



So try something like



1 Orange Juice = 1 portion
2 slices of pineapple = 1 portion
2 slices of melon = 1 portion



1 apple = 1 portion



1 hand full of grapes = 1 portion.



You have eaten/drank something similar to your original list but hit the requirements of the 5 a day.



Also try and vary it so you may eat this one day but have more vegetable another day.  A general good idea is the more colours the better.

No.



More likely to do harm than good.  It would be better if you ate the fruit than drink its juice.  Fruit is good for you but vegetables are essential as they provide other minerals and vitamins which fruit does not have.  You need a combination of both

No you can only count juice as one portion, no matter how much or what variety, this includes smoothies too.



You have to have 5 to 7 portions of different fruitsa nd veggies. see this site, its really helpful

It is gross.. I don't like it either. It was rated one of the worst Halloween candies. It tastes like wax, you're right. Probably because it's coated with wax and all sorts of colored junk.



You cannot afford chocolates? You can but a candy bar for 50 cents at the stores... candy corn is about $1 per bag... just don't give out candy to trick or treaters if you can't afford it!

Candy corn is a confection popular in the United States, particularly around Halloween. Created in the 1880s by George Renninger of the Wunderlee Candy Co., the three colors of the candy are meant to mimic corn. Each piece is approximately the size of a whole kernel of corn, as if it fell off a ripe or dried ear of corn. The candy is usually tri-colored with a yellow base, orange center, and white tip, although the color combinations may vary. The most common variant, called "Indian corn", is white, orange, and brown. Indian corn is sometimes associated with the Thanksgiving holiday.
I can eat my body weight in the little sugar hunks! I prefer the shapes though, also known as mellow-creams... It's a personal preference thing though. My husband thinks they are too sweet, but if they hurt your teeth you may have dental issues to look into. Oh, by the way, you shouldn't post questions when you are too "influenced" to type them properly!

You should pay attention to the expiration date on the egg carton- after they are boiled- and you open them they should not smell bad- unless you do not like the egg smell- then you are going to have a hard time figuring this out.

Before you begin making the eggs, place them in a bowl of water.  If the egg sinks, it's good.  If it sort of floats vertically, it's starting to go bad (use immediately).  If the egg floats, it's bad, don't use it.

The smell will tell, but there is an easier way! Before you crack the egg, put it in a bowl (or cup) of water. If it floats, it is bad. If it sinks it should be all right. You can also check the date on the carton.

Fried egg, absolutely.  Folded over and eaten like an oyster.  Raw, sure.  It used to be a college stunt back in the 20s.  Hard-boiled?  Probably.  (You are talking about chicken eggs, yes?)

What are the sources of Vitamin A? I heared that there is no Vitamin A available in any fruit only our body is making it while we consume such thing? SO what about vitamib tablets? Please help me.

</answer from>



<answer>



Green and orange vegetables are good sources of Vitamin A (as beta carotene).  You want to stay away from vitamin A supplements because too much can be toxic for your body.  The supplements aren't usually made of much beta carotene, which is the safe form of vitamin A.

I have but i am a caterer & was able to use my butchers sausage maker machine!
People generally wouldnt get hold of the skins & then would need the machine for easy stuffing!
probably why a similar filling at home turns out to be borne as a type of meat loaf but would also go nice as a sausage mix.

Yes, a couple of times. The key to making a great sausage is that you need to add fat otherwise they come out all dry and nasty.



I love making vegetarian sausages with interesting fillings like smoked potato and cheese (my favourite), courgette, cream cheese, sun-dried tomato and nuts, or curried lentils.



Because I work in the food industry I can buy casings direct from the supplier, but you can also ask your butcher. A nice butcher that makes their own will normally sell you some.



Real casings come in different sizes and you drop them in warm water to soften them before you can use them; for vegetarian sausages I use artificial casings which you can usually get from a butcher selling halaal meats 'cos they're not allowed to use intestine casings for religious reasons.



If you don't have a sausage attachment for your mixer, you can put the filling into a piping bag and pipe it into the casing.

make a salad.
Chop up the romaine and the spinach, dice up tomato and onions for on top, then sprinkle cheese, finely dice some jalapeno to put on top, then lightly drizzle some dressing on. I would go with the caeser. also you could hard boil some eggs to crumble up.



Or



Make egg salad, since you don't have mayo, use some caeser dressing instead, and put chopped almonds on top. Serve on a leaf of romaine lettuce.

It's simple - fruits have seeds inside eg apple, tomato, pepper, orange, melon



And bananas are a herb, not a fruit or vegetable, so the first person is dead wrong!

Can too much water be bad for you?



I only drink water and sometimes milk. But I never drink juice or soda or anything like that. Unless I'm in a restaurant (rarely) I'll order lemonade, but mostly I'm always drinking water. My parents say that I need to drink juice as well to get nutrients, but I hate juice. Can too much water be bad for me?

Too much water can upset your salt balances.  You need things like potassium and sodium to function properly, which drinking too much water will flush out of your system.



Drinking only water isn't really the problem, if you eat healthy, but drinking excessive amounts of water can be a problem.

You have to drink a ton of water for it to be bad, as long as you have the right amounts of salt and potasium.  Juice, on the other had, is not very good for you.  It's high in sugar and doesn't contain the benafits of eating whole fruits.  You're much better off if you eat fruit and drink water.

As long as you eat fruits, vegetables, meats, grains, and dairy, drinking water won't harm you. It's true that even though water flushes out the bad stuff, it also flushes out the good nutrients, but as long as you replenish with good food, you'll be fine. You might also want to try taking vitamins each day for extra nutrients.



Water can be toxic when a large amount is chugged in a short period of time, or if too much water is consumed in general. You will start to feel light headed and perhaps shaky if you have drinken too much water. If this happens, just sit down and eat and you should be fine. :)

yes, anything in large portions could potentially hurt you. If you drink to much water, you could give yourself water poisoning. Just depending on how much you drink, if you drank like 4 water bottles a day, nothing would happen, but I'm talking like 8-10 bottles a day could drown  your body

Actual too much soda and juice is bad for you. When you drink a glass of apple or orange juice, you are actual eating about 8 apples. That's how much it takes to make  glass of apple juice etc. You body is made up of part water and part blood. Water is the only thing that will bath your body, Soda and Juice will not do it. I am surprised that your parents complain about you drinking water. Do, they realize how many of our children won't and don't drink water. Your parents are lucky to have you as a child. Look up all the benefits of water, so they next time they complain, you can educate them on the reasons why you drink water instead of anything else. It's also good for your complexion. The only way too much water is bad for you is if you drink gallons of it. You are suppose to drink the require amount of water to your weight. The heaver you are the more water, the small the less. Most doctors say 8 glass for the average person.

A lot of water can kill you. Try jumping in the sea, put your head below the water for 4 minutes, and see what happens.



How much water are you drinking? A few glasses over the course of the day, or pints and pints? Excess thirst can be an indication of other health problems. Normal amounts is fine. Water is good for you.



As long as you get the nutrients you need from food you are fine.



Remember that drinking too much (excessive) levels of water also interferes with your salt balance, and makes you more prone to illness.

Juice is good if you LIKE juice.  There are other ways to get the very same nutrients.

There isn't really a difference. Cracked corn is whole corn that has been cracked. I assume it'd be easier for an animal to eat [less chewing].

With cracked corn, the kernels have been passed through a set of rollers to partially crush them, exposing the insides to the outside.



It makes the malting process easier for making into mash, which is needed for fermenting, the first step in making Bourbon Whiskey.



Thus answering the question by Pinky, to The Brain,
"If Jimmy cracks corn, and nobody cares, why does he keep cracking it?"

My favorite is ice cold coke, but I usually drink Coke Zero because I watch my weight. I think Dr. Pepper tastes like some icky medicine. I can drink them if there's nothing else there. Have to pop it in the freezer for 10 minutes to improve the taste. To each his own. Florida here.

Grits do not taste like Oatmeal.  They have a very calm and plain taste and are excellent with butter.  I love grits.  Try them with butter.  Do you like popcorn?  Do you like Corn on the cob?  If yes, you should like grits just fine.  If not, then you will when you turn into a grownup!

The best way I can explain the taste is. Take some spaghetti grind it up very finely (like sand almost), boil till done. That's "fairly" close.

Well it really depends how you cook it. I like to marinade all my meat before cooking as it ensures good flavour and also keeps it nice and moist. With lamb chops I would have marianted them in olive oil with some garlic and rosemary and then lightly grilled them

It sounds to me as though you need to cook your chops for a bit longer. I usually cook them in a gravy for about 45 minutes in the frying pan with a little olive oil.

Did you overcook them? Lamb is at it's best when eaten rare or medium rare. Marinade for an hour or more before cooking and do not cut off the fat before cooking will also keep the meat moist and tender.

don't cook it overcook
choose meat really lamb not mutton
if lam is so thaugh, you can give some meat tendersier (papain)
marinade it first with you special ingredient, grill it first with little bit oil on gridle or frying pan only the surface was brown
This metode is not purpose to make it cooked but only make surface to be brown
in order to the juice which is contained, always force or not go out from meat
next method, grill it on grill for make it cooked, sometimes push the suface center of meat for make sure, it's already cooked or not

Hi there,  there's a few things i have to bring to your attention, allot of Butchers call lamb anything from a day old to 1 and a half  years old, the older the lamb the tougher and the darker the meat,  also any lamb that has grown in (hard country) during a drought  will have tough meat, all ways buy lamb that has a very light pink colour and avoid lean lamb, a milky white fat is what you should all ways be looking for,......... next but not least is the way that you cook meat, believe me you can make the best meat  really tough if you don't know how to cook it,  ....all-ways bring the meat to room Temperature for at least 15 minutes before you grill , fry, BBQ, etc etc,  don't cook lamb well done it dries , shrinks, and gets tough as well , but most of all it looses its natural juices  and flavor,  last of all lamb chops from the neck and shoulder (forequarter) will allways be tougher then chops from the mid and back (loin) and leg area,



enjoy

Unfortunately there is no sure way of telling if meat is going to be tender by just looking at id, and you can't handle it as that is unhygienic.



I tend to marinade meat for at least an hour before cooking. It helps to bash it a little also. (Great way to get rid of pent up frustrations)

Why are buffets so loaded with Salt?



We went to a buffet the other day for lunch.  After we ate I started getting sick and a headache.  I was noticing my blood pressure must have been high and elevated by the way I felt.  I had a heart attack 3 years ago, and this was very upsetting.  Why is this country allowed to put so much SALT in the foods that are served to the public.  The health industry must be in cahoots with these restaurants, "lets keep America sick", so all get money.  There should be better laws for our elderly and our people eating at buffets, the obesity is horrible and this Salt problem is wrong for all of us.  Am I correct in feeling this way?  I would just like some opinions please.  I may do an article in our local newspaper and I would love some views.  Thank you all in advance.

Stop eating at buffets or eating out. That's how you solve the problem. Not only is it unhealthy but a buffet is worse than most. The food is cheap and they don't care what they put on it. Of course it's full of salt and whatever else you don't need.



Why do you think there should be a law for old people or people eating at buffets???? No one tells them to eat there. They know it's unhealthy and if they cared about their health they wouldn't eat out all the time. Don't blame the restaurants or America, blame the fools that make up their mind to eat fattening and salt filled food. It's their responsibility and they are grown. Old people aren't stupid and know what they are doing. It's their business what they want to eat. Who cares? If they don't care, it's unhealthy then why do you? Leave it alone and just worry about what you eat.



It's not the restaurants responsibility that we eat healthy and it's not their problem if someone develops health problems from the food. No one put a gun to these people's heads and made them eat.

It's not the health industrie, but the manager of the bar you need to talk to. If they give you cheap food, you will pay for expensive drinks. Have you never been to a bar?



Whats for free?
Pretzels? Peanuts? Chips? Think about it man!



If there is a bar in the place with the buffet, it's going to be loaded with salt. It's not a conspiracy, it's good business!



The salt free stuff, isn't on the buffet menu, it's on the senior menu.
I found it all by my self.
But the real conspiracy is corn syrup!
That is where the Obesity is coming from! And with it, type 2 diabetes.

No one made you eat there. What good would a law do to stop you from eating there? Salt tastes good. Simple as that. It tastes good. I'd bet that it was MSG that gave you the headache. Doesn't change the fact that you have free will and make your own choices. You were not assigned to eat at this buffet on that day. You were not told to go back at any point or time. Suck it up and be responsible for yourself. Don't blame your health problems on anyone else.

The Truth:



Drinks are not included in the price of the buffet. Salt makes you thirsty, so they make the food salty so you get very thisty and order lots of drinks.



This is also why salted peanuts and pretzels are free in bars.

Foods at buffets aren't really the best quality. They have a lot of preservatives, i.e. MSG and sodium. Salt will also enhance the flavor. It's also good business. Salt makes a person drink more, and you have to pay per drink. Really, the only way to avoid obesity and poor nutrition is to cook for yourself and avoid restaurants when possible, especially buffets. They are businesses first and foremost, especially those that are chains. It's not just sodium you need to worry about, but saturated fats, etc. It's not a conspiracy really, it's just people making cheaper food with cheaper products and methods to increase profit.

I never used to, but I asked my hubby and he said that everyone does it.  And although I've never seen anyone else do it, I realized that I have seen bunches of only 2 or 3 bananas so people do do it.  And I love it for when I only need 2 or 3 for banana bread, or when my hubby only wants 3-4 for the week.  I break 'em up now too and haven't noticed any dirty looks, although I'm not paying attention to anyone else.

Swallowing gum effects?



What are they? I've heard they will stick to your intestines and you'll die earlier or that they'll get stuck in your throat eventually or they just dissolve like any other food or they just get pooped out. Answers?

It isn't dangerous



Chewing gum consists of a fibre that can't be digested by our bodies, so, if it's swallowed, apart from the unpleasant texture, it will pass harmlessly through the body intact along with other waste. There is no way it could get lost and wrap itself around vital organs or lurk in the stomach for untold years.

In rare cases, swallowing a large mass of gum, or many small pieces of gum over a short period of time, can block the digestive tract. Blockages in the digestive system are most likely to happen when gum is swallowed along with other indigestible things (like sunflower seed shells).



Although people cannot digest gum resin, they can digest the things that have been added to chewing gum, such as sweeteners or even medications (think of the nicotine gum used by people trying to quit smoking). The body absorbs these just through the act of chewing. This is where chewing gum can affect a person's health: When a person chews a lot of sugary gum, the calories can add up
