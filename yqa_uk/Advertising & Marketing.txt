Does Anyone In The UK Actually Ever Buy Anything From An American Seller On Amazon?



Taking into consideration the fact that, for example, a UK seller might be selling a CD for £2, many other UK sellers range in price from £2 to £8, but the American seller selling exactly the same product, is advertising it at something ridiculous and downright stupid like £36!!!!!???

I've even seen CDs for sale at prices like £70 when UK sellers are selling them for £2!!!

Why do they do it? They cannot sell anything at these utterly absurd prices surely?

Personally, I think they should be not allowed to advertise on here UNLESS the buyer specifically requests to look at sellers who are overseas. It is very annoying when you want to look for something and half the sellers aren't even in the UK.

Going green is being environmentally conscious.  Do you recycle?  Do you use paper or plastic bags at the store.  Do you bicycle instead of driving your car?



You promote it so people are proud to associate with you and your firm. ./

Going Green is something that was made up by the environmental nuts who brought the Global Warming conspiracy to the main-stream media. Ever since, it's be a big marketing pitch for company's that want to expand their products to these Greenies. So they say they're "Going Green". It's absolutely garbage, just like Global Warming. For the record, there's more Polar Bears than ever.

Green products actually use less chemicals than raid and the other hazardous sprays. Promoting green is to change the economy into saving our planet from pollution. Of course no one is going to stop buying SUV's nor stop throwing away recycling products. We are doomed if no one does something about this! Think about how the government has a lot of mind power over us! Think about if we remain ignorant and have no responsibility for our planet, would we eventually get replaced by robots? Who knows.

You need to be careful when you do pay per click campaigns. Some of the search engines out there don't filter out bots and you could be charged for bogus clicks.



I didn't know anything about this kind of stuff until I read this book.

I highly recommend you check it out. It not only talks about how to effectively use pay per click but it also explains the ins and outs of banner  ads, affiliate commissions, ezines, and a whole bunch of other stuff.



It doesn't matter what your business is, if you want to advertize on or off line, I can't think of a better program.



Check it out.

Okay first thing people need to realise is that when they cannot find paid work, they can go for voluntary - this does in fact BOOST up their experience etc - employers like willingness not just for the money but the ability to go and work (paid or not).  If they see you got for example some voluntary work in  psychology they may take you on.

Also some are not employd because they may not have the right skills. Employers dont say everything.



In the mean time if you realy cant find paid work -go for voluntary and carry on looking for paid whilst you do that - youll feel good about it too. Searching AND asking helps both.

okay here we go... but first it would be easier if you tell me your website? your website niche/topic, it would be easier for me to answer your questions.

adsense is passive, what you need to do is just to drive traffic to website, but you cant fix force your visitor to click your ads...

the alternative you can try to put some direct ads/banner on your website. or selling some text links.

if you are using a blog, try to make some paid reviews.

Google Adsense is great but you can also add products to your website. Try the following sites for this. They all work as the middleman between you and the merchant so they handle the payments of commissions and so on. In other words you don't have to worry about the merchant running off with your commission.

That's what councils do. Their concern is that if you do it then everyone else will so there would be signs everywhere. Plus they need to think about the legal aspect. For exampe, if you have a sign that comes off the wall on a windy day and flys into the window of a car and causes an accident then you might get into a bit of trouble.

How do you maintain a market for a long-lasting product?



Hey Internauts--

I am an engineer and I have no business background, so I figured I'd post this question here...

How does a company avoid what I call "The Maytag Effect"? We all know that the Maytag prides itself on selling products that are so long-lasting and maintenance-free that they rarely need replacement or repair. (So much so that the Maytag repair man is always shown falling asleep in the shop due to lack of work.) That is, how do industries, such as the car industry-- which in recent decades has advertised a product with a long lifespan-- continue to have a market to sell products to after 5 – 10 years? If they make good, strong, reliable products that still meet the users needs after 5 – 10 years, and users have no reason to buy another, how does the company continue to grow and sell more product? I know that there will be factors, such as people turning 16 and wanting to buy a new car, but I am talking about much larger underlying causes. One thing which I have been told is that, in the automotive industry at least, a couple of decades ago, began focusing on leasing programs in order to create a market for new products.

I am looking for references to books or articles that might be of use to me in researching how a company avoids having its own long-lasting products be their current products' primary competition.

As a specific example, how can a company that makes a very costly product which is spec'ed for a certain end-of-life performance level, but which is actually significantly overengineered and used by the primary customer well beyond the promised lifespan, continue to sell product and expand its market?



-thank you

<answer>



Breakdowns and unreliability are not the only reason consumers replace their goods.



Consumer behaviour is driven by the benefits that a product offers. The benefit could be prestige, fuel economy, efficiency, performance etc. Goods become obsolete as soon as newer versions of the same product type become available. When a consumer decides that a newer version of the same product type offers a significant enough benefit improvement over the product that he currently owns, he makes the purchase. Example - a 1995 Mercedes may still be perfectly functional. A person seeking prestige however will obtain more prestige from a 2008 Mercedes. A person seeking better fuel economy would get more mpg from the equivalent 08 model.

Check out this book on planned obsolesence, which has nothing to do with manufaturers making products which fail but with stressing the benefits of new products over those previously sold: http://www.jstor.org/pss/3108138

Remember that spam never works and sooner or later everything you own will be shut down. Your website will be blacklisted and then you'll be left with a dead business.

If you want to conduct business, then conduct it ethically.... build a list or rent one. Offer something unique and be prepared to work for it like every other successful business person in the world.

Good luck.

Do you mean a CUSTOMER or a CONSUMER  survey ?

A CONSUMER survey is invariably a means to obtain information from you about your likes and dislikes so your details can be added to mailing lists. For example, if you said you like  ski-ing then your details would be on the list sold to holiday companies who will then begin sending you details of the holidays they offer.

If it's a CUSTOMER survey then they will probably be trying to find out your opinion of the products they sold you, the service, appearance etc of the store where you were a customer.

I'm guessing.

Product.  You explain what is so wonderful about Flybe.  Bigger seats. Lower fairs.  Faster planes.  Environmentally friendly.

Positioning.



Do you compete against American Airlines?  Or do you seek a niche were you do not compete against the biggest airlines right away.

Publicity.  Do you have a lot of money to spend to get started.  Or are you just doing a few radio ads in targeted cities.

Persistence.  Many people don't notice an ad until they've heard it 5 times.  Don't give up. /

How Can I Sell My Own Music?



Hello, I My name is Jordan Sutton and i am a 14 year old male. I Have Recently started to create my own music (techno/trance) and i am really skilled in creating music, I use FL Studio 8 to create my music and i just finished creating my very first professional song. Now i have asked people on the street what they think of my song so i can ge an honest opinion and they love my song, to be honest they were amazed that i even created it! So As I Get to the point. I Am only young and i don't exactly know of any ways of how i can sell my music, i cant spend too much money on things yet as i do not have a job or earn enough money yet. So I Was Wondering if anyone knows how i can sell my music on a low budget or free if possible. And How Can I Get recognized by the public to get my name out there? thanks.

Design a website yourself or have someone design it for you.  It does not have to be fancy.  As long as it is easy to navigate and people can access your music easily and clearly, it will work.  As you earn more money you can expand.

If you don't know how to design a site yourself, contact these people for great websites at low prices &gt;&gt; http://www.webdesigndiscount.com/wdd/ind...

Big Problem in Budget?



Hi,



I have a problem in my budget. I owe my bank about $900 and they sent me a letter that i need to pay the amount ASAP before they closed my account. Otherwise they will close my account and send a report to ChexSystem which is a credit bureau company, and i have to wait for five years until i can access my credit again. I don't know how to get $900. I used to work at ASIG which is an Airport Service company I could've still have the money to pay, but I got laid-off because there are lack of flights or flight schedule and cutting off-hours and THAT SUCKS A LOT, and also the reason why is that any job companies can't hire new people. Any ideas how to get or borrow $900?

Contact your bank and tell them that you've been laid off/schedule cut.  Tell them you're looking for new work and that you have every intention of paying the bank back. Ask them for time, and a schedule that allows you to pay back in small, manageable amounts.  It's in their interest to help you make your payments.  But you need to make contact with them and have that communication.



Good luck.

write an article and allow a local magazine or the newspaper to publish it for free. they are always looking to fill in a spot or two.

don't underestimate the power of email.  send  friendly letter to everyone in your email address book asking them as a friend to check out your website and forward your email to everyone in their address book.



i have 85 people in my address book and if they all sent to everyone in their address book and so on, that can add up real quick....

I don't think they are important.  There are a few companies which send me text messages as a form of marketing - one or two of them are companies which I gave my number to a long time ago for various reasons, but the vast majority are companies whom I have no idea where they got my number from.  Regardless, I find these messages to be annoying and a nuisance.  Plus, they don't even work as a marketing tool because usually I will just delete the message and forget about it.

Now, I think there are some things that can be marketed effectively via mobiles, but these are usually limited to the youth market - teenagers are generally not too busy to read/act upon a text.  Plus, obviously downloading music, ringtones, etc can be a form of marketing if that is encouraging someone to go and buy a whole album.

One thing that I think is quite interesting is that Sony have just launched a new phone with Usher's new album already loaded onto it.  I'm curious to know what the point of this is.  I actually can't imagine that anyone would buy a phone for this reason, given that if you really wanted the album there are plenty of other cheap means to obtain it.  I can't really imagine that Usher is getting anything out of it either - okay, it might mean that people will listen to it who wouldn't have done otherwise, but if you're giving them a whole album then you're not making any money out of them because they've got nothing left to buy.

Why am I doing your homework for you?

You can only do that if it has no bids already on it and more than 12 hours left to run. Just click on 'revise item' and go from there.

You need to buy the rights to some PLR articles and adjust them a little and post them to your blog. The blog template is O.K. but your content is very limited.  Private Label Rights to articles will give you the content you need to spruce up your blog.

You've asked a complicated question.  But I will try to answer it.

The basic departments for an ad agency are as follows:

Account Service (dealing with clients and acting as a liason with the rest of the agency)

Creative (this includes copywriters art directors, graphic designers, creative directors)  If this is where you want to go, you may need to take additional course work at someplace like Miami Ad School to be able to compete for the best jobs.

Media Planning / Buying (works with agency and client to create a plan for client advertising that includes a good media mix, negotiates with media for best prices)

Strategy (larger agencies will often have a separate department for this, small to mid-size will absorb this into account service)

Research



What you make income-wise depends on where you decide to focus, what size agency you go to, and where it is located.  For instance, a beginning copywriter fresh out of school in a small to mid-size agency in the midwest can expect to start at around $30 - 36,000.



There isn't a way to tell you in this post what the entire income potential is...but I can point you to a place where you can find out.  Go to www.adweek.com and look around.  They publish an annual salary survey every year, and you may be able to access last year's.

I CAN tell you, however, that if you are willing to work hard and learn quickly, a career in advertising can be very lucrative.  It can also be a lot of fun.  : )

Good luck!

best is different for you, me everyone. re ask the question and if the information you seek is in regards to where you want to be, working towards building a career then sit down with yourself and ask what excites you what gets you pumped up. because if I tell you selling bird cage liners on line is the best it gets and you get into it and in three days you realized that selling bird cage liners isn't for you. So again I suggest to everyone find a career in something a product or a service or both that you can continually learn while doing and continually gives the rewards (money) you need to be happy.

Amazon kind of ripped me off?



I made an order for;

( Kath and KIM series 1 to 4 box set limited edition 12 discs [DVD] )

which cost 25 quid.....when i recieved it...it came in a small package and it was JUST series 4 with 2 discs. i then looked at the order on amazon and they funnily enough changed the title to "Kath and Kim series 1 VHS Video Tape"



But Amazon isn't fully responsible as it came from a marketplace seller called caiman.com

THE LINK FOR THE ORDER IS



http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN...

i've sent e-mails to uk@caiman.com which it says on the invoice if i have any problems. they havnt replied. they dont seem bothered...i also try and write a report on the sellers feedback..a little rant to warn future buyers what rip off complete set of FU#^*NG complete set of T1ts they really are and they know what there doing.



Theres probably nothing i can do but i dont blame amazon as it didnt come from them. in future if its not dispatched from amazon...but from a nobby company that takes 20 days to dispatch and another 9 bazillion to get it to your door..i wont even bother.

Should i not even bother..or should i send amazon an email what happend..also whats amazons customer care link..or an email address?

AS A NEW CUSTOMER WITH 'AMAZON' I ORDERED GOODS WORTH £300 ON MY FIRST ORDER BUT I HAD TO SEND THEM BACK BECAUSE OF THEM BEING FAULTY. IT TOOK THEM AGES TO RE'FUND MY HARD EARNED CASH AND THIS WAS ONLY AFTER COUNTLES OF UNANSWERED EMAILS AND UNSATISFACTORY TELEPHONE CALLS MADE BY MYSELF. IN THE END IT WAS ONLY AFTER I THREATENED THEM WITH BAD PRESS AND LEGAL ACTION ETC THAT THEY GOT THEIR ACT TOGETHER. IT TOOK ABOUT 3 MONTHS BEFORE I GOT THE RE'FUND. MY ADVICE TO ANYONE IS DONT BE TEMPTED BY THEIR CHEAPER TO BUY FROM THEM SALES JARGON AND DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM OR THE LIKES OF THEM. SHOPPING ONLINE IS NEVER 100% SAFE AND 'AMAZON' GOODS IF SHOPPED AROUND ELSEWHERE CAN BE FOUND AROUND THE SAME PRICE. HOPE THIS HAS HELPED?!

They have ripped you off but don't give up and keep complaining until you get a refund or what you have paid for. Do you have the original confirmation email from Amazon? I usually keep my confirmation emails when i buy online whether it's from Ebay or anywhere else.

Do not rant and rave, i know you want to but it is the worst thing you can do. Try to be polite and explain the problem.

Good luck and I hope this helps.

I run a driving school and i've been going for years in a big city with much success. I'm moving soon to the middle of nowhere and although there are a lot of customers there, not many have the net and thats how i've always got my work in the past.

Post Flyers and send out Post Cards with discounts/advertisements to announce your new business. You can get great professional products with competitive prices that you can customize to your needs. If there are any fundraisers or events in the area, try to sponsor them so you can get some great customer recognition.

I'd recommend (in addition to some of the other good responses) radio advertising.  It's relatively inexpensive and you can 'buy' the best times for your target market:  are you targeting teens and their families?  If yes, then the best time is when they're out of school and on the road - 3:30 p.m.  or target their parents at 7:30 a.m. on the way to work.



I'd also consider contacting high schools in the area and see if they will let you post and distribute flyers to grade 12s.  They might even let you run a program in conjunction with them - I'm from Canada and my kids took a driving school program that was promoted by the high school (it was discounted if you took it through the school because of the number of kids who signed up).

Good luck!

The internet is growing faster then you think.  So you can't give up on that!  You should set up a free profile on http://104inc.com.  The 104inc brand will help drive business to your driving school (no pun intended).  You can then get the word out by posting signs in local stores.  Word of mouth will really help a business like yours and it's free!

Excellent thinking.  Everyone needs a mentor.

Finding a mentor and promoting their product is what changed me from a marketing flop to actually making money online.

Avoiding "Information Overload" is essential.  It is easier to do this when you find that mentor.  Choose carefully and take your time.

If you want to know how I found my mentor, the  take a look at my site.

Best of luck to you!!

Hi there,
I, myself was where you are, about 6 months ago. I had been looking for ages for a legit way of working on the Internet to make money. I tried all sorts, bought into allsorts and was on the verge of giving up, thinking that they were all a waste of time.
My wife then came across a self made millionaire from Internet Marketing and his way of working seemed to be different. We signed up, went to a Weekend retreat and it has changed our lives. If you would be interested in taking a look at one of the systems that we work the website is in the source box below.

Help with interview at vue cinemas. What will they ask?



My interview is at blackburn vue cinemas and what will they ask me?
what can I ask them at the end of interview?
Anything else i need to know?
(By the way interview is just before college)



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It won't be too challenging, as many people have their first jobs in cinemas so they're not expecting you to have a great deal of work experience to talk about.

They'll probably ask about customer service, so think of examples of times when you've provided great service, even if it needs to be an example from school.

Other questions that you should be prepared for are what are your strengths, what are your weaknesses, and why do you want the job (hint:  they'll want to see that you have a personal interest in working in a cinema and in a customer-focussed role).

You could ask them about what the duties would be - e.g. do you rotate between ticket counter, food, floor staff or are you assigned to one only?  You could ask them about what hours you would work.  Ask them anything you like about the role itself or the company.  Don't ask about anything to do with pay, benefits, training opportunities or room for progression - a first interview is about what you're going to do for them, not what they can do for you.

With regards to anything else ...

Firstly, make sure that you're dressed appropriately, and ask your mum if you don't know what appropriate is.  You're not expected to wear a suit.  But, I have seen people post questions on here asking if you can wear jeans to an interview ... no, you can't.  You should preferably wear smart trousers and a nice shirt with a tie.

In terms of how you present yourself, be friendly and outgoing because this is a customer-focused job so those attributes are important.  But don't be informal.  Make sure you answer the question that is being asked.  Go into details and explain your answer properly - an interview is generally only successful if you do most of the talking - but don't waffle on if there is no need for it.  Be enthusiastic.

2.  Yes
Home - in bed by 8:30 every night - no TV after 8:00 (that was up until I was 12)
School - not allowed in the classroom during lunch - I used to go in anyway because it was cold.  I'm sure there were lots more rules than that though!

3.  2

4.  Nuclear

5.  Yes, to a point - went to Mass every Sunday and went to a Catholic secondary school, and was baptised and all that stuff.  Not hardcore - didn't say prayers every night or Grace before meals or anything.

I have not taken on board or contacted any potential advertisers since the site wasn't completely ready to manage this.

Now since the website is completed I need a company to contact potential advertisers and work with me on a revenue sharing basis, Please let me know if any of you are aware of any companies who would be able to assist me.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a great way to drive traffic that is organic and will actually allow you to convert.  Be wary of other methods that are frowned upon by Google/Yahoo such as online indexes and directories that can actually demote your page rank.  You really want high quality back links.  I found my best bet was to hire a firm that specialized in this.  I actually used Barlam Enterprises.

2500 pageviews is wayyyyyy too small. You won't even get accepted at some banner ad networks such as BurstMedia.com, which requires minimum of 4000 impressions

The rate depends on a number of factors:

- who your audiences are (even if you have only 2500 but your site attracts CEOs and other high net worth individuals, then you can charge even $50 per CPM or thousand impressions)

- what's the ad format to be used ( you can charge more for a medium rectangle than a 125x125 button)

Before you even think of the rate, know who your audiences are. Not just traffic, but demographics. Who are they - are they middle income 20-45 years of age earning an average of $80,000 a year or are they students?

It is hard to give examples of the rate. But if you want to be inspired as to how much some of the blogs charge, look at the authors of the ad agency Federated Media, which sells ads for top blogs such as TechCrunch, BoingBoing, Duct Marketing, etc

The average price for this blog would be about $50 a year. Unless, the blog is targetted toward a very specific niche. For example, if your blog is telling people how to incorporate with step by step examples and you help them fill out the papers then you could charge based on expected sales. If a company sold incorporation papers for $100 each, and you could show that have 2500 'verified buyers' then you can charge a few hundred dollars.



No one is going to pay for 'random traffic' but if you can prove that your readers are ready to buy, and then you pre-sell them, and last you 'validate' that they are serious buyers - then you can ask up to $500 and expect to find a client

Honestly, you should try to hire a SEO consultancy service to have a professional approach to your probem, but usually ranking depends on the number of links you get among other things.

There is no easy way to get your site a high ranking.

1) Target the right keywords. Target the wrong keyword phrases and your online business is destined to fail.



2) Don't use keywords or phrases that are too broad. The competition is too fierce, and research has shown that though you will get more traffic through general phrases, that traffic doesn't convert to sales. All of the traffic in the world will do you no good if it doesn't convert to sales!



3) Optimize your page content. Target each Web page to a different and highly focused keyword phrase. In other words, your main page should be optimized for one keyword phrase. Are the keywords used relative to the site's overall content? Do you use too many keywords, or too few?

Just know i go through to your site. Search engine optimization (SEO) is your starting point for getting traffic & ranking. After all, Google has to "like" your web pages, and people have to be able to find them. All SEO means is making your pages human and Google friendly.

Your website needs seo friendly search engines. you should work on various factors of SEO ( search engine optimization) to get your site rank & traffic well in the search engines.

And PPC(pay per click) is one of the SEO techniques used to get instant results, i.e., your site gets indexed easily and in a less time. Here, you actually post some ads relating to your website into major search engines and pay to the SEs for displaying them on the serps. Here you target certain set of keywords for which you wish to get the traffic and the visitors. And also you bid for the ads being displayed. ppc is not exactly the toughest process but is one of the important process.

Post code and delivery problems.?



My neighbours and I are having problems with deliveries. No matter how carefully we enter our addresses for on line goods they invariable fail to arrive.
 For instance if I enter my address as:- Mr 
Smith, 7 Alma Road, Great Hollands, Bracknell, RG12 4RG (not my real address of course) the delivery address on the parcel reads "7 Great Hollands" (a large community of about 100 streets) completely missing out the street name and making it undeliverable. 
Putting it right takes several phone calls and 2 or 3 attempts at delivery before the goods finally arrive. The problem seems to be that the database used by various suppliers is faulty.
2 suppliers have admitted that rather than copy out addresses they merely copy the post code and use an address database to find the (wrong) address.
How can we contact these database holders and correct the problem?

Most of the database holders use the Postal Address File provided by Royal Mail.  Your first step would be contacting Royal Mail's customer service and asking what they have on PAF for your address.  It may take some time to see the effect of any correction depending on how frequently the database holders update their system.

(You have my sympathies.  We have another business near us which uses our postcode so we regularly receive deliveries for them and the delivery drivers become very irate sometimes that they're at the wrong address.)

Good luck!

<answer>



The website should have full contact details of the company advertising the goods.  They should also have a set of terms and conditions on the site that includes a returns/refund policy.  When you enter your details, there should be a secure server sign that comes up on the bottom of your screen.

If the company you're dealing with is a limited company, once you have their full contact details from the site, you can check them out on the Companies House website.  This will show when they set up and whether they're returns are up to date.

You can also look up Whois to find out who registered the domain name.  It's harder to track this back now as domain registrants are allowed to choose not to have their details displayed on Whois.

If there's no address or telephone number on the website, I'd be very wary of doing business with them.

If the payment is through Paypal, I think you can check whether they're a verified merchant with Paypal.

Good luck!
