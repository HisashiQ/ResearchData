Don't use a loan shark, they can cost you an arm and a leg!

Technically, if you borrow from a loan shark they are not licenced and you do not have to pay them back the money, but try telling them that!

Seriously, you are better of going to some legitimate lender.  Even the Provident is cheaper than the average shark. Look locally for Credit Unions or other social lenders, or try the banks.

Try a money advice service, they may be able to help you sort things out  - do you really need that much?

re next answer - loan shark means unlicensed, unaccredited lender. The example you show is fully licensed.

Top Up credit cards.?



I have heard of a type of credit cards for children that you put credit onto them. This way you can just put on enough credit to buy something online which makes it much safer. What are these cards called and which are the most recognised on websites. Also, where can you "top" them up(put credit on them) N.B i live in ireland! Thanks in advance

They are prepaid "credit" card. Mastercard and Maestro are the most popular but for the internet, the first one is adviced.

You top up at Post office, Bank, or online.

Like someone mentioned earlier, you need to read the SMALL PRINT...as some of the card have very expensive "maintenance" charges.

At the moment, I beleive that BREAD CARD and VIRGIN PREPAID are the best one for the UK.

In Ireland, I am not sure, but a quick search google.ie for prepaid credit card ireland, should give you some good results.

They are known as "Pre Paid" credit cards.

The charges are expensive and there are restrictions placed on them concerning how you can add credit to them (presumably to stop money laundering).



I wouldn't have taken one if I had been fully aware of the costs and restrictions.

I had already deferred previously but after working overseas I completely forgot about it. Stupid, yes, but I've been too worried to know what to do. I work as a teacher in S.E Asia so at no time have I earned enough to meet the minimum salary required for repayment and have documentary proof of this but it's been so long I'm terrified and have kept putting it off. Please give me some advice. If you want to be a wise-guy and  have a laugh at my expense (it happens on 'Answers' from time to time), please don't bother. Thank you for your time.

I don't live in the UK, but I have used a similar plan here.  You can't put anything but credit cards into the account.  They talk with your creditors and either decrease or drop the interest all together.  Then, you have a set monthly fee that has to be paid and will probably be automatically be taken from your bank account.  The credit cards won't be any good anymore, but you will see the balances drop really fast.

Hi i used payplan for about 3 years...I found them to be quite good...they negotiated with all my creditors and got all the interest stopped on my credit cards and loans....I however think that they must of been charging me some sort of money...I remember thinking that the payments outstanding didnt seem to be going down very quickly and i always wondered if some where down the line they had added their charges on without me realising...Probably my imagination but if i were you i would get them to write down what they are paying each creditor each month out of your repayments to them.

Hope this helps and good luck...

Is VISA Debit card payments protected by VISA and chargebacks available?



I have a Halifax VISA Debit and used it recently to buy something online. I was charged twice - so I contacted Halifax for a chargeback.

Are chargebacks available for visa debit, the same way they are available on credit cards?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



In this case, you must contact customer service at Halifax and get them to help you dispute the double-billing. The process is a bit more involved and time-consuming than just doing a chargeback on a regular credit card purchase, but it can be done.



They may tell you to first contact the company that double-billed you. Don't be alarmed or offended if that's the first answer they give, they are obligated by law to tell you that. Just do as they say, and only get back to them if the company that double-billed you gives you an unacceptable answer.

Odds are very good this happened as a result of computer error, and sometimes getting anybody to take responsibility for reversing a computer error requires a lot of phone calls.

All those companies do is take your money and make the payments for you (i.e. money management) and charge you a pretty penny for doing so.

It sounds like you inherited this debt, it wasn't from your lack of discipline.  In any event, you need to work out a budget.  Pay off the smaller debts first, then use the money from those payments to attack larger stuff.  It's not easy, but that's the way it's done.

Also, talk to your creditors and explain the situation.  If you are making a good faith effort and paying something, many of them will work out a payment plan or lower finance charges, etc.

First off, I wouldn't contact any companies you find on the internet. They could very easily be scams, especially if they're asking for that much money. Not to mention that these companies NEVER get you out 100%. So claiming they can seems fishy to me. Open up the phone book and look for more reputable debt consolidators.



Debt consolidators simply consolidate your bills, which makes it seem like they're saving you thousands of dollars when, really, they're only cutting out the interest...if you're lucky. Say you have 20 thousand dollars on 4 cards... and they're all high interest (over 25%). so you've got 4 cards with a minimum payment each month of about 200 dollars or more (800 a month). What the consolidators do is get all of your bills together in one to give you one smaller monthly payment of 500 a month. You still have to pay your debts-- there's no magic service that will wipe out what you've charged. But they make your overall monthly payments lower because now you're only paying 1 or 2 bills instead of 5.

There are other forms of debt relief, too, where they negotiate with your cc company to get your interest down to extremely low percentages, like 3% for a year. The cc company agrees because while they aren't making as much money off of you, at least they're getting paid. it's better than nothing. and 29-31% interest to 3% interest is a HUGE difference in your monthly payment- hundreds of dollars. and almost ALL of your payment is going toward the principle balance whereas, before, almost all of it is going toward your interest, which is why no matter how much you pay the balance never seems to go down.

Your consolidator will negotiate a minimum monthly payment for you and you'll stay on the plan for however long the cc company agrees-- usually 1 year. in the case of discover card, for instance, when the year is up and you've paid down a lot of the debt because you aren't really paying interest (so that 5 thousand dollars on that card in now down to 2 or 3), they'll put you back to the original interest rate. in some cases, you may be able to ask for a continuance of the special rate.

however, there are some drawbacks. as someone who used to work for a credit card company, you need to be aware that the moment your cc companies find out you're even talking to consolidators, they'll close your accounts-- just for talking to them. you may not even decide to do it and you just call for information. If the CC company finds out, they'll close your accounts (meaning you won't be able to use those cards again, ever). When a debt company like these calls the cc company to see what your interest is and to get you on a payment plan, that's a warning to the cc company that you may be a payment risk and they may lose money. So they stop you from being able to charge anymore, usually permanently.

So while it seems like a great deal to be able to consolidate and pay off your debts at a substantially lower rate, remember that you won't have charge cards anymore, and you probably won't for at least 5 years.



you'll have to make all of your payments without missing any, as well. they're giving you a great deal by lowering your interest so much to get you to make payments, so they expect you to not 'forget' or have any problems. i'm not sure but i believe that if you miss more than 1 or 2 payments or are late more than a couple of times, they revoke the deal.

also, your credit is now pretty much shot the minute you have to negotiate payment. that's something you can work to get better, though. but while paying off the debts, which make take years, buying a home, a car, anything of value will be next to impossible. you could be denied jobs. You'll also have a hard time getting credit cards back after you've paid everything off. CC companies aren't going to want the same thing to happen again. So if they do give you a card, it will start at a very, very high interest rate. that's just something you have to accept going into it. but hopefully you'll never have this problem again.

So you'll have to decide what you want to do and if the situation is so bad that there's no other option. often, though, there are solutions you can try before going to the credit councilors.



Take a look at your cards and what they offer-- one may offer an extremely good deal on balance transfers (often you can find some that are 0% for a year). so transfer your 5 thousand balance on one card to the new card and cut out all the interest you're paying, not to mention that all your payment is going toward the principle, so that 5 thousand will go down pretty fast, as will the minimum payments.

Do you know someone with decent-good credit who would be willing to co-sign a loan for you? Getting a loan from a bank could easily pay off your bills, and paying the bank loan is MUCH easier than paying the cc's. Interest is tons lower and, best yet, it actually helps your credit as long as you don't miss payments. Your cards would be paid off and still remain open, your payments would be lower, you'd have only one bill and, if you pay it off without problems, it would actually boost your credit score.

and while it's kind of icky-- you could sue your ex. if the charges on the account are partially hers, then she's responsible for them as well. especially if her name is also on the card. then she's legally required to be responsible for half--- even if all the charges were yours.

new credit card at halifax? any good?
I went into my local branch at halifax, to deposit some funds into my account. The lady at the counter stated to me that I was guaranteed a credit card, namely a halifax credit card all in one card.

Now I am not a big money spender, I thought I’ll use the credit card to pay for my petrol which I fill up twice in a month to a value of £40.

The lady handed me over to gentlemen who processed my details into a computer and did a check and was told, I am pleased to tell you that your credit card application has been successful.

the man mentioned something about 15.9% apr. what is this?

So my question is for example when my credit card statement arrives, and the balance that I have to off for example is £40 and I want to pay it off straight away, what would the total cost be including the 15.9%?

Check the website out: is the credit card any good?

If you pay off the entire amount before the due date you pay no interest. The Credit Card company hope that you will miss the date from time to time, or run up a large bill that you can't afford to pay off straight away. That's basically how they make their money.
I use an Egg card. You can set up a direct debit to pay off all transactions by the due date. That way you don't have to monitor the statements to make sure you don't miss the date.

They are offering you a credit card with a 15.9% APR which means annual percentage rate.

If you buy petrol for £ 40 and pay the balance straight, before the due date then that's all you owe. However if you do not pay the balance by the due date then you'll pay £40 + 15.9% =  £$46.36

most credit card companies are offering a pay as u go style credit card mastercard is probably the best one to choose as American Express is definitely not used by so many companies now as it used to be, the way it works is you go into a place like those cheque cash places uc on the high street u fill out the application, you can normally start topping them up straight away, and voila pre paid credit card, always make sure it will be a recognised one and Im sure they take a charge for it as well, for the service so to speak so check that out also

Don't you get credit card offers in the mail?  Most people do...

When I was 18 and had no credit, it took me forever to find a card that would take me with only a $200 limit.

You don't need ID to get a card.

Even though you don't need it to apply for a credit card, go to your local motor vehicles licensing office and get pedestrians permit.
It's simply government issued ID. You'll need at least a birth certificate to prove who you are. Take along school ID if you have one.

As for credit application, you only need be 18 years old and have a SSN.

Are you a US citizen or resident?  Because without a Social Security number, no credit card due to Patriot Act policies.  That number is the only type of ID that you need.

WHY do you need a Credit Card???. Do you have a Job? If & when you
should get that card what would you do with it??. Is it because your quote & quote FRIEND or FRIENDS have Credit Card why you wants one?. Well let me try & see if I can get to your EARS. A Credit Crd. do nothing for you but put you in financial problem I means that in a short time you will be having no cred @ all because you will be having all bad
Cred and if you really need to get some thing like a house witch you will
NEED not want but NEED then you won't be able to have it because you have NO Cred but a BAD one, so for get about that CARD and save your money and if you want some thing to buy you save up your money and pay for it cash since it is not a hug purchas like a car or a house. Take my advice you do not want that Card never mind NEEDS it so for get it BIG MAN OK.

How do I use an arranged overdraft? 10 points



I have just upgraded my account to a student account as I am starting uni in September. However, there is an overdraft facility for which arranged overdrafts are interest free and I was wondering how I would use this ( i.e. Phone the bank to arrange me taking it out, use the cashpoint etc )

Using an overdraft is basically just like using the money if it was your own, you take it out at cash points or you can pay for things with your debit card. So if you had a £500 overdraft and you already had £200 in there you could use £700 in what ever way you like. Though overdrafts are the cheapest way to borrow as soon as you start spending it you get yourself into a steep hole that you will probably still have way into your working life. Remember that you still have to pay the money back at some point!

You need to talk with your bank, they are quite good at handing out overdrafts, but just be care full Remember, if you keep using it, you have to keep paying it back!
Just call your bank, or go into your bank.

You basically call the bank and ask them if you can have it enabled which they will probably do as they make money off it. There will most likely be an admin charge and a monthly charge even it it is interest free.

Just be careful, it can be difficult to get out of an overdraft situation as you tend to stay in the red once you're in it. Ideally it should only be used for emergencies and if you know you've got some money coming soon to revover you out of it.

You need to speak to your bank, any branch convenient to you will do.

Your banking advisor will discuss your requirements with you and tell you if they are going to allow you an overdraft facility and how much you can have.

Once they have given you a figure, they will also tell you when the facility will be available, usually within a day or two.

When you have a "free" overdraft as a student it is important not to abuse your bank account in any way because, if you do, they will withdraw the facility and you will have to pay it back immediately or start paying interest and penalties on it.

Once you have been told your overdraft limit and it has become available you may allow your account to be overdrawn up to, but not more than, that limit. You don't have to contact the bank each time you are going overdrawn (unless they put special conditions on your account). Use the overdraft as a buffer, it can be accessed in any way you normally withdraw money from your account (cash, cashpoint, cheque, direct debit, standing order etc.).

Your overdraft must always be considered the bank's money. It is a loan to you that they can withdraw at any time. When you stop being a student, they will start charging you interest on your overdraft after allowing you a short time (up to a year) to start earning money.

Good luck at university. Take full advantage of all the opportunities available to you there.

If I have not completely answered your question, please e-mail me for clarification of anything you're not happy with.

As long as the bank has authorised the amount of overdraft you can think of it as an emergency fund and access it exactly the same way as your current account. Unlike some of the answers I think it's good to have access to an "emergency" fund as long as you remember that its a loan and needs to be paid back.

Why in the world would you want to go into overdraft? Look up what it means first.

Here's an quick example: You have $500 in checking account. You buy a $1,200 laptop. You are now at a balance of -$700. This is your overdraft.

Sure, it's no interest but two rules apply in WAMU and Bank of America:

1. You must pay the $700 back by two weeks or else your account gets closed. Then at four weeks, they send creditors and collections agencies to your house.

2. Every time you go into a negative balance, you gain overdraft hits on your credit report. This is minor compared to you getting hit with a "forced account close due to nonpayment" on your credit rating. And you loose MAJOR points if a collection agency has to go to your house.

Trust me.. you want a good credit score. You do want to own a house one day don't you? If you're a gold digger, your bad credit score can make creditors say no to your husband (even if he has perfect score) simply because of YOUR score.

Because for a first order it is too higher value. Your limit is £150 for first order, once you start paying it off, your limit will increase.

These two answers are so correct, it is probably because you are new and this is your first order, they don't want you to purchase one of their higher priced items and then run out on them.  So, for a new customer, they will start you out with a lower limit.



They should have given you a credit limit when they approved your account for this catalog.

It is 6 years but then they sell them to other collection agencies who try again - if you get letters from these places ignore them and it will eventually stop but if you phone them it reopens your files and you have to wait another 6 years.

My guess is you'll get your money refunded tomorrow.  Banks work on business days.  Friday business occurs Friday morning.  Monday "business" usually hits Saturday morning - at least that's how it works with my accounts at Suntrust Bank.  I bet yours is the same.  So, don't fret.  It will get there if it gets there.  And again, if not, follow the other advice and borrow a few bucks until Monday when you do get the refund.

Having said that, banks still suck.  They kill us with fees, and policies which are designed to pile fees upon fees.  It's awful.  Don't get me started.  ;)

theres absolutely nothing u can do unfortunately but hope that something goes in, do they have it on record that you changed the dates for your direct debits? if so they are at fault then I would take it higher, isnt there anyone a friend or someone who can lend u some cash so you can celebrate your birthday tomorrow? If the cash isnt in I would write a letter for monday morning and send it straight to their head office telling them everything that has happened and how they left you with no funds for your birthday and it ruined a planned event, I would then demand they compensate you and threaten taking legal action against them you should find they will soon change their tune, I really hope you can get something sorted out Gilly xif its any consolation I worked full time and was with lloyds tsb my wages went in around 900 quid I was a single parent at the time I had cancelled 2 ten pound cheques I went to withdraw cash to take my kids for a meal and I couldnt get any money out, they had been giving me bank charges without sending me letters constantly everyday a 35quid charge for a month they left me and my kids with nothing for a whole week until it was sorted out then after the week went by it still wasnt fixed I lost all my wages to them and they had the cheek to keep adding charges that accrued to nearly 3,000quid in a matter of 3 months! I am now fighting them through court to get the charges back and they closed my account down because of this its terrible banks think they are a law unto themselves.

I hope you applied to your bank for the loan.
Generally, you could say one to two weeks.  Your online application will be printed up and pass through various checks such as bankruptcy search, your ability to repay, is the requested sum in keeping with the internal regulations of the Company.
Again it is possible that it will pass through two or three peoples hands at different stages.
It is usually normal for you to receive an Offer Letter for signature and return - this is where you sign up to the terms and conditions.
What we didn't hear from you is how long have you been waiting?

Seriously in debt and living in fear?



What are the chances of a couple lasting that are seriously in debt? They have already broken up 3 times in 6 years.  They both owe 7 years back payment in taxes plus 60,000 dollars each on other loans.  They have no assets and live in a studio.  They are 28 and 29.  What do you think their chances of lasting as a couple and having children?  They can barely pay the interest off the debt and are hiding from the authorities by living in a sublet.  They don't have their name on their letterbox and cannot put on the light at night for fear of debt collectors.  Yes, they went on a expensive holiday they put on their credit card last week.  The leasing company is coming this week to take back both of their cars.

Well I am in the UK and work in the world of debt as a job. The fact that they went on an expensive holiday on a credit card ( for which they are not going to pay back, are they? ) means they would lose all my respect. They have no responsibility in their lives and their world needs to crash down on them. Saying that, they remain human beings with a right to exist. This is a classic case of nipping their irresponsible lifestyle in the bud!  They need to come down to basics, admit to the world their situation by applying for bankruptcy and learn how to live with each other again, never to borrow another penny and accepting a poorer lifestyle. That's what marriage should be all about, 'for better or for worse' ..... and yes, get this out of the way and they can survive as a couple.  If they love each other, anything is possible.  But they have to admit that they have a problem.

You've already split up 3 times in 6 years, it would be unfair to bring a child into this situation & I think the pressure of having a child would drive you to breaking point, the chances of splitting for good would significantly increase.



Both of you are wasting your lives hiding from your debtors & failing to deal with your immediate problems.



Get a grip on your finances and investigate declaring yourselves bankrupt.  Once you've established whether or not you can go for bankruptcy or re-negotiate with your creditors, I would make an appointment with the tax man and see if they were willing to write off some of what you owe.

The best bet for this couple is serious financial counseling. They need to get rid of their credit cards and work out payments to get rid of their debt. Bankruptcy may be the short term solution but it will not solve the problem that got them into this bind in the first place. Unfortunately the relationship will not survive unless they both get a grip and start accepting responsibility.



I would also strongly advise against having children until there is some kind of long term financial plan. Children are expensive, even the healthy ones.

Is it normally a requirement to have a reasonable amount of funds before being given a rather large business loan?
Myself and a couple of people I know would like to open up pet boarding facilities in our area as there is only 1 boarding kennels for our rather large town and there is definitely a market for it. We all have animal care related qualifications and experience and some managerial experience, but none of us are home owners. Is there any chance of us getting a loan for this venture?

To get a large business loan all of you will need immaculate credit histories.  They will look at your personal credit histories as an indication of how well you can really handle business.

Then you need a very well written business plan extended out for 12 months at minimum.  That is down to the last detail like where, when, how.

You do not have to have a lot of money to get the money but you do need a business plan and good credit individually.

Unfortunately, yes.



You have to remember that banks only want two things: to be able to get their money back, and to earn from that money. So you have to convince them that they can get their money by showing that you have collateral and that you believe in your business enough to put your own money as equity investment

If you're applying for a loan and if it is a big amount, banks and even the SBA may consider other factors aside from your business credit:

- A business plan explaining what the business is

- Your background and experience in the business -- in my experience, this is KEY in the eyes of the bank because they want to make sure that you know what you are doing and that you can make the business work. If you don't have any experience with the business, have someone on board that knows the business to give banks assurance that someone will guide you

- Your credit factors because it shows your dependability and how well you handle credit. They will do a credit check on you and poor credit history may be frowned upon, or even reason for the disapproval of your loan application

- Your collateral. Banks, even SBA guaranteed loans, want the borrower to show collateral. They want to be guaranteed that somewhere somehow they can get payment from you

- Condition or terms of loans. Banks would want to know three important things: "How much money are you requesting? What will it be used for? and For how long will it be needed?" Banks oftentimes prefer to approve loans for items that can be identified, has lasting value, and can be repossessed and sold if things fail.

- Equity investment to show the bank that you have money to put into the business

Some banks extend what they call "small business lines of credit" often through credit cards. Those are easier to get and can be based on your credit history alone. They typically are up to $100,000.

For example, Wachovia's has various business lines of credits http://www.wachovia.com/small_biz/page/0... Their business line of credit can even be approved overnight,

Flit, what you need to do is put your ideas into a business plan, it doesn't have to be too formal, at this stage you are just wanting to know whether it is feasible.  Most banks (true your own first) have a business adviser.  They will be best equipped to give you the answer that you need.  But, initially, sounds like you have almost a niche market, so sounds quite positive.  They will advise you about loans, or whether you require financial backing.  Wishing you guys every success.

Well, it is better than having an unsatisfied judgment against you, but that is not saying much.



It sounds like you just paid it off. You will probably have a very hard time getting approved for a mortgage anytime soon.



You can always dispute it with the credit bureaus and see if it falls off your report entirely, but don't count on that happening.



Also, if you have a stable job and can find the the right person, you might try to find someone to sell you a house on contract if you are persistent. That would get you out of the traditional mortgage territory.

This cannot be considered a complete answer to a highly complicated question, but it might help you.  The people who run 12-step programs for alcoholics, children of toxic parents, etc., also run a program for debtors.  I think that it is called Debtors Anonymous, but I cannot swear to that.  Several friends of mine who have gotten into heavy credit card debt have attended this program.  Since I don't know where you live, I can't guarantee that there is such a program in your area, but my friends came out of the program with a different realization of what they had been doing.

People like you are effectively stealing off people like me. Where do banks get their money from? Savers, in part. We savers would get higher rates without people like you around.

You think you'll get away with it, and in the short term that may be true. However, you'll never be in a position of financial security, and since you'll always be scrabbling for cash, happiness will elude you. What goes around, comes around. :-)

If you can find a bank to lend you 60,000 UNSECURED then you are doing pretty well and someone in the bank has just lost their job for lending that much to you. It's never going to happen.

And if it is secured, or you own a house, say goodbye to your home and your car now becuse bankruptcy means they sell your assetts. They sold my £2 worth - yes that right TWO POUNDS ONLY - of premium bonds so you are in deep do-do if you own anything.

Learn everything about repairing and/or building credit

if the debt is still owed to credit card company, ask for an account rehabilitation with an erase of negative marks. this means when you pay it off they will delete negative marks.

if it is with a collection agency, write a letter and ask for a pay for delete.

third choice, ask for a debt settlement and pay 60-70percent what you owe and then start disputing the negative marks. 8-10 times the negative marks will get deleted.

Pay on time, by direct debit if possible
Don't go overdrawn unauthorised
Don't go over your credit limit on any credit cards you might hold
Don't apply for too many 'credit' accounts if you can avoid it

It only gives you bad credit if you go over your overdraft and cant pay it back, the bank will only send a default notice if it remains unpaid after them making every attempt to make you aware of it and you still don't pay. Using an over draft can actually help your credit rating if used properly, meaning if you use it regularly but always pay it back every month it shows you are a reliable customer. Obviously it is best to only use it in emergencies, like if you have an unexpected payment to make, like a deposit or something. But basically your partner is wrong.

It it's an "authorised" overdraft you're fine - i.e. an amount that you have agreed with the bank, and you don't exceed that.  Although sometimes there is a small charge for using this facility (i.e. 2%) but this does not affect your credit report in the same way as other bank charges - it is more like a bus fare - i.e. a fee that you pay for a service.

If you go over your agreed overdraft limit however, this is where it can start causing problems with your credit rating, and you may incur bank charges.

I have an overdraft of £300 which I use regularly.  It just gets topped back up when I get my wages, and then if I need to use it again, it's always there.  It stops me getting caught out.  They are good things, if used sensibly

well you use the formula ____is___%of___ then fill it in.
So it would be X is 5.5% of 9000. Then you divide like this:

X



5.5
----- = ------- so it would be



-------- =  --------



of



100



9000

Then you cross multiply and you would get



100X= 49,500

1% of 100= 1
x9= 9 also 900
then x10= 90 also the 9000
so 1% of 9000= 90
x5.5 so 90x5.5= what??? how can i not write it or grab the calculator next to me or on the machine i'm using.
so we need 90x5.5 
5x9= 45 plus the zero in 90, so 450 now we still need the .5
half of 90 is 45, add to the 450 and pray 450+45= 495
so assuming my logic is correct 5.5% of 9000 is 495

Banks would normally just get a credit report from Equifax or Trans Union.  They go back 6 years.  Sometimes not everything makes it onto your file though.  Mortgages aren't listed, and up until about the last 5 years student loans weren't listed.  But there is often times other things that are missed too.
If you are worried about something being on your credit bureau you should request a copy from both Equifax and Trans Union.  Both are required to provide you free copies once a year.  You can request them on-line as well but you have to pay for this service instead of sending away for them.
If you have an item on your report that you dispute.  ie someone sent you to Collections when you think they shouldn't have.  Then you can write a short paragraph for Equifax and Trans Union to add to your report.
If you had credit problems in the past due to an illness or something else you couldn't control...then go ahead and tell your bank or finance company.  They will appreciate the honesty and will most often try to work with you to overcome any obstacles this bad history puts in the way.

Negative credit information remains on your report for 7 years and bankruptcy information for 10.  You are entitled to get a free copy of your credit report from each of the big three credt agencies every year.  It's a good idea to get the reports and see what the bank will see.

Swap it over to a credit card with smaller or 0% interest for balance transfers, there might be a limit meaning you cant do all of it, but at least you will get it paid off quicker!! If you go onto http://www.moneysavingexpert.com theres loads of info on there about the best credit cards to get for that!

Yes take out a new card with 0% interest they normally come with 9 to 12 months 0% interest, so then trans fare your existing credit balance to the new one then continue to pay your £70 per month and all of it will come off your balance.
Hope this helps,good luck.

i suggest you talk to the bank wherein you got your credit card..tell them you can no longer afford to pay those interests and ask how you can settle your bills..its your choice to settle your accounts within 12, 18,24,or 36 months..the bank will minus all the interests and other charges for that,just show them your interest in paying them..better do it now before your bill triples...after paying never ever secure another credit card it will only put you down...

I would look to transfer this immediately onto another credit card with a 0% rate on balance transfers for the longest period possible. When you get the card chop it up so that you don't spend on it and just concentrate on getting it paid off as soon as you can. Another tip is don't take the optional repayments cover with the new card as it can be a killer, as long as you have a secure job and are in good health you probably won't ever need it. It is always possible to arrange cover separately at a cheaper price anyway. 
The best card at the moment would be the capital one platinum card which you can only apply for through this website:-

The first thing you should do is cut the card into pieces so you cant use it again because that is a huge amount to owe on a credit card. 
If you can get a bank loan to pay it off would be better than taking out another credit card which would only encourage you to spend more. The reason I say that is you are obviously not good at curbing your spending when you knew you couldn't afford to pay this debt off. 
If none of the suggestions on this site don't suit you should maybe try the Citizens Advice Bureau for more advice.

Welcome car finance - difficulties paying?



I brought a car on finance using welcome car finance in April. I have now got into some difficulties paying the monthly agreement and am being hounded constantly by welcome as ive missed several payments. I then very stupidly sold the car to someone (not knowing i wasn't allowed to do that as its on HP) and informed welcome, i told them that as soon as the money i received as payment for the car is cleared in my bank, i will pay it all to them. They have told me today they want the car back from the person i sold it to, that they are putting an attachment on my earnings and will take me to court for the rest. The money will clear in my account on Monday for the sale of the car but they said i have to pay it today or the car will have to go back to them and the guy i sold it to will have to be refunded his money. If anyone has any helpful advice it will be appreciated. Cant talk to welcome anymore than i have. Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



They wont except a cheque from me, i actually took one in yesterday and put it through the door of the branch that hold my account but the branch account manager rang me this morning and said they wont accept it and are sending it back to me.



I cant get hold of the guy i sold the car to, he is now aware that there are problems though. Welcome also saying they are reporting car as stolen.  Can they do this? Ive given them name and address of buyer.



Cheers you guys for taking the time to give me advice. Update, managed to borrow £500 today and paid them that, they've given me until Monday to pay the rest so hopefully its sorted now! Thanks again for your advice

to be honest your are in breech of the terms of your loan and unfortunately not knowing is not a defence.  They are within their rights in saying that they want the car back as it belongs to them.

Will what clears on Monday pay off the entire loan?  If so stall them until Monday by not telling them who you sold the car to.

If it doesn't (which unfortunately is probably the case with 2nd hand cars) I dont think that you have much choice other than to make a difficult phone call to the person you sold the car to, refund his money and turn it in.  He should really have done a HPI check to prevent that from happening anyway.

Final option is get a another loan from another company to pay Welcome off - however you may find that difficult as you have missed payments to Welcome which will not have done you any favours.

I am guessing that you are young and the salesperson used that in closing his sale.  I think on this one you really are gonna have to chalk it up to experience, get the car back, surrender it and pay the difference.  It sucks I know

You will learn from this and you will be more careful when getting a credit agreement in future.  Not all fiance companies operate like this one and maybe you need to shop around.

One final point I would never execpt a cheque on a car I would insist on a bankers draft - I hope it doesnt bounce or you really are in the sh1t



Edit Jesus my man they really are taking the hardline with you.....  Yes they can report the car as stolen as they own it until you pay the last payment - you need to get in touch with the guy.  I would have though the fact that you are still talking to them is a sign that you want to help - they now need to help back.

Tricky one this - the finance company legally own the car so they are entitled to it back from the person you sold it to, it wasn't yours to sell! What if the cheque from the "buyer" doesn't clear or bounces - if you write a post dated cheque that will bounce as well. Best option is ask your buyer to stop their cheque, get back the car and give it back as per the HP agreement. That way you'll avoid the court action etc. Good luck.

Whats the point in a prepaid credit card?



We have atrocious credit and can't get even the "poor credit" credit cards like Vanquis etc, so I've pretty much given up trying

I have read about "pre-paid" credit cards on which you put your own money in an account and then use the card to spend it.

But why?  Whats the point in buying a piece of plastic with which to spend your own money?  Whats the difference between that an using an ordinary debit card from your bank?



</question>



<additional details>



Hmmm - thanks for the judgement but I have never "lived beyond my means".  Like many people in the world today I was a victim of what the future would bring - ie a prosperous, dual income houshold reduced to living on the wages of one part-time earner  because of illness, job loss and a pretty bad run of luck.  Is that so hard to understand  When I had a credit card I used it prudently, yet when bad luck hit I had to choose between eating/staying warm or paying off the balance on my credit card and guess which one I went for?!  Crazy eh?  That someone puts their personal survival before their credit rating . . .

The point is it is an easy way to keep your finances in check, you can only spend your own money thus avoiding further debt. It is also an easier way to carry your money around. Then again if you do not have much money, there is no point in having the card.

If you use it online, then you can limit the damages if the card number ends up in the wrong hands.  The bad guys can't take more than the amount on the card, unlike on a regular card where they would be able to take you for the card's credit liimt.

1. It helps you re-build your credit, no, you cannot spend more than you have in the account.
2.  It keeps you from carrying cash, and if the card is lost or stolen, you can stop payments from being deducted.
3.  It allows you to purchase items, such as online products, without having to send a money order or cash.

As a few people have mentioned you put money on them and cannot spend more than that, much like a mobile phone top up card really.
Using the word "credit" is slightly misleading.
The advantages are that they can be used to spend on certain things such as bills, shopping, online transactions.
They may also have greater security than debit cards (in the UK) e.g. like a credit card where the bank guarantees any money you've spent if the person you've bought it off goes bust etc. (this is only up to a certain amount and is for consumers only) However you might want to check this out since it could mean they're a good middle ground between debit and credit cards?



Oh also most of the cards charge a fee to have the card and sometimes to withdraw money on it.

they could be quite good, check out this website VVV

it's for those that don't want to tie them selves up with debt, but still would like the advantages of using visa or mastercard.

i use mine for shopping on websites that do not accept paypal or debit cards and for ordering from other countries as these forms are known world wide.  it can also be used abroad, so you can top it up with spending money before you go.

maybe you should take a look at why you have such a poor credit rating and consider not living beyond your means more than is necessary - a hard task in today's world - but it can be done.

What shop's it for?  Some shops let you pay it off at a till in store but you might need the statement because I'm assuming you'll still only have a temporary card?  Just wait until the statement comes in, pay it and then chop up the card, it's no big deal.

I believe you're legally entitled to a one week "cooling off" period.  That doesn't mean go beserk for a week and then tell them you're no paying.  You have to settle the balance or return the goods in resaleable condition.



If you've got no annual charges attached to the card just pay the balance and cut it up.  They'll send you a statement confirming your payment but they won't send any other mail unless there's been transactions.

When applying for the card you should of been given a credit agreement, which will likely have a contact number on. If you phone the company up you should be able to make a payment over the phone and then cancel the card.

Otherwise you could wait until the first statement comes through. As long as you pay it off in full before the due date you wont be charged any interest. Then contact them to cancel the card.

Some card companies can be pushy about you keeping the card and will tell you about discount etc you may get, but be firm and insist you want to cancel the card.

When will the credit crunch end?



I know its like asking how long is a piece of string, but i mean what are the signs of it ending soon?, and if there were any previous credit crunches, how long did they take to end?

Thank you

I think the credit crunch will be a part of the financial system from now onwards. From the lessons learnt from the fall outs of the sub prime mortgage crisis. It might be infused as a obstacle of the risk management programme or policy of the banking industry. I hope I am not wrong to say that this type of risk management is a means to an end but it is not an end in itself.

Your guess is as good as anyone`s.



The world is changing fast and there is no certainty of anything anymore.



But if it does ever get back to how it was, not within 2 years is my guess.
Everything is linked these days  - with the emerging economies of India and China, and soon Russia  - who knows where the world is heading?
Since Britain`s Empire sank slowly in the west, it has never stopped shrinking.  Gawd knows where we are heading.

This is the first time that this situation has ever occurred.  The good thing is that we have not enter a recession yet.  I think that it will turn around once banks stop having massive write offs.  It will probably be next year or later until things improve.

it depends on other factors, like your income.  also, how bad is "bad"?  if you shop around enough, you might find someone to grant you the loan, but your interest rate will be sky high.  if that's the case, don't do it.  you're better off getting your financial house in order and then reapplying in two years.

These days, it is almost impossible to stay out of debt; outside pressures from family or work can sometimes be the cause. All is not lost if you have acquired a bad credit score; there are many online bad credit loan lenders to help. Money provided to a person experiencing financial hardship is no different to any other type of loan and can be used by the applicant in the same way. A poor credit history can be from something as simple as accidentally missing a loan or credit card repayment to something more serious which may or may not have been done on purpose. Arranging a loan this way could actually help your credit rating.

http://www.worldbestloans.com/

There are other reasons bad credit loans may be required such as for domestic emergencies, unforeseen circumstances or for consolidating previous debts. It is not uncommon for a person to arrange a loan just so they can repair their damaged credit history. They may not require the money for any specific situation.There are two options available, secured and unsecured loans, but with the secured option the amount of loan will be greater, up to 150,000 dollars and the repayment period can be extended to a period of twenty five years. However, if you take the unsecured loan route the maximum you will be able to lend will be dramatically reduced to 50,000 dollars and you will only have 10 years to pay it back.

As already people have said that there interest rates are very high, I think you should go for another one. nowadays there are many companies which provide loans even if you have a bad credit. So first research completely for a suitable one. What kind of bad credit are you having?
Ask4loan provides a bad credit loan in following conditions:
Discharged Bankrupts
County court judgments (CCJ)
Arrears and Defaults



So if your condition matches to them you can apply with them. Here is the web address:

You don't need to!

Although years ago bad credit history was linked to an address, and a person with bad credit living there could affect everyone else at the same address, it was stopped a couple of years ago as its was so unfair.

Now debts are only linked to a person, not to an address, and the debts move with the person. Anyone living at an address does not affect anyone else there, unless they are tied in some way like husband and wife.

Unfortunately, this means that there is something wrong with your credit. It may be that you simply haven't had much credit before, so you are an unknown quantity, or there is a mistake on your credit file, or something on there you didn't know about.

I would get copies of your credit file from both credit agencies, experian and equifax, to make sure the info on there is correct. If its not you can write to them and get it amended.

YES, you still have to pay the fee. It's called a "Monthly Fee", not a "Monthly If You Use the Card and Free If You Don't" Fee.

Click on "Terms and Conditions" here to see for yourself:

Or just read the literature that you got when you got the card.

It shouldn't affect your credit rating unless you try to do something jointly, i.e. get a mortgage.

I recommend paying for an Experian Credit Check Report for each of you. You get you credit score and a history of your credit attempts regardless of whether you succeeded or not.

Here's the way it works: when you open a new account at the bank, they will pull your credit. They're required to do it because of the Patriot Act. Specifically, you'll find their authority in the anti-money-laundering provision of the Act.



That said, not every bank will do a HARD inquiry (which dings your FICO score by about 5 points or so). Some banks will do a soft pull. Washington Mutual, for example, will do a SOFT pull. Bank of America does a HARD pull. You'll have to do some homework to figure out who is doing soft inquiries and who is doing hard inquiries.

Still, every bank is now pulling credit reports these days. Some will impact your score (a hard inquiry) and some will not (soft).

Credit scores are a matter of cash back access, they are not usually mandatory but most applicants don't question this.

You can apply for a regular savings account but in the absence of a credit check they will "hold all" on any non-cash deposits. So if you had a $500 cheque they will likely hold it for 5-10 business days instead of cashing it directly.

All banks will do a credit check. What it says decides the level of account they will offer you.

If you live in the UK, I would look at Lloyd's bank. The basic bank account comes with a Visa debit card so you can shop online, get cash back and even get home if you had paid for a holiday with it with XL Airlines ( unlike some other poor sods).

Not totally safe...
PayPal don't check fraudulent Credit Card use when the transaction is made. (unlike any regular business)

I got ripped off over $200 on eBay on an overseas transaction. 
Sold item on eBay.
It was paid for via PayPal. eBay told me it was paid for & safe to send.
3 days after the funds were cleared & I'd posted the item off I received an email from PayPal telling me the funds had been reversed due to fraudulent credit card use.

Wasted days sending PayPal emails about the situation but never got my money back.
(& from the 'form responses' I received from them it was obvious they hadn't even bothered to read my emails - it took 10 emails to finally have someone respond properly, but they pretty much said it was all my problem anyway.)

I still use them for eBay sales, but both eBay & PayPal suck big-time in my opinion...

"No Care, No Responsibility" seems to be the motto of both those organisations.

Pay-pal is very safe, you may receive an email (spoof) telling you that your account has ben hacked and that you need to click on a link to upgrade your account, BUT, the new email is an attempt to get your details, just forward the email (with headers) to spoof@pay-pal.com and they can trace the hacker. I have  used pay-pal for years now, to pay accounts and receive money from EBay sales, and have never had any money go missing, their rates are excellent, and it is the easiest and safest way to pay for items in EBay.

In general paypal is safe, and quick, but not as good as they would like us to believe.  I pursued one item not received, and after ages the dispute was settled in my favour, and the money would be refunded to my credit card.  Except it never got there.  And by the time I had a couple of credit card statements with no credit showing, they told me the matter was closed.  I still use paypal.  All the other sellers have been OK. I have only come across one that was untrustworthy.

You will have to go bankrupt, if you have anything of any value they will force you to sell to pay up.  That's how loans work, you borrow the money then pay it back with interest, that's the deal.

the judgement is the end result, not the beginning.  you must be notified of the court date/time and given a chance to defend yourself.  if you do not show up, than you lose automatically and a judgement is filed.  a notice of this judgement is sent to you certified.  this usually hits your credit report 30-45 days after the judgment.  so to answer your question, the judgement is the consent to attach.

i hope you mean credit card judgment.

They don't put a judgment on your credit report, judgments are public record. They appear on there on there own as the credit bureaus scan public records for lawsuits, tax liens, and bankruptcies.

If they didnt know where you are, what most likely happened is they sued you and received a default judgment because you never showed up to court....because you never knew about it. This happens alot, ALOT, and there is little you can do after the fact. If they do have a judgment and you were not served properly, you will have to file for a motion to vacate the judgment, which can be very annoying.



..County Court Judgement? A judgement is a judgement, the same circumstances, and rules apply.

There is a statute of limitations for credit card debt, which is the amount of time that they can take legal action against you for the debt. This time period varies for each state. You can find this time period for your state by going to the link below and looking under "Open Account."  If your debt is older than the time period listed for your state, they can no longer take legal action against you. This does not mean that they can't try to collect the debt...it just means that they've lost the power to take legal action....all they can do after this point is annoy you...

Credit card companies cannot assess judgments against you by themselves...they have no such power...only a court can do this. Your credit card company would have to serve you papers...and then on the court date they would have to win a judgement....only then could a judgement be assessed.



Hiding from your creditors will ultimately hurt you...If they serve you a summons and you aren't there to get it...you'll be a "no show" in court....Not showing up in court means default/automatic judgment for them.

Not really sure what you are asking, but here goes.

Before the court grants a judgment, the creditor must perform a "diligent search" for you.  They must show that they made every attempt to locate you and let you know they were taking you to court.



Many times the creditor will do a poor job of this, or simply lie to the court saying that you were informed.  The judge will grant a default judgment, and you lose your case because you didn't show up to defend yourself.

Once the judge grants the default judgment, it will appear on your credit report as a public record.



Your only hope at this point would be to get your court records, and see exactly how the creditor claims they served you.  If you feel they lied, or did not perform a reasonable search for you, then you can file a motion with the court to vacate the judgment.



Hope this answered your question.

Most people know that they can refinance their house, but fewer know that it's possible to refinance a car loan, too! It's become extremely popular in recent years. And it might seem like a silly idea, since most car loan terms are short--typically three to five years. If you got your car loan when rates were high, you may be able to get a lower rate now. Or perhaps, when you first obtained your car loan your credit was less-than-perfect. If you've managed to improve your credit score over the past year or so, you may now qualify for the lower rate. And a lower interest rate means less cost to you over time. Even dropping your rate by 1-2% can mean significant savings over the life of your loan.

http://best-loans.awardspace.com/refinan...



Many car loan lenders that will refinance your loan don't charge any fees. That means no application fees, no fees for paying off your first loan early, and no other extra charges. So in many cases, refinancing your car loan won't cost you anything at all! And if you refinance for a lower rate, that's like saving money for free. Although most lenders wont charge you any fees to refinance your car loan, it is possible you'll have to pay to have the title of your car changed. So ask about any of these extra costs first to ensure the savings is worth the expense.

There aren't any good answers here that don't involve a 2nd or 3rd job delivering pizzas in that car to eliminate the difference.  A 2001 Cadillac is only worth 8K?  Sell anything you can find on ebay because 19% on 21k is going to to kill you.

Maybe look into micro loans from prosper.com and tell a good story about your situation and what you're doing to get out of it.  No conventional lender is going to refinance because the collateral isn't here with the upside-down status -- it's of course why your rate is so high.

You have a few choices:

1.  Continue to pay and have use of the car.  Assuming you need the car, use it and enjoy it.



2.  Sell the car, and pay the difference with cash from the sale.

3.  Buy another car and trade in this car, which means you are financng more for the car than it will be worth.



4.  Let the car go into reposession

5.  Some insurance pays the amount owed, not the amount of value, if your insurance covers the full value of the debt owed then you can park the car (with the window down a couple inches) in a area known for theft but with a place for you to go and just wait there for the police to fail to prevent the car from being stolen.  Be sure to lock the car.  If it's not stolen just keep going back until it is, and keep your receipts at home if asked.  Be sure that you have a reason to be where you are andto lock it (no keys inside the car).  Try to memorize your licens plate.

You're going to have to make a big payment to bring the loan down to what you'll be able to get on it at refinance.

That's what sucks about Caddy.  Beautiful car, but huge depreciation.  I'm in a very similar boat, but at 5.5% interest I'm not too concerned.

It might really save you some money to just get a car loan price online to check out what the going rates are.  You might be totally suprised.  Also if your credit is not the best, a lot of them are more willing to help people.

I suspect that BOS will still trade under it's own banner as it has done during it's time with Halifax.

Oh no, please don't listen to all these spammers, they are all cons and out to steal your money.

I recently took out a £1,000 loan with Halifax.  Works out that I pay back around £95 per month for 12 months.

I shopped around a bit first and this seemed like the best one for me.  I also declined their offer of insurance which brought my repayments down.  I don't think the insurance is needed on such a small loan. Also, don't accept the offer of next day delivery as they charge £50. My documents came in 2 days by royal mail normal post.  Was a very quick service.

If you are new to the world of loans, then all the jargon and terminology can seem very confusing. There are so many different terms to understand, and unless you know some of them you will not find the best loan deal to suit your needs. If you want to know more, then here is a guide to some of the basic loan terms you might need to know.When you borrow money in the form of a loan, the money you receive is called an advance. The more money you want to borrow, then the bigger your loan advance. It is called an advance because you are getting the money in advance of paying for it.The APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the amount of interest you are charged on your loan amount. This amount is written as a percentage, and refers to the total you are charged each year. APR is one of the primary features for comparison between loans, as it is a standard measurement for all loans.

http://best-loans.awardspace.com/

The lower the APR, then the cheaper the loan interest will be. Credit scoring is a method that lenders use to determine your eligibility for a loan. They ask a series of questions about your earnings and financial situation. Each answer you give is scored, and the better your score then the more likely you are to be accepted for a loan. If you score badly then you might be declined for the loan you want.The loan term is the agreed time over which you will repay the loan. You will repay the loan monthly over this period until the loan and interest is fully paid back. Loan terms on personal loans usually range from about 1 to 10 years, with mortgage loan terms being longer at around 15 to 25 years. The longer the loan term, the less your monthly payments will be, but the more you will have to pay back in interest over the years.

Oh My Life....How many spammers can there be!!!

About your question:: You could either try a bank loan, as these have the lowest interest rates and you get the money fairly quicky.

If however, you can get one of these bank loans due to you having no income, then you should try Black Horse. They have higher interest rates but they often lend to high risk people so your being out of work should not affect your application.



I would also like to point out that the people who have advised you go with Provident are wrong- Provident only lend upto £500 which would not be enough for you. They also have a APR of 183%!!!



Overall your best bet would be to log onto moneysuprmarket.com and compare loans using your information. That way you can find the loan you will not be refused and that suits your needs!

Good Luck

Why have I been so harshly credit scored by Nationwide for their skanky Current Account???



I applied for a Nationwide Current account the other week.

I have a Barclays current account which I have had for around 10 years or so. I have never gone into my overdraft nor have I ever missed a payment or anything.

I have various Direct Debits and two credit cards - one of which is a Capital One Plat - which requires an "excellent" credit score, and I have never missed a payment & pay in full.

Now, call me arrogant, but I am pretty sure a scabby Visa Debit card, a lame £100 overdraft which I will never use anyway, or a few added "extras", hardly requires an excellent credit score?

This is beginning to really annoy me. Credit scores are basically there to f*ck you over of the most simplest of things and I simply do not have the time and cannot be bothered to appeal something as pathetically lame as this.

Why have I been given a current account equivalent to what they'd give a 15 year old child?

It's almost offensive. Is anyone else encountering such pointless difficulties?



</question>



<additional details>



Edit:

Sorry, I forgot to mention. I have been given a nationwide account - but it is their "basic banking" account only...

Which means I get a cash card only, which would be pretty useful if I was 13 or perhaps 73...

If I were you would check your credit report. Although it sounds like you have perfect credit, it may be that a mistake has been made and there is something incorrectly on your credit file. This could be bad credit information intended for someone elses file, that went on yours by mistake.

Alternatively, it could be that you a victim of identity fraud, and someone has applied for credit in your name.

It may be none of these, and just Nationwide playing up, but its well worth checking your file to make sure!

Don't fall into the credit card trap.  If you only pay the minimum each month it will take forever to pay it off, and what ever you bought with it will cost you over and over again.  If it is not an extreme emergency don't use credit.  Save up and pay cash and you will be surprised how much more you will have.

Depends on the interest and how much of the credit limit you've used. Try not to use anymore then half, otherwise the only thing you will be paying at the end of each month will be interest. 20 years on and your still paying the same credit card bill. I have a £400 limit on mine, i've used it all :( was an emergency. And my minimum payment is £10 a month, not a lot but a year on and i've still not paid anything from the actual balance just the interest and PPI.

The answer would vary depending on the APR rate and also what the minimum repayment requested by the company is.

The average credit card has an APR of 17% and a minimum repayment of 2%, min £5. On this scenario you would be required to pay £12.50 in the first month, decreasing slightly as you repaid some each month.

However, if you just repaid the minimum based on the scenario above and a £500 debt it would take you just under 11 years to repay and you would pay £390 in additional interest. Therefore try and make as much of a repayment each month as you can afford. If you paid £20 per month each month, you would repay the debt in 2.5 year and only pay £100 in interest.

Trans Union has had a class action law suit filed against them that entitles almost everyone to get free credit reporting.

It is not widely known and time to "apply" ends this week.

Should they not have been required to advertise this, so everyone can take advantage of it?

Maybe you should spend some time and actually read the information in the source you provided.



If you did, you would see that TransUnion paid $1.08 Million to the Notice Administrator.  This money was to be used to notify and advertise this settlement.  Please put the blame where it belongs.

And yes, the ONLY people making money on this are (in order)

-The lawyers
-The named plaintiffs
-Post Settlement claims over a 2-year period
-Class Members.

To qualify to be a "class member" you simply have to be qualified to have your name listed on a credit report.  If you ever had a loan, credit card, mortgage, or anything similar to that, you qualify.  There will be millions of people involved. So by the time everyone in front of you gets their share of the $75M, there will be less then half.  If you want to wait the 2-3 years for your cash settlement, expect a check for under $10.

But it really doesn't matter...I would like everyone in the country to sign up for this, and take advantage for their 6 months of free credit services.  That's going to totally blow away their computer systems.

Well everyone is already entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the credit bureaus.  You can get your reports online at AnnualCreditReport.com.

I have no idea what the purpose of the class action suit is, but typically the only ones who make any money in a class action suit are the lawyers.  I don't think it's TransUnion's place to advertise a lawsuit against them.  The lawyer should be the ones doing the advertising.

I've never seen a company advertise benefits consumers will receive from a class action lawsuit.  It will usually be carefully hidden in a mailer or sent in a plain looking e-mail that you're likely to delete.  I guess you can't blame them, they are in business to sell their products and not give them away.

As of September 8, 2008, total outstanding consumer debt was $2.59 trillion (revolving and nonrevolving). The Federal Reserve releases its G.19 report each month and that's where you find the information. Revolving debt, typically credit cards, was $969.9 billion as of September 8.



The link for the G.19 report can be found at the end of my post.

i know what you mean. me and my husband both work 16 hours and have 2 kids (1 is 2 and 1 is 9 months) we do get help with working and child tax with the child care element but that just goes straight to paying for the nursery which is like 250 a week for them both. we are struggling to get more hours at work as the company cant afford to increase the hours for the staff wanting it (although i find it hard to believe as i work for a well known petrol station) i get paid monthly and when i get my wage its practically gone what with rent and food and bills. last month i had a baliff on my door threatening to take everything in my house unless i paid nearly 900 quid for a debt that i only owe 300 for but baliff charges were added. i had to give all my wages to them leaving me with like 60 quid to last me until the end of this month. i have had to ask my dad if i can lend money and food is the cheap stuff for me n my husband. i had another baliff on my door yesterday who took my car, which now makes it hard for me to get extra hours as the extra hours are usually goin at a different site which benefited me loads as i would get paid fuel expenses at 40p a mile and i used to travel like 40 miles to get there. plus get paid time n half. time are tough and no matter how hard i work it doesnt seem to do me any favours. as long as i have enough to keep a roof over my head and feed and clean my kids. not much else matters. but yes i am well and truly feeling the credit crunch, especially now the cheap stuff like tesos own has gone up like 100%. it rediculas, if theyre going to put the cost of living up the should put the wages we get up but theyre not and its just wrong. to all those who are feeling the credit crunch, good luck with how you get through it.

Gas prices have shot up, so when I buy £15 of gas I am probably only using about £8.00 - 10.00 of it, same goes for Electric.
The price of food has gone up, ie meats, bread, fruit etc... 
I think the credit crunch will be affecting everybody in some way or other.

It hasn't started to affect me yet, I have to budget my money and have £55 to spend in the supermarket every week so if prices rise  I have to cut back, there is no more money in the pot. There have been some really good offer in the shops so far (and I have a Morrisons, Sainsbury's and an ASDA nearby). My heating bills have just come through and are not as bad as I had expected. I don't have a car so petrol prices don't affect me eiher. My message to everyone is 'Cheer up, it's really not that bad' !

I'm not so worried about the credit crunch, it's the job market that's got me in a bind. I have a bachelor's degree in social science (intended to go into teaching and now can't stand it) but despite that I'm at the cash registers hating every minute of it and can't seem to get my foot in the door of healthcare (want to go into xray or ultrasound) because you need 10 years exp. in everything to get a job with all the layoffs coming in even if the actual qualifications are rather low. So I'm making barely anything, driving to far to get it and still living at home because i have no hope of being able to pay for rent with min. wage.

And to top it all off half of the jobs want bilingual people speaking Spanish so we can cater to all of the immigrants - illegal or not. And while I have learned a decent amount of Spanish, I'm not fluent and I had planned on using my rudimentary Spanish skills to use on church trips to Mexico...not as a job prereq.

There aren't any good answers here that don't involve a 2nd or 3rd job delivering pizzas in that car to eliminate the difference.  A 2001 Cadillac is only worth 8K?  Sell anything you can find on ebay because 19% on 21k is going to to kill you.

Maybe look into micro loans from prosper.com and tell a good story about your situation and what you're doing to get out of it.  No conventional lender is going to refinance because the collateral isn't here with the upside-down status -- it's of course why your rate is so high.

You have a few choices:

1.  Continue to pay and have use of the car.  Assuming you need the car, use it and enjoy it.



2.  Sell the car, and pay the difference with cash from the sale.

3.  Buy another car and trade in this car, which means you are financng more for the car than it will be worth.



4.  Let the car go into reposession

5.  Some insurance pays the amount owed, not the amount of value, if your insurance covers the full value of the debt owed then you can park the car (with the window down a couple inches) in a area known for theft but with a place for you to go and just wait there for the police to fail to prevent the car from being stolen.  Be sure to lock the car.  If it's not stolen just keep going back until it is, and keep your receipts at home if asked.  Be sure that you have a reason to be where you are andto lock it (no keys inside the car).  Try to memorize your licens plate.

Good  morning to every one!!



I am James, a United State resident and a second year student of
university of liver pool. Just a months ago i walked into the hands of some
dubrious person(scams), when i was in search of a loan of $ 55,000  to enable
me fund my education since i lost my parents in a gharsly auto accident while
they were away on vacation. the scamers parted with my $ 1,100, which i
managed to gather from friends and families to enable me takr care of my bills
for lart two months. I decided to tell Betsey.A.Braiaton who communicated the
story to Adrew Fulp who happens to be my Vic president for academic services
and has got link with various notable lending firm accross the globe. By this
means using it to bring a globarlizetion to the world, many student and business
men having finacial problems have been able to complete their education to bring
a globar happiness around the world



My happiness now is that i have not only gotten the loan($
85,000 USD) to pay my tuition them Harvey Loan Inc, piloted by Mr, Patrick
Harvey, i have  also been able to establish a chaned to allow me collect money
at very low competative interest rate. since they have assured me thet i can come for more funds as long i am a
genuine person for requesting it and that there is a possibility of repayment at
the stopulated time.i have never ever seen this kind of wonder in my life and i
decided i will tell it to the whole wild world and i need every one to thank GOD
for Mr Patrick Harvey, the man GOD used  to  rescue me even when all hope had
been lost and gone and i will say to every one, no matter how dark and sinful
the world is today, there are still GOD fearing and reliable people on earth and
if you are in need or require a loan legitimately and Government approve
lenders, i will advice you contact this loan lender and you can reach him via
patrickharvey12@yahoo.com and Thank him on behalf of me.



Thanks.

All banks and building societies will survive the credit crunch. However, some are choosing to merge to put themselves in a stronger position. If in the unlikely event the worse should happen, then the Government would step in, just like they did with Northern Rock.

Turmoil in the financial markets; naturally makes consumers worry about the safety of their savings but unless they have more than £35K with a savings provider then there is no need to fret.



The Financial Services Compensation Scheme, covers 100% of the first £35K, per person, per deposit taking institution. Therefore, if you ensure that you don’t have more than this limit with any one provider, if in the unlikely event the worst should happen, you will get all your money back.



However, savers need to be vigilant as if the institutions are registered under one banking licence, they will only be covered once.



For example Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Birmingham Midshires, Intelligent Finance and SAGA are all covered under the Bank of Scotland banking licence. This means that if you had £35,000 with each of them, should they all have problems repaying your money, you would only receive £35,000 back from the FSCS, not £175,000. However, the Sainsbury Bank brand which is part of the HBOS group has a separate licence.

The situation varies from institution to institution. NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland, Tesco Personal Finance, Ulster Bank and Coutts & Co are all part of the same group, but all have separate licences. Thus, if your money was with each of them, you would receive up to the full £35,000 back from each company.



In order to find out if the institutions where you savings are held are covered separately the best thing to do is to either log on to the FSA’s website and check if the firm is authorised. Alternatively, you could contact the FSA’s consumer website www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk or call their helpline on 0845 606 1234.



If you are planning on opening a new account with an institution, make sure you know which institutions your existing savings are with. Then when you contact the new institution, check with them that they are not part of the same group and covered by the same banking licence.

Hello,

A collection agency sent me a bill on a credit card that is almost 7 years old.  If I ask them to prove that I owe it can they open the case again?  I thought they dropped off after 7 years.  And the amount is wrong, almost 3x's the original. -- Thanks for your help.

Start by going to http://www.carreonandassociates.com/arti... .  This site explains about the Statute of limitations, and credit reporting period.  All of the responses here are a bit confusing, and a couple are outright wrong.



As to our friends with the "just pay the debt...you owe it" nonsense....

When you did not pay your debt the creditor gave you a choice.  Pay your debt or they will trash your credit for the next 7 years.  Well, you didn't pay, and they had this on your credit reports.  Your credit is just now recovering.



You paid your debt.  Why on earth would you want to pay it again?

If this debt is over the SOL, send the creditor a demand to validate letter, and include a demand to "cease and desist" all further communications with you.  That would include phone calls plus letters.  Once they get this letter, they will leave you alone.

Keep an eye on your credit report to make sure they are not trying to re-age this debt.

Although the debt drops off your credit record after seven years of inactivity, you remain liable for the debt and the agency can try to collect.  There is also a Statute of Limitations that limits the time they can go to court and get a judgment.  Each state is different, so I would recommend finding out your state's SoL in case they threaten to sue.

1.  it takes 7.5 years to drop off, not 7.  as the debt is reaching a statute of limitations, that is why they are contacting you now...to get their cash before it reaches that point.

2.  the fact that the amount is 3 times the amount that you owed could be reflective of fees, interests, etc.  this could be perfectly legal.

3.  depending on how much that you owe (and if the debt is legit...you know darned well if it is or not), your best bet might be to settle with them.  they will probably settle off for far less than what they are asking if you negotiate with them.  elsewise, they could sue you for the debt and if you don't show up to the court date...they automatically win.  this judgement can be on your reports 10 years, and could result in wage garnishments, account freeze, and liens.



why have a sword of damacles hanging over your head?  i would get this taken care of and try to settle up.

It is not illegal to attempt debt collections on a debt no matter how old. There are certain statutes on the amount of time they can seek judgement, and the amount of time it can stay on your credit report. Anything after those 2 it becomes a moral issue.

Obviously they cannot say they're going to seek judgement, or report it on your credit report if the debt is too old.

it sounds like the statue of limitations is about to expire and they are going to come after you aggressively to try to get the money now. look and see what the statue of limitations in your state is, it is also possible that the original account holder sold to another company and they are trying to get you to pay past the sol, once the sol date has passed they cannot come after you for that debt, that is the reason for the sol, to give the companies time to collect, they had 7 years.

First of all, check to see if this debt is "time barred" which means it is past your states statute of limitation on seeking legal action against you.  States vary from 3 to 10 years on credit cards.  Use this link to find your states SOL
http://www.bcsalliance.com/statute_of_li...

Asking for a validation does not re-set the state SOL or the reporting period by the CRA's.  The only thing that re-sets the state SOL would be making a payment or acknowleding that you owe the debt.

This debt can not be redated on your credit report as per the following:
Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c] 
As of December 29, 1997 the reporting period runs 7 ½ years (7 years plus 180 days) from the date (month and year) of the last delinquency (known as "last missed payment:). 
So, regardless of how long a creditor waits to charge off, sell or transfer a debt, they must report the true and correct "delinquent or last missed payment" date (month and year) that preceded the creditor's action. The additional 180 day period accords a measure of flexibility to credit bureaus whose furnishers may provide them with the wrong date. However, the expansion of the time period that Section 605 allows chargeoffs and similar actions to be reported accents the desirability of treating the "commencement" of the delinquency as the first missed payment -- not some later date that would further extend the period.

When a debt collector makes contact with you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway. Per federal law they must validate the debt in writing and cease collection activity until they've validated the debt.

Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt stating:

Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting 
- written validation of this alleged debt
- validation of the original "date of delinquency" for this alleged debt.
=========================

There is a statute of limitations for credit card debt, which is the amount of time that they can take legal action against you for the debt. This time period varies for each state. You can find this time period for your state by going to the link below and looking under "Open Account." If your debt is older than the time period listed for your state, they can no longer take legal action against you. This does not mean that they can't try to collect the debt...it just means that they've lost the power to take legal action....all they can do after this point is annoy you...

I say it's good because people were starting to want to withdraw their money from HBOS, fuelled by the media speculation about HBOS's future.



And we know where we saw that happening before...Northern Rock. After the mortgage problems, people panicked and tried to withdraw all their money which worsened the Bank's problems.



If that happened to HBOS, believe me it would be a lot worse than a rival bank coming in with a takeover bid.

how do you not know if you have had county court judgements against you or not?  you would have been notified by mail of the date/time of the court date.  if you did not show up to that, you would have been notified of the court's decision, and appropriate action would be taken.  if you do have CCJs they will show up on your credit reports, and telling them that you live at your parent's home will do nothing.  these reports go back a decade (and judgements can be on there 20+ years) and they will find out the truth.  you are trying to obscure the truth and if i were your loan officer (i used to be one), and i found out about this stuff halfway through the process, i would be furious and what be sending you elsewhere.  from what you have told us, your chances of being accepted for this loan nowadays are very low (depending on how long ago your problems were), and if you do get accepted, your interest rate will be high.  better to work on building your credit.  also, it doesn't sound like you can really afford a home.

There are now mergers, acquisitions and bail outs in the banking and insurance industries. To make them stronger and able to withstand the after shocks of the sub prime mortgage crisis and the mortgage problems. Natural disasters have also cause vast destructions and financial losses and bankrupties in many companies of the world. All these are challenges the world and governments need to address. To come out of these recessionary pressures all must be positive and have the great will power and confidence to succeed.

The credit crunch is an effect. The market in high risk loans is the cause. Due to deregulation certain banks were able to lend (in some cases at &gt;100% of the current value of the property) to customers with poor finances/credit histories. The collateral for these loans was in fact the repossession value of the house. In a housing market 'bubble', this would have worked out fine.
Due to a slow down in house price rises and a significant % of repos, this put more properties up 4 sale, reducing the values of the properties below the amount lent. Worse still, these very companies 'sold on' these loans to other banks and institutions including those in the UK and elsewhere. Banks and Building societies and Insurance companies (esp those who were undercapitalised/insufficient liquidity) suddenly found themselves with almost worthless investments of sub prime debt. To make things even worse predatory speculators 'sold 
short' on these institutions shares causing the shares to fall even further in value. Now despite the US lowering interest rates and 'bailing out' certain banks (the UK will follow suit and has done with Northern Rock), there is a crisis of confidence in lending between banks (some are blacklisted) and credit (the price of lending) is now expensive or unobtainable. As our economy is based on freely available lending to stimulate growth, based on the confidence that our job security will enable us to payback, then a recession if not a depression is 'in the post'!

Welcome Car Finance - whats the catch?



We have atrocious credit (really, really bad) and just on the offchance I filled in an online form for a poor credit car loan (our old Rover has just died and we're not sure what to do as we do need a car to get to work).



I didn't think there was any chance in hell of us being accepted as we literally can't get credit anywhere these days, but just thought I'd try for the hell of it.

Anyway, I've just had a call back from Welcome Car Finance who say that they have accepted us and we can make an appointment to go to their showrooms to take our proofs of income etc along and set up a finance deal for a car.

Whats the catch?



No self-respecting credit provider would touch us with a barge pole!



He said the APR is about 19.9% - I know thats high (compared to more mainstream deals) but honestly, with our history I'm surprised anyone would lend to us at all.

So what are we going to be hit with when we go to the appointment tommorrow - massive deposit?  Huge "Admin Fee"?  I can't beleive it tbh and am very sceptical . . .

"if you can borrow off of a friend or family member you will save a small fortune!"

Lindsay, if this was possible we would already have done it!!



Our friends or family members either don't have any money to give us or have it but aren't willing to lend it.  So its not a possibility I'm afraid, we wouldn't even be looking at dodgy car finance companies if this was an option, we've already tried asking friends and family and got nothing but resounding "sorrys" and "nos".

I just wish we had these wonderfully wealthy and generous family/friends which others seem to have who will happily lend money in times of need.  We don't.

I don't like the idea of "Welcome Car Finance" but, like a lot of their other customers, I suspect, we don't have much choice.  They probably prey on people like us without good credit histories or rich, generous "friends and family". . .

It's just really high APR. You need to find out how long the loan will be for. If he said it's about 19.9% he could mean that it starts at that rate but if you want the loan for a longer period it could be higher.

Go along to the appointment and find out all the details - you don't have to go ahead if your worried. Also don't forget that by law they have to give you a 14 day cooling off period so if you did take it out and then changed your mind you can cancel within 14 days.

I work for a company similar to welcome and I can assure you the person you spoke to said their rates START from 19.9% honestly you will be faced with between 40-50% not sure about their fees, but they have more collections staff than sales staff these days so if you take it and miss a payment expect to be harrassed morning, noon and night.
The finance market is horrendous these days, no company will give you a good deal at the moment, if you can borrow off of a friend or family member you will save a small fortune!

Well basically they will try to sell you a car on tick that's makes them dosh and if you fall behind with your repayment's which seems that it is possible with your poor credit they will take your car of you. Then you will be back to Square one with no car and a load of debt!!



Take my advice think seriously before you commit to anything and make sure you can definitely afford to maintain payments on the car as well as fully comp insurance which is a must and you also have to ensure it is serviced properly to.

Not trying to put you of but i have been there, duped into buying something that i could not afford and paid the price quite literally so be careful.

In any case i wish you all the best : 0

There are so many pitfalls out there these days one of which I shall attend right now,
I purchased a suite of Leather furniture for £1600.00  at a well known store only to find out that they wanted £69.00 for delivery... even for cash.
So I decided to take up their interest free loan for one year and bank my cash... to gain the interest to cover my delivery cost...great eh! you'd think so... but...as time of payment drew near I found myself uneasy and looked at my loan forms in  detail under a hard light.... they wanted the money FIVE CLEAR DAYS BEFORE the... DUE DATE...so they could process my cheque... they were also chargeing £29.00 in fees and that was it ..or so I believed....still uneasy I checked out their website to see if I could pay online with a DEBIT card... yes of course I could but there was a service charge of 4% of the loan if I did it this way....why? oh why? was it going to cost me £64.00 in fees for what is a DEBIT TRANSACTION similar to cash? 
I might as well have payed in cash in the very beginnig in the store.
However... not to be beaten I obtained a cost-free bankers draft and posted it at the post office.... REGISTERED POST ...£4.60... and SIGNED FOR... I paid this just so my letter didn't get conveniently mislaid until after the PRIOR... due date... which would therebye load me with interest charges going back in time to the day of signing up... almost a year before...plus interest on the £29.00 fees..their greed is immense
Even then, it was a hard job for the post office to find the name of the lender on the computers list at the Belfast address as stated on the form, as it was on a sixth floor and shared the post code with a ship load of other firms therein...only for a knowegeable local postie who could sort it out from all the other people at that post coded address...it might never have reached the destination in time even though I'd eventually posted 17 days early.
A few days later they acknowledged reciept only on the grounds that the bankers draft would clear?... cheeky sods....
They make payment as difficult as they can for the debts to be squared... just working within the bounds of the law...hoping to entrap us all in never ending debt.
So the morals here?
Know who you are borrowing from.
Know where they operate from preferably in the country that you live and under it's laws.
check out the unclear... PRIOR... DUE DATE  (allow plenty of time for clearance of CHEQUES,DRAFTS or PAYMENTS)
Pay in person if possible and get a bona fide receipt of payment each time you make any payment.
If personal payment presence is not an option, then pay early and get a signed delivery postal RECIEPT.
DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES... MISS... A tricky PRIOR...  DUE DATE... OR YOU WILL RUE THE DAY.
Good luck...you have been warned!!

They pay off the balance each month, which is really no different than pre-paying it one month in advance.

The prepaid cards were brought out for the conscious shopper who didn't want to use there credit card online in case of fraud. So they brought out the prepaid card, you set the amount and then you can shop online without the risk of running up a £10,000 credit card bill when someone stole your details. They were also aimed for the younger shopper, those who can't get credit cards but need one to shop on places like Ebay or Play.

They are solvent but the share price was being forced down by speculation.

If they go bust everyone's savings are guaranteed up to about £35,000.  You would still have to pay off your credit card in full as receivers would collect all amounts due so as to pay as many creditors as possible.

It shouldn't happen now as the share price is recovering

Do NOT believe the rumours of imminent bankruptcy. The shares are being manipulated by hedge funds and others, but the bank's assets themselves are not in any danger, yet. If people start to believe in the rumours and there's a run on the bank, then it will be a self-fulfilling thing. Anyway, the first £35,000 is protected by the deposit guarantee scheme.

There is absolutely no truth in it. However like some others have said scaremongering causes people to remove there money and then it becomes a self forfilling proficy. It is also not true that Halifax are Merging with Llyods TSB, i dont know where that has come from but it is not true.

Hello again. In the UK the banking system is very sound, the Halifax is vulnerable to some fluctuations in instability but not at risk to sub prime mortgage lending as they are the biggest company in this line of business. Your credit card is most likely issued by a separate company within a company,so yes in the most unlikely event of another catastrophe you would be liable i think.You would have to look at the terms you undertook with the Co., on issue.

Money is a commodity like iron, wheat, oil or whatever, prices go up and down throughout the day and night just like all commodities, If people in fear run to their banks and the bank runs short of cash then that bank will have to got to the bigger lenders for more cover... these mega lenders know there is a rush on so the price rises to fit ...so ... the moral here is don't panic you only feed the greedy...and  AT THE MOMENT if anything goes belly up then the greedy get their money from us anyway via government backups.... because you are paying the stupid taxes that these props are made from... in the meantime... the greedy are causing more rumour rushes causing a lowering of share prices at the banks and they get even richer buying SHARES (What they are really after) at the deflated lower prices, they cannot lose as long as the governments prop up the banks.(Which they must for fear of collapse)

So... TO SAVE ON TAX INCREASES 
Don't fall for rumours 
Don't allow people to spook you.
remain steadfast 
You certainly can't win when there is running on a bank ...
Where would you get your paycheck when all the banks go down? stay put and the greedy WILL lose out.. OR... try their luck somewhere else.
Make sure that your bank has good management procedures if you are not sure don't worry the tax payer is in place to settle the bill.

How to cancel charge on debit card? ?



I recently placed an order online with my debit card but decided I don't want the product. I don't know if it's been shipped yet but I really just want my money bank because I've read reviews of the site and their products are supposed to be terrible AND they aren't very good with giving refunds. Can I just go over their heads and call my bank and ask for them to put a stop on the payment? I see on my online statement that the payment has already gone through but I haven't gotten a tracking number yet, meaning it hasn't shipped yet.

Just try to return the item for a refund when you get it.



You can't stop payment on a debit card purchase; it is immediately withdrawn from your checking account.  That's one reason why it's best to do online shopping with a credit card as opposed to a debit card.

Not having a tracking number does not mean that the item hasn't shipped.  Maybe they didn't use delivery confirmation or maybe it's not their policy to give tracking numbers.

As for getting your money back, the only way the bank will be willing to refund it is if the card was used fraudulently by someone other than an authorized user.  Just return the item and request a refund from the company.  Next time do better research BEFORE you make a purchase to be sure that you're dealing with a reputable company that sells good products.

Write your return address in the upper left corner.  Write the recipient's address in the center of the envelope.  Write both address on the return receipt.  Your address will be on the back under sender's address, the recipient's address will be on the front.  Seal your envelope and stick the return receipt to the back of the envelope.  The certified sticker goes on the front top.  There is a certified tracking number that can be pealed off and placed on the return receipt.  The top of the sticker will fold over the top of the envelope so that you can see the green part of the certified sticker from the back.  Write the recipient's address on the receipt portion of the certified sticker.  The post office will stamp this and give it back to you as your receipt.  You'll have to go inside the post office to pay for the postage, a regular stamp won't be enough.

If you are still unsure, just take everything to the post office and ask the clerk to help you.

What is the minimum payment you can make to a credit agency?



If, for instance, I owed £10000 to a debt collection agency due to an ex boyfriend racking up debt in my name, what is the minimum weekly payment I can offer. I only earn £100 P/W and this has to pay for everything, including rent and fuel for my car, etc. I want to clear this debt before it goes any further but I cant afford it. Would I be able to offer a few pounds per week, and has the company got the right to refuse this and demand payment in full.

Thanks in Advance!



</question>



<additional details>



This is not a credit agency as in a credir card company, but an actual debt collection agency. At the moment I am paying nothing at all, which means if I only paid 2.50 a week, its more than they are getting now. What I dont know, is will the agency follow the same school of thought as me.

Debt collection agencies can be tricky to deal with so do get some free advice and don't forget you have rights. There is a lot of help on debt management on this website:

http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/

There's a budget planner which will help you work out the payments that you can afford, plus sample letters that you can send to your creditor to explain your situation and offer them payments. You can set up a Debt Management Plan yourself, or even get one of the free debt charities to help you. You could try PayPlan or CCCS which will not charge you - you can call them for free. They offer advice and guidance in a very non-judgemental way. You could end up paying as little as £1 per month if that's all you can afford at the moment. Don't, whatever you do, go for one of the fee-charging debt management companies.
There's loads more advice on the Money Saving Expert website. I've listed them all below.
Good luck.

Forget trying to negotiate with the debt collectors, you need to get advice from the CCCS (The CAB are useless) who will give you a standard letter to send to your creditors offering then a token payment of whatever you can afford (ie £2.50 a month or £1 a week or whatever).

I'm in a similar position and paying my creditors £1 a month right now.  Its better than nothing.  You won't be able to clear the balance and your credit rating will be stuffed but theres not much else you can do really . . .

As far as the Debt Collectors "demanding payment in full" they can demand all they want, if you haven't got it they can't have it!!!  Unless the debt is secured on your property theres not much they can do - even if they took you to court, the judge would look at your income and grant a very small amount (I have a CCJ for £2 a month).  they can demand all they like but they can't get blood out of a stone.  Even if they send "doorstep collectors" to your house, these people can do f*ck all other than knock your door and say "give us the money".  They can't repossess your stuff or anything, they don't have the legal right under law (only bailiffs can do that, usually after a broken Court Order).  They will harrass and threaten but its all empty threats and they know it.



Unless you have massive amounts of savings or a rich uncle or something, in that case, save yourself the hassle and pay it off.

Pay them from highest interest to lowest interest rate.  Do not use them again until they are paid.  On all cards except teh one with the highest interest rate, make minimum payments (this will cover interest plus a little principal).  On the one with the highest rate, pay as much as you can each month until paid off.  Then switch the big payments to the next card, and so on until everything is cleared.



By taking care of the highest interest cards first, you will minimize interest paid and pay off everything that much quicker.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



All major "gas brands" like Shell, 76, Arco, etc. offer gas cards.
Ask yourself which gas station do you use the most?
No use getting a Shell card when you usually prefer to get your gas at a 76 station because you can only use the card for the specified "brand". If you get a shell card then you can only use it at shell.



All of them offer "perks" that can go from getting a reduced price for gas (after you get the bill not at the pump) to free towing services, etc.
Best thing to do is to go to each brand gas station and ask the clerk for a credit card application. Then take them all home and read each of them careful. Only choose the one you like the best and that fits into your life style. Besides getting gas you can also use the card to buy stuff inside the gas station. So if you usually go inside to buy a snack or a cup of coffee at your local gas station then I would choose one of their cards...



They are in the same category as store credit cards like JCPenny and Macys... they will count towards your credit score but you are limited on where you can use this card and their interest rates are usually higher because they offer the card to low credit and new credit customers.

First of all, read the letter carefully.  The chances are your late payment has been referred to a debt collection agency and they are trying to lean on you. The person who knocks on the door is not acting as a bailiff, just as a persuader.



If you have paid the debt, contact the people you have paid and ask them to call the dogs off.  If you still owe money and you can pay it all, send a cheque to the collection agency.  If you need time to pay, make them a written offer (like £5 a week) and tell them that you want all contact to be in writing.



If you don't pay your debts, they can take you to the County Court.  If you don't put in a defence, you'll get a CCJ.  If you ignore that, they can get a distress warrant and ONLY THEN do they send round the bailiffs to take away your furniture.

I went to a strip club 2.5 weeks ago. I used my AMEX credit card for a cash advance of $110. They swiped the card, I signed the slip, and they wrote down my Driver License # on the slip, Why? Am I going to have someone knocking on my door because of their error? Why wouldn't the charge show up on my statement? I have been checking almost every day.

Creidit Card and Debit Card?



I recently made a phone payment online w/ my debit card. But today I checked my online checking account statement and I don't see the withdrawal. I checked my email and my phone company send a payment confirmation of the amount payed. However, it says it was payed w/ a credit card, and I don't have a credit card. You think the transaction went through?



How could it be payed and not shown in my account summary?



btw, I can't call b/c my dad bought me this phone, so it's under his name but since the bill came so high I was to pay for this time. And I can't tell him it came up high cause I'll get in trouble.

Yes, call the hotline number for the card (it's listed on the back of the card, but since you don't have it, look up the number online on the card's website).  Then after you call, follow the instructions on the voicemessage you hear, enter the sixteen digit code, all that good stuff, and it will tell you the balance.  I'm sure you can still use the card as long as you have the 16 digit code and the pin, but it might depend on the card company and the store at which you use it.  Call the hotline and ask them this.  They will also tell you when the card expires.



Hope this helps and good luck!

I made an online payment using fifth third online banking, they claim it takes up to five business days?



but the operator told me it would definitely take five business days, it is the fifth business day and the money still has not posted.  Is this a common problem with fifth third bank? Also does anyone know when the money will post or has experienced this issue before? I am considering closing my account. They are telling me to wait until tomorrow and give them a call.

Are you paying a 5th/3rd account using the online service?  Or are you using the 5th/3rd online billpay on your bank account to pay another bill?



If it's the billpay, it is common for some payments to take 5 or more days. These are the ones that have to have a check mailed.  Usually electronic bill payments take 2 or 3 days.



If you are paying a 5th/3rd account using their online service, this does not sound right at all. Typicall, companies draft your bank account and the transaction takes 2 or 3 days max.

A debit card is a card that you use for purchases, but the merchants would deduct that amount from your checking account. There are no interest rates involved in a debit card.



A credit card is used the same way as a debit card, but you will receive a bill in the next month of purchases. Some people can only pay the minimum due, while others can pay more then the minimum. All your purchases are charged a certain percentage rate.



So, my advice is just get one credit card for emergency purposes.

When you use a debit card the money to pay for your purchase is taken from your personal bank account. When you use a credit card the money is taken for the bank account of the bank that issued the credit card to you with the belief that you will pay them back. Also, there is a grace period to pay the money back to the bank before they start adding finance charges.

Credit card—You can use a credit card to buy things and pay for
them over time. But remember, buying with credit is a loan—you have
to pay the money back. What’s more, if the credit card company
sends you a check, it’s not a gift. It’s a loan you have to pay back. In
addition to the cost of what you bought, you will owe a percentage
of what you spent (interest) and sometimes an annual fee.
Charge card—If you use a charge card, you must pay your balance in
full when you get your regular statement.
Debit card—This card allows you to access the money in your checking or savings account electronically to make purchases

Mysterious collection on file...no record of me...?



i posted a question yesterday about a company that i ended up finding contact information on from equifax later... i called the company, gave name, account they have, account number they have for me, and they have no record on me what so ever.
The dept that equifax says this is, is an old telus account that has been paid off in full, and was never for the amoun that is stated on my credit file. I never have dealt with this company either that is on my file, and they say, they dont know who i am.



How would their name and an amount get posted on my equifax with that large total owing, and it still says outstanding and active? Can this get removed totally from my file?



</question>



<additional details>



i contacted the agency, and they told me they can not delete the file since they have no record of the file. I just faxed all information to equifax to dispute the claim, so i guess its a waiting game. i do not know if this company is with transunion, or experian... so i will have to find that out.

I would suggest disputing this collection record with Equifax, Experian, and Transunion.



Each credit agency will contact the company which added the record.  The company will have 30 days to respond.  If they do not respond, the record will be deleted.



And, if the company has no record of you on file, they will notify the credit agencies and they should delete the record.

payments get higher because interests each month are compounded.  this is if you don't pay the entire amount or an amount significantly bigger than the minimum required payment.



the bank/creditor could run after you because of non-payment.  best call them up, let them know about your current situation and negotiate a payment scheme you can afford.  you've shown them that you're willing to pay and that should be a plus on your side.



if you do find a means to pay your bills regularly, try to find a low-interest credit card company and see if you can transfer your balance there.  that way, you can take advantage of lower rates so you can get rid of that debt.  good luck!

How are you making any payments if you don't work?



Why not just get a job and start paying off your bills?



As to what will happen -- your credit will be ruined, so that you won't be able to buy anything else for years, and the credit card company *could* pursue legal action against you. If you simply give up making payments, that's exactly what they should do.

Does one "30 days past due" item on credit report impact credit score?



Out of 30 accounts in good standing, one (a Amazon.com Visa card) reported one missed payment of $120 in 2005. All accounts including this one have  a zero balance.



The thing will go off my credit report in 2012 (7 years after the payment was supposedly missed). Is it worth it to try and get if off now of my credit score unaffected by such a minor problem?

It's already 3 years old, so if it is the only late payment you have made, you are fine.  It probably doesn't even affect your score anymore; if it does, it's only a few points anyway.



Just don't make any more late payments, and you will be fine.  Plus, you can't get it removed, if you were legitimately late.

If you have 30 trade lines that are all positive and you have one that is showing negative for 120.00 3 years ago, I would not even really bother with it if your goal is to increase your score.  The majority of what would have affected your score has already passed and really will not be a major decisive factor in future credit transaction.

Ask yourself whether you would be more confident of being  paid by someone who has kept all due debts paid with none going 30 days overdue,or someone who sometimes can not make debt payments for 40 or 60 days, and perhaps neglects to pay bills to 90 days if nobody bothers them.



You would have a much simpler life with someone who always pays every debt before due date. You would expect to lose less money when debtors skip out if they are paid up at least every 30 days. If a debtor then keeps debts due paid, you as a lender would prefer that debtor, You would be willing to offer lower interest rates.



Same for other creditors.  Small, even trivial problems can add up to a general habit.

Anytime you are late on a payment of any kind it goes against your record.  Not drastically but many of those would add up.  So if it's just one pay it off right away.



It won't affect you in any serious ways.
