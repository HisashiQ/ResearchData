I tried them once,the best way is to get fresh



Anaheim chili's and scorch them and peel, for me that was an all day task.Slit the chili and place a piece of jack cheese inside dip in egg batter and fry. They turned out greasy and I made a big mess. There are many good recipes for a casserole using the same ingredients.

CHILIES RELLENOS



6 Anaheim or any mild long green chili
2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 lb mozzarella cheese, grated
1/4 lb Monterey Jack cheese, grated
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tb chopped fresh cilantro or parsley
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 egg
2 T milk
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 cup mild or hot tomato salsa

Make a slit with the tip of a paring knife in the pepper at the cap.
Place the oil in a deep saucepan and heat to a temperature of 375F.

Have a bowl of ice water handy.

Fry the peppers a few at a time for about 1 minute, or until the skin is blistered all over. Remove with tongs, and plunge into the ice water.

Repeat until all peppers are fried.

When cool enough to handle, gently rub off the skin.

Cut a slit in one side of the pepper, and remove the seeds, keeping the pepper whole. Set aside, reserving the oil.

In a bowl, mix together the mozzarella, Monterey Jack, garlic, thyme, oregano, cilantro, salt and pepper.

Gently stuff the mixture into the peppers, securing them with toothpicks.

Chill for 30 minutes.

Beat the egg with the milk.

Roll the peppers in the mixture, and then roll in cornmeal.

Heat the reserved oil to 375F.

Fry the peppers for about 3 minutes, or until golden brown.

As you fry, be careful not to crowd the pan. Remove the peppers from the pan with tongs, drain on paper towels, and repeat until all peppers are fried.

Serve immediately, accompanied by salsa, if desired.

Serves 6.

Note: The peppers can be prepared up to the point of being dredged in cornmeal and fried up to two days in advance and refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap.

The fruit you are referring to the lychee.  It is native to China, and grows throughout South and Southeast Asia.  There are many fruits related to it like rambutans and longans.  I believe the green kind you may be referring to is the mamoncillo.  This fruit grows throughout Central America and the Carribbean.

i would never eat that stuff, not even a little, the smell alone makes me sick as if i have eaten arsenic! it should be internationally banned. the people above me cook some and my whole house reeks of it for the rest of day and i have to call in sick to work the next day and call the cops on them

The one that gets me is Durian, and Asian fruit.  Smell like raw sewage and there are sign on public transport and in hotels in Asia baning it's presence.

Yet people eat it and love it.

i also find many cheeses, especially freeze-dried Parmesan, to be disgusting.  The Parmesan qualifies as the most anti-social condiment around, in my book.

I am not sure what the regulations are regarding food odours in tenements and so on but there must be some limits.

Are you allergic to shrimp?  I've used the dried stuff before and it wasn't too bad.

It isn't hazardous and it isn't poisonous, most likely if you had a reaction to this, you're allergic to something in it.

If you think that the shrimp smells bad, you should smell the Scandinavian lutefisk---it is the most God-awful smelling fish in the world, and makes the shrimp paste smell like fields of roses in comparison.

The odor of lutefisk cooking on Christmas Eve, when we would have our traditional Swedish smorgasbrord is something truly unforgettable!

Although the odor smells like all of the old, dead and rotten fish from all of the lakes in Minnesota, piled up in one place, the flavor is surprisingly mild, and the texture gelatinous.

Many very pungent foods actually are delicious, once you get past the smell; gorgonzola cheese is an example.

What do meal worms taste like?



I was thinking of raising some  meal worms and adding them to a cookie recipe, but what is their taste like? Nutty? Bitter?

People who have tasted meal worms please answer. Anyone wanting to go Ewwww Gross or anything of that nature don't waste your time.



</question>



<additional details>



To everyone saying it's gross, and questioning it, there are a lot of cultures around the world who eat insects. They're very nutritious. Why the bug craving? Because I figure there are enough parts and pieces of them in my processed food already I might as well try it in my own recipes. =P



Oh, if I put them in a recipe, I'll probably roast them first. How will that change their taste?

I've had them prepared pan-fried before.  They don't really taste like much of anything.  I imagine if you roasted them they would have a very mild nutty flavor.  If you put them in your cookies they'd probably take on the flavor of the cookie and if  you diced them fine enough no one would probably even notice.  I would recommend actually roasting and then grinding the worms though, seems like the best for cookies.  This sounds like a great idea for someone trying to get more protein into their diet.  Thanks!

They are nummy if you cook in hot chili oil until they are crunchy.They have a mushroom like texture when cooked.When deep fried they have a crunch like a potato chip.The taste is spicy when fried with hot chili oil..plain and raw wouldn't be very good.A little earthy and bitter...try deep fry in a flavor oil.

There is no such thing as SALSA in Asian cuisine!
Are you talking about chili paste or sambal perhaps.  Sambal is YUMMY!
But it is NOT Salsa!!!

I'm pretty familiar with all types of Asian cuisine, but I've never heard of any kind of Asian salsa.  What were they serving it with?  Did they call it Asian salsa?  If it was called Asian salsa its probably just the restaurant trying some Asian-Mexican fusion dish and apparently they didn't do a very good job at it.

I'm sure that it was only an attempt of fusion cuisine. i am not a big fan of fusion, to me it seems to be a mixture of ideas and ingredients without having the soul of any cuisine. As far as I know, there is no such thing as Asian Salsa as such. Here we make a type of fresh sambal, (it contains small bird chilli, tomato, garlic, lime juice, fish sauce and palm sugar.) and it is very delicious served with fresh raw prawns or barbecued pork cheek.

Titoki T, you have no knowledge of Asia or Asian People, people here have many skills and talents.

lol
I'm Mexican American and I think I know what you mean. I live with Vietnamese and Korean girls, and I've had the pleasure of trying their food, plus I love Thai food!!! I think what you mean is why is their spicy food different than Mexican spicy foods? 
It's hard to explain but it's more of how it's spicy. Asian spicy food tends to be a sort of 'throat spiciness' if you will, it's more spicy after you swallow, where as Mexican spicy food is more instant and on your tongue.  Try Sriracha hot chili sauce, I dont think it's as good as Mexican salsa but it tastes really good with noodles!!!!
Hope this helps some.

Equally as fave is Indian food since that food is also very layered in flavors (spicy, sweet, sour all in one dish sometimes).

You got several choices here:

1) Twelve gauge shotgun (this is actually very humane and painless.  The duck has no idea whats coming and it dies instantly).
2)  Cut the duck's throat.
3)  Cut the duck's head off with a hatchet.
4)  Wring its neck
5)  The most humane way:  Lay the duck on its back in your lap.  Cup your hand over it's eyes and stroke it's stomach.  It will fall asleep.  Keep your hand over the duck's eyes and place it on a chopping block and quickly cut it's head off.  Quick, painless and humane.  (you don't have to use the hatchet.  You can use any of the above methods once the duck is asleep).

FYI:  For anyone who thinks this is sick and inhumane:  This is how its done on farmyards and and poultry farms across the country.  Just a fact of life.

umm,pani is water and if your word is panir,its cottage cheese.
And there's no plural for water in india,or anywhere else.The first answer was terribly stupid.

It is Indian cheese made by boiling milk with some acid like lemon/lime/vinegar until it curdles. It is then strained through a piece of muslin,  The residue is left wrapped in the muslin and lightly weighed down. After an hour or so you've got your paneer.
Watch this clear explanation on making paneerj

Only 'panir' comes to mind ,it is a type of cottage cheese very popular in north Indian dishes & has now gained favour all round the country.
It is made by adding a souring agent like vinegar or lemon juice to luke warm milk,once the milk is curdled it is strained through a sieve or cheese cloth,pressed down under a weight ,when firm enough to handle it can be refrigerated,would last a few days.Used  cut into cubes or crumbled depending on the recipe.
Palak panir /paneer is a popular dish in which fried cubes of paner are added to a spiced spinach puree.

Where can I get skyr in the UK?



I am looking for a company that sells skyr in the UK, a company the exports skyr to the UK, or some other way to get syr in the UK that I haven't thought of (other than making it). By the way, how does one make skyr completely from scratch without existing skyr? (:



</question>



<additional details>



I've been to High Street Kensington Whole Foods twice and never found the skyr. Where is it exactly?

Kefir is good, but it's not skyr, not at all...you must experience it to understand lol. It's cultured like yoghurt or kefir, but it's actually a fat free cheese. If I had to compare it to anything we have here normally, I'd compare it to fromage frais - but tart and not as velvety. Its smoothness is, well, glossy, while fromage frais is creamier.

From the recipe I have just read, this sounds very much like Kefir, which is found in Polish food shops and larger supermarkets with a Polish section.  My mother loves it and it is a great treat for her.  I am not so keen.  But everyone has their own taste and I would never mock someone else' taste and would hope that they do not do that to me.



My mother makes it by using warm milk to which has been added a couple of table spoons of live yoghurt.  Store in a food flask for a day or so and stir occassionally and it will be ready.

i am only speaking traditionally, because in my household, i am the cook.  most asian cultures, house wife is the house maker, they take care of the cooking and the house works - traditionally.
while not only the curry house, most (i donno the percentage, but i am pretty sure) restaurants have male chefs.  because it is a profession that most of the time require dealing with heavy equipments (i.e. large heavy pots, wok and cookwares).  i am not discriminating against anybody, but it is a fact there are more male chefs right now, perhaps we will see more female chefs in the future.

LOL... I'm an Asian woman and sadly this ideal is not just in Asian families, but I will tell you why they feel this way. Families think that women are not worth the time because in China when men die, the sons will take up the farm work and make the money. Women married to men are considered lucky because someone is taking care of them so they are required to take care of everything. I'm American born but still have my Asian roots. My partner is a half Caucasian half Puerto Rican, and in both societies, the same is expected. Now, I make far more money then my partner so we share the responsibilities a little more then most families, but it was agreed upon when we started a life together that if I chose to work when we have children, he will stay at home for 5 years until our children are in school, or vice versa, if I chose to stay at home, he would work. Either way, because of the way I was raised, it is my responsibility to clean up after my family and feed them. It's the same with most families no matter where you go. Now, when it comes to the indian restaurants where men are mainly the cooks, that has to do with the immigration. A majority of the time when people come from asia it will be the men first who will work and save money to start a life in America. When they have enough, they will send for the wives and children to join him. This has happened for years and years because it's thought that men always get the jobs easier then woman and are less likely to be swayed into commercialism (i.e. shopping). Hopefully that all makes sense to you!

I call them "Nohut" because I'm Turkish but in english speaken countries they're usually called Chickpeas
The word Garbanzo comes from old Spanish

In Turkey we roast them and put some spices and eat it as a snack, that is called "leblebi" in Turkish, in English yellow chickpeas. It is a very traditional Turkish snack. See this:

How do you make Pad Thai taste like it does at restaurants.?



I love Pad thai, and have followed a few recipes i found online.  But they never have quite the same taste or consistency that restaurant pad thai has.  I'm sure its something in the sauce.  Does anyone know what ingredient I'm missing?



Does anyone have a recipe that they have tried that tastes like restaurant pad thai?

Try this, one I made last year.

Mutton tikka bhuna

This takes a lot of preparation time, but boy, it is worth every minute. It is up there as one of the best curries I have ever had.  The lamb stock is critical â get some bones from the butchers or Morrisons and make some.

I used a fair bit of fat in the preparation, and the lamb gives off a fair amount but I skimmed it. You could leave it in, the only harm would be to the arteries.



Also I unashamedly use Patak's curry pastes. I've made my own and the Patak's are still better. I get through a fair amount of the stuff, so it's never more than 3 months open, so still fairly fresh.  I like the mild curry paste, it has a great flavour.



Bhuna means the spices are fried. This isn't a purists bhuna, but most people see bhuna as a generic curry.



If you like creamy curries, you could add cream, but this is very rich anyway. It's fairly mild, I added Mr. Naga's chilli paste to mine. Mr. Naga's chilli paste is the bees knees.

Mutton tikka:
1 lb mutton shoulder meat, cubed
2 tbsp Patak's mild curry paste
1 tbsp red wine vinegar

Lamb keema bhuna:
1 lb lamb mince (good quality from a butcher, not the supermarket stuff)
1 large onion, roughly chopped
1 cup peas
1 cup (1/2 pint) reduced lamb stock (See note)
1 tbsp garam masala
1 tbsp patak's curry paste
1 tbsp oil
2 tbsp flour
1 tbsp butter

Pilao rice:
2 cups basmati rice
8 cloves, crushed
8 green cardamom pods, crushed
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1 clove garlic, minced
pinch saffron
1 tsp salt

Garnish
1 handful cilantro (coriander leaf)
4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced

Lamb stock: 
Bones from 2 sides lamb ribs, or leg bones. Rib bones are easier to use.

NB: 1 cup = half a pint or thereabouts

The lamb stock is critical for this dish. It is quite a spicy dish, adding reduced lamb stock adds back the lamb flavour so it's not overwhelmed by the spices. 
To prepare: roast the bones from 2 sides of lamb ribs (about 30 bones). Simmer the bones on a low heat for 3 hours. Leave overnight, reheat and simmer for an hour more. Skim the fat, and reduce to about a cup

Mix the curry paste and vinegar, coat the mutton well and leave for 24 hours or more (2 days would be best).

Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the mince, and cook until well browned, about 20-25 mins. Remove the mince from the pan, leaving the oil behind. Blanch the onion for 4 mins in boiling water, drain and add to the lamb pan with the oil in. Cook until translucent, then add the lamb back and mix well. Add the garam masala and curry paste, mix well to distribute evenly. Add the peas and lamb stock, bring to a simmer and top up with water so it's covered. Simmer for half an hour. Set aside and leave overnight, covered.

Next day, bring to the boil, add water to cover the mince, then drain the stock into a gravy separator and drain the good stock into the pan, and discard the fat.

1/2 hour before troughing time: have everything ready to cook, you'll be swapping between things so be ready.

Rinse the rice, use 2x as much water by volume as rice. Boil the water, and add the rice and spices. Cover and simmer, after about 10 mins the watrer should have absorbed.



When cooked, transfer to a baking dish and keep warm in the oven at 100C/210F

Hard boil the eggs, place in cold water to cool, and shell and slice.

Thread the mutton chunks onto skewers. Place the skewers onto (or under) a hot grill and cook on a high heat; you want them slightly charred on the outside but tender in the middle, about 10 mins tops.

Meanwhile, bring the keema curry to a simmer.

When it's all ready:



Split the rice into 4, arrange into a ring on each plate, try and get a couple of the cardamoms per plate. Spoon 1/4 of the keema curry into the middle. Garnish with chopped cilantro (coriander leaf).  Top with the grilled mutton. Garnish the rice with slices of the egg.

Accompany with a nice full-bodied red wine.

If you can get it, this one should work with mutton. A much under-rated meat, IMHO.



MEAT CURRY

Serves 2

INGREDIENTS

375g of beef, chicken breasts or lamb (or mutton!) 
1 clove of garlic
2cm (1 inch) piece of fresh ginger
2 onions
2 tablespoons of sunflower oil
200g (Â½ a 400g tin) of plum tomatoes*
1 teaspoon of chilli powder
1 tablespoon of garam masala
Â½ a teaspoon of ground turmeric
250ml of water

METHOD

Chop the meat into 1cm (Â½ inch) pieces. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the ginger and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onions and chop them into tiny pieces.

Put the oil into a saucepan on a moderate heat. Put the garlic, ginger, meat and onions into the pan. Cook for 20 minutes until the meat is cooked thoroughly. Stir frequently to stop it sticking.



Open the tin of tomatoes. Pour the juice into a bowl. Chop the tomatoes while they are still in the can (itâs easier than chasing them around the bowl). Put the chopped tomatoes into the bowl. Use half and save the other half.



Put the chopped tomatoes into the pan. Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils. Add the chilli, garam masala and turmeric, and stir. Add the water. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Put the lid on the saucepan and cook for 30 minutes.



ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS

The quantity of chilli powder above makes for a medium curry. For a hot one, increase this to 1Â½ teaspoons.

For a mild one, add 100ml (Â½ a 200ml pot) of yoghurt 5 to 10 minutes before the end of cooking. For a mild Chicken Korma, also add a 50g sachet of creamed coconut. Add Â½ a teaspoon of mint sauce to the leftover yoghurt to make some mint raita.



* Plum tomatoes can be used either whole or chopped. It is difficult to stick chopped tomatoes back together again if you need to use them whole.

the focaccia bread our bakery makes is seasoned with oregano and topped with olive oil and kosher salt.  We use it for lots of different things but one of them is a flattened piece of focaccia dough, baked slightly then basil pesto, tomato slices and asiago cheese is added then finished baking.  Fabulous!

Focaccia is a flat oven-baked Italian bread, which may be topped with onions, herbs or other foodstuffs, related to pizza, but not considered to be the same. The word is derived from the Latin focus meaning âcentreâ and also âfireplaceâ -- the fireplace being in the centre of the house -- and this is a bread baked in the hearth. In English, it is sometimes redundantly referred to as focaccia bread.

Focaccia is used extensively as a sandwich bread outside of Italy.

It is typically rolled out or pressed by hand into a thick layer of dough and then baked in a stone-bottom or hearth oven. Bakers often puncture the bread with a knife to relieve bubbling on the surface of the bread. Also common is the practice of dotting the bread. This creates multiple wells in the bread by using a finger or the handle of a utensil to poke the unbaked dough. As a way to preserve moisture in the bread, olive oil is then spread over the dough, by hand or with a brush prior to rising and baking.

Focaccia can be used as a side to many meals, as a base for pizza or as sandwich bread.

Actually I dont know, I did not know then nor do I know now. It was the last thing on the plate and I figured that at the prices I could not afford to take the chance that it was edible and reject it. So I speared it with the fork and swallowed it whole. That was fifty three years ago, so I cannot have been entirely wrong.

When I was a chef I worked in alot of country's and tried some of the local delicacies, I had fried Frog skin in Thailand, BBQ Crickets in Vietnam, Whale meat and Blubber in Northern Canada, and a taco made with mealworms in Mexico and Yak milk cheese in Singapore.

Some other things quite normal like ostrich, emu, musk ox, caribou, kangaroo and wild goose, not alot I did not have an opportunity to try, and I worked in Jamaica and the local Rastafarian's tried to sell my a special root tonic, said it would fix my bumble and make it right, I am single (an always was) so my bumble is not going anywhere.

Trini Mango Cheesecake --



INGREDIENTS 
2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 
3/4 cup white sugar 
2 eggs 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
1 graham cracker crust, unbaked



1 1/4 cups mango nectar 
1/3 cup white sugar 
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
2 cups ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and diced



DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
In a medium bowl, mix 3/4 cup of sugar into the cream cheese. Mix in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Pour this batter into the graham cracker crust, and smooth over the top. 
Bake in preheated oven until the edges have puffed up but the middle still jiggles, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool for 30 minutes, then refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. 
While the cheesecake is baking, pour 1 cup of the mango nectar and 1/3 cup of sugar into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, dissolving the sugar. Dissolve the cornstarch in the remaining 1/4 cup of nectar, and stir into the boiling saucepan until thickened and clear, about 30 seconds. Place diced mango into a heatproof bowl, and toss with the thickened sauce. Allow to cool to room temperature, then pour over the cheesecake. Serve cold.

I think a good and simple carribean meal would be
jerk chicken , rice & peas with fried plantain or hard food on the side

There is preparation involved in making the jerk sauce to marinate the chicken and soaking the kidney beans for the rice and peas but cooking any kind of Caribbean food comes with preparation to ensure it's distinct taste. So if you're looking for flavoursome food the fried plantain compliments the spice of the jerk sauce and works well together. Hardfood is also easy to make as a side as you just need to slice plantain and sweet potato and then boil.. very simple.

Good Luck

"Caribbean food" is a rather broad term and can apply to any island in the Caribbean. The people of each island have their own cooking methods and preferred flavours. Coming from the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago I can say that because of the multi-cultural nature of our society, we have a variety of local foods that have evolved because of the influence of Europe, Africa, India, China and Syria. I have yet to see any recipes online that are true to the foods of my country and this is something I will soon remedy via a cookbook highlighting the many multi-cultural dishes of my country. I see someone has posted a recipe for Trini Mango Cheesecake which she has no doubt procured from the Allrecipes.com website. I know this because this recipe was posted by my co-author of said cookbook. This Trini Mango Cheesecake is in fact one of the many recipes which will become available once our book is published. So stay tuned to all who are interested in the truly unique and delicious fare that Trinidad and Tobago has to offer!

Where can I buy Proscuitto in Maadi, Egypt?



No you can't go to the amazon.com.eg and try to buy it, they won't ship to Egypt. The german butcher does not carry it, nor does "gourmet egypt"...it's not in "metro markets"...any useful help would be appreciated.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I doubt that you will be able to find it easily; if at all. Prosciutto is pork. You might want to check with some of the finer Italian restaurants there, and if they have it, you can inquire as to where it's from. I believe that the Italian restaurant in the Conrad Cairo Hotel has it on their menu. But I'm not positive. Also try some areas that have a larger Christian population like Heliopolis.

What did I eat? Weird chinese chicken? ?



I had chinese food for dinner and I had ordered honey chicken.  Whatever they sent me definitely wasn't that. It was cooked in a ton of onions had this strange yellow clear sauce with red specks and was extremely spicy. I have no clue what this dish was. I feel sick now too and usually chinese food doesn't make me sick.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Generally, honey chicken is not authentically chinese honey chicken, but a version developed for caucasian taste buds. You may have received a true version of honey chilli chicken. And the sickness could be your stomach reacting to chinese spices, which it is not accustomed to.

I love Indian food! My mom's friend used to make cookies for my family and she called them sweet cookies. They were the best cookies I've ever tasted. The taste was so different that's what made them good.
Another time when I lived next door to a couple from Pakistan they made a delicious meat dish with rice. That was very good too because of the spices.
Then when I was in highschool for multicultural day my mom's friend made an Indian soup and it was very good too.

I'm not Indian but I love Indian foods. My faves are Kasmiri style and south Indian (vegetarian, mustard seeds and spicy). Half my friends like it, the other half aren't so fond. I wouldn't know how to Americanize it except that use "familar meats" if a recipe calls for goat or lamb, you may try replacing it with chicken. Maybe omitting certain ingredients like asofetida may Americanize it. Good luck! I really love a good lamb vindaloo or a Vadavan spiced lentils. I do love palak paneer and my all time favorite dessert is kheer made with rice =)

O.k.  here is the deal, you don't have to be Indian to like Indian food.  I'm Asian, spicy food is not too different from our taste.



Ask your friend or your friend's parents if they like spicy food.  Than you can ask your mom to make it according to their taste bud.  However, keep it Indian but adjust the spices.  You could make tandoori chicken or curry chicken, basmati rice/chapati for the main course, samosa for the appetizer, and some really good dessert to finish off so that way they will remember the meal for a long time to come.  Trust me, once they taste the food, I"m sure they'll definitely come back again.

Hehe. Since I'm Chinese, I'm really picky with my Chinese food. I don't like much from the Americanized Chinese food restaurants, cause they're not a spicy and flavorful as their original dishes back in China. However, there are some really good authentic Chinese restuarants I've come across.



Favorite: Dumplins by far! And not the fried kind, the water boiled kind

I live in Idaho and I haven't really noticed any different cuisine. Of course, Idaho is famous for potatoes, but it's not like there is an over abundance of potato dishes on our menus. I have noticed a lot of huckleberry recipes coming out of our lovely state, though. Huckleberries grow very well in my area of the state and huckleberry picking a popular summer activity.

Pot noodles is not really food.  Pot noodles is like smoking or abusing yourself in some way.



My wife originates from another countrly.  She saw an ad. for pot noodle and really wanted to try one.  She ate one spoonful and threw it away.  Now she laughs in disbelief when she goes past them in the supermarket, she cannot believe people eat them.



Most ready meals have too many additives.

I love cooked food...especially If somebody else cooked it for me.  As far as the microwave goes...I use it to cheat and cut down on cooking time...a microwavable burger is just gross...that's like reheating pizza in the microwave.  And my mom is old school, she rarely used the microwave...if I'm correct just for popcorn...lol

Ready made food is okay once in a blue moon, but it's not healthy for you.  Home-made burgers, home-made noodles, etc taste a million times better and they won't give you all the health problems these ready made foods filled with preservatives will.

Some people do eat dog, and really I have no problem with that. Personally, though, I wouldn't want to eat a carnivorous animal. I'll eat domestically raised pork because they don't rely on meat as their main food, but dogs, cats, wild boar, and other carnivores, no thanks.
Rabbit is yummy, though.

I believe meat consumption is based a lot on culture. For example, in the United States, dogs are primarily pets; whereas pigs are raised primarily for slaughter. In other countries, these two animals' rolls may be reversed.

Yea I agree. In Vietnam and Laos they do eat dogs. In Laos I think they also ate cats.I never tried either cos my daughter would have hated me forever.
I used to eat rabbit when I was a kid, it was nice, again I couldn't eat it now cos of my daughter.
The Japs say the same about us eating cows and them eating whales. I totally disagree with killing whales cos I've seen them in the wild and there is something very, very special about them,  hard to describe, you feel there's an intelligence and a kindness in them that humanity would do well to emulate. I know the Africans and S Americans eat monkeys and I think that is horrible cos they're so like us, it's almost like cannibalism to me.
But meat is meat is meat. What's acceptable on one culture is unacceptable in another. Also poverty has a big part to play especially if you go to places like China and Cambodia, they got used to eating whatever the hell they could get their hands on.
Let's face it the world would be a lot better place if we were all vegetarians.

Yeah you are right!  It is quite simple really. You either eat meat or not, all this meat snobbery is nonsense.



It is just because you are born in certain part of the world where it is acceptable to chicken and cow meat, that you have got a right to say yuck to someone from another culture who eats dogs!



Every meat eater should be open minded to meat of different animals in other countries, apart from if they are restricted because of religous reasons.......

Rainbow roll is usually a California roll with extra sashimi slices placed on top - usually tuna, hamachi, and salmon.



As for the others, many restaurants make up their own rolls, so you'll have to look at their menu to find out what's in it.  Most of the time it's just a combination of veggies and fish, sometimes deep fried or covered with a sauce.
