Half is not just offensive, as i mainly play back and half i know what i'm talknig about when i say this, when defending mark their wing, get in their face, if you can not smell them then you are not close enough, when attacking  go up if it's nessecary go in the "D" try using your inner and wing to go up the field, on short corner defensive, then your team should orginizer that on offensive stand behind the reciever/ hitter at the angle at which the ball is comnig so in the case they do not trap it you can get it or you can be a lay off in which case stand the side of the main hitter and if he wishes or if you've played you will get the ball and such..

For example take the war games like call of duty or medal of honour. All those freakin games portray american as the hero like they were the one country in war and single handed won the war. B.S. Canadians were there they won the war.the first americans came like 2 years later eh?

I have read a lot of questions on Yahoo Uk & Ireland that use derogatory terms such as red neck and hillbilly.?



This makes me wonder what exactly do the people of the UK & Ireland know about the American south? I had a penpal from London several years back (he was of color or black) and he said he would never go to North Carolina because he was afraid. About 60% of the population of North Carolina is African American what exactly was he afraid of?

the film deliverance did wonders for the southern states not to mention the k.k.k or any other w.a.s.p. organisations and of-coarse the whole 50's American history of segregation does wonders to the black communities in the UK and Ireland I know it sounds harsh but we don't carry fire arms as a rule either so it could just be that he doesn't want to be made to squeal like a pig or get his butt shot or something even worse made to go to a Rodio and eat deep fried bull's balls with ketchup or some such nasty-ness all in all you got to see it from the UK's point of View  we ain't racist we got a good laws that treat people with other ethnic minorities as equals with no exception we got only one political (joke) party called the British national party that is a racist institute within our political world but we have no radical Nazi organisations that promote hatred of colour and arm themselves for (the revolution) we don't have any guns allowed on the streets if you get caught with a shooter in the UK or Ireland its instant jail for a long time and you could even be sentenced  for racial abuse in the UK so I hope you get a better understanding of our oversight of the U.S without trying to upset you in any way its just how it looks from the outside in an honest point of View

I would say misinformation. I highly doubt that any society that someone is genuinely unfamiliar with is consistent with their preconceived notions (probably could've worded that better).



Living in Michigan I didn't know too much about the south. Pretty much everything I learned was from friends of mine who think that they're southern because their grandpa was born in TN and moved here when he was 9. It's those people who give the false stereotype. They tend to like the idea because they're racist or jingoistic and they think the south is that way.

I believed it for a while to. In fact as a suburban white male up till recently the only group i was prejudiced against were southerners, Then i realized that most of it comes from... we'll call em' Southern Fried Phoneys. People who think they're from the south and act like they just moved up north from Charlottesville when they've lived just outside of Detroit their entire lives.

BTW why is this in the hockey section?

i agree that calgary has had the best off-season in acquiring bertuzzi and cammalleri, as well as glencross and bourque. these players are going to add scoring, as well as youth and grit to the team, trying to get back to what we had in 2004 in the cup run (gelinas's goal in game six, anyone?). anyways, as was said above, colorado's core players (with the exception of stastny and wolski) are getting older. edmonton is basically in the opposite position (where colorado will be in a few years). they have a good core of young players, but just not enough experience yet. a few years down the road, if they manage to keep their young players, edmonton is going to be a force in the nw division.
as for minnesota, while still stingy defensively, will have a tough time scoring goals.
