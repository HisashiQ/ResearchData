Yes you can indeed live in upstate NY and commute into NYC--  You need to look for a place near a Metro North train station in either Westchester, Putnam or Dutchess counties (all are east of the Hudson river).  Metro North goes as far north as Poughkeepsie on its Hudson line, and as far north as Wassaic in Dutchess County on its Harlem line.

It's more difficult to commute into NYC from Upstate NY if you are on the west side of the Hudson, because none of the rail lines from Rockland or Orange Counties goes directly to Penn Station--  They all go to Hoboken NJ where you have to transfer to a PATH train to get in.

thanks guys for your help. I appreciate it.  Hopefully I get a chance to work in NYC.

Probably between £10 and £12 depending how you drive and depending on the kind of roads you will be driving on whether motorway or A or B class roads and how many hills you will encounter etc. etc. With good sensible driving yes around the £12 mark to be on the safe side. But always have plenty of petrol in your tank, as you never know if you will have to make a detour because of accidents.
 Take care and have a safe journey.  Alex

Your Micra should average 48mpg, according to book figures.
Your journey would therefore need 1.73 gallons, or 7.86 litres.
At your prices, that's £8.86

Info that we need to solve this problem:

1. Miles per gallon for the car
2. Price of fuel.
3. Length of trip.

£15 should cover it. I have a magan 2ltr and mine would be fine with that much fuel, yours is a smaller car so you may even get away with a tenner if you drive around 60-70mph.
around town you probably use £20 with that distance, but you get much more to the gallon on the motorway.

Hmm, this is a difficult one.

170 miles at 10 miles per litre - could that possibly be 17 litres?

17 litres at £1.13 = £19.21.

Not rocket science, is it?

Your car should average 47mpg on this journey, so therefore it should use 3.62 gallons, or 16.42 litres. At your fuel pricing, that's £18.56 (Call it £20 to round it off)

There is no way without running it and testing.  The tuning has a lot to do with is as well as the weight of the car and even wind resistance.  Too many things that cant just be turned into number to calculate.  Even manufacturers estimates are very optimistic as they just run them on rollers with a little resistance but that will never compare to real road conditions.

My friend paid for my ride on COACH USA Red & Tan Rockland Coach #20 bus from Palisade Mall to Port Authority Bus Terminal at 5:20pm.
Since this bus I did not taken, so I was nervous because it was mystery route to me and it was long ride. And then we got stuck on heavy inbound traffic to Lincoln Tunnel at few feets, and I felt embrass because I was about to urine explore, but I did not. I was holding to my pant or eating to obstractle from thinking about urine.
As soon as bus arrive at Port Authority, I rush to restroom because it took 103 minute ride.

as for train service there is no train service from Santa Clarita to Bakersfield?
(Amtrak does have a bus though but then you cant take to

Relocate or Commute?



I just got an offer for a job 50-55 miles away from where I am and they are offering £15000. Train and bus it out the q as its too long and many changes. So I either need to get a car and commute or move closer. I could be looking to stay at the place for at least 2-3 years so in terms of relocation I have the option to buy or rent. but I'm not sure about costs involved. If I buy my father would help as I prob wouldn't get a mortgage on my own. I would look to rent out any spare rooms if I bought. what are your thoughts to justify one of the three options (buy/rent/commute by car)?

Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



I know its crap I need to have a word with them about how long I should expect to stay on that and what the future looks like in terms of pay. However this company is offering a software testing position with full training and ISEB certification and the company is a huge multinational with opportunities to progress. I've been looking for work since Apr/May now with only two interviews, one which I was not selected for (ony 20 mins down the road) and this one which I did get 50 miles away.

Would definitely talk to the company and see what the long term prospects are. When you know, decide then, but I would look at relocating. I used to travel 75 miles each way, good in the summer, light mornings and nights, but in the winter, the darkness gets to you. You could give the commute a try, but if your paying for your own travelling costs, they will soon eat into your money.
Good luck with whatever you decide anyway

Rent - possibly see if you can rent a room in a shared house rather than renting a full place on you own. It will also give you a feel for somewhere different and you can always pop home at weekends

A 100 mile round trip every day will become very tiring and expensive on fuel and wear and tear on your car.

Good luck

Does this seem impractical?



I really want a street bike, and I'm going to be attending the University of Manitoba soon. I really want to buy a bike instead of a car. Do you think this is impractical?

PROS:
-Cheap on gas
-Fun
-New (vs. buying a $3500 used car.)



CONS:
-I can only use the bike from mid April october.
-I plan to use public transportation in the other months.
-Insurance is a little more than a car.

Also, my parents HATE the idea, but it's not like it's there money, i have been working at Mc Donald's since i was 14 saving up! :P
Not to mention I'm paying my way through school, including my apartment and everything. My parents aren't contributing a dime, so i think it's my decision.

Ohh yeah here's the bike.

Practical? Yes, but there are other factors that weigh in.  You don't say if you've ridden a bike before and what your experience level is.  If this is your first bike (and this is a good choice for a beginner) then you should invest in driver training, which you could suggest to your parents that they could pay for and would alleviate some of their concerns.  It's worth it!  If you don't mind taking transit during the winter months and have a level head on your shoulders (ie don't be an idiot like I was and end up in hospital for a month with badly broken bones) then it is a cheap reliable fun way to get around.  Good luck!

There is a buzzer.
It is controlled either by a cable above the window that you pull on, or a strip of rubber tape between the windows that you push on. It depends on how old the bus is.

Sorry, not to sure.  But I remember top gear saying that you get 10% extra on speed limit..  Hopefully you'll be lucky.

When I use premium gas I swear ot runs much better but some people say it is a waste what is your opinion?



It is a 2002 Olds Alero V6. Preemium SEEMS to improve smoothness and acceleration and it just feels better. Is this all psychological or is there any truth to it?

I won't run anything else but premium. In my own experience with gasoline differences.  In the long run, premium is cheaper.  Reason being as I get better gas mileage when I run premium then I do if I run Regular gas.  Regular gas I don't go as far and it would cost more to go as far as what premium gets me.  So in actuality,  Regular gas costs me more to go the distance of Premium mileage.

When it comes to travel distance and performance there is a mixed opinion on the benefits of premium fuel over normal unleaded.

Is there an advantage in it for you?

If you are finding improved performance that brings with it a lower fuel usage, that’s then good news.



Now days most cars do see a benefit.



The unknown is, do you receive a benefit that is value for money.



Premium does clean the injectors although you still do need to use an injector cleaner now and then.



You also need to find out how much fuel you use of both premium over what you used of normal unleaded.  After you know this you can then work out how much it cost for each fuel to travel a set distance.

It's better, modern cars with computers are pretty smart.  They have knock sensors that that let the timing retard or advance according to the grade of fuel you use, so they get the most out of it.  It's still a draw cost wise` better mileage vs higher cost....

Expect to be introduced to the controls of the car, and feel strange to be sat on that side!  The seat-belt will feel odd on your shoulder too. You will get used to it in time.  Spend any time you can just sitting in a drivers' seat.  Practice sitting and gently squeezing a grapefruit under your left foot!  This is the art of 'clutch-control'.  The clutch is not a switch, it allows the engines' torque (rotation) to be introduced GENTLY to the gearbox, in a controlled manner.  You have to give a little throttle, push in the clutch pedal, select first gear, and slowly, gently, lift your left foot up, to allow the clutch to 'bite'.  Release the handbrake, a little more gas, and you are moving off!!

Before i had my first lesson my biggest fear was not being able to work out how to change gear,but on the day it was more about actually steering the car. But my instructor was great and he just told me to look ahead and not down at the controls.
It's a fabulous experience and i can promise you when you finally get home after your first lesson you will feel amazing and look forward to your next lesson.
It's brilliant learning to drive,a real thrill. I just hope you get a fab instructor that makes the experience a good one for you.
Enjoy.

It's been a few years since I was in your shoes but from what I recall, The first half of my first lesson was familiarization with the controls, how to modulate ( and find the friction point ) the clutch pedal, up and down shifting, etc.  This was done with the instructor driving.  The second half of the lesson I drove.  My time in the driving seat was basically just driving around my neighbourhood ( quiet, residential streets ) learning how to coordinate the clutch, brake and gas pedals.

Here in Alberta, the ticket gets sent to the registered owner of the vehicle, so if it is not your car then you won't get anything. Otherwise, it can take several weeks (I got one 3 months after the "offence") to get anything and I'm not sure there is a set time frame that this has to be done in, but I could be wrong on this one.

If you are in the UK the first person to find out is the owner - the police send him/her a demand to know who was driving at the time - I think they have 28 days to do this and I think the owner has the same time to reply - then they would send you notification of the fine etc.



So you may have to wait 3 months to know you're in the clear if you were driving someone else's car.



If you were driving your own it will still be the second letter you receive that gives you the option of paying the fine, going to court, or if you were less than 10 mph over the limit possibly a speed awareness course

Do what a lot of us do, use the internet to give and get directions MAPQUEST.com

I doubt its that your bad, a majority of people just have a tough time doing it, directions can be easily confusing.

(But since you asked for certain activities and its sounds like your willing to actually try, I can suggest that you try to understand how the people are thinking of what your saying or what you wrote when their reading or heading your directions.  What would make it easier for you personally in directions?



Challenge all your work as if you hadn't known it, how easy would it be.



Visuals, clear directions, distances, all help people.  The exercise I just listed would in my opinion be similar to prepping for an exam, look at what would make sense.)

I have the same problem.
i think it is because I usually have my wife in the car and she is very good with directions.
She is always telling me where to go, in more ways than one.
It is like a GPS system that also tells me what chores I have neglected.

When I get in the car later by myself to go to the same location we had just been to, I can't remeber for the life of me where it is.
If my wife and I are going somewhere we had just been a few day before she can't believe that I don't remember the directions.
I just use the GPS to eliminate "issues".
She still usually knows a better way which dirves me crazy :)

You should try to find landmarks around the places you are going.  Even things like a store or a post office may help you to remember certain things about your trips and this may help you to find your way better.

If that doesn't work you can always buy a GPS or a Tom Tom, both of these things are designed to help you find your way.

I have a very good sense of direction and I attribute this to a couple of things.  One is spatial orientation--the ability to comprehend size and shapes and to fit them together.  Men seem to generally have better spatial orientation, although I have known women who were every bit as good at it as I am.  The other is due to an experience I had when I was 6 years old and got lost coming home from school.

My father decided that would never happen to me again, so he took me out and showed me every way I could get home from school, including some that were pretty ridiculous.  It gave me the confidence I needed to know I could find my way with a little patience and a good methodology.

A few years of scouting, some map-reading training and a lot of experience have given me a good sense of direction.

So I would have to say a sense of direction is basically an acquired skill.  You can learn to look for landmarks or signs of direction.  It takes a good methodology, a good teacher, and patience and lots of practice.  If you can't figure it out, consider GPS, Mapqwest, Yahoo Maps or other devices.  Learning how to read a map is also a really good way of helping yourself acquire a good sense of direction.

Men generally tend to learn this more easily than women, but women can learn it--witness female cab drivers, police officers or firefighters.

Good luck.

The main problem is your brain goes into a different state while driving.  It's called the "beta mode' in which you don't pay attention and just watch the road.

And screw the male who says they are better with directions.  I'm a grandmother that hardly needs a map and I live close to the DFW area.  I have a built in GPS in my brain and always know which was is North.

It takes time to learn things.  Also, find your landmarks which should help.  Printing out a map from mapquest is also a good idea.

use a map instead of sat nav. sat nav takes you places and you don't actually realise or keep track of where you're going, because you've got someone telling you where to go. so even if you've been to the place a few times, to drive there without sat nav is a challenge!



instead, take in your surroundings, remember buildings and landmarks, when i take my niece to her boyfriends, his turning is after the big cream house with railings outside, thats how i remember where it is. develop your way of remembering! good luck :)

My wife is the same way. I think the best thing to do is start with the basics. Look at the sky - specifically the sun. The sun comes up in the east and sets in the west. If you look at the morning sun - east, then north will be to your left and south to your right; west will be behind you. If I make 4 right or left turns, I will be going the same direction as when I started. Another thing to look for is landmarks, like a prominent building or sign.



If you are going to a new destination, call ahead and get the closest cross streets. Check your route on your computer using Google Earth or MSN Virtual Earth. These are free downloads. Then write down your route street by street, even include the street before you turn so you know when you're close. Practice it a couple of times just to get in the habit. Don't buy a GPS until you feel comfortable doing it on your own.

All the best.

I am exactly the same. If you have enough petrol to spare and have nothing to do, go for a long drive firstly around your local area and explore as many roads as you can and you will soon get familiar with them then gradually explore further and further out of the area (make sure you have an A-Z handy at all times in case), I have been doing this myself lately and feel a lot more confident about going places and discovered new short cuts to places that I never knew about. I have been driving for over 2 years but it is only in the past 4 months that I have really started learning and becoming more familiar with routes but it gets expensive driving for hours and hours a day, but I enjoy driving and take my ill mum out for a ride to get her out of the house. Studying the A-Z can help, get the big colourful one so it won't be too boring. Or plan a landmark to visit each day or so and practise going there. Goodluck.

Personally i would see this as a warning and stick to 30 in a 30 zone.

It depends on whether or not there was film in the camera.  If it flashed twice - definitely - if once only you may be lucky.

If it did catch you the next step is for the registered owner to receive a letter requiring her/him to state who was driving.

Then after that has been replied to you will get a letter asking you to confirm and to agree to fine and points on your licence.  Had you been going under 40 mph and you habe not been on one in last 3 years you would also have had the choice of a speed awareness course.

Depends whether the camera had any film inside it.

If you trigger the mechanism - it will still flash.

They do this because it scares the sh1t out of drivers - and the camera operators like that.

The answer turns on what jurisdiction (city/county/country) you are in.  I have no idea where you are located.  In the state where I live, where I don't believe they have many speed cameras installed, it is widely believed that the police (usually using radar guns) don't stop for speeding unless you are "10 over", This is typically on the freeways, maybe not true on local streets (certainly not in school zones), though my limited experience suggests "10 over" is the rule here.

<answer>



Most Sat Navs have the facility to use a speed camera database to warn you of fixed speed cameras, by using the GPS location of the camera.

This database has an additional cost to keep it up to date (Tom Tom is £19.99 a year).

NO sat nav. can 'detect' speed cameras as that requires a radar system which is illegal.

If you don't need a Sat Nav device you can get a speed camera locator (same principle) e.g. 'RoadPilot MicroGo'

The database on a sat nav usually only operates by the GPS location, so that a camera for the opposite carriageway or on a road over bridge will be detected.

In the case of the Micro GO. the type of camera is held in the database and it's direction of operation so that you should only be warned of cameras affecting your direction of travel.

My neighbour has an allocated parking bay but still chooses to park elsewhere on the street ?



One of my neighbours has a drop kerb and a space that is marked at each end with a white line.  He also has off road parking outside his house (I assume it is a disabled bay although it is not marked 'disabled') and the neighbour himself does not require an aid (walking stick / wheelchair etc) to get around - he can walk quite ably.



This parking space is big enough to fit 2 cars in.  He throws a complete hissy fit if you dare to park even a couple of inches over his white line.  Parking is really limited on the road anyway and now he has taken to parking elswhere on the road other than 'his space' - but of course, no-one is allowed to use this space!



I think he is doing it to annoy the neighbours (mission accomplished!).  Recently my next-door neighbour was forced to park just impinging on this space and Mr Grumpy left a rude and mildly threatening letter on his wind-screen.

I am not being petty - but it seems really unfair.  Any advice guys??

the parking bay must be marked correctly and signposted to state the rules for parking in there. If they are not marked properly or signposted to state the rules of parking, then you are free to park there. If it says permit holders only, ask the council for a residents permit. If it is a disabled bay, it does not belong to the resident and ANY disabled person can park there (time to call in a few favours from the elderly rellies!).

Contact your local authority that issues his exclusive parking slot and tell them that he is parking elsewhere and doesn't use it and is therefore not as disabled as they have been led to believe. This is fraud as he is obtaining an advantage under false pretences.

i cannot see the white lines actually marking out a parking space. i am assuming they are just to define his drop kerb as under eu laws if there is to be an allocated parking space there has to be a pole with a sign on it. as long as there are no cars parked in his drive then you can park where you want in front of the drop kerb as you have to let access to the road for the cars and not the road to his drive.also if its a disabled bay there has to be a pole and the "disabled " marked on the road. check with the local council and if its not any sort of parking bay park there and he will soon get the hint and if he causes any damage to your car then call the police to him

Even if the bay is in yellow with the word disabled in it anyone can park there, it has no legal basis unless it has a single or double yellow line and / or a sign stating parking conditions.
The box is an advisory and works on the basis of peoples good nature and too often in this country the lack of knowledge of the laws of the road by the people that use it.
Park there and keep an eye on it in case the grump damages it.
My parents have similar problems, 2 cars, both parked off road but have people parked outside sometimes blocking driveway as these people won't use their driveways.

I love it when I am in traffic and a big bus with shiny windows is behind me as I can see when my brakelights or indicators on the back of my car are working ok from the reflection of their bus through my rearview mirror. Does anyone else test their lights like this too, also if I am not the only one that does this do you think the bus driver behind knows what we are doing or must they think we are crazy seeing all the car in fronts lights randomly going on and off, lol. Oh and no I wouldn't use this opportunity to test out my reverse lights, that would give the bus driver behind the horrors I think! lol.

Another good way to test your brake lights is to wait until someone is too close and slam your brakes on hard. If they run into you your lights are not working and you should replace the bulbs at the same time as you have the rear end of the car rebuilt.

If someone runs into you it is usually regarded as their fault in law, so you should be able to claim for the bodywork, and the bulbs, on their insurance.

Yup, I do it too - but I liked Gerard's answer!  (I wouldn't have the nerve to carry it through though.)  I bet bus drivers are used to being used as testing grounds.  It passes the time constructively at least.

There's nothing wrong with that.  It only takes a second or two to check your brake lights.  I wouldn't suggest checking your indicators in that way though it's not only misleading but also unnecessary.  Whenever an indicator bulb blows, both the click and the flash of the internal light will operate twice as fast.  Whilst this won't tell you exactly which bulb has blown it will at least draw your attention to the problem.

What's up with Petrol?



The most I've paid for petrol is £1.16ish and that is when petrol prices where $147ish.

So how comes I'm still paying £1.08ish and petrol prices are $95ish.

I know tax accounts for a high proportion of petrol prices, but surely a drop of $55 must bring petrol prices to below a quid?

The prices will come down, but it just takes a while for that to happen.



Adze is on the right track, but not completely right.  When oil was going up it was going up by up to 10% a day.  During this time I never saw gas go up by more than 4-5% a day.  If stations were to raise prices as fast as oil prices were rising people would revolt so they slow down the increase a little to calm the people down.  This is part of the reason why the prices also can't fall as fast as oil prices do.  It is also important to realize that while oil price is the largest impact on gas price, it is not the only factor that impacts gas price. This is hurricane season and most of America's gas refineries have been getting hit by hurricanes.  They have been without electricity and therefore unable to produce gas.  You may think that since you are across the pond it wouldn't affect you, but it does.  Us Americans need to get our gas from somewhere so now we are more directly competing with Europe for refined gas which would drive up prices for you as well.

Of course greed does also play a part.  These are companies after all and last time I checked the were not non-profits or charaties.

Stored reserves bought at the higher market price have to be used first - the suppliers won't drop their prices so that they make a loss on oil purchased by them at the higher price.

and diesel being high,will they come down
when and if fuel cost come down ? will
electricity gas and water come down ?.will
it buggery,greed is king and always will be.
