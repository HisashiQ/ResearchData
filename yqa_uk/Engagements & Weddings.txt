Hi - it shouldbe a song thats personal to her and her new hubby, anyone elses suggestions would be 'nice' but have no meaning

For example, my first dance was 'can you feel the love tonight' from the lion king. Now youll prob sit there and go, my God what a random choice! But to us, its an important song

Enjoy helping plan the day, I dont know what I would have dne without my main girl! (and my Mum of course lol)xx

It should definately be a song that has great personal and sentimental meaning to the couple.  Otherwise, just google "Romantic songs."  The first movie my (now) wife and I saw together was Moulin Rouge.  Our first dance was Come What May.  I wanted Beauty and the Beast (we got married at Disney, I'm 6'8" and she's gorgeous :-p) but it got voted down!

I Can't Help Falling In Love With You......Elvis Presley....wonderfully romantic, slow and just a tad sappy enough to be sweet (our song is At Last-Etta James-we didn't have a first dance because we opted for a small home reception, but that's our song lol...great song, too)

I generally had it in my mind that I wouldn't marry someone more than 20 years older than me, as it's turned out my husband is 12 years older.  It's not like I have some kind of daddy complex, I just happen to like and have more in common with people a few years older, I have always been that way even with friends.  Maybe because I'm the baby of 8 and my oldest brother could be my father!

15 years.  I've dated older men and frankly, unless you are already in your 30s or 40s, the gap really shows. My sister married a guy who is probably 25 years older (she is only about 2 years older than his youngest daughter).  Works, but they didn't get together until she was almost 40 and she had no plans to have children of her own.

My guy is 8 years younger.

It would depend on how old I was at the time.  At 20, I wouldn't consider anyone more than three years older than me, and no more than a year younger than me.  At 30, I'd consider someone up to nine years older, and five years younger.  At 40, I'd consider someone 12 years older and seven years younger.  At 50, I'd consider someone 15 years older and 10 years younger.  And so on.  It would also depend on the person's health if they were more than a few years older than me.

I think it would depend on what age you are. 
18 and 38 is too large a gap, but 35 and 55 might not be so different. 
You need to consider the maturity of both people and what they want our of the rest of their lives.



Generally speaking, I would not suggest more than a 10 year gap.

I am 52 and the youngest legal age for marriage is 16, so that makes 36 years.  As we all know, England is queueing up with 16-year-old girls eager to marry a 50-something bloke with a beard and a pointy hat.  They have to lay on special trains to carry them all here. I might have to consider a harem.  Does that count as marriage?

There is only 25 years between me and my current girlfriend, who is 27.

In the other direction is more problematic, since I would like children.  Jeanne Calment was 120 when she died, so in theory if I found someone else the same age irresistible and she found me equally so, that makes an age gap of 68 years...  Still, it shouldn't be long before a bit of genetic modification and hormone replacement will give all 120-year-olds the right to motherhood.

Well there has to be somewhere, stand to reason. But doesn't it figure, women have more to offer men, that men have to women. 
What I mean is, men are just way more desperate to get a woman, and usually they think mail order women, are more submissive.
Like that will last, once they get them home, lol.

There are also more mail order brides sites because women do not have as much financial security as men in many of the countries where these women are from. They see marriage as an easier way to get a better life in a first world nation.

20 minutes for pictures...highly unlikely.  I would schedule 1 hour for photos and in the meantime, you should have some sort of something for your guests...a cocktail hour, for example.

Unless this is a tiny wedding I don't think you have given yourselves enough time. Half an hour for the ceremony and the photographs isn't nearly enough, you are more likely to start the reception at 5.00. Then everyone has to greet you, the courses will be served, and then the speeches start. If that happens without a hitch and no one makes a long speech, best case scenario is an hour and a half but it's more likely to be closer to two hours. Then you start the dances, that leaves you cutting the cake at 7.30.
This all feels terribly rushed, as though you are trying to stuff all of the traditions into too short a time line. Why have dances when the guests won't be able to dance themselves?! I think they will feel cheated!

The ceremony is generally about 20 to 30 minutes long for a short one.  And I would say that you definitely need more then 20 minutes for pictures even if you won't be taking many.  We didn't do that many pictures either, but it took about an hour and a half to do.  This isn't a time when you want to be or feel rushed.  With the ceremony at 4pm, I wouldn't start the reception until 6pm.  If everything is in the same place and guest don't have to travel, then just put reception following, and do a small cocktail hour for your guest while you are getting pictures taken.

5:00 is a tad early for dinner, for most people.  Do you think you can maybe flip-flop the order of events a bit- maybe a little cocktail hour from 4:30 to 5:30, speeches/toasts from 5:30 to 6, dinner at 6, cake at 7:00, dancing right after the cake, and then maybe bouquet and garter toss right before you leave?  As for the Newlywed Game, I guess that's cute, but it will cut into the dancing a lot.  Maybe it could be an ice-breaker game during cocktail hour?

there is not enough time between the ceremony and reception.  the ceremony lasts at least 15 min and you want 20 min for pictures but you are only left with 15 min after the cermony.so you are already over by 5 min. by the time you get people together to take one picture and fix your dress it might take 4 min. also it seems kinda smooshed together. is there other people using the venue after you? i would suggest offering guests some hors d vors during picture time. good luck!

if you have alot of family and friends and have a myspace account-why not send them all a message explaining what happened and why.



you can also send out emails or text messages (just text them to call you about engagement changes).

mayb tell your friends and family you guys have been fighting alot or that u r having 2nd thought or something like that. then keep doing that over a 1-3 week period and then eventually on the 2nd or 3rd week.. tell them that u guys arnt getting engged anymore. that way they dont take sides on who's fault is who but more like they'd understand ur relationship wasnt working out on both parties and would accept it.

I actually went through the same thing as well, I'm so sorry to hear.  It depends if you already sent out invitations or not.  Luckily, my ex-fiance and I had only sent out save-the-dates, so without the follow up of the invitation, there was no confirmation or information.  And word gets around, so people will definitely hear through the grapevine, but if you would feel better explaining things a bit more to certain people, I would feel free to call and people would always feel special that you called and sympathetic towards your situation.  If you don't feel the need to explain anything then I would just try to move forward and be prepared as to how you'll answer questions people will have in the future.  Remember, everything happens for a reason.. I can still say that even after going through the same thing about a year & 1/2 ago.  Best wishes.

if you two broke up on good terms, an easy way out is to have a small family gathering for a drink or so, and then tell everybody you have an announcement to make and tell them that you have -  for the moment - postponed the engagement thing, because you have to reconsider your lives and relationships. they will not ask anything since they will think it's just delaying thing. with time they will stop seeing you together and forget the idea that you are an item and stop asking questions.

As  hard as it to tell the truth you have to be honest because the longer you leave it the harder its going to get and if you had a date set it would be difficult to keep up the pretense as it got closer.Tell your parent/parents the full story and have them tell other family member that it with regret your engagement has ended and that it wasn't meant to be and leave it at that and you don't have to say anything else.Or for the really long distant people you could right them a note. Depend on how close you are to your friends you could tell them the same thing. Good luck and all the best for your future.

Need Positive Suggestions on Deciding What to do?



My spouse is interested in joining a religious tour to Italy.  I agreed to it although I am not too keen because of the cost and time issue.  My spouse has been concerned how this trip is going to affect his job since he will be out for 10 week days.  He had never been out of his job that long and there will be a project going on during the10 days he will be out from work.



We have been holding on to commit to this trip over the last month, and tomorrow is the last day for us to decide whether we should commit or not.



I personally am not too keen of going to the trip, but my spouse wanted to go, but with mixed feelings.  Something is telling me that this may not be a good time for us to be going for a trip like this, but I feel like I have to go through it because I don't want to let my spouse down.  However, I feel that am something is pulling me back and can't seem to make any kind of decision.



Has anyone ever in this situation and can share advice as you may think is best to do?



Would it be a good idea to go or not?



Thanks.

There is a saying.... when in doubt dont?  If there is doubt, then dont.

If you have indecision, then it's not the right time. There will always be other trips.



Don't second guess yourself by saying you want to support your husband. Be honest with him and let him know how you feel.  It will be very helpful for him.

A hint that is sometimes helpful.... when you make a decision, pray about it. If you dont feel comfortable afterwards, then its not the right decision... you will know when you have made the right decision.

Everything isnt always logical. There could be a reason why you shouldnt go based on information you dont have yet. Its always a good idea to trust your gut feelings, instincts, spirit, etc.

However I would question why your husband feels he cant leave his job for two weeks. two weeks is not very long. Are there control or codependent issues he needs to address?

Good luck with your decision.

Start as soon as possible, which others have already said. I'm getting married September 2009, and I've already tried on tons of dresses, if that gives you perspective.



Your first few visits will be trying to decide what style you want. Try on every style, even if you think you hate it. I tried on a few that I was dead against, but when they were on, they looked completely different, and I even liked a few of them!



After three stores or so, you can start to only try on styles you know you what. I'm now limiting myself to strapless gowns with dropped waists because I know that's what I look best in, and what style I want.

Order your dress at least 6 months in advance if possible. When you order a dress from the designer, they make it for you, so that's why it takes so long (it can take three to four months just to get it in). Sometimes, though, because of this, you can make special requests like, "remove the buttons" or "add a flower here." Emphasis on sometimes, not always. Depends on the store and the designer.

Fittings are included in the alterations price, not the dress price (two separate things - almost every dress has to be altered). Once your dress arrived, the store will call you and ask you to come in for your first fitting (you'll need your shoes and wedding day undergarments for that). They will tailor the dress specifically for you, add a bustle, and make any changes you want. Alterations are pricey. Some stores charge a flat fee, and others base in on what needs to be done. Usually, you can expect to pay anywhere between $200 to $500 for alterations.

You'll also have at least two fittings before it's perfect on your body.

Hope that helps! And really milk the experience for all it's worth. When I first started, I was totally intimidated by wedding dress shops and didn't want to do it. Now I love it and do it whenever I can :)

Good luck!

Start shopping as soon as possible. It may take many trips to find the dress of your dreams. Be careful on the ordering of the dress. That usually take 10-14 weeks to get the dress from the time that you order it. Some places a little longer. There could be a need for multiple fittings depending on the detail of the dress and how many alterations they have to make. I found my dress the first time out. My girlfriend took months. But we did one ot two shops a month so we did not get worn out.

I would for sure start pulling ideas of what you like and within the next month or two get into a bridal salon and start trying things on and give yourself plenty of time to shop around.  Different places require different amounts of time to get the dress in (mine took 4 months to come in after I ordered it) I would also then be sure to have your shoes picked out when you for fittings so you know how long it will have to be.

You could probably start looking now, it won't hurt.  Trust me I am getting married in 3 days and I started looking fairly early too.  It's a big decision and there are a ton of dresses to choose from.  I think I actually finally picked one out in around February/March.



Good luck!!!  Yes, the fittings are included in the price but not the actual alterations.  My alterations were about $200, I had to have it hemmed up and taked in a bit.  I think that is on the high end though.

If you have a really good clue as to what you want, right now, many of the bridal shops are clearancing (is that a word?) all the spring and summer dresses.  You can save a bundle on a designer dress if they have one in your size.  Otherwise, you can start shopping whenever you want, but at least 5 months prior if you want a custom dress.  Fittings are usually included in the price of a custom dress, but not necessarily for an off-the-rack one.

Start now!  I'm getting married that month too and found my dress in June.  Depending on what you find, I've been told anywhere from 5-9 months.. Sometimes more to get the dress IN.. which doesn't include alterations.. Don't want you to panic, just be aware!

I figured it was going to take me forever to find "The Right" Dress. The first one I tried on, I loved and bought it. This was over a year before my wedding. Any alterations that need to be made to the dress are ALWAYS an additional cost. My suggestion is to not get the alterations done at the place you purchase your dress, they are usually very, very high on their prices for alterations. Find someone who does this elsewhere, I suggest looking on Craigslist or in the newspaper for ads for people/shops that do this sort of this exclusively, that is going to be your best bet-they do a better job and it will cost much, much less! Good luck with your dress hunt!

My dress will be ready In Feb and I'm getting married in May so you should start soon. They usually tell you to buy about 7-8 months in advance. Most bridal stores charge the alterations and fittings together with the dress. At least mine did, but I guess you should just ask before you buy the dress so there won't be any surprises.

How long had you been with your partner before you got engaged???????????????????????…



How long do you think you should be together before you get married/engaged? I've been with my other half 4.5 years and although he says he wants us to be together forever he doesn't want to get engaged til he's older (he's28)!! But i feel that i shoudln't have to wait for him....??



</question>



<additional details>



Hmm, we've lived together for the last 2 and a half years and own our house together so we know eachother pretty well etc



Thanks for the replys! I think basically i am thinking right now that he is just using me - as in yes we live togehther etc already, and we've been together a long time and i find it a bit "disrepectful" in a way (not sure if thats the right word) Everytime i bring it up he says he's not ready, i say, well i'm not waiting for something that might not ever happen - he insist it will but it hasn't and we've been together so long, i dont want to waste my time on something thats not going to happen??



I REFUSE to do his washing and things as i am not his wife - why would i act like one?? I have been away lots lately on holiday and things and there have been loads of pressies for me etc when i get back as he's missed me so much etc... I will have to get that Book too!!!

I got engaged after 2 and a half years but have no plans to marry for a least 5 more years. Relationships fall apart because people don't really know each other, so take time (7-10 years) then get married, by then you should know everything about this person and should be pretty sure whether you want to spend the rest of your life with them!

I was with my guy for 5 years before he proposed.  Then we had a year long engagement.  We got married when I was 23 and he was 24. 
I say he's old enough to know what he wants and it seems that he doesn't want to get engaged or be married.  He's been with you for 4.5 years and he doesn't see it leading anywhere it seems he isn't ready to commit to the relationship.

3 years by the time we got engaged, but we knew we wanted to get married after one year.

I believe neither person in a relationship should be pushed into an engagement or a marriage. Both people have to be ready for the commitment and the (relative) permanence that comes along with that little slip of paper and the titles of husband and wife. If one person is unsure, the process will be unhappy and stressful.

Wait it out. If he still doesn't want to commit by the time he's 30, maybe you need to consider how well you think you know this guy and if being with him is what you want.

19 months.  The wedding was 17 months later.  We were both very young (20) but we just celebrated our 10th anniversary.

I feel like moving in together really hurts your chances of marriage - why should he buy the cow when he is already getting the milk for free?  (I'm not calling you a cow - I just can't think of anyother way to put it..sorry)  There is just no incentive for commitment from a guy if you already are living in the same house, sharing finances, chores and practically being married w/o the license.  No license means he (or she) is free to walk at anytime.

My FH and I were together for a year and a half before he popped the question. By the time we actually get married we'll have been together for about 3 and a half. We're getting married in June of 2010- I wanted at least a year to plan it, and at the time we set the date, I wasn't sure where my brother would be. He's in the National Guard, and at the time was thinking of going back into the Army. Wanted to give him enough time that he could request the time off, as he is one of 4 people who's schedules I will GLADLY plan my wedding around. (Others are my aunt, my mom, and my best friend, who's husband will be doing residency somewhere at that point.)

I wouldn't give him an ultimatum or anything...you never know, he may be planning to propose at christmas. I told my guy long before he proposed, back when the "if" we get married talks turned into "when" we get married talks, that I wasn't going to wait 10 years for it to happen. 5 or so would have been ok with me, but not 10. (Neither one of us want kids, so I don't have a biological clock ticking or anything.) I was honestly surprised he proposed so soon...lol. What guy would propose before 2 years if he knows he's got 3 more to go...?

Ok another example of why living together does not work, men are basically lazy and if they have a wife without the trappings and expensive of a wedding they are not likely to be in a hurry to get to church/registry office.
I am afraid you have made things easy for him but not so easy for yourself when you decided to move in together, why should he marry you when you are his "wife" now in everything but name ?
If you really want to get married then you should move out and wait until he cant find the remote control for the t.v, thats when he will realise he misses you and will be more likely to propose to get you to live back with him again - which if you have any sense you wont do until you are his wife legally.
Good luck.

When I finalIy got the proposal I had been waiting for this June, we had been together 9 years. I am 30 and he is 35. Believe me - it was worth the wait :)

We had been pressured by family from the time we had been together 2 years, but didn't officially even move in together until 18 months ago. I had wondered many times whether I was doing the right thing, waiting for him. I thought about giving him an ultimatum, but decided I didn't ever want to feel as thought I had forced him into anything, or threatened him into anything.

At the end of the day, you need to decide what you want, do you want to be married? Or do you want him? If he is the love of your life, then he is worth waiting for. If you just want to get married, then go find someone who will marry you.

Marriage doesn't prove commitment, only time proves it. A wedding ring won't stop him cheating, lying or leaving you. Only his commitment to you will.

Wait for him hun, it's all worth it... I promise!!

My fiance and I were together for 5 and a half years before he finally proposed.  We'd been living together for about 3 of those years.  We're getting married on the 7-year anniversary of the day we met.  He'll have just turned 28 and I'll be 29 and a half, very nearly 30.



I was really getting to the point where I thought he'd never ask, and he always said he wanted to marry me but wanted to wait until he was older and more financially stable (like your guy, he was already in his mid-twenties, which I thought was plenty old enough, but he apparently didn't think so.)  Anyway, it was hard to wait and we used to fight about it sometimes, but in the end I'm glad I didn't give him an ultimatum or anything.  I am so happy that he finally made up his own mind to ask me, and when he proposed, I knew in my heart that he really meant it, rather than just doing it to make me happy.  Sounds like he lavishes you with gifts and love and doesn't mind that you don't do any of his laundry or housework for him, so you have a pretty good thing going- why spoil it over a little proposal that will happen when he's ready?  Give him time.

We was together for almost 7 years. But We dating in high school to. We lived together for 2 years. I was ready before he was. I knew that He was all I wanted and that I would wait on him to get ready. Most people live together and never get married and have kids. So you need to do what ever is in your heart to do. I think since yall have lived together for that long than yes you need to wash his clothe and other things. When you live together you do things for each other. If you dont do none of that stuff why are you living together? You really need to think about what you are doing, sounds like yall need to really sit down and talk about things.

The bridesmaid...That is why you have to think long and hard about accepting the invitation to be in someone's wedding. Not only do you have to buy the dress, you have to get the shoes and undergarments, and you have to get your hair/nails done. All of these expenses add up....Unless it is a VERY close friend, I always decline and just attend the wedding. It is much easier and cheaper.

The bridesmaids usually, so please bear in mind the cost when selecting a dress for them. I have been a bridesmaid 7 times and only once did the bride's family pay for the dress (they were wealthy enough to do that).  Thankfully all the other brides took cost into consideration.

The bridesmaid.
That's why the dresses should be chosen with their economics in mind.
However, if the bride chooses a dress that is terribly expensive, she should help with the cost.
Or if the bride is made of money and can afford to make the dresses her gift to the bridesmaids.

In most cases, the bridesmaid is supposed to pay for her dress and shoes. I've been in a couple of weddings where the bride has paid for the dresses and shoes in place of giving a bridesmaid gift (which was much better!)



If you're asking as a bride, I would recommend paying in place of the bridesmaid gift - it makes it much easier on the bridesmaid. If you're asking as the bridesmaid, you should assume you're paying unless you're told otherwise. :)

I've been a bridesmaid about half a dozen times, and each time I bought my own dress.  The bride and the maid (or matron) of honor (and any other bridesmaids who live in town) typically pick out the dresses together and order them for all the bridesmaids.  For my wedding, my mom made the dresses and each bridesmaid just paid for the fabric, which was $30 a piece.  This was about 1/4 the price of the typical bridesmaid's dress at the time (10 years ago).

Personally, I think it's outrageous to ask someone to be part of your wedding and them ask them to pay for the dress that you want them to wear. Yes, they get to keep it afterwards but the fact is once someone has asked you to be their bridesmaid you can't say no. 
I paid for all my bridesmaids dresses and grooms mens suit hire, it's an expense but you just have to budget, just like everything else in your wedding.
My best friend was asked to be a bridesmaid in one of our friends wedding, she was so excited to be in the wedding of such a beloved friend but then horrified that she was asked to pay for the dress that the bride had picked, she almost considered not taking part, though found it too hard to mention any of this to our friend. In the end she paid for the dress and of course they are still good friends though almost two years on it's still somewhat of a sore point.

Ok for you people who are saying the Bride pays WRONG.  The Bridesmaid pays for her own dress. That is why you ASK if the person would be in your wedding.  If they can't afford it they have every right to say no.  all my bridesmaids know i couldn't afford to have them in my wedding if i were to buy all of them their dresses.  Besides, they know I'll be returning the favor when they all get married.

Sweet jesus. The bride wants these girls to ornament her occasion then she tells them how much it would cost.
Back when people spent what they could afford, the bride paid for the dresses. Today the bride expects the whole world to focus on providing a setting for bridezilla, including spending hundreds on a dress.
I told the last bride who asked me that I was flattered to be counted among her best friends, that I hope she'll have a happy marriage, but that I couldn't afford all the garb along with a plane ticket and wedding gift.
She bought some other friends, a dozen desperate gals with nothing better to do than spend $1000 to stand outside the center of attention.

I think their might be some regional variations.  Everyone I've ever known who has been a bridesmaid paid for her own dress.  Of course, my experience is before the whole idea that everyone needed to have their hair and nails and make-up professionally done.

In some areas, I think it is more common that the bride or her family pays for the bridesmaids' dresses.

When I got married, each paid for their own attire but we selected the dresses together and I really wanted to keep a like on the price.

The way I look at it is, you are asking them to be in your wedding. you should pay for it. No one likes to be forced to pay for a dress that they don't even get to pick out and may very well only wear one time. I'm paying for my bridesmaids dresses. It just doesn''t seem right to ask them to pay for the dress on top of asking them to be a bridesmaid.

I think that he still really loves you okay. Some people are really just afraid of commitment. He does want to spend his life with you, but he just doesn't want to be bound. He wants to be free if in life he ever wants to leave (which I assure you won't happen) just sit down and talk to him about never being afraid of commitment when it is a wonderful thing. Also tell him that you will always be good to him, so he never will have to leave. I hope this helps.

Just try to sit down an calmly talk to him let him know how your feeling this lets you  see where his head is about where ya'll relationship is going.

I'm getting married and we wanted to honor our grandfathers who have passed away..?



My Fiance and I are getting married and both of our grandfathers have passed away (mine earlier this year, and his a few years ago.. we were very close to them). We are going to leave an empty chair beside our grandmothers with a rose on the table where they would have sat. We wanted to do something else though, we were thinking about playing "A song for dad" by keith urban or another song like that while playing a short slide show. We didn't want to turn our wedding into something sad and depressing though. If we did we were going to put both of our pictures together and make it just one slide show. But once again I don't want to turn the reception into a memorial. Any other suggestions ideas? Thanks so much!

Its awesome that you want to honor your grandfathers. Instead of turning the reception into a memorial tribute, honor them by putting on the program, we dedicate our wedding to the memories of our grandfathers, (put their names), who are with us today in spirit.  We love you!

You can also burn a candle at the reception for them with pictures of them. Or just dance to the song and have the DJ say that this song is dedicated to our grandfathers.  This is a celebration, not a wake.



Have a happy wedding, you both sound like such caring people!

Yes, it does sound more like a memorial than a wedding.  What about lighting a candle in memory of all those whom you love who couldn't be there.  You can donate an alter candle in their memory then light it while up on the alter.  Then that's it. No videos, no songs and truthfully I wouldn't even leave the empty chair.  This is going to be hard on your grandmothers.  Just do the candle.  Good Luck!

How creepy.  Leave a chair empty and put a picture of them in it.  This is about you and your man making a life, not about memorializing your dead grandfathers.  Put this back into perspective.  A small gesture is better.  Celebrate your marriage and play songs about that.

First of, sorry for your loss. I think the rose idea is too sad, but if you do the slide show thing that would be too depressing. I'm sure both grandfathers knew that they were loved dearly as well as everyone else in the family knew you loved them. Your wedding is supposed to be a happy, fun time. If you feel you need something more besides the roses then how about getting a picture of each grandfather and blowing it up and displaying them at the entrance with their names and something saying we miss you. Don't know if you're spiritual at all, but I think that they will be there with you in spirit that day and I think they would prefer the focus be of your wedding celebration rather than a memorial.

I went to a wedding last year where the grooms father had passed on and the brides uncle ( whom she was very close to) as well as a couple grandparents, so they wanted to honor their memory, since they couldn't be there, so they purchased a baby tree, and had it at the ceremony(it was outdoors, but indoors would be fine too), and on the back of the wedding program they put a message about the ones they loved who couldn't be there because they had passed and it briefly explained that the tree was in their honor and would planted at the bride and grooms new home together in the memory of those they loved. I thought it was a really cool idea, and wished I had thought of something like that for my own wedding as my husbands father passed before we were married. I think its nice that you are thinking of them.

Instead of the slideshow, which I think would bring up some saddness, I like the small table idea set-up with a candle burning. If you dont want to do pictures here is another idea. Did your grandfathers have a certain thing they were known for? We set up a "memorial table" and did the following
For my husband's grandfather we set up a pint of Guiness and a cigar
For my grandmother we attached her angel pin that she always wore to a piece of card stock and propped it up on the table and so on with others we had lost. We lit a single taper and got one of those "In loving memory" vases and put a pretty arrangement in it and had the table sitting off to the side. It was quiet, but we made simple gestures for each person without showing their faces. People who knew them knew what the items meant, but it didnt put a damper on anything.

Those things sound really sad and depressing. Remember that as hard as it is on you, it's even harder for your parents and grandmothers. A small gesture is better than something really obvious. No empty chairs next to your grandmothers, which emphasizes their loss rather than comforting them - surround them with friends and family. No slide show to a sad song - put a still photograph of each grandfather on a small table with a rose and perhaps a framed poem or remembrance. Have their names and "In loving memory" printed in the program.



I think your wish to honor their memory is wonderful, but make it low key, for the sake of all of your family members.

You're right; don't turn it into a memorial. I think you're doing too much already. I realize you miss them and they were important in your lives, and you should honor them in some way, but you are making your wedding more like a double funeral for your grandfathers. 
What I did was get poinsettas (I got married close to Christmas) and placed them in front of the stage. In the programs, I wrote in there that the poinsettas are in memory of our grandparents who have passed away who are especially missed at this important time in our lives. (We had 6 poinsettas I believe, thru hubby's step-grandparents and all!). Nothing was ever said, nothing else was done, and we sent a poinsetta home with the spouse of the deceased grandparent, if one was still alive. 
My grandmother loved it and kept the poinsetta alive for at least a year after the wedding because it meant so much to her!!! lol I don't know what time of year you are getting married, but don't make the wedding so depressing everyone! Keep it simple!

You can't get married there if you are not a member.  There are always exceptions, but it would probably cost a lot of money to get them to make an exception.

You cant, they dont conduct weddings unless you are a member of their parish for at least 1 year. Sorry. You will run into this with most of the historic churches in the city.

If you can change the settings on the song (itunes maybe?) you can just make it so the bass is set for different things. There may be vocal minimizer, but I'm not sure. Just fool around changing different bass settings and I'm sure you'll find something to make you hardly be able to hear it at all!

How important is a wedding really?



I love weddings, and I love reading and responding to the questions in this section, but I've noticed that some people place a lot of importance on one day in their entire life.

I'm looking forward to my wedding (8/28/09) and it will be great, but I'm not turning it into a spectacle at all. I'm thinking of it as an opportunity to profess my love and faith in our relationship to the one I'm going to spend the rest of my life with in front of our family and friends. Then afterwards is the celebration with good food and drinks. I'll wear my grandma's dress which means more to me than anything, maybe my grandpa will play some good jazz on the piano for us, but no real bells and whistles.



I hear of couples having their bridal party take dance classes for choreographed dances, brides being pulled up to the church, paying $2,000 on a dress but only having a cocktail reception.

What causes women (not to be sexist, but it seems men don't do this as much) to focus so much on one day out of thousands of days and out of hundreds of important events that will happen to them throughout their life?? What do they feel entitles them to be catered to???



</question>



<additional details>



Great answers so far!!!



Fizzystuff... I was just really asking for the reasoning behind a bride putting on such a big production, thank you for giving some pretty realistic answers

Oh, and just to clarify, I'm not saying that weddings aren't meant to be beautiful gorgeous affairs someone will remember for the rest of their life, but I'm just saying that I feel some people forget the real reason why it's so beautiful (hint: it's not flowers).



Blunt... wow, I never said that I was judging anyone or that my way was the only right way. I love big, lavish weddings. I only wanted people who felt differently, like you,  to explain the logic behind a way of thinking that's different than my own. If someone wants to spend half a mil on their wedding, it's their half a mil to spend but I'm just trying to figure out why they wouldn't want to buy a nice house instead.

A lot of the wedding hubbub is commercial. Americans (mostly) put a lot of stock in weddings as a "status" symbol (Think "Platinum Weddings"!). Some people are born inot cultures where big events and formal parties are common and they don't see anything odd about investing so much money in one day. As for those who have a big lavish wedding and don't focus on their guests' enjoyment, I couldn't tell you. A sense of entitlement, I'd assume, but where that stems from, I am at a loss. I suppose the theory that "it's YOUR day" has a lot to do with it, and I assume that comes from society's view of weddings. I feel that the wedding is about the committment and the covenant you're making with your new husband and God. It's not entirely about you. It's about the 175 people who came from all over the place to see you make that covenant - so why not show them your thanks for coming and sharing the blessing? Sadly not everyone has a down-to-earth view on their reception or wedding - they want a glam, lavish, out-of-this-world party no matter what the cost or consequences.

More of the reception is based on what people can afford - and what they can't. No one wants to NOT be able to afford something (again, status quo, "keeping up with the Joneses") so they often go overboard on what people SEE (the reception) and then suffer the consequences of what people DON'T see (the credit card bills and debt). That's human nature, to present a face of "power" (often associated with money in the modern world) despite internal turmoil or fear. "Put on a brave face," they say in war, "and your enemy will be afraid".



My thoughts on the reception are "spoil the guests!". My guests come before anything in my thoughts and I want to surround them with a luxurious, pampering atmosphere. Budgetwise, we are lucky enough to be able to afford a luxurious wedding without breaking the bank, going into debt or taking money from other ventures. With our budget we are easily able to spoil our guests with extra servers, a 5-course sit-down meal, free transportation, open bar, tons of food choices, a great DJ, an awesome venue, extravagant favors and an atmosphere of elegance. I am always thinking of other things to do for them to make them feel pampered. I want my guests to leave feeling like it was THEIR day, that THEY were being honored by my husband and I and thanked for attending our ceremony. Had we not had the budget to ensure our guests are treated well, we would have ghad to find a way to ensure they were. If money were an issue, we would have a church wedding with a cake and punch reception in the fellowship hall. As long as my guests are able to witness and share the covenant, the reception is not an issue, it's simply a "thank you for sharing the moment". It can be as grand or simple as you want and can afford so long as the focus is on the covenant and the fact that your guests came to witness because they love you.

It's a symbol really but some women start thinking about it when they're young and planning.  Crazy!  As most men just want to know the time and place, it does become the bride's day.  All eyes on her.  And of course if you look back in history you can see why.



But these shows like Bridezilla where women make azzes of themselves, that's just ridiculous.  I've been to very simple weddings but the love of the two people just kind of glowed.  And they have been very happy.  Then I've been to some really expensive and elaborate ones where it seems like the bride forgot she would be married afterwards.  And they ended in divorce.



I'm not saying either type of wedding predicts the future of the marriage but just that some people lose the focus, the reason for the wedding.  I think you put it in very good words.

Im not sure exactly what your question is getting at. But placing a high importance on marriage is not a new concept. Its been around since... well a long time. Its one of the moments in life where things are transformed for you, its a big deal. The trimmings and trappings are just our culture's way of showing it. We are a materialistic culture, so this is the manifestation. That does not mean its a bad thing, or that people dont understand the gravity of what a marriage is vs. what a wedding is.

It's all relative.

When you don't have anything else going on in your life, then whatever is going on is important.  In traditional cases, a bride is marrying someone and leaving her home to live with him.  That's a huge event and they won't realize that there are other more important events (such as having a child) that come later on because it isn't relevant at the time.

With so much violence and negativity in the world, if you can spend one day feeling loved and happy then why not celebrate it the way you want to? I'm having something small because that's my idea of a special day but I wouldn't knock someone who decided to go all out.  That's how they see their day and that's a-ok with me.

Well goody for you.  You sound more like you are trying to lecture others than asking a question really.

A wedding IS important.  They type, style, etc varies for everyone.  We all want it to be "just right" because there are really no do-overs.

And all the while, you have to consider everyone who is involved as well as yourself...

It's all a VERY big deal.

But it doesn't entitle a bride to turn into a monster either.

The wedding industry has become one of the most profitable industries in our nation and it seems every couple has the urge to out-do the next. Its become way over the top.

I'm 35, and know 3 couples that threw $150,000.+ weddings and were divorced in 3-4 years.

I think keeping it simple and being able to invest in your future (a house, savings, etc.) is so much more important.

I've been to informal pinics, potlucks, and beach parties that were so much more memorable weddings than the generic huge catering hall.

Do what you want and feel comfortable doing. Its ultimately your day, and make it as big or small as you want.

I think it's just because it's a day you plan for so long you want it all to work out just right.  I do agree though too many people are forgetting the whole point of the wedding, the marriage.  That's what is important because 10 years down the road if you're in a wonderful marriage and had an ok wedding it wont matter...  If you had a lavish wedding and your marriage is terrible you wont look back and say oh well at least the wedding was good.

Simple answer, I think those women have unreasonable expectations about their weddings and are more interested in keeping up with the Joneses than reflecting on the meaning of their vows. We live in a culture that celebrates excess and urges consumption, and these elaborate expensive weddings are one of the best examples of that

The day does really matter to some women, not as much to others. I don't think there's really ever anything wrong with special moments being made a big deal of--to me, a wedding is one of the most significant moments in an adult's life, and I see nothing wrong with celebrating that event in a way that makes sense to the couple or their families.



Remember, what seems extravagant to you might be pocket change to someone else.

It's their wedding and they can do as they please. Who are you to judge other people's weddings or to proclame what's right or wrong?

If you want a simple ceremony with no dances, good for you! but that doesn't mean that if someone else has a dance on their wedding is less meaningful than yours.

Hi.  To answer your question, a wedding is important in order to be married!  lol

Now, for the point you make:  "Why do brides feel that they need to be catered to?"  It's our society.  With the influx of magazines, websites such as theknot.com and shows like "Bridezilla"; "Who's Wedding is it Anyway"; "Platinum Weddings" and others, its no wonder.

It's the billion dollar/year wedding industry that has pushed wedding celebrations over the top.



There are, however, many of this forum who are seeing past all of that and, for personal reasons and/or budget reasons, they are not going overboard....such as yourself.

Your wedding sounds like a blast to me!  I think every bride needs to decide for herself what constitutes a meaningful wedding for her and her fiance.  Some brides have been dreaming of their wedding day since they were little girls and will be disappointed without all the traditional wedding fanfare.  Other brides (like you and me!) want just a casual, low-key, laid-back day that is meaningful without being over-the-top or impractical in any way.  It's all about the bride's personality, I guess.  It's not wrong to want a big wedding, and it's not wrong to want a small wedding, or even no wedding at all and just a courthouse deal.  As long as you're getting what you really want, anything goes.

It's really only as important as the person makes it out to be. To me, it was important to "be married", not to "have a wedding". Our wedding was completely informal, more like a party for friends/family.

A pretty christmas ball would be sweet :)
you can buy this see-thru kind and you just take the top off of them and put whatever you want inside them!
They're cheap too, probably like $5 for a box of at least 12 max!
You could put in a little slip of paper saying your guys wedding, or just a little bit of tinsil (sp?)

I think i'd be cute and cheap.
It may be predictable though.

How about like, cinnimon candles or something to do with candy canes or mini stockings?

Sounds fun =)

I would use christmas ball things to hand on the tree. They come in so many colours and styles. You could make the colours match your wedding theme and of course still attach a tag saying thank you for celebrating our wedding day with your names and the date. You could also opt for something like mini christmas puddings which would be cute. Or an organza bag with a few little shortbread biscuits. Or if you like those christmas mince pie things, that might work also.
Hope I helped

i would go with something like either a tree decoration like a bauble and get some like glitter glue and write on each one a message to each person.. you could also give candy canes to kids that are attending. or you could make christmas cookies and wrap up a few in a christmassy wrapping and give them a lucky dip kinda choice its nice tasty and best of all cheap to do. you could even mix various items in and leave the box or whatever by the door and ask them to take them on the way out.

You could go for something traditional with sugar almonds in a white box with maybe silver star ribbon for the christmas feel. Maybe little wedding cake candles for everyone with little snowflake design. What about mints in a christmas tin. you could have mini edible 3 tier cakes maybe about 2 inch high.

If you go with ornaments, which is a good idea, don't do personalized ones. Stick with a beautiful large snowflake, or an angel.

Just decline. It's not very nice that they didn't invite your partner... but just keep it simple and say that you're sorry but you cannot attend due to previous commitments.

Just say that your not happy to go alone, maybe say your a bit shy.  If they want you there then they may invite your partner, if not then at least you haven't lied.  I dont know if there is a reason your partner hasn't been invited, you dont say in your post.

When my brother in law got married I wasn't invited but my hubby and our daughter were.  I was mortified, but I persuaded my hubby to go on his own as it was his brother getting wed, although I didn't send our daughter, who was one at the time.

I have had to ditch a friend's wedding due to me being out of town because of work.  Of course that did conveniently come up and the last minute and I had an out.



My story was that I didn't want to go as I was single at the time and knew I would be surrounded by other couples at this wedding and on top of it I would have known maybe 2-3 people there.



You may have to resort to coming up with a lie to get out of going -- work or family emergency are the two big ones.

If it's a friend you're close enough to that you would actually want to go, then either respond with "2" as # of guests on the RSVP, or simply decline.  If you aren't married to your partner, they probably expect that you might bring them along and it's fine they didn't officially invite your partner, but if you are married then it was rude of them not to address the invitation to both of you.

If it's a friend that you're not even close enough to want to go, then you shouldn't care about simply declining.

If you don't want to go, just mark on the reply card that you will not be attending, and leave it at that. No one will be asking you why you didn't attend so there is no need to make a bigger deal out of it than necessary.

honesty option! 'Sorry guys, I couldnt care less for a free meal and giving you a bale of towels is so boring...and seeing as you didnt invite my partner so you can eff off, coz that is like just the GROOM showing up, as you see, you cannot 'marry' without YOUR partner in attendance, so me and MY partner cannot attend.

I'd maybe say that you wouldn't feel comfortable attending alone without your partner and just be honest.  It's a shame to have to make up an excuse or fake an illness nearer the time, especially with Wedding costs to the couple etc.



You could maybe add that you'll both go to the church ( if it's a church wedding obviously ) and congratulate them etc after the ceremony if they would still like to see you on the day, I think anyone can do that invited or not.  Good Luck

Tell them the truth, ask them why they haven't invited your partner to this wedding.
If you don't go to this wedding asking this question, at least they will know the reason for your absent.
